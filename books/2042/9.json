To most human eyes, those features stood out but weren\u0027t a vampire tip-off. Humans just noted the features as striking and unusual, much as Lia regarded Jill as the perfect ethereal runway form. I didn\u0027t want to play upon stereotypes, but after a quick assessment of Mr. Ivashkov\u0027s Moroi-paleness, long face, dour look, and silver hair, I kind of wondered that he didn\u0027t get mistaken for a vampire more often. No, vampire wasn\u0027t really the correct term, I decided. More like undertaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" said Adrian stiffly. \"Always a pleasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For some of us.\" His father studied me, and I saw his eyes fall on my cheek. He extended a hand. I took it, proud that shaking hands with Moroi was a non-event for me now. \"Nathan Ivashkov.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sydney Sage,\" I replied. \"It\u0027s very nice to meet you, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met Sage while I was bumming around out here,\" explained Adrian. \"She was nice enough to give me a ride from ll.A. today since I don\u0027t have a car.\" Nathan looked at me in astonishment. \"That\u0027s a long drive.\" Not nearly as long as the drive from Palm Springs, but we\u0027d figured it would be safest - and more believable - to let him think Adrian was in Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind, sir,\" I said. I glanced over at Adrian. \"I\u0027ll go get some work done. You want to text me when you\u0027re ready to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Work?\" he asked in disgust. \"Come on, Sage. Go buy a bikini and enjoy the pool while you\u0027re hanging around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan looked between us incredulously. \"You made her drive you out here, and now you\u0027re just going to make her wait around for your convenience?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s an Alchemist,\" continued Nathan. \"Not a chauffeur. There\u0027s a big difference.\" Actually, there were days at Amberwood I doubted that. \"Come, Miss Sage. If you\u0027ve wasted your day driving my son here, the least I can do is buy you lunch.\" I shot a panicked look at Adrian. It wasn\u0027t panicked because I was afraid of being with Moroi. I\u0027d long since gotten used to these sorts of situations. What I was unsure of was if Adrian really wanted me around for his family reunion. That hadn\u0027t been part of the plan. Also, I wasn\u0027t sure that I really wanted to be around for said reunion either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad - \" Adrian attempted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I insist,\" said Nathan crisply. \"Pay attention and learn common courtesy.\" He turned and began walking away, assuming we\u0027d follow. We did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I find a reason to leave?\" I whispered to Adrian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not when he uses his \u0027I insist\u0027 voice,\" came the muttered response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, catching sight of the gorgeous terrace restaurant and its sunny ocean view, I thought I could handle the Ivashkovs. Sitting out there in that warmth and beauty would be well worth the drama. Then, Nathan walked right past the balcony doors and led us to the elevator. We followed obediently. He took us down to the hotel\u0027s ground floor, to a pub called The Corkscrew. The place was dim and windowless, with low-hanging wood beams and black leather booths. Oak barrels lined the walls, and what light there was came filtered through red glass lamps. Aside from a lone bartender, the pub was empty, which didn\u0027t entirely surprise me this time of day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did surprise me was that Nathan had taken us here instead of the ritzy outdoor restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy was dressed in an expensive suit that looked like it had come straight from a Manhattan boardroom. Why he\u0027d ignore a trendy, elite restaurant for lunch and instead choose a stuffy, dark - Dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly groaned. Of course the terrace wasn\u0027t an option, not with Moroi. The sunny afternoon that made such enchanting conditions for me would have resulted in a pretty miserable lunch for the Ivashkovs - not that either of them looked like they planned on enjoying this one anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ivashkov,\" said the bartender. \"Nice to see you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get food delivered down here again?\" asked Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain. This subterranean lair had probably been Nathan\u0027s mainstay for all meals since arriving in San Diego. I allowed the terrace one last, wistful thought and then followed Nathan and Adrian inside. Nathan selected a corner table intended for eight people. Maybe he liked his space. Or maybe he liked pretending he was presiding over a corporate meeting. The bartender gave us menus and took drink orders. I got coffee. Adrian ordered a martini, earning disapproving looks from his father and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s barely noon,\" said Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" said Adrian. \"I\u0027m surprised I held out that long too.\" Nathan ignored the comment and turned to me. \"You\u0027re very young. You must have just started with the Alchemists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They start us all young,\" I agreed. \"I\u0027ve been working on my own for a little over a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I admire that. Shows a great deal of responsibility and initiative.\" He nodded thanks as the bartender set down a bottle of sparkling water. \"It\u0027s no secret how the Alchemists feel about us, but at the same time, your group does a lot of good for us. Your efficiency is particularly remarkable. Too bad my own people don\u0027t pay more attention to that example.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are things with the Moroi?\" I asked. \"With the queen?\" Nathan almost smiled. \"Are you saying you don\u0027t know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did - at least, I knew what the Alchemists knew. \"It\u0027s always different hearing an insider\u0027s perspective, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. It was a harsh sound, like laughing wasn\u0027t something Nathan Ivashkov had much practice with. \"The situation\u0027s better than it was. Not great, though. That girl\u0027s smart, I\u0027ll give her that.\" I assumed \"that girl\" was Vasilisa Dragomir, teenage queen of the Moroi and Rose\u0027s best friend. \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027d rather be passing dhampir laws and hereditary laws - but she knows those are only going to anger her opponents. So, she\u0027s finding ways to compromise on other issues and has won a few of her enemies over to her already.\" The hereditary laws. Those were of interest to me. There were twelve royal lines among the Moroi, and Vasilisa and Jill were the only two left in theirs. Current Moroi law said a monarch had to have at least one other family member, which was how Jill had become such a political game piece. Even hardcore assassins would have a difficult time taking out a wellguarded queen. Removing her half sister would provide the same results, however, and invalidate Vasilisa\u0027s rule. That was why Jill had ended up in hiding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan\u0027s thoughts followed the same lines. \"She\u0027s also smart to hide that bastard sister of hers.\" I knew he meant \"bastard\" in the sense of an illegitimate child, not an insult, but I still winced. \"Rumor has it your people know something about that. Don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d give me an insider\u0027s perspective on it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and tried to keep my tone friendly. \"Sorry, sir. Insight only goes so far.\" After a few moments of silence, Nathan cleared his throat. \"Well, Adrian. What is it you wanted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian took a sip of his martini. \"Oh, did you just notice I was here? I thought you\u0027d come to see Sydney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank into my chair a little. This was exactly the kind of situation I\u0027d wanted to avoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why must every question yield some difficult answer with you?\" asked Nathan wearily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s the kinds of questions you ask, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis pub wasn\u0027t going to be big enough to hold the rapidly increasing tension. Every instinct told me to become invisible, but I found myself speaking anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrian\u0027s in college,\" I said. \"Taking art classes. He\u0027s very talented.\" Adrian shot me a questioning - but amused - look at that. Some of his pieces were quite good. Others -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eespecially when he\u0027d been drinking - looked like he\u0027d accidentally spilled paint on canvas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d helpfully told him so on a number of occasions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan looked unimpressed. \"Yes. He\u0027s done that before. It didn\u0027t last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different time, different place,\" I said. \"Things can change. People can change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But often, they don\u0027t,\" declared Nathan. The bartender returned to take our lunch orders, though none of us had even looked at the menus yet. \"I\u0027ll just order for us all, shall I?\" Nathan opened the menu and scanned it quickly. \"Bring us a platter of the garlic butter mushrooms, the goat cheese fondue, the bacon-wrapped scallops, and the fried oyster Caesar salad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough for three on the salad, obviously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender made a couple of quick notes and was gone before I could even say a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heavy-handed much, Dad?\" asked Adrian. \"You didn\u0027t even ask if we minded you ordering.\" Nathan looked unconcerned. \"I\u0027ve eaten here before. I know what\u0027s good. Trust me, you\u0027ll like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sage won\u0027t eat any of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis really would be easier, I decided, if they\u0027d both just pretend I didn\u0027t exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why ever not?\" asked Nathan, looking at me curiously. \"Are you allergic to seafood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She only eats healthy stuff,\" said Adrian. \"Everything you just got is dripping in fat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little butter won\u0027t hurt her. You\u0027ll both see that I\u0027m right. It\u0027s all good. Besides,\" Nathan added, pausing to sip at his water. \"I did order a salad for the table. Lettuce is healthy.\" I didn\u0027t even attempt to point out that no amount of Romaine was going to make up for fried oysters or Caesar dressing. I wouldn\u0027t have had a chance to speak up anyway because Adrian was on a roll and - I noticed with some surprise - halfway through his martini.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see?\" he said in disgust. \"That\u0027s exactly how you operate. You assume you know best for everyone. You just go ahead and make these decisions, not bothering to consult with anyone, because you\u0027re so certain you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my vast experience,\" said Nathan coldly, \"I am usually right. When you too possess that kind of experience - when you can actually claim to be an authority on, well, anything -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen you can also be trusted with important decisions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is lunch,\" Adrian argued back. \"Not a life or death decision. All I\u0027m saying is that you could have at least made some effort to include others. Obviously, your \u0027vast experience\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoesn\u0027t apply to normal courtesies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan glanced over at me. \"Have I been anything but courteous to you, Miss Sage?\" My chair, much to my dismay, didn\u0027t swallow me up or offer to hide me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian finished his martini in a gulp and held up the glass to catch the bartender\u0027s eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave her out of it,\" Adrian told his father. \"Don\u0027t try to manipulate her into proving your point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hardly need to manipulate anyone into proving my point,\" said Nathan. \"I think it\u0027s made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lunch will be fine,\" I blurted out, fully aware that this altercation between father and son really had nothing to do with my eating habits. \"I need to try more things anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t give in to him, Sydney,\" warned Adrian. \"That\u0027s how he gets away with walking all over people - especially women. He\u0027s done it to my mom for years.\" The bartender silently appeared and replaced the empty martini glass with a full one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" said Nathan, with a heavy sigh. \"Let\u0027s leave your mother out of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should be easy enough,\" said Adrian. I could see lines of tension in his face. His mother was a sensitive topic. \"Seeing as you always do. I\u0027ve been trying to get an answer out of you for weeks on how she\u0027s doing! Hell, I\u0027ve just been trying to figure out where she\u0027s even at. Is that so hard for you to give up? She can\u0027t be in maximum security. They must let her get letters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s better that you don\u0027t have contact with her while she\u0027s incarcerated,\" said Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven I was amazed at how coldly he spoke about his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian sneered and took a sip of his new martini. \"There we are again: you knowing what\u0027s best for everyone. You know, I\u0027d really, really like to think you\u0027re keeping this avoidance attitude with her because it hurts too much. I know that if the woman I loved was locked away, I\u0027d be doing everything in my power to reach her. For you? Maybe it\u0027s too hard. Maybe the only way you can cope without her is to block her out - and by keeping me away too. I could almost understand that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrian - \" began Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s not it, is it? You don\u0027t want me to have contact - and you probably aren\u0027t having contact - because you\u0027re embarrassed.\" Adrian was really getting worked up now. \"You want to distance us and pretend what she did doesn\u0027t exist. You want to pretend that she doesn\u0027t exist. She\u0027s ruined the family reputation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan fixed his son with a steely look. \"Considering your own reputation, I\u0027d think you would see the wisdom in not associating with someone who has done what she\u0027s done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, screw up?\" Adrian demanded. \"We all screw up. Everyone makes mistakes. That\u0027s what she did. It was bad judgment, that\u0027s all. You don\u0027t cut off the people you love for mistakes like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She did it because of you,\" said Nathan. His tone left no question about what he thought of that decision. \"Because you couldn\u0027t leave well enough alone with that dhampir girl. You had to flaunt your relationship with her, nearly getting yourself in as much trouble as her in your aunt\u0027s murder. That\u0027s why your mother did what she did - to protect you. Because of your irresponsibility, she\u0027s in prison now. All of this is your fault.\" Adrian went pale - more so than usual - and looked too shocked to even attempt any response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up his martini again, and I was almost certain I could see his hands shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was right around then that two waiters from the upstairs restaurant showed up with our food. We stared in silence as they arranged our place settings and artfully laid out the platters of food. Looking at all that food made me nauseous, and it had nothing to do with the oill or salt content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ivashkov,\" I began, despite every reasonable voice in my head screaming at me to shut up. \"It\u0027s unfair to blame Adrian for her choices, especially when he didn\u0027t even realize what she was doing. I know he would do anything for her. If he\u0027d been able to stop this - or take her place - he would have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure of that, huh?\" Nathan was piling his plate with food and seemed quite excited about it. Neither Adrian nor I had an appetite. \"Well, Miss Sage, I\u0027m sorry to shatter your illusions, but it seems you - like so many other young women - have been fooled by my son\u0027s fast-talking ways. I can assure you, he has never done anything that didn\u0027t serve his own interests first. He has no initiative, no ambition, no follow-through. From a very early age, he was constantly breaking rules, never listening to what others had to say if it didn\u0027t suit what he wanted. I\u0027m not really surprised his college attempts have failed - and I assure you, this one will too - because he barely made it out of high school. It wasn\u0027t even about the drinking, the girls, and the stunts he pulled... he just didn\u0027t care. He ignored his work. It was only through our influence and checkbook that he managed to graduate. Since then, it\u0027s been a constant downward spiral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian looked like he\u0027d been slapped. I wanted to reach out and comfort him, but even I was still in shock from Nathan\u0027s words. Adrian clearly was too. It was one thing to go on and on about how you thought your father was disappointed in you. It was an entirely different thing to hear your father explain it in excruciating detail. I knew because I had been in both situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly, I don\u0027t even mind the drinking so much, so long as it knocks him out and keeps him quiet,\" continued Nathan, through a mouth full of goat cheese. \"You think his mother suffers now? I assure you, she\u0027s far better off. She was up countless nights, crying over whatever trouble he\u0027d gotten himself into. Keeping him away from her now isn\u0027t about me or him. It\u0027s for her. At least now, she doesn\u0027t have to hear about his latest antics or worry about him. Ignorance is bliss. She\u0027s in a better place not having contact with him, and I intend to keep it that way.\" He offered the scallops to me, as though he hadn\u0027t just delivered a huge chastisement without taking a breath. \"You really should try this. Protein\u0027s good for you, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, unable to find words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian took a deep breath. \"Really, Dad? I come all the way here to see you, to ask you to give me some way to contact her... and this is all I get? That she\u0027s better off not talking to me?\" Looking at him, I had a feeling he was working very hard to stay calm and reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreaking into snarky Adrian retorts wouldn\u0027t win him any ground, and he knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan looked startled. \"Is that the only reason you came here?\" It was clear from his tone that he thought it was a foolish reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian bit his lip, probably again to hold back his true feelings. I was impressed at his control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also thought... well, that maybe you\u0027d want to hear how I was doing. I thought you might be glad to know I was doing something useful.\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, his father simply stared. Then, his confusion melted into one of those awkward laughs. \"Ah. You\u0027re joking. I was puzzled for a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m done with this,\" said Adrian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flash, he downed his martini and was out of his seat, heading toward the door. Nathan continued eating undisturbed, but I was on my feet as well. It was only when I was halfway across the pub, trying to catch up with Adrian, that Nathan bothered to say anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Sage?\" Every part of me wanted to run after Adrian, but I paused to glance back at his father. Nathan had taken out his wallet and was flipping through a stack of bills. \"Here. Allow me to pay you for your gas and your time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the cash out, and I almost laughed. Adrian had forced himself to come here for all sorts of reasons, money being one of them. He\u0027d never gotten a chance to ask for it, yet here his father was, offering it up. I didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want anything from you,\" I said. \"Unless it\u0027s an apology to Adrian.\" Nathan gave me another blank look. He seemed sincerely confused. \"What do I have to apologize for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian had either taken the stairs or immediately caught an elevator because there was no sign of him outside the pub. I went back up to the lobby and peered around anxiously. A bellman passed by, and I flagged him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me. Where\u0027s the nearest place you can smoke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded back toward the front door. \"Far side of the circle drive.\" I thanked him and practically ran outside. Sure enough, over in the designated smoking area, Adrian was leaning against an ornate fence in the shade of an orange tree, lighting up. I hurried over to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrian,\" I exclaimed. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a long drag on his cigarette. \"Is that really a question you want to ask, Sage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was out of line,\" I said adamantly. \"He had no business saying any of that about you.\" Adrian inhaled on the cigarette again and then dropped it to the sidewalk. He stamped the cigarette out with the toe of his shoe. \"Let\u0027s just go back to Palm Springs.\" I glanced back at the hotel. \"We should get you some water or something. You took down that vodka pretty fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nearly smiled. Nearly. \"Takes a lot more than that to make me sick. I won\u0027t throw up in your car. I promise. I just don\u0027t want to stick around and risk seeing him again.\" I complied, and before long, we were back on the road again. We\u0027d spent less time in San Diego than it had taken to drive there. Adrian stayed silent, and this time, I didn\u0027t try to coax him out or distract him with meaningless conversation. No words of mine would help. I doubted anyone\u0027s words would help. I didn\u0027t blame Adrian for his mood. I\u0027d feel the same way if my father had laid into me like that in public. Still, I wished there was something I could do to ease Adrian\u0027s pain. Some small comfort to give him a moment of peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chance came when I saw a small gas station outside of Escondido with a sign reading BEST SLUSHES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HERE AT JUMBO JIM\u0027S! I remembered his joke about switching to a slush-based diet. I turned my car off the highway, even though I knew it was silly. What was a slush compared to the disaster we\u0027d just left behind? Still, I had to do something - anything - to make Adrian feel better. He didn\u0027t even seem to notice we\u0027d stopped there until I was getting out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" he asked, managing to drag himself out of his dark thoughts. The look on his face tore me apart. \"You\u0027ve got half a tank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be right back,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned five minutes later, a cup in each hand, and managed to knock on his window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got out of the car, truly puzzled now. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slushes,\" I said. \"Cherry for you. You have to drink it out here, though. I\u0027m not risking the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian blinked a couple of times, as though maybe I was a mirage brought on by too much sunlight. \"What is this? A pity party for me? Because I\u0027m so pathetic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not always about you,\" I scolded. \"I saw the sign and wanted a slush. Figured you\u0027d want one too. If you don\u0027t, I\u0027ll throw it away and just drink mine.\" I only got one step away before he stopped me and took the bright red slush. We leaned against the car together and drank without talking for a while. \"Man,\" he finally said, when we were about halfway through. There was a look of wonder in his eyes. \"I\u0027d forgotten how good these are. What kind did you get?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blue raspberry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and slurped loudly on his. That dark mood still hung around him, and I knew a childhood beverage wasn\u0027t going to undo what his father had done anytime soon. The best I could hope for was a few moments of peace for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finished shortly thereafter and tossed the cups in the trash. When we got back in Latte, Adrian sighed wearily and rubbed his eyes. \"God, those are awesome. I think I needed that. The vodka may have hit me harder than I thought. Glad you decided to branch out into something that isn\u0027t coffee for a change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, if they\u0027d had coffee flavor, you know I would\u0027ve gotten it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s disgusting,\" he said. \"There isn\u0027t enough sugar in the world to make that even remotely - \" He stopped and gave me a startled look. In fact, he looked so shocked that I stopped backing up and kicked the car back into park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The slush. That thing\u0027s like 99 percent sugar. You just drank one, Sage.\" He seemed to interpret my silence as though perhaps I hadn\u0027t understood. \"You just drank liquid sugar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you drank liquid sugar,\" I said. \"Mine was sugar free.\" I hoped I sounded convincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I couldn\u0027t tell if he was relieved or disappointed. \"You freaked me out there for a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should\u0027ve known better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I suppose so.\" He fell back into his blue mood, the slushes only a temporary distraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what the worst part of all that was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew we were back to his father, not slushes. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d think it\u0027d be that I didn\u0027t get the money or that he just ripped my life apart or that he has no faith in me sticking to college. But that\u0027s okay. I\u0027m used to that from him. What really bothers me is that I really did ruin my mom\u0027s life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t imagine you did,\" I said, shocked at his words. \"Like you pointed out, we still love people who make mistakes. I\u0027m sure she loves you too. Anyway, that\u0027s something you need to discuss with her - not him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"The other thing that bothered me... well, he said all that in front of you.\" That was a shock too. I brushed it off, feeling a little flustered that he would think so much of my opinion. Why should he care? \"Don\u0027t worry about me. I\u0027ve been with much more abrasive people than him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no... I mean...\" Adrian looked at me and then quickly averted his eyes. \"After what he said about me, I can\u0027t stand the thought that you might think less of me.\" I was so surprised that I couldn\u0027t muster a response right away. When I did, I just blurted out the first thing that came to mind. \"Of course I don\u0027t.\" He still wouldn\u0027t look at me, apparently not believing my words. \"Adrian.\" I laid my hand over his and felt a warm spark of connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jerked his head toward me in astonishment. \"Nothing he said could change what I think of you. I\u0027ve had my mind made up about you for a long time... and it\u0027s all good.\" Adrian looked away from me and down to where my hand covered his. I blushed and pulled away. \"Sorry.\" I\u0027d probably freaked him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced back up at me. \"Best thing that\u0027s happened to me all day. Let\u0027s hit the road.\" We got back on the highway, and I found myself distracted by two things. First was my hand. It still tingled and felt warm from where I\u0027d touched his, which was kind of funny. People always thought vampires were cold, but they weren\u0027t. Certainly not Adrian. The sensation was fading the longer I drove, but I kind of wished it\u0027d stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other thing that kept distracting me was all that sugar I\u0027d just consumed. I kept running my tongue over my teeth. My whole mouth was coated in sickening sweetness. I wanted to brush my teeth and then drink a bottle of mouthwash. Liquid sugar. Yes, that was exactly what it had been. I hadn\u0027t wanted to drink one, but I\u0027d known if I\u0027d just brought a slush for Adrian, he really would\u0027ve read that as pity and refused. I had to act as though I\u0027d wanted one too, with him as an afterthought. He seemed to have believed my lie about the drink\u0027s sugar content, though a quick trip into the gas station would have quickly alerted him to the fact that Jumbo Jim\u0027s most certainly didn\u0027t carry sugar-free slushes. I\u0027d asked them. They\u0027d laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkipping lunch wasn\u0027t going to compensate for those calories, I thought glumly. And I wasn\u0027t going to get that sugary taste out of my mouth anytime soon. With as quickly as Adrian had sunk back into his depression, I suddenly felt stupid for even attempting this ruse. A slush couldn\u0027t change what his father had said, and I\u0027d be a pound up on the scale tomorrow. This probably hadn\u0027t been worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, I thought back to that brief moment by the car, and Adrian\u0027s fleeting look of contentment, followed later by: God, those are awesome. I think I needed that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brief moment of peace in the midst of his dark despair. That was what I had wanted, and that was what I had gotten. Was it worth it? I rubbed my fingertips together, still feeling that warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I decided. Yes, it was worth it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-golden-lily-bloodlines-2/page-9.html","bookId":2042,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:15 PM"}
