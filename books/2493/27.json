I couldn\u0027t find her. I tore myself up by sheer will, fighting the puke for the second time in so many minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies were already standing, looking at me and a point behind my left shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and faced where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hugged the ground like a lover, his head pressed against it. I ran to where he was, slipping twice, vertigo trying to claim my equilibrium. I made it, gripping his elbow and hauling him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe swayed together for a moment then he leaned away from me suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker bent over and sprayed chunks into the tall grass, the sun just rising here in this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb!\" Randi shouted across the wide-open space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and saw my zombies squaring off with a group of dudes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew these guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fragment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit-in-a-sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hadn\u0027t taken them any time to find us. Weak, shaken and disoriented from the travel, we were vulnerable to their assault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker\u0027s zombies reached for their assault rifles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen realized they didn\u0027t have any weapons. It was comical. They ran their large hands over the spot where they should have been and balled their empty hands into fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose guys were so resourceful. No weapons, no problemo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde came to stand beside us as Parker straightened. \"That sucked,\" he said, wiping the back of his sleeve against his mouth. His all-black ensemble had suffered with the Puke as an Accessory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. He was right. I was getting over the effects of the travel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Clyde, who never took his eyes off the group of fragment. \"Where did the young woman take us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somewhere else,\" I said, my eyes sweeping the area for Jade... then, reluctantly, Brett. My eyes were flying over the bodies that were mostly standing now, some were puking, some were fine. I spotted John and breathed a little easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clearly, Master,\" Clyde said, peeved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbi Gale said, her stance alert and ready, \"Where, Caleb? I\u0027m not wanting the twenty questions!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Randi is a Dimensional.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great! So we\u0027re in some other world somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"It\u0027s a long story,\" I said, giving her serious eyes and continued, \"but those guys,\" I pointed to the advancing fragment, \"are the bad guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbi looked at the ragged but tough-looking group that were making steady progress straight for them and thought Caleb might be on to something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How bad?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very,\" I replied and walked into the middle of the teens in the hopes of getting to Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett had Jade wrapped against his body when he woke up in a strange place. His eyes cracked open, his stomach rolling around in a hot wave of gonna barf. They were in the middle of a field or something. The air was the freshest he\u0027d ever smelled. It was somewhere between crisp forest and wheaten pasture. He forced his stomach to settle, breathing deeply. He pulled Jade closer against him and pushed the hair away from her face tenderly, kissing her temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke up and gasped. \"What are you doing, Brett?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade utterly undid him, her eyes were so beautiful, like emerald fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kissing you,\" Brett said, thinking that\u0027d been pretty damn obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" she said, shoving at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell is this? She was crawling into his mouth five minutes before...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah? What happened? He looked around, sitting up, his hand clamped around her tiny wrist. She wasn\u0027t going anywhere till he figured out what the fuck was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw a group of freaks comin\u0027 their way and hauled Jade up, shoving her behind him protectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had makeshift weapons. Some he recognized, others he didn\u0027t. His eyes searched the kids and the creepers that Hart had somehow managed to bring with him. Where was that dick hole, Frazier... where had that bastard lurked off to now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you goddamned delusional, Mason?\" Jonesy asked as he moved toward him, his fist raised to deck him when Hart interrupted, \"No, let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Hart was barreling into him and he was fighting for all he was worth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the girl he wanted more than his own life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I could think of was Brett with his hands on Jade. It didn\u0027t matter that she\u0027d dumped me, that most likely she dumped me under the influence of the enhancer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe. Had. His. Hands. On. Her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pounded a good one in his face and he kicked out in a move so novice, I could\u0027ve deflected it in my sleep. But I was all rage-driven and felt it graze my nuts and I grunted, my hands cupping my package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved me off and kicked me in the ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped over and used the instep of my foot to take out his knee. He shrieked in agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat move hurt like a bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde grabbed the back of Brett\u0027s shirt and mine and jerked us off our feet, four hundred pounds between the two of us, like we were a couple of bowling balls instead of two almost full-grown men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZombie strength. But his eyes blazed human pissed off at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They come!\" shake-thrash-teeth rattle, \"We do not have sufficient time for fisticuffs!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my head and saw that while I was all over the top of Brett, the fragment had begun to wade into our zombies, hacking at them as they came, their primitive weapons plenty effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we only had five zombies here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognized what the Skopamish looked like to the fragment. What had Queen Clara called them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Red Men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief turned and looked at me for a command. I gave him the one I knew best, my balls throbbing like I\u0027d be sick again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKill them, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned smoothly, in a move so choreographed it looked like he was dancing, reaching for the tomahawk that was no longer there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weapons. All the weapons had been lost to the travel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were completely defenseless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde lowered us to the ground and the Indians gave a shrill war cry, the three against many, their bare hands the only weapons at their disposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might be enough, they were the walking dead after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker\u0027s bodyguard zombies started taking the fragment apart by hand, beating them as they came for them. The flesh of their knuckles sloughing off even as Parker\u0027s will re-knitted it to perfection before our eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were simply too many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde asked as he rolled up his sleeves, his suit jacket folded neatly on a nearby boulder, \"What do these marauders want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The women. They\u0027re rare here. They\u0027ll kill every male and take the girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this male,\" he stated like he was talking about the weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe agreed on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced Brett\u0027s way, his chest was heaving, the weight off the leg that I\u0027d abused. Hell... I needed him and I\u0027d incapacitated him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was gettin\u0027 an F for sure in Reactive Management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Howie?\" I yelled at Brett over the noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade came to me like we\u0027d never been apart, her large green eyes filled with apprehension, she opened her mouth to speak but I had to shove her behind me as the first of the fragment came within range, his eyes pinned on her with greed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith lust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew that blowhard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale began beating the hell out of the one that came closest to her, Clyde slammed two heads together and they split apart, brain matter splattering everything within a meter from the force of the blow. He heaved their bodies to the side like so much trash and snarled as one of the men of the fragment grabbed hold of Gale\u0027s hair and she screamed like it was being torn out of her scalp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brought her elbow up and swung it with precision at the one who advanced on her, breaking his nose at the same time she rammed her head into hair-puller who was behind. Clyde took both hands and latched onto the male who had his hands laced in Gale\u0027s hair. He jerked down with every ounce of the undead strength that he possessed and I felt the pull of it through our connection and grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde separated the dude\u0027s arm from the socket. Blood burst out of the open hole where his arm had been attached and sprayed another of the fragment as he moved in to maim. Clyde turned smoothly and plugged him in the jaw with the severed arm, using the ball joints like a sledgehammer, causing the fragment to pinwheel backwards into two more that bore down right behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Righteous, Clyde!\" I heard Jonesy shriek as he got clocked by a fragment who looked like he was going to bring down a weapon that looked suspiciously like a crowbar on his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot to worry, Tiff spit out a wad of gum, biting the guy who had the crowbar in the forearm. He shrieked and dropped the weapon. Jonesy was stunned for a moment but the guy backhanded Tiff and that woke Jonesy up. She hung on, tears and snot leaking out of her from the blow, her arms hanging on for dear life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy drove his fist like a hammer in the guy\u0027s beak and he folded. It\u0027d been a direct hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff fell away from him like a perfect leaf off a tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn caught her and gently lowered her to the ground. Jade screamed, \"Caleb!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and in an intuitive move I didn\u0027t know I possessed, I ducked and a small sword sailed over my head, the breeze of it passing through my hair. I punched out without thinking at whatever was in front of me and connected with a lean gut, toughened by the life of Outside. A great whoosh of breath came out and then the males were all over us like ants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dragged the girls into a circle, kicking and screaming. Alex roared when one of them cuffed Randi and her small body fell to the ground. He ran toward them but one put a knife to her neck, the point of it drawing a crimson drop, the essence running down her neck to pool at the hollow in her throat. She gave him wide eyes, her hair knotted in the fist of the one who held the blade at her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t come to her aid, Band,\" he said, eyeing Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex looked at me in confusion and I responded, \"Remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey mistook him for Band. Rightfully so, as he was somehow related to them. Minus the gills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders slumped in defeat. They were using the girls against us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps, Clyde and the zombies came to stand behind me. The fragment grabbed the rest of the girls, knives or other sharpened weapons of brutality jammed at the tender spot under their chins. Identical expressions gazed back at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOurs were worse. If I\u0027d had a mirror, I would have seen my expression and recognized it immediately for it what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine had moved smoothly over into terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen as the group of fragment parted, I saw who came to stand amongst them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zondorae brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn\u0027t this special?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould\u0027ve killed them when I had the chance, I thought without a drop of mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe stepped forward, his grim face beginning a slow smile that overtook his face instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so pleased with himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe self-satisfied prick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had eyes only for Parker. \"Parker,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joe,\" Parker responded neutrally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over the group, his eyes resting briefly on the captured girls: Mia, Randi, Jade, Tiff and Sophie. Their eyes were wide and frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck that, Tiff\u0027s eyes were narrowed and pissed. I gave a small smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze passed over the zombies; both Parker\u0027s and mine. He missed Clyde and then his eyes briefly traveled over Gale and Clyde hissed, giving himself away neatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans didn\u0027t usually do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZombies did. It was second nature. Like eating brains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYum-yum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Zondorae\u0027s eyes narrowed when he caught sight of Gramps and the guys from the group. Brett limped over to stand beside the rest of my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowie was still a no-show. That kinda nagged at me, I wasn\u0027t gonna self-delude on that. I wanted that asswipe in my sights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary Zondorae looked at Randi and her eyes got even bigger in her small face. He palmed his chin and said to Joe, \"She needs to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she does.\" His eyes flicked to Alex and he said something to five males of the fragment and they sprinted to where Alex stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d underestimated him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen men of the fragment to hold a berserk Alex down while they shot Randi up with something. Some kind of sedative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes rolled back in her head, her coal black hair falling away from her face like a fragile curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex roared into the sky while the fragment struggled to contain him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We took your supplies,\" I said to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you seriously believe that we had everything we would ever need on our person?\" Joe asked, jabbing a thumb in his chest for emphasis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary cocked an arrogant brow above hard eyes. \"Who do you think Tucker received his ideas from? His whispered principles? The raw material necessary to eradicate the genetic problem of the spheres?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-weeps-death-5/page-27.html","bookId":2493,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM"}
