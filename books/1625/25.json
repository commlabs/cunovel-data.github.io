There were taverns out there, and parks. There was a whole bustling world, in which the students and apprentices of the various Guilds and Colleges took a full ripe part, either by playing tricks on it, running through it shouting, or throwing parts of it up. There was laughter which paid no attention to the Five Cadences or Twelve Inflections. And – although the students debated this news in the dormitories at night – there was apparently unauthorised humour, delivered freestyle, with no reference to the Monster Fun Book or the Council or anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut there, beyond the stained stonework, people were telling jokes without reference to the Lords of Misrule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a sobering thought. Well, not a sobering thought in actual fact, because alcohol wasn\u0027t allowed in the Guild. But if it was, it would have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nowhere more sober than the Guild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fool spoke bitterly of the huge, redfaced Brother Prankster, of evenings learning the Merry Jests, of long mornings in the freezing gymnasium learning the Eighteen Pratfalls and the accepted trajectory for a custard pie. And juggling. Juggling! Brother Jape, a man with a soul like cold boiled string, taught juggling. It wasn\u0027t that the Fool was bad at juggling that reduced him to incoherent fury. Fools were expected to be bad at juggling, especially if juggling inherently funny items like custard pies, flaming torches or extremely sharp cleavers. What had Brother Jape laying about him in red-hot, clanging rage was the fact that the Fool was bad at juggling because he wasn \u0027t any good at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Didn\u0027t you want to be anything else?\u0027 said Magrat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What else is there?\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027I haven\u0027t seen anything else I could be.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudent Fools were allowed out, in the last year of training, but under a fearsome set of restrictions. Capering miserably through the streets he\u0027d seen wizards for the first time, moving like dignified carnival floats. He\u0027d seen the surviving assassins, foppish, giggling young men in black silk, as sharp as knives underneath; he\u0027d seen priests, their fantastic costumes only slightly marred by the long rubber sacrificial aprons they wore for major services. Every trade and profession had its costume, he saw, and he realised for the first time that the uniform he was wearing had been carefully and meticulously designed for no other purpose than making its wearer look like a complete and utter pillock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, he\u0027d persevered. He\u0027d spent his whole life persevering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe persevered precisely because he had absolutely no talent, and because grandfather would have flayed him alive if he didn\u0027t. He memorised the authorised jokes until his head rang, and got up even earlier in the morning to juggle until his elbows creaked. He had perfected his grasp of the comic vocabulary until only the very senior Lords could understand him. He\u0027d capered and clowned with an impenetrable grim determination and he\u0027d graduated top of his year and had been awarded the Bladder of Honour. He\u0027d dropped it down the privy when he came home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagrat was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fool said, \u0027How did you get to be a witch?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Um?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I mean, did you go to a school or something?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh. No. Goodie Whemper just walked down to the village one day, got all us girls lined up, and chose me. You don\u0027t choose the Craft, you see. It chooses you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, but when do you actually become a witch?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027When the other witches treat you as one, I suppose.\u0027 Magrat sighed. \u0027If they ever do,\u0027 she added. \u0027I thought they would after I did that spell in the corridor. It was pretty good, after all.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Marry, t\u0027was a rite of passage,\u0027 said the Fool, unable to stop himself. Magrat gave him a blank look. He coughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The other witches being those two old ladies?\u0027 he said, relapsing into his usual gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Very strong characters, I imagine.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Very,\u0027 said Magrat, with feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I wonder if they ever met my grandad,\u0027 said the Fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagrat looked at her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They\u0027re quite nice really,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s just that, well, when you\u0027re a witch you don\u0027t think about other people. I mean, you think about them, but you don\u0027t actually think about their feelings, if you see what I mean. At least, not unless you think about it.\u0027 She looked at her feet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re not like that,\u0027 said the Fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Look, I wish you\u0027d stop working for the duke,\u0027 said Magrat desperately. \u0027You know what he\u0027s like. Torturing people and setting fire to their cottages and everything.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But I\u0027m his Fool,\u0027 said the Fool. \u0027A Fool has to be loyal to his master. Right up until he dies. I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s tradition. Tradition is very important.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But you don\u0027t even like being a Fool!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I hate it. But that\u0027s got nothing to do with it. If I\u0027ve got to be a Fool, I\u0027ll do it properly.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s really stupid,\u0027 said Magrat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Foolish, I\u0027d prefer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fool had been edging along the log. \u0027If I kiss you,\u0027 he added carefully, \u0027do I turn into a frog?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagrat looked down at her feet again. They shuffled themselves under her dress, embarrassed at all this attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could sense the shades of Gytha Ogg and Esme Weatherwax on either side of her. Granny\u0027s spectre glared at her. A witch is master of every situation, it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMistress, said the vision of Nanny Ogg, and made a brief gesture involving much grinning and waving of forearms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We shall have to see,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was destined to be the most impressive kiss in the history of foreplay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime, as Granny Weatherwax had pointed out, is a subjective experience. The Fool\u0027s years in the Guild had been an eternity whereas the hours with Magrat on the hilltop passed like a couple of minutes. And, high above Lancre, a double handful of seconds extended like taffy into hours of screaming terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ice!\u0027 screamed Granny. \u0027It\u0027s iced up!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanny Ogg came alongside, trying vainly to match courses with the tumbling, bucking broomstick. Octarine fire crackled over the frozen bristles, shorting them out at random. She leaned over and snatched a handful of Granny\u0027s skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I tole you it was daft!\u0027 she shouted. \u0027You went all through all that wet mist and then up into the cold air, you daft besom!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You let go of my skirt, Gytha Ogg!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come on, grab hold o\u0027mine. You\u0027re on fire at the back there!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shot through the bottom of the cloud bank and screamed in unison as the shrub-covered ground emerged from nowhere and aimed itself directly at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd went past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanny looked down a black perspective at the bottom of which a boil of white water was dimly visible. They had flown over the edge of Lancre Gorge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue smoke was pouring out of Granny\u0027s broomstick but she hung on, determined, and forced it around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What the hell you doing?\u0027 roared Nanny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I can follow the river,\u0027 Granny Weatherwax screamed, above the crackle of flames. \u0027Don\u0027t you worry!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You come aboard, d\u0027you hear? It\u0027s all over, you can\u0027t do it . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small explosion behind Granny and several handfuls of burning bristles broke off and whirled away into the booming depths of the gorge. Her stick jerked sideways and Nanny grabbed her around the shoulders as a gout of fire snapped another binding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blazing broomstick shot from between her legs, twisted in the air, and went straight upwards, trailing sparks and making a noise like a wet finger dragged around the top of a wineglass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis left Nanny flying upside down, supporting Granny Weatherwax at arm\u0027s length. They stared into one another\u0027s face and screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I can\u0027t pull you up!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, I can\u0027t climb up, can I? Act your age, Gytha!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanny considered this. Then she let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree marriages and an adventurous girlhood had left Nanny Ogg with thigh muscles that could crack coconuts, and the G-forces sucked at her as she forced the speeding stick down and around in a tight loop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead of her she made out Granny Weatherwax dropping like a stone, one hand clutching her hat, the other trying to prevent gravity from seeing up her skirts. She urged the stick forwards until it creaked, snatched the falling witch around the waist, fought the plunging stick back up to level flight, and sagged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe subsequent silence was broken by Granny Weatherwax saying, \u0027Don\u0027t you ever do that again, Gytha Ogg.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I promise.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Now turn us around. We\u0027re heading for Lancre Bridge, remember?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanny obediently turned the broomstick, brushing the canyon walls as she did so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s still miles to go,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I mean to do it,\u0027 said Granny. \u0027There\u0027s plenty of night left.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not enough, I\u0027m thinking.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A witch doesn\u0027t know the meaning of the word “failure”. Gytha.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shot up into the clear air again. The horizon was a line of golden light as the slow dawn of the Disc sped across the land, bulldozing the suburbs of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Esme?\u0027 said Nanny Ogg, after a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It means “lack of success”.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey flew in chilly silence for several seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I was speaking wossname. Figuratively,\u0027 said Granny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh. Well. You should of said.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line of light was bigger, brighter. For the first time a flicker of doubt invaded Granny Weatherwax\u0027s mind, puzzled to find itself in such unfamiliar surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I wonder how many cockerels there are in Lancre?\u0027 she said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Was that one of them wossname questions?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I was just wondering.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanny Ogg sat back. There were thirty-two of crowing age, she knew. She knew because she\u0027d worked it out last night – tonight - and had given Jason his instructions. She had fifteen grown-up children and innumerable grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and they\u0027d had most of the evening to get into position. It should be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Did you hear that?\u0027 said Granny. \u0027Over Razorback way?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanny looked innocently across the misty landscape. Sound travelled very clearly in these early hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sort of an “urk” noise?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny spun around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Over there,\u0027 she said. \u0027I definitely heard it this time. Something like “cock-a-doo-arrgh”.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Can\u0027t say I did, Esme,\u0027 said Nanny, smiling at the sky. \u0027Lancre Bridge up ahead.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And over there! Right down there! It was a definite squawk!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Dawn chorus, Esme, I expect. Look, only half a mile to go.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny glared at the back of her colleague\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s something going on here,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Search me, Esme.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Your shoulders are shaking!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Lost my shawl back there. I\u0027m a bit chilly. Look, we\u0027re nearly there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranny glared ahead, her mind a maze of suspicions. She was going to get to the bottom of this. When she had time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe damp logs of Lancre\u0027s main link to the outside world drifted gently underneath them. From the chicken farm half a mile away came a chorus of strangled squawks and a thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And that? What was that, then?\u0027 demanded Granny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Fowl pest. Careful, I\u0027m bringing us down.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you laughing at me?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just pleased for you, Esme. You\u0027ll go down in history for this, you know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drifted between the timbers of the bridge. Granny Weatherwax alighted cautiously on the greasy planking and adjusted her dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. Well,\u0027 she added, nonchalantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Better than Black Aliss, everyone\u0027ll say,\u0027 Nanny Ogg went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Some people will say anything,\u0027 said Granny. She peered over the parapet at the foaming torrent far below, and then up at the distant outcrop on which stood Lancre Castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you think they will?\u0027 she added, nonchalantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Mark my words.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wyrd-sisters-discworld-6/page-25.html","bookId":1625,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:49 PM"}
