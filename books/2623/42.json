In an instant. If a fight had broken out, she would have been killed. We can be controlled too, Olya. Human beings can be turned in different directions, towards Good or Evil, the Dark Ones can be manipulated through their meanness, their vanity, their thirst for power and fame. And we can be manipulated through love. There we\u0027re as defenceless as children.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is the boss in the picture?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Olya?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was finding it hard to get the words out. I couldn\u0027t believe it. Light Magicians who had lived for hundreds of years didn\u0027t feel shame. They\u0027d saved the world so often, they had all the ethical dodges off pat. Great Sorceresses didn\u0027t feel ashamed, not even former Great Sorceresses. They\u0027d been betrayed too often themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Olya, did you realise straight away? As soon as the Dark Ones lodged their protest? That they were hunting me, but only in order to push Svetlana beyond her self-control?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, yes, yes. And you still didn\u0027t warn me, or her?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Svetlana needs to mature quickly, to skip a few steps on the way.\u0027 A bright flame flared in Olga\u0027s eyes. \u0027Anton, you\u0027re my friend. I\u0027ll tell you the truth, so you can understand. We don\u0027t have enough time right now to nurture a Great Sorceress properly. But we need her, we need her more than you can even imagine. She already has enough power. She\u0027ll get tougher and learn how to draw on that power and direct it and, what\u0027s even more important, she\u0027ll learn how to hold it in check.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And if I die, that will only strengthen her will and her hatred of the Dark.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. But I\u0027m sure you\u0027re not going to die. The Watch is hunting the Maverick, everybody\u0027s been drafted in. We\u0027ll turn him over to the Dark Ones and the charges against you will be dropped.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But a certain Light Magician who wasn\u0027t initiated at the right time will die. Miserable and alone, like an animal brought to bay, convinced he\u0027s the only one fighting against the Dark.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You agree with everything I say today,\u0027 I said calmly. \u0027Olga, don\u0027t you think what you\u0027re doing might just be despicable?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No.\u0027 There wasn\u0027t a trace of doubt. That meant the stakes must be really high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How long do I have to hold out, Light One?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a time, a long time ago, when that was a form of address Watch members often used – \u0027Light One\u0027. Why had the words lost their old meaning, why did they sound as absurd now as the word \u0027gentlemen\u0027 used to address the dirty street bums at the beer kiosks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Until morning at least.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The night\u0027s not our time any longer. Today all the Dark Ones will be out on the streets of Moscow. And they\u0027ll be acting within their rights.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Only until we locate the Maverick. Hang on in there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Olga.\u0027 I took a step towards her and touched her cheek, for a moment forgetting the difference in our ages – what were a few hundred years, compared with eternal night? – and the difference in our powers and our knowledge. \u0027Olga, do you really believe that I\u0027ll still be alive in the morning?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sorceress didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. There was nothing more to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder how it would be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo lose myself in the dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo knock at the transparent doors\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd know no one will answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed the button and set the walkman to play in random mode. Not because the song didn\u0027t suit my mood, in fact exactly the opposite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love the metro at night, but I don\u0027t know why. There\u0027s nothing to look at except the same old dreary adverts and the same old tired human auras. The rumble of the engine, the gusts of air coming in through the half-open windows, the jolting over the rails. The numb wait for your own station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I love it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered, got up and walked to the door, even though I\u0027d been planning to go to the end of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis station was Rizhskaya. The next was Alexeevskaya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain that intense silence,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways about the same thing,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday the season opens\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the lepers\u0027 club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was already on the escalator when I caught the faint sense of power ahead of me. I ran my eyes along the down escalator and saw the Dark One almost immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he wasn\u0027t Day Watch, he was carrying himself all wrong for that. He was a low-grade magician, grade four or five, probably five: and he was concentrating hard, scanning the people around him. Still really young, not much over twenty, in a crumpled, unbuttoned jacket, with long, fair hair and an attractive face, even though it was all tensed up like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what could have pushed you over the edge into the Dark? What happened before that first time you stepped into the Twilight? An argument with your girlfriend? A quarrel with your parents? Did you flunk your exams in college or get a Fail at school? Did someone tread on your foot on a trolleybus?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the most terrible thing of all is that your appearance hasn\u0027t even changed. Maybe you\u0027re even better-looking now. Your friends were amazed to discover what a fun guy you turned out to be, how well everything went when they planned things with you. Your girlfriend discovered all sorts of good qualities in you that she couldn\u0027t see before. Your parents were overjoyed to see how serious and intelligent their son had suddenly become. Your professors were delighted with their talented student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd nobody knows how you make the people around you pay. And just how high the price of your kindness, your jokes and your sympathy is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and leaned against the moving handrail. I was tired, I was slightly drunk, I wasn\u0027t paying any attention to anything, just listening to the music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark One\u0027s gaze slid over me, moving lower, then quivered and came to a halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t had any time to prepare, to change my appearance or distort my aura. I really hadn\u0027t expected the search of the metro would have started already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold, piercing touch, like a gust of icy wind. The young guy was comparing me with the image that must have been distributed to all the Dark Ones in Moscow. He was working clumsily, he\u0027d forgotten about his defences, he didn\u0027t notice my mind slipping along the pathway cleared through the Twilight and touching his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy. Delight. Found. The prey. They\u0027ll give me some of the prey\u0027s power. They\u0027ll appreciate this. They\u0027ll promote me. Fame. Getting my own back. They didn\u0027t appreciate me before. Now they\u0027ll understand. They\u0027ll pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been imagining that at least somewhere in some corner of his mind there would be some other thoughts. About me being an enemy. About me killing others like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no. There was nothing. He wasn\u0027t thinking of anything but himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI withdrew my feelers before the young magician withdrew his own clumsy ones. All right. He didn\u0027t possess any great powers, he wouldn\u0027t be able to communicate with the Day Watch from inside the metro. And he wouldn\u0027t even want to. He thought of me as a cornered animal, and not even a dangerous one – a rabbit, not a wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBring it on, my friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked out of the metro, slipped round beside the entrance and summoned my shadow. The hazy silhouette shimmered above the ground and I stepped into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople walking by became a transparent haze, cars started to crawl like tortoises, the streetlamps dimmed, their light turned gloomy and oppressive. It was quiet, all sounds reduced to a barely audible rumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d made my move a little too early, it would be a while before the magician could get back up after me . . . But I could feel my own power, I was pumped full of it. That must have been Olga\u0027s work. While she was in my body she\u0027d regained her former powers and filled it with energy, without using up any of it. She would never even have thought of taking any, no matter how great the temptation might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027ll understand for yourself where the boundary lies\u0027 – that\u0027s what I\u0027d told Svetlana. Olga had known, far better than me, where the boundary lay for a long, long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked along the wall, glancing through the concrete at the inclined shaft and the belts of the escalators. There was a dark spot climbing upwards rapidly: the magician was in a hurry, running up the steps, but he was still in the human world. Saving his powers. Bring it on, bring it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small, swirling cloud skimming toward me just above the ground, a patch of mist that had assumed the form of a human figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Other. A former Other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it had been one of us. And maybe not. The Dark Ones had to go somewhere when they died. But now it was just a hazy little cloud, an eternal wanderer in the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Peace be with you, fallen one,\u0027 I said. \u0027Whoever you may have been.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quivering silhouette halted in front of me. A tongue of mist freed itself from its body and extended towards me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did it want? The number of times inhabitants of the Twilight had tried to communicate with the living could be counted on the fingers of one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand – if it could be called a hand – was trembling. White threads of mist came away from it, dissolving in the Twilight, scattering on to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m very short of time,\u0027 I said. \u0027Fallen one, no matter who you were in life, Dark or Light, peace be with you. What do you want from me?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gust of wind seemed to ripple through the swirls of mist. The phantom turned and the outstretched hand – I no longer had any doubt that it was a hand – pointed through the Twilight towards the north-east. I turned in its direction. It was pointing to a needle-slim silhouette glimmering in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, the tower, I understand! But what does it mean?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mist started to blur and dissolve and a moment later the Twilight around me was as empty as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to shiver. The dead Other had tried to communicate with me. Was it a friend or an enemy? Had it been advising me or warning me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way to tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another look through the walls of the station building – the Dark Magician had almost reached the top of the escalator, but he was still on it. So I had a moment to try to figure out what the phantom had been trying to say. I hadn\u0027t been intending to go to the Ostankino Television Tower, I had a different route in mind, a somewhat risky but surprising plan. So it didn\u0027t make any sense to warn me not to go to the tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I\u0027d been given directions. But who by? Friend or foe, that was the important question. I couldn\u0027t expect all differences to be wiped out beyond the borders of life. Our dead would not abandon us in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have to decide for myself. Only not right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran towards the entrance of the metro, taking my pistol out of my shoulder holster as I ran. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-42.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
