When it’s time to settle down, I’m getting somebody like…” Erin looked over her shoulder at the eavesdroppers behind us, “like one of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys looked at each other and stood up a little straighter. With a smirk in Erin’s direction, one of them fist-bumped the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI doubted Erin would give me a second thought during her romantic weekend. I was on my own. I deliberated, finally turning toward the student union while pulling my jacket tighter against the sudden November chill. Frat parties held this weekend wouldn’t be open-window, not that I’d know firsthand. There was no way in hell I was going anywhere Kennedy might be. Or Buck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coffee smell invaded my senses before the Starbucks came into view. Rounding the corner, my eyes went to the counter, where two employees stood talking. When I didn’t see Lucas, I wondered if he’d switched shifts and forgot to text me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were only a handful of customers—one of whom was Dr. Heller, reading the paper in the corner. I had nothing against my professor, but I didn’t exactly want him witnessing my attempts to flirt with the guy who skipped the quiz and got called out for it just this morning. I stood just behind a display of coffee mugs and travel cups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as he had Monday, Lucas pushed through the door to the back as my eyes brushed over it. My fingers and toes tingled at the sight of him. Underneath the green apron, he wore a close-fitting light blue t-shirt, long-sleeved, not the university-branded sweatshirt he’d worn this morning in class. His shirtsleeves were pushed past his elbows again, leaving the tattoos visible. I moved to the counter, my eyes skimming from his forearms to his face. He hadn’t seen me yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the girls at the register straightened. “Can I help you?” Her voice held a bite of annoyance, as though she was snapping her fingers to get my attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got it, Eve,” Lucas said, and she shrugged and returned to her conversation with her coworker, but they both eyed me with even more hostility than a moment before. “Hey, Jacqueline.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced toward the corner where Dr. Heller sat. “What can I get for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone wasn’t the tone of a guy who’d specifically asked me to come by. Maybe he was behaving circumspectly for his coworkers’ benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, a grande Americano, I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed the cup from the stack and made the drink. I tried to hand him my card, but he shook his head once. “That’s okay. I’ve got it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis coworkers exchanged a look I pretended not to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thanked him and retreated to the opposite side of the shop from Dr. Heller, setting up my laptop to work on my econ project. I had to glean information from multiple sources to defend the position my research paper was taking. It was due before Thanksgiving break, less than two weeks away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I never had to make up another midterm, it would be too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter an hour, I’d bookmarked a dozen sources on current international economic happenings, my coffee was gone, and Lucas hadn’t come over once. I was expected at the high school for my weekly Friday afternoon bass lessons in half an hour. Shutting down my laptop, I turned to unplug the power cord from the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ms. Wallace.” At Dr. Heller’s unexpected greeting, I jumped, knocking over my thankfully-empty cup. “Oh! So sorry to have startled you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, that’s okay. I’m a little jumpy—from, uh, the coffee.” And from thinking for one split second that you were Lucas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wanted to let you know that Mr. Maxfield tells me you’re almost caught up, and making headway on the project. I’m glad to hear it.” He lowered his voice and glanced around conspiratorially. “My colleagues and I don’t actually want to fail anyone, you know. Our goal is to frighten—I mean encourage—the less, er, serious students to produce. Not that I believe you’re one of those.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned his smile. “I understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightened and cleared his throat. “Good, good. Well, on that note—have a productive weekend.” He chuckled at his joke and I managed to avoid rolling my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Dr. Heller.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to the counter and spoke to Lucas as I wound the power cord and stowed the laptop in my backpack. The conversation between them was earnest, and I was concerned when Dr. Heller seemed to gesture toward me at least once. I wondered if our professor believed that Lucas was one of those less serious students he could intimidate into becoming more dedicated. If so, I didn’t want to be used as some sort of example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I walked out, I looked over my shoulder, but Lucas didn’t shift his gaze my way at all, and his expression was tense. His coworker, wiping down a counter a few feet away, smirked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I left the high school two hours later, I switched on my phone, endeavoring to look forward to a weekend alone while it powered up. Clearly, the trip to Starbucks was a bust. Lucas had been, if possible, even more puzzling and cagey than he was before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile working on the project, I’d emailed Landon to thank him for sending the worksheet Wednesday, and for insisting that I do it. Not wanting to trigger a possible guilt complex, I didn’t directly refer to the tipoff he’d knowingly given me, in case he was the rigorously honest type of guy he seemed to be. I hadn’t heard from him since Wednesday, but maybe he would email this afternoon or tonight. Maybe he’d be free this weekend, and we could finally meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had one text from Erin that she and Chaz had arrived in Shreveport—along with lots of insinuation about what I could do with a room to myself, and Mom had texted to ask about my Thanksgiving plans. Kennedy and I had alternated spending the day at his house or mine the past three years. Somehow, this translated into confusion about whether or not I was coming home this year. When I texted her back that yes, breaking up with a guy generally means no more shared holidays, I expected an apology to follow. I should have known better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom: Don’t be snippy. Your dad and I planned and paid for a trip to Breckenridge that weekend, because we thought you could stay at the Moore’s. I guess we’ll have to cancel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Go ahead and go. I’ll go home with Erin or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom: Ok. If you’re sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: I’m sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow. My boyfriend dumps me, and the first chance Mom has to be tangibly supportive, she and Dad are taking off alone to go skiing. Way to make me feel wanted and included, Mom. As if Kennedy’s rejection wasn’t enough to deal with. Jesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tossed my phone in an empty cup-holder and drove back to campus, prepared to watch reality TV and work on economics all weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got to my room, I saw that Lucas had texted while I was driving back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas: Sorry I didn’t say goodbye\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: It was awkward with Dr. Heller there I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas: So, I’d like to sketch you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Oh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas: Yeah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Okay. Not, like, sans clothes or anything right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas: Haha no. Unless you’re up for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas: J/k. Is tonight ok? Or tomorrow night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Tonight is good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas: Cool. I can be there in a couple of hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Ok.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas: What’s your room number?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: 362. I’ll need to let you into the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas: I can probably get in. I’ll text you if I can’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas’s knock was light. I was so nervous that I was trembling when I got up to answer the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d said he wanted to sketch me, but I wasn’t sure if that’s all he wanted to do, or if it was code for more. Erin would never let me hear the end of it if I had him in our room and didn’t at least get him to kiss me, though Lucas didn’t strike me as the sort of guy who usually had to stop at kissing. Plenty of girls saw college as some sort of exploratory period, and many would be more than happy to explore Lucas. But it had taken me over a year to work up to sex with Kennedy, and he was the only guy I’d ever slept with. I wasn’t ready to go there with Lucas, not yet anyway—rebound or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knocked again, a little harder, and I stopped thinking and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFringes of dark hair stuck out from his dark gray beanie. In the diffuse hallway lighting, his eyes took on the nearly colorless quality they’d had that first night, when he peered into my truck after he’d fought with Buck. He hunched his shoulders, hands in his front pockets, sketchpad under one arm. “Hey,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped back into the room, holding the door wide. Olivia and Rona lounged in their own doorway across the hall, eyeballing Lucas, gaping at me, watching him enter my room while Erin was gone. Olivia arched a brow and glanced at her roommate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole floor would know I had a hot guy in my room within five minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let the door swing shut as Lucas tossed his sketchpad on my bed and stood in the center of the room, which seemed to shrink with him in it. Without moving, he examined Erin’s side of the room, the walls above her bed covered in photos, the Greek letters of her sorority above the glittery letters of her name. Taking advantage of his distraction, I studied him: cowboy boots, scuffed to hell, worn jeans, heather gray hoodie. He turned his head to scan my side of the room, and I stared at his profile—recently-shaved jaw, parted lips, dark eyelashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacing me, his eyes flicked over me and then to the laptop on my desk, which I’d hooked to a small set of speakers. I’d set up a playlist of tracks from my collection and set it to play quietly. Another of Erin’s suggestions. She’d titled the playlist OBBP, and I belatedly hoped he didn’t inspect the list and ask what that meant. I wouldn’t tell him, of course, but my blush-prone parts would probably incinerate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like this band. Did you see them last month?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy and I had seen them, in fact—the night before we broke up. They were one of our favorite local groups. He’d been weird that night. Distant. At concerts, he’d usually tuck my back to his chest, legs spread just enough to accommodate my feet between his, his arms locked around my middle. Instead, he’d stood next to me, like we were friends. After we broke up, I realized that he’d made up his mind before that night—that his reserve was evidence of the wall between us; I just hadn’t seen it yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, vanquishing Kennedy from my thoughts. “Did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. I don’t remember seeing you there—but it was dark, and I maybe had a beer or two.” He smiled—white teeth, just imperfect enough to indicate that he’d not suffered through the orthodontics I had. Pulling off the cap and dropping it on my bed, he placed the pencil on his sketchbook and slid both hands through his flattened hair, and then shook it out, resulting in a bed-head look. Good God. When he drew the hoodie over his head, his white t-shirt pulled up a bit with it, and I got my answer on how far the tattoos extended. Four lines of script, too small to read, snaked around his left side. Some sort of Celtic-looking design balanced it on the right. Bonus: I now knew what Erin meant by lickable abs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hoodie joined the cap, and his t-shirt fell back into place. Picking up the sketchbook and pencil, he turned to me, and I noted that the ink on his forearms continued over his biceps and under the short sleeves of his shirt. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/easy-contours-of-the-heart-1/page-11.html","bookId":2743,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:59 PM"}
