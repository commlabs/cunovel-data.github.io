Back when powerful experts of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty had been fighting those from the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, they had all been working together. But the truth was that, normally speaking, they were always at odds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople noticed Bai Xiaochun, but did little more than look at him before moving along. That also served to put him more at ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This thing probably isn’t about me specifically….” he thought. “After all, I\u0027m the ambassador from the Saint-Emperor Dynasty. The Vile-Emperor probably just invited me to attend out of formality.” Feeling calmer than ever, he flew up to the imperial palace. Upon arriving, he saw a beam of light approaching, within which was a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was beautiful, but cold beyond measure. Most people edged away from her subconsciously, seemingly unwilling to even come into contact with the ghost qi that surrounded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was none other than… Gongsun Wan’er!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Bai Xiaochun had given her a chunk of the sovereign\u0027s flesh back in the second immortal domain, she had acquired a reward that none of the other celestials did. Despite that, she treated Bai Xiaochun as coldly as ever, almost as if she didn’t even notice him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun had originally planned to call out a greeting, but upon seeing how she was acting, gave an inward harrumph. He was really getting convinced that Gongsun Wan’er had mental problems. Considering that, he wasn’t inclined to pay her any attention, and simply turned to enter the imperial palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, even as Gongsun Wan’er walked past him, he heard an almost undetectably quiet voice in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be careful!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly those two words were spoken, nothing else. And yet, ripples of divine sense could be detected inside the imperial palace in response to them, as though people had noticed. By then, Gongsun Wan’er was past Bai Xiaochun and in the imperial palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood in place for a long moment. Moments ago, he had calmed himself down, only to have that calm shattered by Gongsun Wan’er’s words. And yet, there was no going back now. Steeling himself, he entered the imperial palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in no mood to marvel at the magnificent imperial palace. Feeling the pressure mounting, he entered the main hall to find numerous banquet tables set up, spread with immortal liquor and spirit fruits. There was also a host of handmaidens present to serve the guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun looked around hesitantly at all the tables. He recognized many of the people here. Virūpākṣa, Gongsun Wan’er, Prince Ur-Demon, Celestial Deadfall, Daoist Heavenspan…. There were also quite a few demigod experts that he had seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the far end of the hall near the Dragon Throne was the Vile-Prince, who was currently chatting with the cultivators seated near him. When he noticed Bai Xiaochun, he looked over and laughed heartily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ambassador Bai! Come come, sit here with me!” He even rose to his feet, walked over, and cordially put his arm over Bai Xiaochun’s shoulder to lead him over to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun cautiously went along. After being seated, he looked over at the Vile-Prince and asked, “What’s the occasion, Vile-Prince?”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My father the emperor recently had a cultivation breakthrough, and instructed me to throw a little banquet. I invited all of the officials and officers of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, first to offer their congratulations, and second to, er… well, Ambassador Bai, most of your time in Vile-Emperor City has been spent in seclusion. You should really spend a bit more time getting to know the cultivators of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty.” He chuckled a bit, during which time many of the surrounding cultivators turned to look at Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe celestials’ eyes were cold, and more than one derisive smile could be seen. Clearly, none of them had any desire to conceal the revulsion they felt for Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, Bai Xiaochun realized that this banquet… had indeed been set up to target him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the likely culprit wasn’t the Vile-Emperor, but rather, the Vile-Prince!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s brow furrowed slightly, but then he relaxed. Laughing heartily, he took a casual swig of some immortal alcohol, and then cast an enigmatic smile in the Vile-Prince’s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response, the Vile-Prince’s eyes flickered with icy light, and he chuckled again. Apparently, everyone who had been invited was now gathered. It was at this point that divine sense fluctuations spread out that clearly surpassed anything from a celestial. Before any of the shaken guests could react, someone appeared on the Dragon Throne!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore a dragon robe, and an imperial crown, and despite his expressionless face, looked like some sort of god. He was none other than… the Vile-Emperor!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone, Bai Xiaochun included, shot to their feet, clasped hands, and bowed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Vile-Emperor!” they said in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vile-Emperor said nothing. Waving his hand dismissively, he closed his eyes, as though nothing present were worthy of attracting his interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, there were many people here who were used to the Vile-Emperor, and understood the significance of his action. And many of them began to cast occasional glances in the direction of the Vile-Prince and Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Bai Xiaochun, he was now feeling more convinced than ever that this was no banquet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No matter what he has planned, I just have to play along…. I refuse to believe that I can commit some sort of capital offense while simply enjoying some alcohol!” Snorting coldly in his heart, he kept a calm expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point the Vile-Prince rose to his feet, eyes narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said with a smile, “I think it’s safe to assume that most of you have at least heard of the new ambassador from the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, King Heavenspan, Bai Xiaochun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun raised his glass of alcohol as protocol required, a faint smile visible on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks to my profound love for my father the emperor, I have been tasked with presiding over today’s festivities. Therefore, the first thing I would like to do is give Ambassador Bai a chance to enjoy his first Vile-Emperor Dynasty banquet.” Everyone looked on as the Vile-Prince gave his little speech, all of them looking very pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ambassador Bai, worry about the alcohol later. Please, take a moment to enjoy a special kind of dance that has become something of a tradition in recent years.” Glancing at Bai Xiaochun out of the corner of his eyes, he began to clap in very soft fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin moment, soft footfalls could be heard as two groups of women entered from either side of the hall. All of them were beautiful and lithesome. However, there was something awkward about the way they moved, as if they were marionettes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdd smiles could be seen on their faces. Strangely, each and every smile seemed exactly the same, down to the slightest twist of the lip!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who saw such smiles would find them to be completely bizarre. However what was even more shocking was their expressions. Within their eyes could be seen profound entreaty, and even despair….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were not female cultivators! Clearly… these were \u003cem\u003eformer\u003c/em\u003e female cultivators who had been transformed into corpse puppets!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet… their souls had been ensnared within them, giving expression to their eyes. They were not like the walking dead, but rather, were being controlled by external forces. And as soon as they reached the center of the hall, they began to perform a graceful dance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people might not find it too surprising of a situation. However as soon as Bai Xiaochun laid eyes on the spectacle, his mind began to spin, and he even began to tremble visibly. Within moments, his eyes were completely bloodshot!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was because… these women were all cultivators from the Heavenspan Realm!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, two of them had been disciples in the River-Defying Sect who had written love letters to him!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, the Vile-Prince looked over at Bai Xiaochun and said, “Ambassador Bai, don’t you just love this opening dance that we’ve come to enjoy before banquets in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty?”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes of the many celestials and demigods in the room were all focused dead on Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was struggling to remain calm. Clearly, the Vile-Prince had set this all up on purpose to provoke him. The celestials were watching him with coldly flickering eyes, and even the Vile-Emperor sat there without saying a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he did something rash here, then it would give them a perfect excuse to claim that he was trying to assassinate the emperor, and then possibly execute him as a result!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1173\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1175\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1174","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM"}
