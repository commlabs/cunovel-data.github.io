The old man is awful mean. If he had treated me right, I shouldn’t have had to help myself; that’s certain.” \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Joshua congratulated himself that, though he now possessed a hundred-dollar gold watch and chain, purchased at less than half price, he still had left considerably more than five hundred dollars. When he purchased the watch, his first thought was to sell it almost immediately, and so realize something by the speculation. But, being well provided with money, he decided, on the whole, to keep it, for the present, at least, and not to sell unless he should stand in need of money. That would not probably be for a long time, as five hundred dollars seemed quite a fortune to him. Besides, in a short time, probably, he would get a place, with a salary large enough to pay his expenses.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Joshua wandered about the park a short time, but returned to his boarding house in time for lunch. Here he met Sam Crawford.

If any money was to be spent, he wanted to have something to do with it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I didn’t buy it at any jeweler’s,” answered Joshua. “If I had, I couldn’t have got it so cheap.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Didn’t buy it at a jeweler’s!” repeated Sam, suspiciously. “Where did you buy it, then?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I bought it of a man I met in Central Park.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A man you knew?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; a stranger--a man from the country.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let me see the watch,” said Sam, abruptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took it in his hands, and looked at it, but, not being a professional, he could not tell whether it was genuine or not.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shouldn’t wonder if you had got swindled,” he said, handing it back. “How much did you pay for it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Forty dollars. The man said it was worth a hundred,” said Joshua, beginning to feel uncomfortable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course, he would say so,” returned Sam, contemptuously. “They always do. What made him sell it to you so cheap, then?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He found it in the park, and had to go out of the city very soon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sam shook his head.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You ought not to have bought a watch without my being with you.

Forty dollars was a good deal to lose. Besides, it was, or would be, mortifying to feel that he had been swindled. The watch and chain looked all right. He could not help thinking that it was gold, after all.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When lunch was over, he went out with Sam. Two blocks distant, there was a small jeweler’s shop.

The works are good for nothing. It won’t keep good time.

I shouldn’t get swindled easily. I’ve been in the city too long. I know the ropes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You had your pocket picked last evening,” said Joshua.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That’s true,” Sam was forced to answer--though it was not true. “I was talking with you, and that made me careless. But I shouldn’t be cheated on a bargain. How much did you give for the watch? Forty dollars?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” answered Joshua, wincing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then it’s forty dollars thrown away, for the watch won’t go, and it will never do you any good.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should like to sell it for as much as I gave,” said Joshua, not very honestly. “I might go out to Central Park this afternoon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You wouldn’t catch a greenhorn every day that would let himself be taken in as you were.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you call me a greenhorn?” added Joshua, angrily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course, you’re a little green,” said Sam. “I was myself, at first,” he added, in a conciliatory manner. “But you’ll soon get over it. Only don’t buy anything of importance unless I am with you. That will be your safest way for the present.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Joshua did not reply, but he reluctantly decided that perhaps he would do better to follow Sam’s advice. Evidently, the city was full of snares and swindlers of which he had no idea, and it wouldn’t do for him to lose forty dollars very often. He felt unhappy whenever he thought of his loss. He had been in the city only twenty-four hours, yet it had cost him in the neighborhood of fifty dollars. He decided henceforth to beware of plausible strangers, especially if they professed to hail from the country.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We must now return to Stapleton, where Mr. Drummond was still nursing his indignation at the audacity of his son, whom he had never supposed daring enough to rob his strong box.
