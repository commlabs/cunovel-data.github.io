Oliver had offered to pick her up in his car to take her to the first day back at school. Schuyler, who would usually resist such a gesture since she lived across town and out of the way, had meekly agreed to such an arrangement. Oliver was her Conduit--he was supposed to take care of her, and for once, she was going to let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spring semester at Duschene was officially opened by an assembly, in which the Headmistress welcomed all the students back for another exciting term, followed by a tea of currant scones and hot chocolate in the belvedere. Oliver and Schuyler found their usual seats in the back pew of the chapel with the other sophomores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a lot of cheerful greeting and exchanging of vacation stories all around. Most of the girls looked tan and rested, trading cell phones to show pictures of themselves in bikinis on the beaches of the Bahamas, St. Thomas, or Maui. Schuyler saw Bliss Llewellyn walk in with Mimi Force, the two of them with their arms linked around each other\u0027s waists as if they were the closest of friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi\u0027s hair had been made even lighter by the sun, and Bliss sported a few copper highlights of her own. Jack Force walked slowly behind them, hands jammed in the pockets of his Duckhead chinos. He had a bit of a ski-mask tan around his eyes, which only made him look more adorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver noticed where Schuyler was looking and didn\u0027t comment. She knew how he felt about her crush on Jack Force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensing her friend\u0027s pique, Schuyler leaned down and rested her head affectionately on his shoulder. If it hadn\u0027t been for Oliver...she might have...what? Passed out forever? Joined her mother in the comatose room uptown? She was still having trouble understanding everything. What did it mean that her vampire cells were fighting her human cells? Would she always be torn in two directions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunger she had felt in Venice had abated somewhat with the transfusion. Maybe that was all it was. She had needed blood. Maybe she could just get transfusions instead of having to feed. She would have to ask Dr. Pat if that was a viable alternative. It was just too weird to always look at Oliver and think he\u0027d taste delicious. He was her best friend, not a snack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss Llewellyn looked around and met Schuyler\u0027s eye. The two girls waved shyly to each other. Bliss had been meaning to tell Schuyler about Dylan\u0027s return, to have the conversation she had started at the ball, but somehow the opportunity never seemed to come up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe holidays had been an anxious time for Bliss. The blackouts and nightmares had returned in full force. Christmas Eve had been the worst night yet. She had woken up with a pain in her chest so excruciating that she couldn\u0027t breathe. She was drenched in sweat and the bedsheets were so wet they were pasted together. Gross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven more terrifying, the beast of her nightmares had begun to speak to her in her sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlissssss...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlissssss...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlissssss...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only said her name, and yet it sent shivers down her spine. It was just a dream. Just a dream. Just a dream. There was no beast who could hurt her. It was just part of the trans- formation. Her memories waking up and talking to her, that\u0027s what The Committee said. Her former selves, her past lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clenched her jaw and sat up straighter in her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to her, Mimi Force yawned into her delicate palm. For Mimi, the two weeks off had been nothing short of heaven. She had picked up not one but two yummy human familiars on the trip, had had her fill of them, and felt like she could conquer the world. She was eager to start the new semester. A new season always meant another excuse to go shopping. Like Bliss, Mimi was anxious, too. Anxious to get to Barneys today before it closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss forced herself to pay attention to the Headmistress\u0027s semiannual pep talk--Another semester of excellence awaits you in the halls of Duchesne, blah blah blah-- when the chapel doors flew open with a bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeads swiveled to look at what had caused the commotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boy stood at the threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA very, very handsome boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, er, sorry. Didn\u0027t mean to do that. Slip of the fingers, eh?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, it\u0027s okay. Come on in, Kingsley. You can have a seat up here in front,\" the Headmistress said, waving him forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy grinned. He swaggered down the aisle, his walk a rolling, slouching gait. His black hair gleaming, a forelock saucily slanting over his left eye, he exuded a cocky confidence to go along with his model-perfect good looks. He wore a loose white oxford shirt and tight black jeans, as if he had just stepped off of a CD cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike all of the girls assembled, Bliss couldn\u0027t take her eyes off him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though he could feel her stare, he turned around and looked at her directly in the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd winked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-18.html","bookId":2120,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM"}
