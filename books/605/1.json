{"id":32113,"no":1,"title":"PREFACE","content":"\u0026nbsp;My endeavor has been to tell a simple story, preserving as closely as possible the spirit and feeling of the original. I have tried, as it were, to take the play to pieces, and build a novel out of the same material. I have not felt at liberty to embellish M. Brieuxâ€™s ideas, and I have used his dialogue word for word wherever possible. Unless I have mis-read the author, his sole purpose in writing LES AVARIES was to place a number of most important facts before the minds of the public, and to drive them home by means of intense emotion. If I have been able to assist him, this bit of literary carpentering will be worth while. I have to thank M. Brieux for his kind permission to make the attempt, and for the cordial spirit which he has manifested. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Upton Sinclair\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3249/89031.html","bookId":605,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:54:31 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:54:31 AM"}
