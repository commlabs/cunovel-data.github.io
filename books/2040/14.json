While waiting for my appointment, I\u0027d checked in once with the Thorn Land, only to find the whole experience frustrating. Though no one openly said it - well, except for Jasmine - they all thought me breaking up with Dorian was the worst idea ever. I also learned from Shaya that arrangements for a war meeting were getting bogged down. Dorian insisted all three monarchs meet in person. Katrice wanted to send her nephew. There was also the matter of which kingdom would host because several others wanted to, most likely in the hopes of getting in good with one or all of us. I told Shaya I didn\u0027t care about the details and to simply do whatever it took to finish this war quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kiyo and I reached Enrique\u0027s address, we found it was in a small, sad-looking office building in one of the more rundown areas of downtown Tucson. I eyed it askance as we stood outside and waited for him to buzz us up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get why it took us three days to get in,\" I said. \"It doesn\u0027t really seem like he\u0027s got that much business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door buzzed, and Kiyo opened it. \"Maybe it\u0027s a cover,\" he said. We walked up to the second floor, where Enrique\u0027s office was located. \"Maybe he wants to hide how successful he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped when the office door opened before we knocked. Even with Enrique standing in the doorway, I could see beautiful, expensive furnishings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll be damned,\" I muttered, entering at Enrique\u0027s gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shorter than me, with deeply tanned skin and black hair starting to gray. I put him somewhere in his mid to late forties. His attire didn\u0027t quite match the office\u0027s opulence. In fact, it looked like stereotypical P.I. clothing from some old detective noir film, complete with a fedora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Markham\u0027s girl, huh?\" he asked, voice laced with a faint Spanish accent. His eyes fell on Kiyo. \"And a bodyguard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend,\" I said sharply. \"I don\u0027t need a bodyguard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" Enrique didn\u0027t sound like he believed that. He pointed us to some plush leather chairs while he sat in an even bigger one across from us. A huge cherry desk was situated between us. It gleamed deep red in the late afternoon light and didn\u0027t look like the kind of thing you\u0027d find at IKEA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared around at the rest of the office, still amazed at how it contrasted with the exterior. Books - ranging widely from Moby Dick to Arizona state law - lined shelves that matched the desk, and small pieces of art - paintings, statues, et cetera - adorned the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" began Enrique. \"What\u0027s his name, and why do you think he\u0027s cheating on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - huh?\" I jerked my head from a sculpture that looked like some Mayan god and stared at Enrique in astonishment. \"What are you talking about? Is that what Roland told you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he didn\u0027t tell me anything. I just figured that\u0027s why you were here. That\u0027s usually what women come in for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo made a small sound beside me that I think was a laugh. \"That\u0027s ridiculous,\" I exclaimed, unsure if I should be offended or not. \"I need you to investigate a murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnrique arched an eyebrow. \"That\u0027s what the police are for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They already investigated it. And actually, they declared it a suicide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you need me because ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t think it was,\" I said. \"I think it was a murder and that the victim\u0027s family might be in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnrique made no attempt to hide his skepticism. \"Do you have any evidence to support this ... theory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, hoping Roland had been right about this guy. \"The victim\u0027s, um, ghost said she didn\u0027t kill herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her ghost,\" he repeated. As though on cue, Deanna materialized in the room, though Enrique couldn\u0027t see her. Kiyo and I could with our Otherworldly senses, but neither of us gave any indication of her arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Roland said you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah,\" said Enrique. \"I know about that hocus pocus he deals with. I\u0027m also guessing suicide might be so traumatic that afterward, maybe a ghost blocked out what she actually did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true!\" exclaimed Deanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI supposed it wasn\u0027t out of the realm of possibility, but I\u0027d explore all other options first. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the case. I think she really was murdered. If that\u0027s true, we need to make sure no one else in her family gets hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she was murdered,\" countered Enrique, \"then statistics say someone in her family probably did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true either!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored Deanna\u0027s second outburst and stayed fixed on Enrique. \"Well, one way or another, I need to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back in his chair, putting his feet up on his desk and crossing his arms behind his head. If he\u0027d called me \u0027dame,\u0027 I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised. \"The police take all this into consideration, you know. What makes you think I\u0027d find something they haven\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought guys like you were smarter than the police,\" said Kiyo. \"Figured you had connections and channels above the law. That you didn\u0027t play by the same rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true,\" said Enrique, seeming pleased at the compliment. I swore, he was also taking Kiyo more seriously than me. \"I can look into it, I suppose. But it\u0027s not like I\u0027ll do it for free, just because you\u0027re cute.\" That was directed back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI repressed a scowl. \"I didn\u0027t expect you to. I can pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered this and finally gave a nod, straightening back up in his chair. \"Okay. Tell me what you know, and I\u0027ll get to it when I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What!\" cried Deanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is kind of time sensitive,\" I said. Mostly because I wasn\u0027t sure how much more of Deanna I could handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnrique gestured to a stack of folders on a table. \"So are these. I\u0027m drowning in paperwork. Can\u0027t keep half of these straight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll pay for you to expedite it,\" said Kiyo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a look of astonishment, not thrilled that he\u0027d speak for me - especially considering my income was lower than it used to be. Nonetheless, it got Enrique\u0027s attention. \"Expediting it is, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him all the details I\u0027d recently learned from Deanna, and to his credit, Enrique diligently wrote them all down and asked pertinent questions that reaffirmed my faith in his legitimacy. The price he named didn\u0027t cheer me up as much, but there was nothing to be done for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kiyo and I finally got up to leave, I couldn\u0027t resist asking the obvious. \"You seem to be doing pretty well ... so why\u0027s your office in a dump like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnrique didn\u0027t look offended so much as scornful that I\u0027d ask such a ridiculous question. \"Do you know how much office rent is lately? I\u0027m saving tons of money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should put that surplus toward a secretary instead of statues,\" I pointed out, nodding toward the tower of folders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t trust anyone,\" he said bluntly. \"Especially when ghost clients show up.\" He opened the door. \"I\u0027ll be in touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charming,\" I said, once Kiyo and I were on the road again. \"The only thing I\u0027m convinced that guy can do is help in the regression of women\u0027s rights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo tried to hide a smile and failed. \"He was right about you being cute, though. And I don\u0027t know ... something tells me that despite the attitude, he\u0027s pretty competent. Crappy building aside, he couldn\u0027t afford that office if he wasn\u0027t achieving results. Besides, Roland wouldn\u0027t recommend anyone incompetent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless he was trying to sabotage me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo\u0027s smile faded. \"Do you really think he\u0027d do that to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared out the passenger seat window. \"No. He wouldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, you know. I really am. About Roland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk about it,\" I said. My mood plummeted each time Roland\u0027s name came up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then. You want to salvage this \u0027date\u0027 and get some lunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have faith in the change of subject. I didn\u0027t think anything could really distract me, certainly not the crappy Mexican restaurant Kiyo took us to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious?\" I asked. Felipe\u0027s Fiestaland was the cheesiest restaurant in town, figuratively speaking. In a place like Tucson, where you could get amazingly authentic Southwestern cuisine, Felipe\u0027s was for tourists and suburbanites who didn\u0027t know any better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you saying a margarita wouldn\u0027t do you good?\" he asked, getting out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would never say that. But there are better places with better margaritas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They still use tequila in theirs. Isn\u0027t that what really matters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were greeted by a hostess who sounded like she\u0027d taken one semester of Spanish in high school. Pi\u0026amp;ntilde;atas hung from the ceiling, and bad mariachi music blasted from speakers. I scanned the drink menu as soon as we sat down and was ready when the waiter came by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have your Double Platinum Extra Premium Margarita,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grande or super grande?\" asked the waiter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Super.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo looked impressed. \"I\u0027ll have the same.\" When we were alone, he asked, \"What is that exactly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI propped an elbow on the table, resting my chin on my palm. \"I\u0027m not sure, but it sounded like it had the most alcohol in it. Places like this tend to drown their drinks in mixers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spoken like a pro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stating the obvious. You and I both know Roza\u0027s has the best margaritas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo smiled at that, flashing me a warm and knowing look. I had a feeling he was thinking about a memory that had come to me too, back from when we\u0027d dated. We\u0027d gone out to Roza\u0027s - which really did have the best margaritas in town - and gotten so drunk that neither of us could drive home. So, we\u0027d used the car for the only thing we could: sex. Twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drinks arrived and were about the size of fishbowls. They were also about half-mixer, as suspected, but at least that still left a reasonable quantity of alcohol. I drank mine down quickly as we waited for our food. Alcohol numbed my shamanic powers a little bit and sometimes let me forget my problems. Not so much today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think Enrique might be right?\" I asked. \"That Deanna did commit suicide and blocked it out?\" The ghost had left us once we departed from the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know if she\u0027d believe it, even if he turned up a film or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced and downed more of the drink. \"I hope not. It\u0027s nothing I\u0027d want to watch. I\u0027m tired of bloodshed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said gently. \"And no matter what I said before ... and how upset I was when this war started ... well, I have to admit. You\u0027ve handled it as best you could. Word gets around. I know you\u0027ve made some tactical moves that minimized casualties - and not just for your own people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Tactical.\u0027 \u0027Casualties.\u0027\" I shook my head, eyeing my low margarita. \"Those are terms I never thought I\u0027d use. And really, I don\u0027t have much to do with that planning. Rurik does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you give the okay,\" Kiyo pointed out. \"Not many rulers would. Most would do whatever it took to crush their enemies quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve certainly wanted to.\" Dorian had as well, and the few disagreements we\u0027d had during our wartime partnership had been over civilian collateral damage. \"Can we talk about something not Otherworldly? And not about suicide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" Our waiter suddenly appeared with the plate of Mile High Muy Bueno Nachos we\u0027d ordered. Kiyo flashed him a grin. \"She\u0027ll have another margarita. Also, it\u0027s her birthday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot Kiyo a look of horror as the waiter scurried off. \"Are you out of your mind? You don\u0027t say something like that in a place like this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was too late. Because in a matter of minutes, the entire waitstaff of Felipe\u0027s Fiestaland had surrounded our table. Someone put a sombrero on my head and a candlelit piece of flan in front of me. The whole group then launched into an out-of-tune rendition of \"Cumplea\u0026amp;ntilde;os Feliz,\" set to equally bad out-of-rhythm clapping. I stared at Kiyo the whole time and mouthed I will kill you. It only made his smile grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t look a day older,\" he told me, once the mob had dispersed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you did that.\" I jerked off the sombrero and dove into the new margarita. \"Do you know how humiliating that is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, it got your mind off everything else, didn\u0027t it? Plus, check it out. Free flan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blew out the candle and hesitantly poked the gelatinous mass below it. \"It looks like it\u0027s been sitting around a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" he said, dragging the plate over to his side of the table. \"With all the preservatives in it, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get you back for this,\" I warned, narrowing my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look he gave me was knowing. \"I hope so,\" he said. \"I certainly hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can only blame the margaritas for what happened next, because as soon as we\u0027d paid our bill and were back in the car, we attacked each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" he said, trying to pull my shirt over my head. \"Who needs Roza\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was dark out then,\" I reminded him, my own hands fumbling for his pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in the back of the lot,\" he argued. \"And the sun\u0027s going down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a point, and when he brought one of my nipples to his mouth, I kind of let the subject drop. We really were out of sight, and there were more important matters to take care of. We reclined and pushed the seat back as far as it would go, then finally managed to get each other\u0027s jeans off. I brought my hips down, taking him into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" I gasped. \"You\u0027re sorry now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very,\" he managed to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur awkward positioning kept my breasts pretty close to his face, and he was taking advantage of it with his hands and mouth. As for me, I was just thrilled at the feel of being on top of him. After always playing submissive with Dorian, I suddenly exalted in this sense of power - especially since Kiyo had definitely been the one in control the last time we had sex. Now, it was all me, and I took a fair amount of satisfaction in taunting him, alternately increasing the speed of my movement and then slowing down when he got close to coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie,\" he begged at last. \"Enough. Please ... do it....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned toward him like I might kiss him - and then pulled back when his lips sought mine. With a grin, I straightened up as much as I could and rode him hard, finally letting him have the release he\u0027d begged for. His body bucked up as he came, his hands holding tightly to my hips as though I might leave before he finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, I guess we were kind of dating again. The next week or so passed in an easy pattern. I saw Kiyo almost every day, and we slipped back into our old routines. I started taking more jobs, much to Lara\u0027s relief, while Kiyo alternately worked at the vet clinic and checked in with the Otherworld. At night, he and I were always together, either at my place or his. My body began to remember what it was like being in a relationship, and slowly, my heart did as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only crossed into the Otherworld once during that time, both from Thorn Land withdrawal and curiosity over the war proceedings. No progress was being made with Katrice. I was grateful for the lack of fighting, but the hoped-for peace talks still seemed a ways off. It was frustrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s being difficult,\" said Shaya, when I asked about it. Understandably, she looked weary. \"These are delicate matters. They take time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left it at that, feeling impatient, but figuring she knew better than me. Back in Tucson, I also got sporadic updates of another sort: Enrique\u0027s. To his credit, he called almost every day to report what he\u0027d done or investigated. At first his attitude remained the same, full of that cockiness and irritability that said this was a waste of his time. Then, one day, things changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" he said. \"You might be right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure who was more surprised by this: him or me. I\u0027d honestly started to believe he wouldn\u0027t turn up anything at all as evidence of either a suicide or a murder. I gripped the phone tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? That someone killed her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah ... I found a couple things. Did you know her husband has a girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deanna told me. She seemed okay with his moving on.\" It had been a few months since her death, too soon to start dating in my book, but still a semi-respectable time frame. According to Deanna, he\u0027d begun seeing someone a few weeks ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, he moved on before she was dead. The girlfriend? His alibi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"Seriously?\" Deanna\u0027s husband had been removed from suspicion because he\u0027d had a solid witness to his whereabouts when she\u0027d been killed. He\u0027d been at a real estate agent\u0027s office; the agent was helping him with a vacation home for their family. \"Maybe their relationship started after Deanna died ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if a witness I found is reliable. I also might have a lead that proves Deanna wasn\u0027t the one who bought the gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s true ...\" I couldn\u0027t finish right away. Deanna acquiring the gun that had killed her had been one of the most damning pieces of evidence for suicide. \"If you can prove that, then it could reopen everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Enrique matter-of-factly. \"Yes, it could. I\u0027ll be in touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe disconnected, and I suddenly wished he hadn\u0027t been quite so good at his job. If he was right about all this and turned up the evidence he needed ... well, someone was going to have to break the news to Deanna that her husband had murdered her. And that someone would be me. She currently believed some crazed killer had done it, one that was after her family now. The thought of it all sickened me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I sat there in my room, an Otherworldly presence made my skin tingle. For half a second, I thought Deanna was appearing unsummoned - something I wasn\u0027t ready to deal with. I\u0027d essentially given her a \"don\u0027t call me, I\u0027ll call you\" directive. But, no. It wasn\u0027t her. It was Volusian, his red eyes as malevolent as always. Lately, his appearance meant news from the Otherworld. I hoped it would be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shaya requests your presence immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething good at last. \"The peace talks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She needs you because the Oak King is at your castle, demanding to see you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-14.html","bookId":2040,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:36:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:36:59 PM"}
