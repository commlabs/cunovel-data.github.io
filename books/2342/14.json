He shaved and showered. He was halfway through the Bureau\u0027s bottle of shampoo. He dressed standing next to the bed. Took his coat from the closet and put it on. Ducked back into the bathroom and clipped his toothbrush into the inside pocket. Just in case today was the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on the bed with the coat wrapped around him against the cold and waited for Harper. But when the key went into the lock and the door opened, it wasn\u0027t Harper standing there. It was Poulton. He was keeping his face deliberately blank, and Reacher felt the first stirrings of triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Harper?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Off the case,\" Poulton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she talk to Blake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoulton shrugged. \"And nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re ignoring my input?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not here for input.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"OK. Ready for breakfast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoulton nodded back. \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was coming up in the east and sending color into the sky. There was no cloud. No damp. No wind. It was a pleasant walk through the early gloom. The place felt busy again. Monday morning, the start of a new week. Blake was at the usual table in the cafeteria, over by the window. Lamarr was sitting with him. She was wearing a black blouse in place of her customary cream. It was slightly faded, like it had been washed many times. There was coffee on the table, and mugs, and milk and sugar, and doughnuts. But no newspapers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was sorry to hear the news from Spokane,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLamarr nodded, silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I offered her time off,\" Blake said. \"She\u0027s entitled to compassionate leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher looked at him. \"You don\u0027t need to explain yourself to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the midst of life is death,\" Lamarr said. \"That\u0027s something you learn pretty quickly around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to the funeral?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLamarr took a teaspoon and balanced it across her forefinger. Stared down at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alison hasn\u0027t called me,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know what the arrangements are going to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t call her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I\u0027d feel like I was intruding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think Alison would agree with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked straight at him. \"But I just don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence. Reacher turned a mug over and poured coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to get to work,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t like my theory?\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a guess, not a theory,\" Blake said back. \"We can all guess, as much as we want to. But we can\u0027t turn our backs on eighty women just because we enjoy guessing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would they notice the difference?\" Reacher asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a long sip of coffee and looked at the doughnuts. They were wrinkled and hard. Probably Saturday\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re not going to pay attention?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake shrugged. \"I gave it some consideration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, give it some more. Because the next woman to die will be one of the eleven I marked, and it\u0027ll be on your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake said nothing and Reacher pushed his chair back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want pancakes,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t like the look of those doughnuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up before they could object and stepped away toward the center of the room. Stopped at the first table with a New York Times on it. It belonged to a guy on his own. He was reading the sports. The front section was discarded to his left. Reacher picked it up. The story he was waiting for was right there, front page, below the fold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I borrow this?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy with the interest in sports nodded without looking. Reacher tucked the paper under his arm and walked to the serving counter. Breakfast was set out like a buffet. He helped himself to a stack of pancakes and eight rashers of bacon. Added syrup until the plate was swimming. He was going to need the nutrition. He had a long journey ahead, and he was probably going to be walking the first part of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came back to the table and squatted awkwardly to get the plate down without spilling the syrup or dropping the newspaper. He propped the paper in front of his plate and started to eat. Then he pretended to notice the headline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, look at that,\" he said, with his mouth full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe headline read Gang Warfare Explodes in Lower Manhattan, Leaves Six Dead. The story recounted a brief and deadly turf war between two rival protection rackets, one of them allegedly Chinese, the other allegedly Syrian. Automatic firearms and machetes had been used. The body count ran four to two in favor of the Chinese. Among the four dead on the Syrian side was the alleged gang leader, a suspected felon named Almar Petrosian. There were quotes from the NYPD and the FBI, and background reporting about the hundred-year history of protection rackets in New York City, the Chinese tongs, the jockeying between different ethnic groups for their business, which reputedly ran to billions of dollars nationwide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, look at that,\" Reacher said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had already looked at it. That was clear. They were all turned away from him. Blake was staring through the window at the streaks of dawn in the sky. Poulton had his eyes fixed on the back wall. Lamarr was still studying her teaspoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cozo call you to confirm it?\" Reacher asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody said a thing, which was the same as a yes. Reacher smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Life\u0027s a bitch, right?\" he said. \"You get a hook into me, and suddenly the hook isn\u0027t there anymore. Fate\u0027s a funny thing, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fate,\" Blake repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So let me get this straight,\" Reacher said. \"Harper wouldn\u0027t play ball with the femme fatale thing, and now old Petrosian is dead, so you got no more cards to play. And you\u0027re not listening to a word I say anyway, so is there a reason why I shouldn\u0027t walk right out of here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of reasons,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of them good enough,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up and stepped away from the table again. Nobody tried to stop him. He walked out of the cafeteria and out through the glass doors into the chill of dawn. Started walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHE WALKED ALL the way out to the guardhouse on the perimeter. Ducked under the barrier and dropped his visitor\u0027s pass on the road. Walked on and turned the corner and entered Marine territory. He kept to the middle of the pavement and reached the first clearing after a half-mile. There was a cluster of vehicles and a number of quiet, watchful men. They let him go on. Walking was unusual, but not illegal. He reached the second clearing thirty minutes after leaving the cafeteria. He walked through it and kept on going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the car behind him five minutes later. He stopped and turned and waited for it. It came near enough for him to see past the dazzle of its running lights. It was Harper, which is what he had expected. She was alone. She drew level with him and buzzed her window down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Reacher,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. Said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want a ride?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out or back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wherever you decide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-95 on-ramp will do it. Going north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hitchhiking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I\u0027ve got no money for a plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid in next to her and she accelerated gently away, heading out. She was in her second suit and her hair was loose. It spilled all over her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They tell you to bring me back?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"They decided you\u0027re useless. Nothing to contribute, is what they said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"So now I\u0027m supposed to get all boiled up with indignation and storm back in there and prove them wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled back. \"Something like that. They spent ten minutes discussing the best approach. Lamarr decided they should appeal to your ego.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what happens when you\u0027re a psychologist who studied landscape gardening in school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drove on, through the wooded curves, past the last Marine clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she\u0027s right,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got nothing to contribute. Nobody\u0027s going to catch this guy. He\u0027s too smart. Too smart for me, that\u0027s for damn sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled again. \"A little psychology of your own? Trying to leave with a clear conscience?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"My conscience is always clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it clear about Petrosian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why shouldn\u0027t it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell of a coincidence, don\u0027t you think? They threaten you with Petrosian, and he\u0027s dead within three days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just dumb luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, luck. You know I didn\u0027t tell them I was outside Trent\u0027s office all day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was covering my ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her. \"And what\u0027s Trent\u0027s office got to do with anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. But I don\u0027t like coincidences. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They happen, time to time. Obviously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody in the Bureau likes coincidences.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged again. \"So they could, you know, dig around. Might make it hard for you, later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled again. \"This is phase two of the approach, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled back, and then the smile exploded into a laugh. \"Yeah, phase two. There are about a dozen still to go. Some of them are real good. You want to hear them all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. I\u0027m not going back. They\u0027re not listening. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and drove on. Paused before the junction with the interstate, and then swooped north up the ramp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take you to the next one,\" she said. \"Nobody uses this one except Bureau people. And none of them is going to give you a ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Thanks, Harper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jodie\u0027s home,\" she said. \"I called Cozo\u0027s office. Apparently they had a little surveillance going. She\u0027s been away. She got back this morning, in a taxi. Looked like she\u0027d come from the airport. Looks like she\u0027s working from home today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"OK, so now I\u0027m definitely out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need your input, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not listening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to make them listen,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is phase three?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, this is me. I mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent for a long moment. Then he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why won\u0027t they listen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pride, maybe?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They need somebody\u0027s input,\" he said. \"That\u0027s for sure. But not mine. I don\u0027t have the resources. And I don\u0027t have the authority.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To do what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To take it out of their hands. They\u0027re wasting their time with this profiling shit. It won\u0027t get them anywhere. They need to work the clues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There aren\u0027t any clues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, there are. How smart the guy is. And the paint, and the geography, and how quiet the scenes are. They\u0027re all clues. They should work them. They\u0027ve got to mean something. Starting with the motive is starting at the wrong end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pass that on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled off the highway and stopped at the cross street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You going to get into trouble?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For failing to bring you back?\" she said. \"Probably. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent. She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was phase ten,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll be perfectly OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so,\" he said, and got out of the car. He walked north across the street to the ramp and stood all alone and watched her car slide under the bridge and turn back south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA MALE HITCHHIKER standing six feet five and weighing two hundred and thirty pounds is on the cusp of acceptability for easy rides. Generally, women won\u0027t stop for him, because they see a threat. Men can be just as nervous. But Reacher was showered and shaved and clean, and dressed quietly. That shortened the odds, and there were enough trucks on the road with big confident owner-drivers that he was back in New York City within seven hours of starting out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quiet most of the seven hours, partly because the trucks were too noisy for conversation, and partly because he wasn\u0027t in the mood for talking. The old hobo demon was whispering to him again. Where are you going? Back to Jodie, of course. OK, smart guy, but what else? What the hell else? Yardwork behind your house? Painting the damn walls? He sat next to a succession of kindly drivers and felt his brief unsatisfactory excursion into freedom ebb away. He worked on forgetting about it, and felt he succeeded. His final ride was from a New Jersey vegetable truck delivering to Greenwich Village. It rumbled in through the Holland Tunnel. He got out and walked the last mile on Canal and Broadway, all the way down to Jodie\u0027s apartment house, concentrating hard on his desire to see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had his own key to her lobby, and he went up in the elevator and knocked on her door. The peephole went dark and light again and the door opened and she was standing there, in jeans and a shirt, tall and slim and vital. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. But she wasn\u0027t smiling at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Jodie,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s an FBI agent in my kitchen.\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she repeated. \"You tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed her into the apartment, through to the kitchen. The Bureau guy was a short young man with a wide neck. Blue suit, white shirt, striped tie. He was holding a cell phone up to his face, reporting Reacher\u0027s arrival to somebody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" Reacher asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to wait here, sir,\" the guy said. \"About ten minutes, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll find out, sir. Ten minutes, is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher felt like walking out, just to be contrary, but Jodie sat down. There was something in her face. Something halfway between concern and annoyance. The New York Times was open on the countertop. Reacher glanced at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" he said. \"Ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down, too. They waited in silence. It was nearer fifteen minutes than ten. Then the buzzer from the street sounded and the Bureau guy went to answer it. He clicked the door release and moved out to the hallway. Jodie sat still and passive, like a guest in her own apartment. Reacher heard the whine of the elevator. He heard it stop. He heard the apartment door open. He heard footsteps on the maple floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Deerfield walked into the kitchen. He was in a dark raincoat with the collar turned up. He was moving energetically and he had sidewalk grit on the soles of his shoes and it made him loud and invasive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got six people dead in my city,\" he said. He saw the Times on the counter and walked over and folded it back to reveal the headline. \"So I got a couple questions, naturally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher looked at him. \"What questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeerfield looked back. \"Delicate questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So ask them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeerfield nodded. \"First question is for Ms. Jacob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJodie stirred in her chair. Didn\u0027t look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the question?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been, the last few days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of town,\" she said. \"On business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where out of town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"London. Client conference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"London, England?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As opposed to what other Londons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeerfield shrugged. \"London, Kentucky? London, Ohio? There\u0027s a London somewhere in Canada too, I believe. Ontario, maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"London, England,\" Jodie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got clients in London, England?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJodie was still looking at the floor. \"We\u0027ve got clients everywhere. Especially in London, England.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeerfield nodded. \"You go by the Concorde?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up. \"Yes I did, as a matter of fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Real quick, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJodie nodded. \"Quick enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But expensive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But worth it for a partner on important business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJodie looked at him. \"I\u0027m not a partner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeerfield smiled. \"Even better, right? They put an associate on the Concorde, got to mean something. Must mean they like you. Must mean you\u0027ll be a partner real soon. If nothing comes along and gets in the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJodie said nothing in reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, London,\" Deerfield said. \"Reacher knew you were there, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No, I didn\u0027t tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scheduled trip?\" Deerfield asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJodie shook her head again. \"Last-minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Reacher didn\u0027t know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already told you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Deerfield said. \"Information is king, is what I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have to tell him where I go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeerfield smiled. \"I\u0027m not talking about what information you give Reacher. I\u0027m talking about what information I get out of a situation. Right now I\u0027m getting he didn\u0027t know where you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That should have worried him. And it did worry him. Right after he got to Quantico, he was trying to get you on the phone. Office, home, mobile. That night, same thing again. Calling, calling, calling, couldn\u0027t get you. A worried man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJodie glanced up at Reacher. Concern in her face, maybe a little apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have told him, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, that\u0027s up to you. I don\u0027t go around telling people how to conduct their relationships. But the interesting thing is, then he stops calling you. Suddenly he\u0027s not calling you anymore. Now why is that? Did he find out you were safe over there in London, England? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to reply, and then she stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take that for a no,\" Deerfield said. \"You were worried about Petrosian, so you told people in your office to clam up about where you were. So as far as Reacher knew, you were still right here in town. But he\u0027s suddenly not worried anymore. He doesn\u0027t know you\u0027re safe and sound in London, England, but maybe he does know you\u0027re safe and sound because of some other reason, such as maybe he knows Petrosian isn\u0027t going to be around for very much longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJodie\u0027s eyes were back on the floor again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a smart guy,\" Deerfield said. \"My guess is he whistled up some pal of his to set the cat among the pigeons up here in Chinatown, and then he sat back and waited for the tongs to do what they always do when somebody starts messing with them. And he figures he\u0027s safe. He knows we\u0027ll never find his busy little pal, and he figures those Chinese boys aren\u0027t going to tell us diddly, not in a million years, and he knows the exact moment old Petrosian is getting the good news with the machete, he\u0027s locked into a room down in Quantico. A smart guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJodie said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But a very confident guy,\" Deerfield said. \"He stopped calling you two days before Petrosian finally bought the farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence in the kitchen. Deerfield turned to Reacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I on the money?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shrugged. \"Why should anybody have been worrying about Petrosian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeerfield smiled again. \"Oh, sure, we can\u0027t talk about that. We\u0027ll never admit Blake said a word to you on that subject. But like I told Ms. Jacob, information is king. I just want to be a hundred percent sure what I\u0027m dealing with here. If you stirred it up, just tell me and maybe I\u0027ll pat you on the back for a job well done. But if by some chance it was a genuine dispute, we need to know about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why did you stop calling Ms. Jacob?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s everybody\u0027s business,\" Deerfield said. \"Certainly it\u0027s Ms. Jacob\u0027s business, right? And it\u0027s mine too. So tell me about it. And don\u0027t go thinking you\u0027re out of the woods yet, Reacher. Petrosian was a piece of shit for sure, but he\u0027s still a homicide, and we can crank up a pretty good motive for you anyway, based on what was witnessed by two credible witnesses the other night in the alley. We could call it a conspiracy with persons unknown. Careful preparation of the case, you could be inside two years, just waiting for the trial. Jury might let you go in the end, but then who really knows what a jury might do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said nothing. Jodie stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should leave now, Mr. Deerfield,\" she said. \"I\u0027m still his lawyer, and this is an inappropriate forum for this discussion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeerfield nodded slowly, and looked around the kitchen, like he was seeing it for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it sure is, Ms. Jacob,\" he said. \"So maybe we\u0027ll have to continue this discussion someplace more appropriate at some future time. Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week, maybe next year. Like Mr. Blake pointed out, we know where you both live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned on the spot, with the grit on his shoes loud in the silence. They heard him walk through the living room and they heard the apartment door open and slam shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you took Petrosian out,\" Jodie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never went near him,\" Reacher replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Save that stuff for the FBI, OK? You arranged it or provoked it or engineered it or whatever the correct phrase would be. You took him out, as surely as if you were standing right next to him with a gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I told you not to do that,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deerfield knows you did it,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t matter,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t you see that? He can try to prove it. And he\u0027s not kidding about the two years in jail. A suspicion of gang warfare? A thing like that, the courts will back him up all the way. Denial of bail, continuances, the prosecutors will really go to bat for him. It\u0027s not an empty threat. He owns you now. Like I told you he would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Lots of reasons. It needed doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would my father have agreed with you?\" Jodie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leon?\" Reacher said. He recalled the photographs in Cozo\u0027s packet. The photographs of Petrosian\u0027s handiwork. The dead women, displayed like centerfolds. Pieces missing, things inserted. \"Are you kidding? Leon would have agreed with me in a heartbeat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And would he have gone ahead and done what you did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Yes, he probably would. But look around you, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At everything. What do you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around. \"An apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"My apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I grow up here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where did I grow up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"All over the place, on Army bases, like I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Where did you first meet me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know where. Manila. On the base.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember that bungalow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"So do I. It was tiny, it stank, and it had cockroaches bigger than my hand. And you know what? That was the best place I ever lived as a kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was pointing at her briefcase. It was a leather pilot\u0027s case, stuffed with legal paper, parked against the wall just inside the kitchen door. \"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your briefcase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. Not a rifle, not a carbine, not a flame-thrower. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I live in a Manhattan apartment instead of base quarters, and I carry a briefcase instead of infantry weapons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I know you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But do you know why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you want to, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. Because I want to. It was a conscious choice. My choice. I grew up in the Army, just like you did, and I could have joined up if I\u0027d wanted to, just like you did. But I didn\u0027t want to. I wanted to go to college and law school instead. I wanted to join a big firm and make partner. And why was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I wanted to live in a world with rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plenty of rules in the Army,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wrong rules, Reacher. I wanted civilian rules. Civilized rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what are you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saying I left the military all those years ago and I don\u0027t want to be back in it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not back in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you make me feel that I am. Worse than the military. This thing with Petrosian? I don\u0027t want to be in a world with rules like that. You know I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what should I have done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have gotten into it in the first place. That night in the restaurant? You should have walked away and called the cops. That\u0027s what we do here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the civilized world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on her kitchen stool and leaned his forearms on her countertop. Spread his fingers wide and placed his palms down flat. The countertop was cold. It was some kind of granite, gray and shiny, milled to reveal tiny quartz speckles throughout its surface. The corners and angles were radiused into perfect quarter-circles. It was an inch thick, and probably very expensive. It was a civilized product. It belonged right there in a world where people agree to labor forty hours, or a hundred, or two hundred, and then exchange the remuneration they get for installations they hope will make their kitchens look nice, inside their expensive remodeled buildings high above Broadway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you stop calling me?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at his hands. They lay on the polished granite like the rough exposed roots of small trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured you were safe,\" he said. \"I figured you were hiding out someplace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You figured,\" she repeated. \"But you didn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assumed,\" he said. \"I was taking care of Petrosian, I assumed you were taking care of yourself. I figured we know each other well enough to trust assumptions like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like we were comrades,\" she said softly. \"In the same unit, a major and a captain maybe, in the middle of some tight dangerous mission, absolutely relying on each other to do our separate jobs properly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m not a captain. I\u0027m not in some unit. I\u0027m a lawyer. A lawyer, in New York, all alone and afraid, caught up in something I don\u0027t want to be caught up in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded again. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re not a major,\" she said. \"Not anymore. You\u0027re a civilian. You need to get that straight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. Said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s the big problem, right?\" she said. \"We\u0027ve both got the same problem. You\u0027re getting me caught up in something I don\u0027t want to be caught up in, and I\u0027m getting you caught up in something you don\u0027t want to be caught up in either. The civilized world. The house, the car, living somewhere, doing ordinary things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My fault, probably,\" she said. \"I wanted those things. God, did I want them. Makes it kind of hard for me to accept that maybe you don\u0027t want them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I know that. And I want you. You know that too. But do we want each other\u0027s lives?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hobo demon erupted in his head, cheering and screaming like a fan watching the winning run soar into the bleachers, bottom of the ninth. She said it! She said it! Now it\u0027s right there, out in the open! So go for it! Jump on it! Just gobble it right up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to talk about it,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no more talking to be done, not then, because the buzzer from the lobby started up an insistent squawk, like somebody was down there on the street leaning on the button. Jodie stood up and hit the door release and moved into the living room to wait. Reacher stayed on his stool at the granite counter, looking at the quartz sparkles showing between his fingers. Then he felt the elevator arrive and heard the apartment door open. He heard urgent conversation and fast light footsteps through the living room and then Jodie was back in the kitchen with Lisa Harper standing at her side. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/running-blind-jack-reacher-4/page-14.html","bookId":2342,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:26 AM"}
