Some Earth-people consider it a term of derision and resent it when a Lunarite uses it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean when a Lunie uses it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene flushed. She said, \"Yes. That\u0027s about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, let\u0027s neither of us cry out at words. Go ahead, you were telling me about your job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On my job, there are these Earthies whom I have to keep from killing themselves and whom I have to take here and there and give little speeches to and make sure they eat and drink and walk by the book. They see their little pet sights and do their little pet things, and I have to be terribly polite and motherly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Awful,\" said the Earthman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you and I can do as we please, I hope, and you are willing to take your chances and I don\u0027t have to watch what I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you that you\u0027re perfectly welcome to call me Earthie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then. I\u0027ll have a busman\u0027s holiday. What would you like to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s an easy one to answer. I want to see the proton synchrotron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that Maybe Barren can arrange it after you see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if I can\u0027t see the synchrotron, I don\u0027t know what else there is to see. I know the radio telescope is on the other side and I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s any novelty in it, anyway. . . . You tell me. What doesn\u0027t the average tourist get to see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A number of things. There are the algae rooms - not the antiseptic processing plants, which you\u0027ve seen - but the farms themselves. However, the smell is pretty strong there and I don\u0027t suppose an Earthie - Earthman - would find it particularly appetizing. Earth - men have trouble with the food as it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that surprise you? Have you ever tasted Earth-food?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. I probably wouldn\u0027t like it, though. It all depends on what you\u0027re used to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so,\" said the Earthman, sighing. \"If you ate a real steak, you\u0027d probably gag at the fat and fiber.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could go to the outskirts where the new corridors are being driven into bedrock, but you\u0027ll have to wear special protective garments. There are the factories - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make the choice, Selene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, if you will tell me something honestly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t promise without hearing the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said that Earthies that didn\u0027t like Earthies tended to stay on the Moon. You didn\u0027t correct me. Do you intend to stay on the Moon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman stared at the toes of his clumsy boots. He said, \"Selene, I had trouble getting a visa to the Moon. They said I might be too old for the trip and that if I stayed any length of time I might find it impossible to return to Earth. So I told them I planned to stay on the Moon permanently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t lying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t sure at the time. But I think I\u0027ll stay here now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have thought that they would have been less willing than ever to let you go under those conditions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Generally, the Earth authorities don\u0027t like to send physicists to the Moon on a permanent basis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman\u0027s lips twitched. \"In that respect, I had no trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, if you\u0027re going to be one of us, I think you ought to visit the gymnasium. Earthies often want to but we don\u0027t encourage them as a general rule - though it\u0027s not forbidden outright Immigrants are a different thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, for one thing, we exercise in the nude or near-nude. Why not?\" She sounded aggrieved, as though weary of repeating a defensive position. \"The temperature is controlled; the environment is clean. It\u0027s just that where people from Earth are expected to be, nudity becomes unsettling. Some Earthies are shocked; some are titillated; and some are both. Well, we\u0027re not going to dress in the gymnasium for their sake, and we\u0027re not going to cope with them, either; so we keep them out\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But immigrants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have to get used to it. In the end, they\u0027ll be discarding clothes, too. And they\u0027ll need the gymnasium even more than the native Lunarites do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Til be honest with you, Selene. If I encounter female nudity, I\u0027ll find it titillating, too. I\u0027m not quite so old that I won\u0027t\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, titillate, then,\" she said, indifferently, \"but to yourself. Agreed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we have to get undressed too?\" He looked at her with amused interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As spectators? No. We could, but we don\u0027t have to. You would feel uncomfortable if you did this early in the game and you wouldn\u0027t be a particularly inspiring sight to the rest of us - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are frank!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it would be? Be honest And as for myself, I have no wish to put you under a special strain in your private titillation. So we might both just as well stay clothed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will there be any objection? I mean to my being there as an Earthie of uninspirational appearance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if I\u0027m with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, then, Selene. Is it far away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are there. Just through here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, then, you were planning to come here all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it might be interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene smiled suddenly. \"I just thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman shook his head. \"I\u0027m beginning to think you never just think. Let me guess. If I\u0027m to stay on the Moon, I will need to exercise now and then in order to keep muscles, bones, and all my organs, perhaps, in condition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite true. So do all of us, immigrants from Earth in particular. The day will come when the gymnasium will be a daily grind for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stepped through a door and the Earthman stared in astonishment. \"This is the first place I\u0027ve seen that looks like Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why it\u0027s big. I didn\u0027t imagine you would have such big rooms on the Moon. Desks, office machinery, women at the desks - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bare-breasted women,\" said Selene, gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That part isn\u0027t Earthlike, I admit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got a hold-chute, too, and an elevator for Earthies. There are many levels . . . But wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe approached a woman at one of the nearer desks, talking in a rapid, low voice while the Earthman stared at everything with amiable curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene returned. \"No trouble. And it turns out we\u0027re going to have a melee. A rather good one; I know the teams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This place is very impressive. Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you still mean its size, it\u0027s not nearly big enough. We have three gymnasiums. This is the largest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m somehow pleased that in the Spartan surroundings of the Moon, you can afford to waste so much room on frivolity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frivolity!\" Selene sounded offended. \"Why do you think this is frivolity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Melees? Some sort of game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might call it a game. On Earth you can do such things for sports; ten men doing, ten thousand watching. It\u0027s not so on the Moon; what\u0027s frivolous for you is necessary for us, . . . This way; we\u0027ll take the elevator, which means a little waiting perhaps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t mean to get you angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not really angry but you must be reasonable. You Earthmen have been adapted to Earth-gravity for all the three hundred million years since life crawled onto dry land. Even if you don\u0027t exercise, you get by. We\u0027ve had no time at all to adapt to Moon-gravity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look different enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re born and reared under Moon-gravity, your bones and muscles are, naturally, slimmer and less massive than an Earthie\u0027s would be, but that\u0027s superficial. There isn\u0027t a bodily function we possess, however subtle - digestion, rates of hormonal secretions - that isn\u0027t maladjusted to gravity and that doesn\u0027t require a deliberate regimen of exercise. If we can arrange exercise in the form of fun and games that does not make it frivolity . . . Here\u0027s the elevator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman hung back in momentary alarm, but Selene, said, with residual impatience, as though still seething over the necessity of defense. \"I suppose you\u0027re going to tell me it looks like a wickerwork basket. Every Earthman who uses it says so. With Moon-gravity, it doesn\u0027t have to be any more substantial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator moved downward slowly. They were the only ones on board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman said, \"I suspect this isn\u0027t much used.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene smiled again. \"You\u0027re right. The hold-chute is much more popular, and much more fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what the name implies . . . Here we are. We only had to drop two levels . . . It\u0027s just a vertical tube you can drop through, with handholds. We don\u0027t encourage Earthies to use it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too risky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in itself. You can climb down as though it were a ladder. However, there are always youngsters swinging down at considerable speed and Earthies don\u0027t know how to keep out of the way. Collisions are always discomforting. But you\u0027ll get to use it in time. . . . In fact, what you\u0027ll see now is a kind of large hold-chute designed for recklessness.\" ^\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led him to a circular railing around which a number of individuals were leaning and talking. All were more or less in the nude. Sandals were common and usually a hip-purse was slung over one shoulder. Some wore briefs. One was scooping a greenish-mash out of a container and was eating it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman wrinkled his nose slightly as he passed that one. He said, \"The dental problem must be severe on the Moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t good,\" Selene agreed. \"Ifwe ever get the chance, we\u0027ll select for an edentate jaw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toothlessness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not entirely. We might keep the incisors and canines for cosmetic reasons and for occasionally useful tasks. They\u0027re easily cleaned, too. But why should we want useless molars? It\u0027s just a hangover from an Earthie past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you making any progress in that direction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said, stiffly. \"Genetic engineering is illegal. Earth insists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was leaning over the railing. \"They call this the Moon\u0027s playground,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman looked down. It was a large cylindrical opening with pink smooth walls to which metal bars were attached in what seemed a random configuration. Here and there, a bar stretched across a portion of the cylinder, sometimes across its entire width. It was perhaps four or five hundred feet deep and about fifty feet across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one seemed to be paying particular attention either to the playground or to the Earthman. Some had looked at him indifferently as he passed, seeming to weigh his clothed state, his facial appearance, and then had turned away. Some made a casual hand gesture to Selene\u0027s direction before turning away, but all turned away. The no-interest signal, however subdued, could not have been more blatant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman turned to the cylindrical opening. There were slim figures at the bottom, foreshortened because they were seen from above. Some wore wisps of clothing in red, some in blue. Two teams, he decided. Clearly the wisps served protective functions, since all wore gloves and sandals, protective bands about knees and elbows. Some wore brief bands about the hips, some about the chests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" he muttered. \"Men and women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene said, \"Right! The sexes compete equally but the idea is to prevent the uncontrolled swinging of parts that might hamper the guided fall. There\u0027s a sexual difference there which also involves vulnerability to pain. It\u0027s not modesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman said, \"I think I\u0027ve read of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may have,\" said Selene, indifferently. \"Not much seems to get out. Not that we have any objection, but the Terrestrial government prefers to keep news of the Moon to a minimum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Selene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re an Earthman. You tell me. . . . Our theory here on the Moon is that we embarrass the Earth. Or at least\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe Earth government.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn either side of the cylinder now, two individuals were rising rapidly and the patter of light drumbeats was heard in the background. At first, the climbers seemed to be going up a ladder, rung by rung, but their speed increased and by the time they were halfway up, they were striking each hold as they passed, making an ostentatious slapping noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t do that on Earth as gracefully,\" said the Earthman, admiringly. \"Or at all,\" he amended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not just low-gravity,\" said Selene. \"Try it, if you think so. This takes endless hours of practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe climbers reached the railing and swung up to a headstand. They performed a simultaneous somersault and began to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can move quickly when they want to,\" said the Earthman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Umm,\" said Selene, through the patter of applause. \"I suspect that when Earthmen - I mean the real Earthmen, the ones who have never even visited the Moon - think of moving around the Moon, they think of the surface and of spacesuits. That\u0027s often slow, of course. The mass, with the spacesuit added, is huge, which means high inertia and a small gravity to overcome it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite right,\" said the Earthman. \"I\u0027ve seen the classic motion pictures of the early astronauts that all school children see and the movements are like those underwater, The picture gets imprinted, even when we know better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be surprised how fast we can move on the surface these days, spacesuit and all,\" said Selene. \"And here, underground, without spacesuits, we can move as quickly as on Earth. The slower whip of gravity is made up for by the proper use of muscles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can move slowly, too.\" The Earthman was watching the acrobats. They had gone up with speed and were going down with deliberate slowness. They-were floating, slapping the handholds to delay the drop rather than, as before, to accelerate the rise. They reached the ground and two others replaced them. And then two more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then two more. From each team alternately, pairs competed in virtuosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach pair went up in unison; each pair rose and fell in a more complicated pattern. One pair kicked off simultaneously to cross the tube in a low parabola, convex upward, each reaching the handhold the other had abandoned, and somehow skimming past each other in mid-air without touching. That evoked louder applause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman said, \"I suspect I lack the experience to appreciate the finer points of skill. Are these all native Lunarites?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have to be,\" said Selene. \"The gymnasium is open to all Lunar citizens and some immigrants are fairly good, considering. For this kind of virtuosity, however, you must depend on babies that are conceived and born here. They have the proper physical adaptation, at least more than native Earthmen have, and they get the proper childhood training. Most of these performers are under eighteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I imagine it\u0027s dangerous, even at Moon-gravity levels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Broken bones aren\u0027t very uncommon. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s been an actual death, but there\u0027s been at least one case of broken spine and paralysis. That was a terrible accident; I was actually watching -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Oh, wait now; we\u0027re going to have the ad libs now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Till now, we\u0027ve had set pieces. The climbs were according to a fixed pattern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe percussion beat seemed softer as one climber rose and suddenly launched into mid-air. He caught a transverse bar one-handed, circling it once vertically, and let\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ego-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman watched closely. He said, \"Amazing. He gets around those bars exactly like a gibbon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A what?\" asked Selene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A gibbon. A kind of ape; in fact, the only ape still existing in the wild. They - \" He looked at Selene\u0027s expression and said, \"I don\u0027t mean it as an insult, Selene; they are graceful creatures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene said, frowning, \"I\u0027ve seen pictures of apes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You probably haven\u0027t seen gibbons, in motion. . . . I dare say that Earthies might call Lunarites \u0027gibbons* and mean it insultingly, about on the level of what you mean by \u0027Earthie.\u0027 But I don\u0027t mean it so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned both elbows on the railing and watched the movements. It was like dancing in the air. He said, \"How do you treat Earth-immigrants here on the Moon, Selene? J mean immigrants who mean to stay here life-long. Since they lack true Lunarite abilities - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That makes no difference. Immies are citizens. There\u0027s no discrimination; no legal discrimination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean? No legal discrimination?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you said it yourself. There are some things they can\u0027t do. There are differences. Their medical problems are different and they\u0027ve usually had a worse medical history. If they come in middle age, they look - old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman looked away, embarrassed. \"Can they intermarry? I mean, immigrants and Lunarites.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. That is, they can interbreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s what I meant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. No reason why an immigrant can\u0027t have some worthwhile genes. Heavens, my father was an immie, though I\u0027m second-generation Lunarite on my mother\u0027s side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose your father must have come when he was1 quite - Oh, good Lord - \" He froze at the railing, then drew a shuddering sigh. \"I thought he was going to miss that bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a chance,\" said Selene. \"That\u0027s Marco Fore. He likes to do that, reach out at the last moment. Actually, it\u0027s bad form to do that and a real champion doesn\u0027t. Still -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;My father was twenty-two when he arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose that\u0027s the way. Still young enough to be adaptable; no emotional complications back on Earth. From the standpoint of the Earthie male, I imagine it must be rather nice to have a sexual attachment with a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sexual attachment!\" Selene\u0027s amusement seemed to cover a very real sense of shock. \"You don\u0027t suppose my father had sex with my mother. If my mother heard you say that, she\u0027d set you right in a hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Artificial insemination was what it was for goodness sake. Sex with an Earthman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Earthman looked solemn. \"I thought you said there was no discrimination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not discrimination. That\u0027s a matter of physical fact. An Earthman can\u0027t handle the gravity field properly. However practiced he might be, under the stress of passion, he might revert. I wouldn\u0027t risk it. The clumsy fool might snap his arm or leg - or worse, mine. Gene mixtures are one thing; sex is quite another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry . . . Isn\u0027t artificial insemination against the law?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was watching the gymnastics with absorption. \"That\u0027s Marco Fore again. When he isn\u0027t trying to be uselessly spectacular, he really is good; and his sister is almost as good. When they work together it\u0027s really a poem of motion. Look at them now. They\u0027ll come together and circle the same bar as though they have a single body stretched across. He\u0027s a little too flamboyant at times, but you can\u0027t fault his muscular control . . . Yes, artificial insemination is against Earth\u0027s law, but it\u0027s allowed where medical reasons are involved, and, of course, that\u0027s often the case, or said to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAU the acrobats had now climbed to the top and were in a great circle just below the railing; all the reds on one side, the blues on the other. All arms on the side of the interior were raised and the applause was loud. Quite a crowd had now gathered at the rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ought to have some seating arrangement,\" said the Earthman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. This isn\u0027t a show. This is exercise. We don\u0027t encourage any more spectators than can stand comfortably about the railing. We\u0027re supposed to be down there, not up here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you can do that sort of thing, Selene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After a fashion, of course. Any Lunarite can. I\u0027m not as good as they are. I haven\u0027t joined any teams -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There\u0027s going to be the melee now, the free-for-all. This is the really dangerous part. All ten are going to be in the air and each side is going to try to send members of the other side into a fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A real fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As real as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are there injuries occasionally?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Occasionally. In theory, this sort of thing is frowned upon. That is considered frivolous, and we don\u0027t have so large a population that we can afford to incapacitate anyone without real cause. Still, the melee is popular and we can\u0027t raise the votes to outlaw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which side do you vote on, Selene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene blushed. \"Oh, never mind. You watch this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe percussion rhythm had suddenly grown thunderous and each of the individuals in the huge well darted outward like an arrow. There was wild confusion in mid-air \"but when they parted again, each ended firmly on a bar-grip. There was the tension of waiting. One launched; another followed; and the air was filled with flashing bodies again. Over and over it happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene said, \"The scoring is intricate. There is a point for every launch; a point for every touch; two points for every miss inflicted; ten points for a grounding; various penalties for various kinds of fouling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who keeps the score?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are umpires watching who make the preliminary decisions and there are television tapes in case of appeals. Very often even the tapes can\u0027t decide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sudden excited cry when a girl in blue moved past a boy in red and slapped his flank resoundingly. The boy who received the blow had writhed away, but not successfully, and grabbing at a wall bar with improper balance struck that wall ungracefully with his knee. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gods-themselves/page-19.html","bookId":1744,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:25 AM"}
