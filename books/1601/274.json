Two sides to every coin. Two halves to the Power. Hot and cold, light and dark, woman and man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a weave exists, so must its opposite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM’Hael released balefire, and Egwene did . . . something. The weave she’d tried before on the cracks, but of a much greater power and scope: a majestic, marvelous weave, a combination of all Five Powers. It slid into place before her. She yelled, releasing it as if from her very soul, a column of pure white that struck M’Hael’s weave at its center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two canceled one another, like scalding water and freezing water poured together. A powerful flash of light overwhelmed all else, blinding Egwene, but she could feel something from what she did. A shoring up of the Pattern. The cracks stopped spreading, and something welled up inside of them, a stabilizing force. A growth, like scab on a wound. Not a perfect fix, but at least a patch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe yelled, forcing herself to her feet. She would not face him on her knees! She drew every scrap of the Power she could hold, throwing it at the Forsaken with the fury of the Amyrlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two streams of power sprayed light against one another, the ground around M’Hael cracking as the ground near Egwene rebuilt itself. She still did not know what it was she wove. The opposite of balefire. A fire of her own, a weave of light and rebuilding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Flame of Tar Valon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey matched one another, in stasis, for an eternal moment. In that moment, Egwene felt a peace come upon her. The pain of Gawyn\u0027s death faded. He would be reborn. The Pattern would continue. The very weave she wielded calmed her anger and replaced it with peace. She reached more deeply into saidar,; that glowing comfort that had guided her so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she drew on more of the Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer stream of energy pushed its way through M’Hael’s balefire like a sword thrust, spraying the Power aside and traveling right up the stream into M’Hael’s outstretched hand. It pierced the hand and shot through his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe balefire vanished. M’Hael gaped, stumbling, eyes wide, and then he crystallized from the inside out, as if freezing in ice. A multihued, beautiful crystal grew from him. Uncut and rough, as if from the core of the earth itself. Somehow Egwene knew that the Flame would have had much less effect on a person who had not given himself to the Shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clung to the Power she’d held. She had pulled in too much. She knew that if she released her grip, she would leave herself burned out, unable to channel another drop. The Power surged through her in this last moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething trembled far to the north. Rand’s fight continued. The gaps in the land expanded. M’Hael and Demandred\u0027s balefire had done its work. The world here was crumbling. Black lines radiated across the Heights, and her mind’s eye saw them opening, the land shattering, and a void appearing here that sucked into it all life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch for the light\", Egwene whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother?\" Leilwin still knelt beside her. Around them, hundreds of Sharans picked themselves up off the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch for the light, Leilwin\", Egwene said. \"As the Amyrlin Seat, I command you—find the seals of the Dark One’s prison and break them. Do it the moment the light shines. Only then can it save us\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene wove a gateway and wrapped Leilwin in Air, shoving her through to safety. As she went, Egwene released the woman’s bond, severing their brief tie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Leilwin cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gateway closed. Black cracks into nothingness expanded all around Egwene as she faced the hundreds of Sharans. Her Aes Sedai had fought with strength and valor, but those Sharan channelers still remained. They surrounded her, some timid, others smiling in triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes and drew in the power. More than a woman should be able to, more than was right. Far beyond safety, far beyond wisdom. This sa’angreal had no buffer to prevent this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body was spent. She offered it up and became a column of light, releasing the Flame of Tar Valon into the ground beneath her and high into the sky. The Power left her in a quiet, beautiful explosion, washing across the Sharans and sealing the cracks created by her fight with M’Hael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene’s soul separated from her collapsing body and rested upon that wave, riding it into the Light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand screamed in denial, in rage, in sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not her! NOT HER!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE DEAD ARE MINE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shaitan!\" Rand yelled. \"Not her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI WILL KILL THEM ALL, ADVERSARY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand bent over, squeezing his eyes shut. I will protect you, he thought. Whatever else happens, I will see you safe, I swear it. I swear it.. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Light. Egwene’s name joined the list of the dead. That list continued to grow, thundering in his mind. His failures. So many failures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should have been able to save them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark One’s attacks persisted, trying to rip Rand apart and crush him all at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Light. Not Egwene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand closed his eyes and collapsed, barely holding back the next attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness enclosed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeane raised her arm, shading her eyes against the magnificent burst of light. It washed the hillside of its darkness and—for a moment—left only brilliance. Sharans froze in place, casting shadows behind them as they crystallized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe column of power rose high in the air, a beacon, then faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeane dropped to her knees, one hand resting on the ground to steady herself. A blanket of crystals coated the ground, growing over broken rock, coating the scarred landscape. Where cracks had opened, they were now filled with crystal, looking like tiny rivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeane climbed to her feet and crept forward, passing the Sharans frozen in crystal, dead in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the very center of the explosion, Leane found a column of crystal as wide as an ancient leatherleaf tree, rising some fifty feet in the air. Frozen at its center was a fluted rod, Vora’s sa’angreal. There was no sign of the Amyrlin herself, but Leane knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Amyrlin Seat has fallen\", a nearby Aes Sedai cried amid the crystallized Sharans. \"The Amyrlin Seat has fallen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder rumbled. Berelain looked up from the side of the bed, then stood, Galad’s hand slipping from hers as she walked to the window set in the stone wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea churned and broke against the rocks outside, roaring, as if in anger. Perhaps pain. White foam sprayed, violent, toward clouds where lightning cast a fractured light. While she watched, those clouds grew thicker in the night, if t \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-274.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
