This skill had probably been refined during his days as a waterfront urchin before he was forcibly taken to the orphanage, as it took the fleet of foot to steal food and dodge billyclubs. Now it served him well, as he was catching up to his quarry; also paramount in his mind was the fact that it was safer to keep the Masker in front of him, yet he was ready at any second for the man to whirl around with an outstretched blade. ausley didn\u0027t need the walking-stick any longer, but Matthew clung to it like life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Constable!\" Matthew shouted again, and now the Masker took a severe turn to the left and, cloak flying, disappeared into the space between the silversmith\u0027s and the house next door. Matthew lifted the lantern with its paltry light; his pace faltered and he had only seconds to decide whether to go in or not before the Masker would be lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up the stick to ward off an attack, took a breath, and darted to the chase. The little passageway was so narrow it nearly scraped his shoulders. He came to another opening and found himself in someone\u0027s garden. a brick pathway led off to the right, with a white wall and a gate on the left. a dog began barking furiously to the right and in that direction the voice of some frightened citizen shouted, \"Who\u0027s therei Who\u0027s therei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew could hear shouts also from over on Barrack Street. ausley\u0027s body had been discovered. In for a penny, in for a pound, he thought. He began running again along the pathway and in a moment passed under a rose arbor. Then there was another wall ahead of him with the wooden gate open, and when Matthew went through this there was a holler, \"I see you, damn you!\" from the house on his right. With a flash and a bang a pistol discharged from an upper window and a lead ball shrieked past Matthew\u0027s ear. He didn\u0027t wait for further introductions; he took to his heels, went over a waist-high picket fence, and then the dog that had been barking lunged at him with snapping teeth and wild eyes but its night-chain yanked it back before flesh could be served.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Matthew didn\u0027t fear the Masker so much as whatever else lay in wait, but going through another gate he came around a privy where the lantern\u0027s light picked out a dark shape climbing over a stone wall about eight feet high. The Masker had dragged a barrel over to stand on, and as Matthew shouted again for a constable the dark figure secured the heights, paused to kick over the barrel, and then dropped onto the other side. Matthew heard footsteps running on stones, heading toward the docks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe righted the barrel, climbed up, and also went over. He landed on the uneven stones of a narrow alley that ran behind the houses and shops of New Street. This was an excellent place to twist an ankle, a fact he could only hope the Masker had already discovered. He continued on along the alleyway but at a walk. His light was almost out, he was breathing hard, and unless the Masker had circled around behind him with intent to claim a second victim this night, the man was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the sounds of the yelling on Barrack Street, the barking of more dogs, and the calling of neighbors one to another, the entire town was coming awake. If I were the Masker, Matthew thought, I\u0027d call a finish to this night and go to my secure place, wherever that might be. Still, there were many places the Masker could be hidden in ambush as Matthew approached. On the left was a barn. Beside it lay a jumble of debris, old broken buckets, coils of rope, wagon wheels, and the like. On the right was the rear of a store and a root cellar. Matthew tried the root cellar\u0027s door but it was bolted from within. He went on, shining his fading lamp to both sides. Most of the houses and shops had root cellars, and here and there were gates that led either into more Dutch gardens or out to the right onto New Street or to the left onto Broad Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas Matthew walked on, his lantern uplifted and the walking-stick thrust out like a rapier, he kept watch for any trace of movement beyond the edges of light. From the noise on Barrack Street, the demise of Eben ausley had caused either a riot or a party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end of the alleyway, which was about as wide as a horse-cart, was not far distant. It opened onto Beaver Street, where Matthew could see the shine of a cornerpost lamp on a glass window. He kept moving his lantern from side to side, looking at the stones for anything the Masker might have dropped in his haste to escape. It would be a good idea, he decided, to retrace the path he\u0027d come. But then again, that was best left to daylight for he was not about to be shot at twice in one night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then, quite suddenly, the light showed him something that stopped him in his tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the handle to a root cellar door on his left was a dark red smear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent over it and examined it more carefully. His heart, which had not had an easy time of it during the last few minutes, began to pound anew. It was a small smear, yes. But it was wet and fresh, and it might have come from a bloody glove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hooked a finger under the door\u0027s handle and tried to lift it, but it was locked. He stepped back and looked at the structure. a two-story brick house or a shop of some kindi It was hard to tell from here. No lights shone in any of the windows. He found a pathway to the front and a wrought-iron gate that opened onto Broad Street. Just as he was about to go through, two men with lanterns came running past on their way to, presumably, the murder scene. He decided to give them time to make some distance, as he didn\u0027t wish to be either interrupted or assaulted by some terrified constable. When the men were gone, Matthew emerged through the gate onto Broad Street and looked up at the building before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he could see illumination, two or three candles\u0027 worth it appeared, up in a room on the second floor. He could also make out the sign on its hooks above the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePollard, Fitzgerald, and Kippering, attorneys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew went up the three front steps and used the brass knocker, which sounded equally as loud as the gunshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, looking south along Broad Street in case anyone else came running past. There was no reply from within the lawyers\u0027 office, yet upon an appraisal of the upstairs window it did appear that at least one of the candles had moved. Matthew hated to knock again, as the noise sounded as if it could wake the dead, but he was determined to get in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps ten seconds passed, with no response. He was about to use his fist when he heard a latch being undone. The door opened, and at that instant the last light of Matthew\u0027s lantern fizzled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanother candle was thrust almost into his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Youi What the hell do you wanti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew squinted in the glare of a fresh wick. He knew the voice. \"I hate to bother you, sir, but I assume you\u0027ve heard a little noise just latelyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have,\" said Kippering. \"Fools shouting the town down, and what sounded like a gun going off. What\u0027s happenedi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you been curious enough to venture out to seei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I have beeni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you make a habit of answering a question with a questioni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the question is from a clerk at my office door near midnight, yes.\" Kippering lowered the candle, which was set in a pewter holder. Matthew noted that the man was wearing the same rather tatty black suit he\u0027d worn at the Thorn Bush, and now Kippering\u0027s appearance matched his clothing. He looked haggard and tired with dark circles under his eyes, his mouth slack and his blue eyes more watery than icy. at that moment three men and a woman were going past on the sidewalk, heading north. Two of the men were armed, one with a musket and the other with an axe. \"Here!\" Kippering called to them. \"What\u0027s happenedi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"another murder,\" answered one of the men. \"The Masker\u0027s cut somebody\u0027s head off!\" They rushed on, almost gleefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"a little exaggeration,\" Matthew said, \"but centrally true. The Masker has killed Eben ausley. He\u0027s lying up there on Barrack Street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoi\" Kippering blinked heavily. \"The Masker or ausleyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ausley. are you illi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"a matter of conjecture, I\u0027m sure.\" Kippering ran a hand through his thick and unruly hair, and the black comma fell back onto his forehead. \"So ausley\u0027s dead, is hei\" He seemed to look at Matthew fully for the first time, and then his gaze found the walking-stick. He took it from Matthew\u0027s hand and examined it more closely in the light. \"If I\u0027m not mistaken-and I\u0027m not-this belongs to ausley. He had it at the Thorn Bush. almost brained Tom Fletcher. May I ask what you\u0027re doing in possession of iti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may, but first I have to ask if I might inspect your cellar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inspect my cellari What are you going on abouti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew said, \"I was first on the scene when ausley was killed. I saw the Masker, just as he\u0027d finished his work. I took the stick as a weapon and chased after him. He led me here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Herei\" Kippering scowled. \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s ill, boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He led me to the alley behind your office. On the door to your root cellar is a blood smear. From a glove, perhaps. I should like to have a look down there.\" Matthew reached out and grasped the stick. When he tried to pull it away, he met a little resistance; then Kippering released his grip and gave it up. \"Will you show me, or shall I go for a constablei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cellar door\u0027s bolted from within. It\u0027s always bolted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That may be so, but someone left blood on the doorhandle. I\u0027d like to take a look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you sayingi That I\u0027m the Maskeri\" Kippering offered up a crooked grin. \"Oh, certainly! after the night I\u0027ve had, I surely gathered up the energy to go out prowling the streets and ended my festivities by murdering another of our clients. at this rate we\u0027ll be out of business in a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ausley was your clienti I didn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKippering seemed to be listening to the noise over on Barrack Street. a few more people rushed past the office door. He gave a long, weary sigh. \"I suppose I ought to go represent the estate. Keep the fools from trampling him flat.\" He refocused his gaze on Matthew. \"You saw the Maskeri\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. Not his face, unfortunately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s blood on the cellar doori\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in.\" Kippering opened the door wider, and Matthew entered. When Kippering started to close the door, Matthew said, \"I\u0027d appreciate it if you\u0027d leave that open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can assure you that the only thing I\u0027ve killed tonight is half a bottle of brandy and a lot of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please leave the door open,\" Matthew insisted in a calm voice, and Kippering shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way.\" Kippering led him past a narrow staircase to another door. He paused to light a second candle in a pewter holder that was sitting atop a stack of books on a table and this he gave to Matthew, who laid aside the dead lantern. \"I hope you\u0027re not afraid of spiders,\" he said. He unhooked a latch and opened the door into the cellar\u0027s darkness. \"Watch your step, these stairs are older than my grandmother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore they descended, Matthew requested that Kippering also leave that door open and go down first. \"You\u0027re serious, aren\u0027t youi\" Kippering asked, but then he took appraisal of Matthew\u0027s expression and obeyed. as he followed down the rickety old stairs, Matthew thought that sometimes it did pay to carry a big stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe candles seemed to throw more shadows than illumination. It was a large cellar with a dirt floor and brick walls. The old yellowish-white bricks, Matthew noted, that had originally come over as ballast on some of the first Dutch ships. Filling the place almost up to the raftered ceiling were battered wooden shelves full of decaying law books, parcels of papers wrapped in twine, and stacks upon stacks of more yellowed documents. Matthew thought that, though there was a sea dampness to the air, if a fire ever got loose in here it would burn steadily for a month. Discarded buckets, two broken chairs, a desk that looked as if it had been chewed by a beaver, and other odds-and-ends of office decor littered the chamber. Matthew went directly to the cellar door and inspected the bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"anything therei\" Kippering asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" came the answer. There was no blood on this side of the door. But that didn\u0027t stop Matthew from shining his candle around to check the steps and the floor. There were many footprints in the dirt, but why would there not bei He continued searching around boxes of papers. \"What is all thisi\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The underbelly of the legal profession.\" Kippering sat down on a large wooden trunk. \"This is where the old deceased records lie in rotting perpetuity. Most of it dates back to before Charles Land took the firm over from Rolf Gorendyke. He left it all here for us to clean up, except Bryan thinks there\u0027ll be value to it someday as history and he wants to keep it. If Joplin and I had our way, we\u0027d toss it tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toss it wherei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, well that\u0027s the problem, isn\u0027t iti We\u0027ve thought of burning it, but...\" He shrugged. \"Maybe Bryan\u0027s right. Someday someone might give a damn about what went on here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew was still poking around and finding nothing but a rat\u0027s nest, both figuratively and literally. \"You say Eben ausley was your clienti\" he asked as he explored the room. \"You don\u0027t seem so concerned that he\u0027s lying dead over on the next street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had limited dealings with him. Joplin handled most everything. Records of contributions. Contracts for supplies and labor. Paperwork when the orphans found homes. Things such as that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume those more current documents are kept in better circumstancesi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"File cabinets upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew kept looking, but this path was showing no promise. \"aren\u0027t you at all curiousi\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"about whati\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two things. Who killed ausley, and what the smear of blood on the door looks likei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKippering grunted and smiled thinly. \"I hear,\" he said, \"that ausley had lost a lot of money on the tables. He\u0027d borrowed heavily, and lost most of that as well. The man was what you might call a gambling fanatic. In case you don\u0027t know, there are individuals in this town who lend money and aren\u0027t pleased when it\u0027s not promptly repaid. ausley unfortunately did not have the most charming personality, either. I think it was only a matter of time before someone either beat him to death or cut his throat, so this Masker person may have simply cheated the pawnbroker. as for the blood smear, I\u0027ve seen them before. Still, I\u0027ll take your bait.\" He stood up with his candle, walked to the door, and threw back the bolt. Then he pushed the door open and stuck his head out to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Matthew heard a frightened voice call from outside, \"Hold there! Hold!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just having a look around,\" Kippering explained to the unseen person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just hold right there, I said! Do you have a weaponi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Settle down, Giles. It is Giles Wintergarten, isn\u0027t iti It\u0027s me, andrew Kippering. Look.\" Matthew envisioned him holding the light nearer his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear God, Mr. Kipperin\u0027, you scared the shit into my drawers pokin\u0027 your head out like that! Don\u0027t you know there\u0027s been another murder right up the wayi I might have run you through!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew got the picture. a constable had been in the alley when the cellar door had opened. Carrying a sword, too, by the sound of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Masker\u0027s been at work, yessir!\" said Wintergarten. \"Cut the life out of Eben ausley and left him like a bloody bag up there on Barrack! But he got his, too, he did! Ol\u0027 Emory Coody shot him good and proper!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emory Coodyi\" Kippering asked. \"The one-eyed weather-spyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s him! Lives right up the way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas the two spoke, Matthew found himself staring at the trunk upon which Kippering had been sitting. He walked to it, saw that there was no lock, and lifted the lid. His light fell upon what was inside, and after the jolt of surprise had subsided he thought, Now I\u0027ve found you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look here, Giles,\" Kippering was saying. \"On the doorhandle. Blood. See iti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yessir. Yessir, that does \u0027pear to be blood, don\u0027t iti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the Masker came along here and left his mark. Possibly he tried to open the door, but it was locked from the inside. You might want to take a careful stroll up and down the alley and check all the other cellar doors, yesi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yessir, that would be the thing to do. I ought to go get some help, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"all right, but be careful. Oh, and listen: will you inform High Constable Lillehorne of this, and tell him I\u0027d be happy to help him in any way possiblei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, sir. You ought to get in yourself now, Mr. Kippering. Work such as this ought to be left to the professionals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My thoughts exactly. Goodnight, Giles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Night, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKippering closed the door, rebolted it, and turned to face Matthew. \"as I said, all blood smears look the same.\" He glanced at the open trunk. \"What are you searching for nowi Costumes for the dancei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are clothes in here,\" Matthew said, his voice tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, there are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are gloves in here.\" Matthew held up a pair. They were black and made of thin cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your powers of observation are stunning. You might also observe that those are women\u0027s gowns and underclothing.\" He held up a large hand, took two strides forward, and demonstrated how small the glove was. It looked to fit a child. \"Women\u0027s gloves. I think there may be some men\u0027s shirts and a coat or two down there at the bottom, but I haven\u0027t gone all the way through. You\u0027ll note that everything is moldering and musty and is probably over twenty years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew was flustered. He was so eager to believe he\u0027d found the Masker\u0027s hidden cache of clothes that the first black gown on top had addled his brain. \"Well...where did all this come fromi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not sure, but we think one of Gorendyke\u0027s clients used the trunk as payment for legal services. Or it might have come from the estate of someone who died aboard ship on the way over. We\u0027re going to throw it out, sooner or later. are you donei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew nodded, his brow furrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKippering closed the lid. \"If you didn\u0027t hear, I showed Giles Wintergarten the blood smear and I told him to inform Lillehorne. I think the Masker either really did try to get in-though I didn\u0027t hear anything as I\u0027ve been upstairs for at least an hour-or being such a clever murderer as you feel him to be, he deliberately left a mark for your benefit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For my benefiti Whyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he stopped your following him, didn\u0027t hei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t have known I would see the mark,\" Matthew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but he might have reasoned the odds were on his side that you would.\" Kippering gave a smile, which on his usually handsome but now dark-shadowed face seemed a little ghastly. \"I think the Masker might also be a gambler. Don\u0027t youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew cast his eyes down. He didn\u0027t know what to think. as he was pondering what to him was an appalling lack of mental acuity, he saw his candlelight gleam on an object that leaned against one of the shelves. It was a strange object to be down here, he thought. a pair of hammered-brass firetongs, yet there was certainly no fireplace in the cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to the firetongs and picked them up. The business end of the tongs had been thinned by some scraping instrument or grinding wheel, it appeared. \"What\u0027s this fori\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKippering took the tongs, turned away, and reached up to a top shelf to grasp a packet of papers, which he brought down trailing dust. He waved the papers in front of Matthew\u0027s face before returning them to where they\u0027d been likely situated for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew sniffed, holding back a sneeze, and rubbed his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want a drinki\" Kippering asked. \"I\u0027ve got that half-bottle of brandy left. You can help me celebrate the fact that I only lost five shillings and eight pence at gambling tonight, and that I overpaid by twice for a cheap bottle of wine at Madam Blossom\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Matthew said, already feeling thoroughly debilitated. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then may I give you some free legal advicei\" Kippering waited for Matthew to give him his full attention. \"I would refrain from mentioning to anyone that you discovered ausley\u0027s body. That is, if you wish to remain free to walk around town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardoni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were nearly first on the scene with Mr. Deverick, weren\u0027t youi and now first to find ausleyi I\u0027d hate to think what Lillehorne might do with that, since he seems to consider you such an outspoken boon to his authority.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t murder anyone. Why should I not tell Lillehornei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\" Kippering said, \"the high constable will find your presence at both murders so interesting that he will wish to know what you were doing out tonight. and even though you and I may believe that Lillehorne is not entirely up to the job, he is relentless when it suits him to be. Thus he will wish to know in exacting detail your progress through this night, and he may well feel you are best questioned behind the security of iron bars. He will ask questions here and there and there and here, and sooner or later he\u0027ll find out that you and the future husband of our good reverend\u0027s daughter were meeting at a rather dismal little drinking and gambling establishment festooned with whores. For privacy, did you sayi Do you see my directioni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew did, but he remained sullenly silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do,\" Kippering went on. \"Now I don\u0027t know what you and Mr. Five were talking about in that back room, but you can be sure Lillehorne will find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That has nothing to do with the Masker. It\u0027s private business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you keep using that word, and that will only feed Lillehorne\u0027s desire to root out whatever secret you have.\" He paused to let Matthew feel the sting of that particular fish-hook. \"Now in a few minutes I\u0027m going to put on my official lawyer\u0027s face, straighten my suit and comb my hair, and walk out to stand alongside ausley\u0027s corpse until the body-cart pulls up. I suggest you go home, go to bed, and in the morning you are as surprised to hear of Eben ausley\u0027s death as anyone in New York. How does that settle with youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew thought about it, though there wasn\u0027t a lot of thinking to be done. It wouldn\u0027t do for questions to be asked about Matthew\u0027s jaunts this night, not with Reverend Wade\u0027s problem still unknown. He said quietly, \"It settles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Incidentally, I\u0027m sure Giles will carry that information about the blood smear straight to Lillehorne, in case you\u0027re thinking this is an attempt to keep you from telling anyone. I assure you I couldn\u0027t care less, just so long as he doesn\u0027t come up behind me on a dark night.\" Kippering motioned Matthew toward the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat the front, Matthew hesitated in the doorway before Kippering could shut him out. He gazed up at the candle-illuminated window. \"Tell me, if you will,\" he said, \"why you\u0027re at work so late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKippering kept the faint smile on his face. \"I don\u0027t sleep very well. Never have. Goodnight. Oh...two last things: I should avoid the crowd up there on Barrack, and I should beware not the Masker but some frightened rabbit with a blunderbuss.\" So saying, he pushed the door shut and Matthew heard the latch fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew looked toward City Hall and saw the wash of candlelight in two of the attic\u0027s small square windows. He\u0027d never been up there before, as access to that area was by invitation only; that portion was the office and also the living quarters of ashton McCaggers, whose abilities as coroner more than made up for his eccentricities. It appeared McCaggers was awake and preparing for another session in the cold room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZed would be hauling the body-cart past here soon. It was time to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew crossed Broad Street to Princes Street, intending to go back up Smith and then to the Broad Way and home, thus bypassing that noisy rabble gathered around the corpse of Eben ausley. as he made his way past the late-flickering lamps on their cornerposts, the warm breeze moving about him with its leathery smells of dockside tar and sewer ditch, he knew he would find sleep a troubling companion this night. There would be many echoes in his mind calling for recognition or resolve, and many that might never be resolved. In truth, he felt fortunate to have survived not only a gunshot and dog attack but the Masker himself, who might easily have turned on him and cut him to pieces with a hooked blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas for ausley, he felt...nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo anger, no sadness, no loss, no gain, no sense of justice, no exultation at the death of a wicked man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt as if a slate within him upon which he\u0027d marked balances for such a very long time had been wiped clean. Just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached the safety of the pottery, he left the walking-stick on the ground alongside the building. He intended to rise with the sun, take the stick out to the East River, and consign it to dark water, where it might vanish in time from sight and memory like its late owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew went up to bed, remembering to wash his hands. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-queen-of-bedlam-matthew-corbett-2/page-16.html","bookId":2251,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:05 PM"}
