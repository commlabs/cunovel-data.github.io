Come on up. It’s sturdier than it looks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe platform was ringed on all four sides with a gated rail that opened front and back, and it now rested on a track that looked burly enough to support a herd of cattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead,” Lucy told her. “Get on the lift. It’ll hold us both, and then some.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar took the suggestion and Lucy climbed up behind her, wavering with a lack of balance until Briar steadied her. “We follow along this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walkway disappeared into another tangle of platforms, lifts, and other contraptions meant to move people. Eventually it terminated at an interchange, and Lucy pointed out the green arrow aiming at a path that began with four green boards. Her eyes shifted back and forth in her mask and she said, much more quietly, “Don’t look now, but we aren’t alone. Up on the roof, to the right; and down in the window on the left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar held her head still but followed the verbal directions. Lucy was right. Above them on the next roof over, a masked fellow with a long gun leaned into a corner and watched the women approach. Below them, one seamless glass window was blotched dark with the silhouette of a man with a covered face and a hat, also armed, and also hiding out in the open—not much caring if anyone saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guards?” Briar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t get too nervous about them. We’re coming up the right way, out in the open and plenty loud. They won’t bother us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But they’re watching for newcomers, aren’t they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Newcomers and rotters, and disgruntled clients,” Lucy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar pointed out, “I’m a newcomer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. But they know me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I should ask them—,” she started to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy interrupted. “Ask them what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ask them about Zeke. They’re watchmen, aren’t they? Maybe they saw my son while they were watching the streets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barkeep shook her head. “Not yet. Not these men. They won’t talk to you, even if they can. They’re only mercenaries, most of them. And they aren’t friendly. Just leave ’em be.” She lowered her voice again, and marched straight ahead behind Briar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar picked out a third armed man on another nearby rooftop, and then a fourth. She asked, “Are there always this many of them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy was looking another direction, for she’d spotted yet a fifth. “Sometimes,” she said, but she sounded unconvinced by her own assessment. “This does seem like a lot for a welcome wagon. I wonder what’s going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar didn’t find this particularly reassuring, but she resolutely refused to hold her gun any tighter or walk any faster along the narrow, pipe-and-wood-frame corridors that held her up over the Blight-poisoned streets. “No one’s aiming at us, at least,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True enough. Maybe they’ve had some problems. Maybe they’re looking out for somebody else. Honey, could you do me a favor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Name it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stick a little closer by me. This part’s uneven, and it’s hard for me to straighten myself without my arm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar shifted her shoulder, twitching her satchel and gun until they wouldn’t clap Lucy in the face; then she put one arm around the other woman and helped her walk across the crooked beams. At the end of the way she pulled another lever, and another lift dropped down to meet them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy said, “This is the last of them. It’ll take us down, into the basement. Can you see the station over there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar squinted and thought that she might be able to spy a dark point and a circle crossed by two lines through the shifting sheets of curdled air. “Over there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right. That’s the clock tower, there. They’d just got it up when the Blight hit us all. This place right here,” she said as the gear-work mechanisms that held the platform aloft buckled and began to lower, “this was supposed to be a garage where the train cars were stored when no one needed them. It’s been turned into a lobby of sorts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lobby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Think of it as a hotel. It’s pretty nice inside,” Lucy said. “Nicer than the Vaults, anyhow. Even down here, money has plenty to say—and Minnericht’s rich as can be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne level at a time, the rickety lift dropped the women. Through the skeleton of the huge, stillborn station their stomachs raced to beat them to the bottom; and at the bottom, the doors opened into more startling bareness—more blank reminders that there were no trains, and no tickets, and no customers. This was a place that had never been brand-new, and now it felt more ancient than the wings of flies trapped in dirty amber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA puff of dust accompanied the settling of the lift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar sneezed, and Lucy lifted her arm to wipe her nose on her sleeve, but the mask kept her from success. “Come on, dear,” she said. “It’s not much farther, and the deeper we go, the more comfortable the station becomes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long has he lived here?” Briar asked as she followed Lucy off the lift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I don’t know. Ten years, maybe? He’s had quite a long time to spruce the place up to his liking, that’s for sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked across flat stone without any shine or tiling, and their footsteps banged an announcement echo up to the room’s edge. The vast, blank space terminated against a set of red double doors that were sealed with smooth black flaps at all the seams. Briar touched one of the flaps and stared at it more closely. It looked cleaner and more manufactured than the hastily improvised seals of the other quarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do we get inside? Do we have to knock a special way, or pull a bell?” Briar asked, noting that the door had no external knobs or latches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy said, “Help me pull the arm out of this sling, will you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar assisted with the detangling, and then Lucy swung the arm three times against the rightmost door. The sound was sharp and clanging. It was the sound of metal on metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The doors…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Steel, I think. Someone told me he made them out of a train car’s siding. But someone else told me he yanked them down from the entrance, so I don’t know where he got them, really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And they’re just going to let us inside?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy shrugged, and her mostly limp arm swung jauntily against her belly. “Rotters don’t knock. Everybody else, they figure they can manage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wonderful,” Briar mumbled, and soon the jerk and squeal of interior braces revealed that they’d been heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door took half a minute to open, as bars and locks were twisted, lifted, and set aside; and then came the squeal of unhappy hinges as the portal split open. Behind it, a thin man with an oversized mask glared suspiciously out into the area that Lucy had called “the lobby.” An averagely tall fellow, he was dressed like a cowboy in canvas pants, a buttoned-shut shirt, and a pair of gun belts that overlapped one another around his hips. Across his chest another strap held another gun, a larger one like Briar’s Spencer. He was younger than many of the other people she’d seen inside the city walls, but he was not as young as her son. He might’ve been as old as thirty, but it was hard to tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello there, Richard,” Lucy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he had a frown or a smile to return the greeting, Briar couldn’t see it through his mask. He said, “Miss Lucy. Something wrong with the arm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave Briar a frank sort of appraisal and said, “How’d your friend get inside the city?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy frowned. “What’s that got to do with anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe nothing. How’d she get inside?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, I’m standing right here. You could just ask me,” Briar groused. “Fact is, I dropped down off the Naamah Darling. Captain Cly was kind enough to give me a ride.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy held very still, like a prey animal afraid it’s been spotted. Then she added slowly, “She’s been here since yesterday. I was going to bring her sooner, but we had trouble with rotters. And anyway, she’s here now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar had assumed it had been longer, but when she thought about it, she realized she’d only been down in the city for one night and almost two full days. She said, before he could ask, “I’m looking for my son. He would’ve come inside here a couple of days ago. It’s a long story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her without blinking, for a moment too long. “I’ll bet.” After giving her another long look, he said, “I guess you’d better come inside.” He turned his back to lead Briar and Lucy inside and they followed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red double doors sipped a gust of air as they slapped back together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This way,” said Richard. He drew them through a narrow room that was only just too wide to be called a hallway. The walls were pocked with gas lamps that looked like they came from ships. They reminded Briar of the lights on the Naamah Darling, and she thought that if she touched them, they might sway on their suspending arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked together in silence for so long that Briar jumped when Richard spoke again. “I think you’re expected,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar couldn’t decide if this revelation gave her hope or made her feel sick, “I beg your pardon?” she asked, hoping for clarification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t offer any. “Miss Lucy, did you bang up your hand hitting on Willard again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, but it sounded more nervous than happy. “No, and that was only once. He’s not very often a problem. Just that one time…” Her voice evaporated, and returned. “No, this was a clot of rotters. We had some trouble at Maynard’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar wondered if Richard already knew about the trouble, or if he could have been involved in it. The man didn’t respond, and Lucy didn’t try any more conversation; and before long the stretched-out room ended in a set of curtains made of the same black rubber, but hung as if they were proper drapery. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/boneshaker-the-clockwork-century-1/page-53.html","bookId":2550,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:25:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:25:52 AM"}
