It was pointing upstairs, she decided-the opposite direction led into a wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d better get out in the open, anyway,\" Adam said. \"Otherwise we might not be able to follow it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie nodded. She and Adam were speaking quickly, tensely-but calmly. Their violent agitation was held just under the surface, kept down by sheer willpower. Having something to do was what made the difference, she thought as they climbed the stairs. She couldn\u0027t afford to have hysterics now; she had to keep her mind clear to trace Jeffrey\u0027s killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hallway outside the custodian\u0027s office they ran into Deborah and the Henderson brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam, dude, what\u0027s goin\u0027 on?\" Chris said. Cassie saw that he\u0027d been drinking. \"We were just comin\u0027 down for a little liquid refreshment, you know-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not down there,\" Adam said shortly. He looked at Doug, who seemed less inebriated. \"Go get Melanie,\" he said, \"and tell her to call the police. Jeffrey Lovejoy\u0027s been murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious?\" Deborah demanded. The fierce light was in her face again. \"All right!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" said Cassie before she could stop herself. \"You haven\u0027t seen him. It\u0027s terrible- and it\u0027s nothing to joke about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam\u0027s arm shot out as Deborah started toward her. \"Why don\u0027t you help us instead of picking fights with our side? We\u0027re trying to trace the dark energy that killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dark energy,\" Deborah repeated scornfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie took a quick breath, but Nick was speaking. \"I think it\u0027s garbage too,\" he said calmly. \"But if it wasn\u0027t the dark energy, that means a person did it-like somebody who had a grudge against Jeffrey.\" He stared at Deborah, his eyes hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah stared back arrogantly. Cassie looked at her as she stood there in her short black tank dress-more like a sleeveless top than a dress-and her suede boots. Deborah was belligerent, antagonistic, hostile-and strong. For the first time in a long while Cassie noticed the crescent-moon tattoo on Deborah\u0027s collarbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you help us, Deborah?\" she said. \"This crystal is picking something up-or it was before we all started talking. Help us find what it\u0027s tracing.\" And then she added, inspired by some instinct below the level of consciousness, \"Of course, it\u0027s probably dangerous-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what? You think I\u0027m scared?\" Deborah demanded. \"All right, I\u0027m coming. You guys get out of here,\" she told the Hendersons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat to Cassie\u0027s surprise, Chris and Doug did, presumably going off to tell Melanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Cassie said, holding the crystal up again. She was afraid that it wouldn\u0027t do anything now that their concentration had been broken. And at first it simply hung at the end of the chain, swaying very slightly. But then, as the four of them stared at it, the swaying slowly became more pronounced. Cassie held her breath, trying to keep her hand from trembling. She didn\u0027t want to influence the crystal in any way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was definitely swinging now. In toward the boiler room and out toward the front of the school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Due east,\" Adam said in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding the crystal high in her left hand, Cassie followed the direction of the swing, down the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the moon was almost full, high in the sky, dropping west behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Blood Moon,\" Adam said quietly. Cassie remembered Diana saying that witches counted their year by moons, not months. The name of this one was hideously appropriate, but she didn\u0027t look back at it again. She was focusing on the crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first they walked through town, with closed stores and empty buildings on either side of them. Nothing stayed open past midnight in New Salem. Then the stores became less frequent, and there were a few clustered houses. Finally they were walking down a road which got lonelier and lonelier with every step, and all that surrounded them were the night noises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no human habitation out here, but the moon was bright enough to see by. Their shadows stretched in front of them as they went. The air was cold, and Cassie shivered without taking her eyes off the crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt something slip over her shoulders. Adam\u0027s jacket. She glanced at him gratefully, then quickly looked at the crystal again; if she faltered in her concentration it seemed to falter too, losing decisiveness and slowing almost to a random bobbing. It never swung as vigorously as the peridot had done for Diana-but then, Cassie wasn\u0027t Diana, and she didn\u0027t have a nearly-full coven to back her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her, she heard Adam say sharply, \"Nick?\" And then Deborah\u0027s derisive snort, \"I wouldn\u0027t take it, anyway. I never get cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were on a narrow dirt road now, still heading east. Suddenly Cassie had a terrible thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my God-Faye\u0027s house. That\u0027s where we set it loose and that\u0027s where we\u0027re going. We\u0027re going to trace this stuff all the way back to Faye\u0027s bedroom... and then what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coldness that went through her now was deeper and more numbing than the night wind. If the dark energy that had exploded through Faye\u0027s ceiling had killed Jeffrey, Cassie was as guilty as Faye was. She was a murderer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen stop tracing it, a thin voice inside her whispered. You\u0027re controlling the crystal; give it a twirl in the wrong direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t. She kept her eyes on the quartz teardrop, which seemed to shine with a milky light in the darkness, and she let it swing the way it wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the truth comes out, it comes out, she told herself coldly. And if she was a murderer, she deserved to be caught. She was going to follow this trail wherever it led.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it didn\u0027t seem to be leading to Crowhaven Road. They were still going east, not northeast. And suddenly the narrow, rutted road they were on began to seem familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp ahead she glimpsed a chain-link fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cemetery,\" Adam said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" said Deborah. \"Did you see-there, look!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At what, the cemetery?\" Adam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! At that thing-there it is again! Up there on the road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see anything,\" Nick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to. See, it\u0027s moving-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see a shadow,\" Adam said. \"Or maybe a possum or something...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s big,\" Deborah insisted. \"There! Can\u0027t you see that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie looked up at last; she couldn\u0027t help it. The lonely road in front of her seemed dark and still at first, but then she saw-something. A shadow, she thought... but a shadow of what? It didn\u0027t lie along the road as a shadow ought to. It seemed to be standing high, and it was moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see anything,\" Nick said again, curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027re blind,\" Deborah snapped. \"It\u0027s like a person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder Adam\u0027s jacket, Cassie\u0027s skin was rising in goose pimples. It did look like a person- except that it seemed to change every minute, now taller, now shorter, now wider, now thinner. At times it disappeared completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s heading for the cemetery,\" Deborah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No-look! It\u0027s veering off toward the shed,\" Adam cried. \"Nick, come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside the road was an abandoned shed. Even in the moonlight it was clear that it was falling to pieces. The dim shape seemed to whisk toward it, merging with the darkness behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam and Nick were running, Nick snarling, \"We\u0027re chasing after nothing!\" Deborah was standing poised, tense and alert, scanning the roadside. Cassie looked at the chain in dismay. Everyone\u0027s concentration had been shattered, the crystal was gyrating aimlessly. She looked up to say something-and drew in a quick breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There it is!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had reappeared beside the shed, and it was moving fast. It went through the chain-link fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah was after it in an instant, running like a deer. And Cassie, without any idea of what she was doing, was right behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam!\" she shouted. \"Nick! This way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah reached the waist-high fence and went over it, her tank dress not hindering her at all. Cassie reached it a second later, hesitated, then got a foothold in a chain link, flicking her skirts out of the way as she boosted herself over. She came down with a jolt that hurt her ankle, but there was no time to worry about it. Deborah was racing ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got it,\" Deborah shouted, suddenly pulling up short. \"I\u0027ve got it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie could see it just in front of Deborah. It had stopped in its straight-line flight and was darting from side to side as if looking for escape. Deborah was darting, too, blocking it as if she were a guard on a basketball team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe must be crazy, Cassie thought, as she reached the other girl. She couldn\u0027t leave Deborah to face the shadowy thing alone-but what were they going to do with it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a spell or something to hold it?\" she panted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah threw her a startled glance, and Cassie saw that she hadn\u0027t realized Cassie was behind her. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to trap it somehow! Is there a spell-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down!\" Deborah shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie dove for the ground. The shadow-thing had swelled suddenly to twice its size, like an infuriated cat, and then it had lunged at them. Straight at them. Cassie felt it rush over her head, colder than ice and blacker than the night sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah and Cassie sat up and looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam and Nick appeared, running. \"Are you all right?\" Adam demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Cassie said shakily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you two doing?\" Nick said, looking at them in disbelief. And even Adam asked, \"How did you get over the fence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah gave him a scornful look. \"I didn\u0027t mean you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie gave him a scornful look. \"Girls can climb,\" she said. She and Deborah stood up and began brushing each other off, exchanging a glance of complicity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gone now,\" Adam said, wisely dropping the subject of fences. \"But at least we know what it looks like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick made a derisive sound. \"What what looks like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t still say you didn\u0027t see it,\" Deborah said impatiently. \"It was here. It went for Cassie and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw something-but what makes you think it was this so-called dark energy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were tracing it,\" said Adam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do we know what we were tracing?\" Nick rapped back. \"Something that was around the place Lovejoy was killed, that\u0027s all. It could be the \u0027dark energy\u0027-or just some garden-variety ghost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A ghost?\" Cassie said, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. If you believe in them at all, some of them like to hang out where murders are committed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah spoke up eagerly. \"Yeah, like the Wailing Woman of Beverly, that lady in black that appears when somebody is going to die by violence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or that phantom ship in Kennybunk-the Isidore. The one that comes and shows you your coffin if you\u0027re going to die at sea,\" Adam said, looking thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie was confused. She\u0027d assumed it was the dark energy they were tracking-but who could tell? \"It did end up in the cemetery,\" she said slowly. \"Which seems like a logical place for a ghost. But if it wasn\u0027t the dark energy that killed Jeffrey, who was it? Who would want to kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she asked, she knew the answer. Vividly, in her mind, she saw Jeffrey standing between two girls: one tall, dark, and disturbingly beautiful; the other small and wiry, with rusty hair and a pugnacious face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faye or Sally,\" she whispered. \"They were both jealous tonight. But-oh, look, even if they were mad enough to kill him, neither of them could have actually done it! Jeffrey was an athlete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A witch could have done it,\" Deborah said matter-of-factly. \"Faye could\u0027ve made him do it to himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Sally\u0027s got friends on the football team,\" Nick added dryly. \"That\u0027s how she got herself voted Homecoming Queen. If they strangled him first, and then strung him up...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam was looking disturbed at this coldblooded discussion. \"You don\u0027t actually believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, a woman scorned, you know?\" Nick said. \"I\u0027m not saying either of them did it. I\u0027m saying either of them could have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we won\u0027t figure it out by standing here,\" Cassie said, shivering. Adam\u0027s jacket had slipped off when she went over the fence. \"Maybe if we could try to trace it again-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then she realized she wasn\u0027t holding the crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gone,\" she said. \"Melanie\u0027s crystal. I must have dropped it when that thing rushed us. It should be right here on the ground, then. It\u0027s got to be,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t. They all stooped to look, and Cassie combed through the sparse, withered grass with her fingers, but none of them could find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, this final disaster, incredibly tiny in comparison to everything that had happened that night, brought Cassie close to tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been in Melanie\u0027s family for generations,\" she said, blinking hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Melanie will understand,\" Adam told her gently. He put a hand on her shoulder, not easily but carefully, as if keenly aware that they were in front of witnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true, though; there\u0027s no point in standing around here,\" he said to the others. \"Let\u0027s get back to school. Maybe they\u0027ve found out something about Jeffrey there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Cassie walked, the Cinderella shoes hurting her feet and Laurel\u0027s silvery dress streaked with dirt, she found herself looking straight into the Blood Moon. It was hovering over New Salem like the Angel of Death, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, on the night of the full moon, the Circle would meet and celebrate. But on the day after Jeffrey\u0027s murder Diana was still sick, Faye was refusing to speak to anyone, and no one else had the heart to call a meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie spent the day feeling wretched. Last night at the high school the police had found no leads as to Jeffrey\u0027s killer. They hadn\u0027t said if he\u0027d been strangled first and then hung, or if he\u0027d just been hung. They weren\u0027t saying much of anything, and they didn\u0027t like questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie had been kind about the necklace, but Cassie still felt guilty. She\u0027d used it to go off on what turned out to be a wild-goose chase, and then she\u0027d lost it. But far worse was the feeling of guilt over Jeffrey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she hadn\u0027t danced with him, maybe Faye and Sally wouldn\u0027t have been so angry. If she hadn\u0027t let Faye have the skull, then the dark energy wouldn\u0027t have been released. However she looked at it, she felt responsible, and she hadn\u0027t slept all night for thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to talk?\" her grandmother said, looking up from the table where she was cutting ginger root. The archaic kitchen which had seemed so bewildering to Cassie when she\u0027d first come to New Salem was now a sort of haven. There was always something to do here, cutting or drying or preserving the herbs from her grandmother\u0027s garden, and there was often a fire in the hearth. It was a cheerful, homey place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Grandma,\" Cassie said, then stopped. She wanted to talk, yes, but how could she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at her grandmother\u0027s wrinkled hands spreading the root in a wooden rack for drying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, Cassie, that I\u0027m always here for you-and so is your mother,\" her grandmother went on. She threw a sudden sharp glance up at the kitchen doorway, and Cassie saw that her mother was standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Blake\u0027s large dark eyes were fixed on Cassie, and Cassie thought there was something sad in them. Ever since they\u0027d come on this \"vacation\" to Massachusetts, her mother had looked troubled, but these days there was a kind of tired wistfulness in her face that puzzled Cassie. Her mother was so beautiful, and so young-looking, and the new helplessness in her expression made her seem even younger than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you know, Cassie, that if you\u0027re truly unhappy here-\" her mother began, with a kind of defiance in her gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie\u0027s grandmother had stiffened, and her hands stopped spreading the root.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-we don\u0027t have to stay,\" her mother finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie was astounded. After all she\u0027d been through those first weeks in New Salem, after all those nights she\u0027d wanted to die from homesickness-now her mother said they could go? But even stranger was the way Cassie\u0027s grandmother was glaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Running away has never solved anything,\" the older woman said. \"Haven\u0027t you learned that yet? Haven\u0027t we all-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are two children dead,\" Cassie\u0027s mother said. \"And if Cassie wants to leave here, we will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie looked from one to the other in bewilderment. What were they talking about? \"Mom,\" she said abruptly, \"why did you bring me here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother and grandmother were still looking at each other-a battle of wills, Cassie thought. Then Cassie\u0027s mother looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you at dinner,\" she said, and just as suddenly as she\u0027d appeared, she slipped out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie\u0027s grandmother let out a long sigh. Her old hands trembled slightly as she picked up another root.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are some things you can only understand later,\" she said to Cassie, after a moment. \"You\u0027ll have to trust us for that, Cassie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does this have something to do with why you and Mom were estranged for so long? Does it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause. Then her grandmother said softly, \"You\u0027ll just have to trust us...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie opened her mouth, then shut it again. There was no use in pressing it any further. As she\u0027d already learned, her family was very good at keeping secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d go to the cemetery, she decided. She could use the fresh air, and maybe if she found Melanie\u0027s crystal she would feel a little better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce there, she wished she\u0027d asked Laurel to go along. Even though the October sun was bright, the air was nippy, and something about the dispirited graveyard made Cassie uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if ghosts come out in the daytime, she thought, as she located the place where she and Deborah had had to throw themselves facedown. But no ghosts appeared. Nothing moved except the tips of the grass which rippled in the breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie\u0027s eyes scanned the ground, looking for any glint of bright silver chain or clear quartz. She went over the area inch by inch. The chain had to be right here... but it wasn\u0027t. At last she gave up and sat back on her heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when she noticed the mound again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d forgotten to ask her grandmother about it. She\u0027d have to remember tonight. She got up and walked over to it, looking at it curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy daylight, she could see that the iron door was rusty. The padlock was rusty too, but it looked fairly modern. The cement chunk in front of the door was large; she didn\u0027t see how it could have gotten there. It was certainly too heavy for a person to carry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why would somebody want to carry it there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie turned away from the mound. The graves on this side of the cemetery were modern too; she\u0027d seen them before. The writing on the tombstones was actually legible. Eve Dulany, 1955-1976, she read. Dulany was Sean\u0027s last name; this must be his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next stone had two names: David Quincey, 1955-1976, and Melissa B. Quincey, 1955-1976. Laurel\u0027s parents, Cassie thought. God, it must be awful to have both your parents dead. But Laurel wasn\u0027t the only kid on Crowhaven Road who did. Right here beside the Quincey headstone was another marker: Nicholas Armstrong, 1951-1976; Sharon Armstrong, 1953-1976. Nick\u0027s mom and dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she saw the third headstone, the hairs on Cassie\u0027s arms began to prickle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda Whittier, she read. Born 1954, died 1976. Suzan\u0027s mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDied 1976.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharply, Cassie turned to look at the Armstrong headstone again. She\u0027d been right-both of Nick\u0027s parents had died in 1976. And the Quinceys... she was walking faster now. Yes. 1976 again. And Eve Dulany, too: died 1976.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething rippled up Cassie\u0027s spine and she almost ran to the headstones on the far side of the mound. Mary Meade-Diana\u0027s mother- died 1976. Marshall Glaser and Sophia Burke Glaser. Melanie\u0027s parents. Died 1976. Grant Chamberlain. Faye\u0027s father. Died 1976. Adrian and Elizabeth Conant. Adam\u0027s parents. Died 1976.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNineteen seventy-six. Nineteen seventy-six! There was a terrible shaking in Cassie\u0027s stomach and the hairs on the back of her neck were quivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat in God\u0027s name had happened in New Salem in 1976? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-captive-the-secret-circle-2/page-7.html","bookId":2096,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:16 PM"}
