I believe it now.\" She shook her head slowly. \"I try to water them but the pressure is off. They must be repairing pipes in the neighborhood or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know why it struck me with such vivid force at that moment. Perhaps the mundane quality of what she said. But I remembered Albert\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no point in your trying to convince her that she\u0027s not alive; she thinks she is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the true horror of this situation. If she knew that she\u0027d committed suicide and that this was the end result, some kind of approach might be made. As it was, there could be no possible meaning to this plight for her, no logic whatever to this dismal state in which she found herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really didn\u0027t know what to say, yet, once more, heard myself speaking. \"I have water in my house,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned as though surprised by my continued presence. \"How can that be?\" she asked. She looked confused and irritated. \"What about electricity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have that too,\" I said, realizing, then, why I\u0027d spoken as I had. I was hoping that she\u0027d discover, by comparison, that what was happening in her house was, logically, unrealistic and, thus, be led to examine her surroundings more closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your gas service?\" I asked, pursuing the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s off too,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine isn\u0027t,\" I replied. \"What about your telephone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s ... out of order,\" she said. I felt a momentary glimmer of expectancy at her tone-- one which asked of itself: How can this be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" I said, trying to press my advantage. \"It doesn\u0027t make sense that all your services would be out at the same time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it\u0027s ... odd.\" She stared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very odd,\" I said. \"That only your house would have none of them? I wonder why ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched her carefully. Was any degree of awareness reaching her? I waited anxiously to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf convincing her was all that simple, in all likelihood someone would have done it already. I knew that as a look of apathy replaced the one of doubt--replaced it instantly. She shrugged. \"Because I\u0027m on a hilltop,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why--?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke in. \"Would you call the phone company for me and tell them my service is out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her, confounded by my own frustration. For a moment, I had a reckless urge to tell her everything directly--who I was and why she was there. Something held me from it though, sensing the peril of attempting to convince her that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother idea occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you come to my house and call them yourself?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... don\u0027t leave,\" she said. \"I just--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" My voice was edged with impatience now, I was so disturbed by my failure to help her in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t leave,\" she repeated. She averted her face but, before she did, I saw the beginning of tears in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think but reached out automatically to comfort her. Ginger growled and I drew back my hand. Would I feel it if she attacked, the thought occurred? Could I bleed, suffer pain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pool looks so awful,\" Ann said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sense of cold despair again. How terrible her existence was, spending endless days in this place, unable to do anything to ease its drab appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to love it out here,\" she said, unhappily. \"It was my favorite place. Now look at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy question was answered. I could suffer pain at that level. I felt it deeply as I looked at her, recalling how she used to come out on the deck each morning with her coffee, sit in the sunshine in her nightgown and robe and gaze across the crystal water of the rock- edged pool, looking at the lush planting we\u0027d put in. She had loved it; very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tone grew sardonic. \"Some exclusive area,\" she said. \"Yet everything works at my house,\" I said, trying again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How nice for you,\" she responded coldly; and I knew, in that instant, that no approach could work twice. I was back to square one in mis dreadful game, forced to start all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence once more. Ann standing motionless, looking across the ugly expanse of the pool, Ginger beside her, eyes fixed on me. What was I to do? I wondered in discouragement. It seemed as though the more time passed, the less aware of possibilities I became.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself to concentrate. Was that the danger Albert had warned me about? That I would let these dismal surroundings draw me in and make me part of them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have children?\" I asked on impulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to look at me with distant appraisal. Then she answered. \"Four.\" Looking away again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to ask about them when I decided to attempt, once more, to set up, in her mind, a series of provoking \"coincidences.\" The area of children hadn\u0027t been approached yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have four children too,\" I said. \"Two daughters and two sons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" she said without turning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My two girls are twenty-six and twenty,\" I told her. \"My sons are twenty-three and seventeen.\" Was I pressing too far? I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was looking at me again. Her expression hadn\u0027t changed but it seemed to me there was a tightening around her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI braced myself and said, \"My children\u0027s names are Louise, Marie, Richard and Ian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she was drawing back again, a distrustful look on her face. The expression of a woman who sensed that she was being baited but didn\u0027t know how or why. I felt a pang of fear at that expression. Had I made a dreadful mistake?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as I wondered that, I heard myself ask, \"What are your children\u0027s names?\" She said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Nielsen?\" I said. I\u0027d almost called her Ann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat look of filming across her eyes again--and sudden, gut-wrenched realization on my part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how close I came, I could never reach her. Whenever I came too close, something built-in would affect her, causing her to cut herself off. Already, she had mentally shrugged off my words, perhaps blanked them out entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet still I went on with a kind of blind, unwilling dread. \"My older girl is married and has three children of her own,\" I said. \"My younger girl--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI broke off as she turned away and started toward the house, the dead bird dropping, unnoticed, from her hands. I started after her but Ginger, at her heels, looked back with a warning growl. I stopped and watched Ann moving off from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad the end already come?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Ann glanced aside and made a sickened noise, then ran inside the house through the family room doorway, sliding the glass door shut with a bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the ground where she\u0027d glanced and saw a huge tarantula crawling over a rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned, not out of fear of the tarantula but at the realization that one of Ann\u0027s deepest fears was embodied here. She\u0027d always been terrified of tarantulas, made virtually ill by the sight of them. How hideously predictable that her private hell would include these giant spiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking over to the tarantula, I looked down at it. Bulbous and hairy, it clambered sluggishly across the rock. I looked around and saw Ann at the glass door, looking at it in panicked revulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around again and saw a shovel leaning against the house. Moving to it, I picked it up and returned to the tarantula. I angled the blade in front of it until it had crawled onto the metal. Then, carrying the shovel to the edge of the deck, I flung the spider as far as I could, wondering, as it arced across the pool and into the ivy, whether it was real or not. Did it exist on its own or only because Ann feared it? I looked toward the family room door as it was opened slightly. And my heart leaped as I saw a look of childlike gratitude on Ann\u0027s face. \"Thank you,\" she murmured. Even in Hell there can be gratitude, I thought in wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved quickly to strengthen my position. \"I noticed that your Sparklett\u0027s bottle is empty,\" I said. \"May I put up a new one for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked immediately suspicious and I almost groaned at the sight. \"What do you want?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself to smile. \"Just to say hello,\" I told her. \"Invite you to my house for coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you I don\u0027t leave,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you ever go for walks?\" I asked, trying to sound pleasantly casual. She and I had walked a lot in Hidden Hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted her to realize her isolation and to question it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe questioned nothing, turning from me as though my words had offended her. I followed her inside the house and shut the glass door. As I did, Ann turned to look at me and Ginger growled again, her neck fur raised, A vision of endlessly futile attempts to reach Ann\u0027s mind assailed me. I struggled with despair again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I became aware of the dozens of framed photographs on the walls and another idea occurred. If I could get her to look at one of the photographs of me, the obvious similarity to my present appearance might impress her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring Ginger\u0027s growl, I moved to the nearest wall and looked for a photograph of myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the photographs were faded and impossible to make out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did that happen? I wondered. Was it part of Ann\u0027s self-denying punishment? I was going to mention it, then changed my mind. It could only disturb her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother idea. I turned to her and said, \"I wasn\u0027t really telling you the truth before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me, suspiciously uncertain. \"My wife and I are separated,\" I said, \"but not in the way you may think. We\u0027re separated by death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt myself wince at the spasmodic shudder my words caused in her; the look on her face as though a knife had just been plunged into her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I had to pursue it, hoping I was finally on the right track. \"Her name was Ann too,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like it here in Hidden Hills?\" she asked as though I hadn\u0027t spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear me?\" I asked. \"Where did you live before?\" \"I said her name was Ann.\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shudder again, the expression of staggered dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the empty look returning. She moved away from me, headed for the kitchen. Ann, come back, I wanted to say; I almost did. I wanted to shout: It\u0027s me, don\u0027t you understand?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t. And, like a cold weight in my chest, depression returned. I tried to resist but, this time, I was less successful. Some of it remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at this place,\" Ann said. She spoke as though she was alone, her voice mechanical. I had the feeling it was part of the process she endured; constant repetition of the details of her plight reinforcing her bondage to them. \"Nothing works,\" she said. \"The food is spoiling. I can\u0027t open cans because there\u0027s no electricity and the hand opener is gone. Without water, I can\u0027t do the dishes and they keep piling up. There\u0027s no TV; I think it\u0027s broken anyway. No radio, no phonograph, no music. No heat except for scraps of wood I burn; the house is chilly all the time. I have to go to bed at dark because there are no lights and all the candles are gone. The rubbish company never picks up anymore. The whole place smells of trash and garbage. And I can\u0027t complain about anything because the phone is out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke off her somber catechism with a laugh that chilled me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put up a Sparklett\u0027s bottle?\" she said. \"They haven\u0027t made a delivery in such a long time I can\u0027t remember the last one.\" She laughed again, a dreadful, bitter sound. \"The good life,\" she said. \"I swear to God I feel like a character in some Neil Simon play, everything around me falling apart, everything inside me shriveling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sob shook her body and I started toward her instinctively. Ginger blocked my way, teeth bared, a fierce growl rumbling in her chest. She looked like a hound of hell, I thought, despair returning again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Ann. I knew exactly what she was doing but I had no strength to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was fleeing from the truth by immersing herself in the relative safety of afflictive details--the sheltering of melancholy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/what-dreams-may-come/page-30.html","bookId":2541,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:37 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:37 AM"}
