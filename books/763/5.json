It is only by serving those beyond ourselves that we can secure for ourselves protection, sympathy, or honour. The neglect of home for public affairs endangers philanthropy, by making it the enemy of the household. To suffer, on the other hand, the interests of the family to degenerate into mere selfism, is a dangerous example to rulers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n II.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No man or woman is accountable to others for any conduct by which others are not injured or damaged.\"*\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;* D. \u0026nbsp; in the LEADER, \u0026nbsp;1850, who, as a correspondent, first\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;expressed this aphorism thus.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n III.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Social freedom consists in being subject to just rule and to none other.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n IV.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Service and endurance are the chief personal duties of man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n V.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Secularism holds it to be the duty of every man to reserve a portion of his means and energies for the public service, and so to cultivate and cherish his powers, mental and physical, as to have them ever ready to perform service, as efficient as possible, to the well-being of humanity. No weakness, no passion, no wavering, should be found among those who are battling for the cause of human welfare, which such errors may fatally injure. Self-control, self-culture, self-sacrifice, are all essential to those who would serve that cause, and would not bring discredit upon their comrades in that service.*\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;* Mr. L.

In other words, Secularist union implies the concerted action of all who believe it right to promote the Secular good of this life, to teach morality, founded upon the laws of Nature, and to seek human improvement by material methods, irrespective of any other opinions held, and irrespective of any diversity of reasons for holding these.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3200/87439.html","bookId":763,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:03:45 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:03:45 PM"}
