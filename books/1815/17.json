She said the word and I stopped. I reminded her often, made sure she always knew that the choice to cease or continue rested entirely with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’d failed to make the connection when it came to her job. It was inexcusable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned toward her. “Angel, I didn’t mean to make you feel powerless. I would never. Ever. I didn’t think of it that way. I’m … I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words weren’t enough; they never were. I wanted to be her fresh start, her new beginning. How could I be when I was acting like the assholes in her past?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me with those eyes that saw everything I’d rather keep hidden. For once, I was grateful that she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer combative posture relaxed. Her gaze softened with love. “Maybe I haven’t been explaining myself well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there, unable to express what was churning through my mind. When we talked about being a team and sharing our burdens, I hadn’t related it to her needing the power to agree or disagree. I thought I could shield her from the troubles we faced and make things smoother for her. Eva deserved that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe poked my shoulder. “Didn’t it feel good, even a little bit, to talk to me about your dream last night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” I exhaled harshly. “I just know you’re happy with me because I did. If that’s what it takes … then that’s what I’ll do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sank back into the sofa cushions, her lips trembling. She looked at Dr. Petersen. “And now I feel guilty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. I didn’t know what to say. Dr. Petersen just waited with that maddening patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEva took a deep, shaky breath. “I was thinking if he’d just try it my way, he’d see how much better it could be between us. But if I’m just pushing him into a corner … if I’m just blackmailing him …” A tear slid down her face, cutting into me like a blade. “Maybe we have different ideas about what our marriage should be. What if that’s not going to change?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva.” I put my arm around her and pulled her closer, grateful when she leaned into me and put her head on my shoulder. Not surrender. More like a momentary truce. Good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s an important question,” Dr. Petersen said. “So let’s explore it. What if the level of disclosure you want from Gideon isn’t something he will ever feel comfortable with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” She swiped at her tears. “I don’t know where that leaves us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the hope she’d had when we entered the room was gone. Stroking her hair, I tried to come up with something to say that would take things back to the way they’d been when we arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLost, I told her, “You quit your job for me, even though you didn’t want to. I told you about my dream, even though I didn’t want to. Isn’t that how this works? We both compromise?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You left your job, Eva?” Dr. Petersen asked. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe curled into my side. “It was starting to cause more trouble than it was worth. Besides, Gideon’s right—he gave a little, so it seems only fair to give a little, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t say what either of you compromised was ‘little.’ And both of you chose to open our session with other things first, which suggests neither of you are completely comfortable with the sacrifice.” He sat back, setting his tablet in his lap. “Have either of you asked yourselves why you’re in such a hurry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. “You’re both frowning, so I’ll take that as a no. As a couple, you have a lot of strengths. You may not be sharing everything, but you’re communicating and you’re doing so productively. There’s some anger and frustration, but you’re expressing them and validating each other’s feelings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEva straightened. “But …?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re also both pushing personal agendas and manipulating each other to make them happen. My concern is that they’re issues and changes that would naturally present themselves and be resolved in time, but neither of you wants to wait. You’re both driving your relationship forward on an accelerated schedule. It’s only been three months since you two met for the first time. At this point, most couples are deciding to date exclusively, but you two have been married for nearly a month.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my shoulders going back. “What’s the point in delaying the inevitable?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it’s inevitable,” he responded, his eyes kind, “why rush it? But that’s not my point. You’re both jeopardizing your marriage by forcing each other to act before you’re ready. You each have ways of coping with adverse situations. Gideon, you disassociate, as you’ve done with your family. Eva, you blame yourself for why the relationship isn’t working and start subverting your own needs, as you’ve demonstrated with your previous self-destructive romantic relationships. If you continue to maneuver each other into situations where you feel threatened, you will eventually trigger one of these self-defense mechanisms.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-17.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
