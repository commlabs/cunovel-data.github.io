There are large wooden balls, painted with different colours, that you have to roll about; and arches of wire, that you have to send them through; and great wooden mallets, with long handles, to knock the balls about with.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now look at the picture, and you’ll see that Alice has just been playing a Game of Croquet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But she couldn’t play, with that great red what’s-its-name in her arms! Why, how could she hold the mallet?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Alice holding a flamingo and talking to the Duchess\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Why, my dear Child, that great red what’s-its-name (its real name is “a Flamingo”) is the mallet! In this Croquet-Game, the balls were[46] live Hedge-hogs——you know a hedge-hog can roll itself up into a ball?——and the mallets were live Flamingos!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So Alice is just resting from the Game, for a minute, to have a chat with that dear old thing, the Duchess: and of course she keeps her mallet under her arm, so as not to lose it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But I don’t think she was a dear old thing, one bit! To call her Baby a Pig, and to want to chop off Alice’s head!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, that was only a joke, about chopping off Alice’s head: and as to the Baby——why, it was a Pig, you know! And just look at her smile! Why, it’s wider than all Alice’s head: and yet you can only see half of it!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, they’d only had a very little chat, when the Queen came and took Alice away, to see the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You don’t know what a Gryphon is? Well! Do you know anything? That’s the question. However, look at the picture. That creature with a red head, and red claws, and green scales, is the Gryphon. Now you know.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the other’s the Mock Turtle. It’s got a calf’s-head, because calf’s head is used to make Mock Turtle Soup. Now you know.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But what are they doing, going round and round Alice like that?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Why, I thought of course you’d know that! They’re dancing a Lobster-Quadrille.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alice, Gryphon, and Mock Turtle\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And next time you meet a Gryphon and a Mock Turtle, I daresay they’ll dance it for you, if you ask them prettily. Only don’t let them come quite close, or they’ll be treading on your toes, as they did on poor Alice’s.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1831/53099.html","bookId":630,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:06:03 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:06:03 PM"}
