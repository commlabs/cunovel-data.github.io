The raccoons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a man - \" I frowned. \"Didn\u0027t you see him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You were talking to yourself when I got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was not. There was a man.\" I waved my hand. \"He was wearing pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always a good choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But nothing else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even better. The last time I met a naked man in the forest it was the start of something big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t naked. Completely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman shrugged. \"Too bad. Where\u0027d he go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure there was a man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I? Yes. Definitely. I hadn\u0027t lost my mind since... I\u0027d found it the last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said his name was Damien Fitzgerald. Don\u0027t you know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t say that I do. But then Mandenauer and I just got here last week. From what you\u0027re telling me, he sounds like a prime candidate for the fanged and furry club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I heard what she\u0027d said, what she\u0027d been saying. She knew about the Juger-Suchers,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the werewolves, Edward. The guy I was supposed to train had just turned into a girl. \"You\u0027re...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessie McQuade. And you must be Leigh, my trainer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled. We\u0027d see about that. I could think of few things I\u0027d like to do less than teach this spectacularly competent woman all my tricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are Leigh,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took that as a yes. \"Mandenauer is waiting at my place. Follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout so much as a by-your-leave, she kicked apart the remnants of the fire and stomped on the cinders. Then she marched back in the direction I\u0027d come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze scanned the clearing, but there was no sign of the half-naked man. I even hurried to the place I\u0027d last seen him and crouched in the leaves to examine the ground for a footprint. But the earth was hard and he\u0027d been wearing... hardly anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wolf howled near enough to make me jump, far enough away so that I followed Jessie at a walk instead of a run. I wasn\u0027t going to let her, or them, know just how spooked I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad there been a man named Damien? Probably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he merely a man? Or had he been more? I might never know that for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie\u0027s place was an apartment located in a small complex adjacent to the sheriff\u0027s office. I parked beside the squad car and followed her up the flight of stairs to the second floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really a cop?\" I asked. \"Or is this just pretend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t elaborate and irritation flared again. Jessie got to do her chosen job while she saved the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to pretend I was a warden and earn the scorn of every community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t exactly be a werewolf hunter and a kindergarten teacher. The very thought was ludicrous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door sprang open before she could touch it, and a tall, emaciated silhouette spread across the hall floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie cast me a quick, surprised glance, and I realized I\u0027d said his name aloud in a delighted voice that didn\u0027t belong to me. I couldn\u0027t afford attachments, not even to him, so I straightened my shoulders, cleared my throat, and stuck out my hand. \"Good to see you, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez, why don\u0027t you click your heels and salute,\" Jessie muttered, pushing past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward Mandenauer was as unlikely a leader of an elite monster-hunting unit as could be imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadaverous thin, he owned every one of his eighty-plus years. But he could still pull the trigger, and he\u0027d killed more monsters than anyone, even me. I admired him. More than I would ever say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you not come directly to me, Leigh?\" Edward stepped back so I could enter the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You took a detour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know?\" I scowled. \"How did she find me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your car was abandoned in town. Jessie ran the license plate, then tracked you into the woods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy interest was piqued. Tracking had never been my strong suit. I wasn\u0027t patient enough. Jessie had to be very good to have found me as quickly as she had in the thickness of a forest that must be as strange to her as it was to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the look of the bonfire,\" Jessie tattled, \"she\u0027s already started blasting away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my job,\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girls, girls,\" Mandenauer admonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call me a girl,\" Jessie and I said at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe glanced at each other, scowled, and turned away. Mandenauer sighed. \"You need to work together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is something odd happening in Crow Valley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat got my attention. \"Odder than werewolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To be sure. Did you make note of the name of this fair city?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow Valley. I hadn\u0027t thought about it. Stupid me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor reasons unknown to science, wolves allow crows to scavenge from their kills. Some naturalists believe that the birds fly ahead, locate suitable prey, then circle back and lead the wolves to it. In gratitude, or perhaps as payment for services rendered, the wolves don\u0027t chase the crows off the corpses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether this is true or not is anyone\u0027s guess. But the fact remains, where there are a lot of one, there are a lot of the other. Wolves feel at home around crows. Werewolves appear to as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wolves in this area have always been abundant, but they increased in number recently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you know this how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just gave me one of his stares. Edward knew everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the sheriff in this town left - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Left or was eaten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not eaten. Not this time. The odd occurrences with the wolves disturbed him. He called the authorities with his tall tales, and I was notified. I convinced him to take a leave of absence, then gave Jessie his job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou think there are a lot of conspiracies in the government? You don\u0027t even know about the ones Edward is involved with. Any odd report - unexplained events, wolves run amok, monstrosities wandering over hill and dale - the information is forwarded to Edward and he sends a Juger-Sucher to determine what needs to be done, then do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Jessie\u0027s other job?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had accomplished all we could in Miniwa. The wolves ran from there. We waited, but they did not return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at Jessie. \"Tell her what we know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie hesitated, but in the end she shrugged and flopped onto the couch, gesturing me into a chair nearby. The apartment was sparsely but adequately furnished, as if she\u0027d only brought the essentials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo pictures on the walls, no knickknacks on the tables, though Jessie hardly seemed the knickknack type. Instead, every spare surface was covered with books, papers, notebooks. She didn\u0027t seem the studious type, either, but then what did I know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Werewolves are being killed in Crow Valley,\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may wonder how we know the difference between a dead wolf and a dead werewolf. I\u0027ll let you in on a little secret. If you shoot them with silver, they explode. Live or dead, doesn\u0027t matter. I kind of like putting a bullet into the dead ones. Call me sick. Everyone else does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were being killed before we got here,\" Jessie continued. \"From what I can tell, it started a little over three weeks ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up straighter in my chair. A little over three weeks ago would have been the last full moon. That couldn\u0027t be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Edward. \"You\u0027ve got no one working in Crow Valley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rogue agent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doubtful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the werewolves are not being killed with silver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how can they be dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is only one other way to kill a werewolf,\" Edward said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come I never heard of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it rarely happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only other way to kill a werewolf, besides the silver, is for a werewolf to kill one of its own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They never kill their own kind. It\u0027s against the werewolf rules of conduct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently we have come across one who can\u0027t read.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumor again. What was wrong with the man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolves and werewolves may appear the same,\" Jessie said, \"but they\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit,\" I muttered. I was already sick of Miss Know-It-All-Come-Lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored me. Point for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Though it\u0027s rare, wolves will kill another wolf, but werewolves won\u0027t. They\u0027ll fight, drive one another from their territory, but they won\u0027t kill. I\u0027d say it was a remnant of their humanity shining through, but we all know that most humans aren\u0027t very humane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s going on?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what we\u0027re trying to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What difference does it make who kills them as long as they\u0027re dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie glanced at Edward and he took over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does not matter who kills them. What matters is that there is a werewolf out there behaving unlike a werewolf. I do not like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last time one of them behaved oddly, we met the wolf god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think someone\u0027s trying to raise another wolf god?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"A wolf god can only be brought forth under the blue moon. That time is past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not know. But I have a very bad feeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been around Edward long enough to understand that when he had a very bad feeling, the shit was usually going to hit the fan real soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the plan?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You teach Jessie all that she needs to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I demanded. \"You\u0027ve always taught the new guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not as young as I used to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, join the club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips twitched, almost as if he might laugh. Wonders never ceased these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have enlisted the help of an expert to search the pages of history. Perhaps we will find a mention of what they are up to this time before it is too late. Until then, I must go back to headquarters. Elise needs my help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise was Dr. Hanover, head research scientist at the Jdger-Sucher Compound in Montana and Edward\u0027s right hand. There was something else between them, too, though I\u0027d never quite figured out what that something was. He was old enough to be her grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to leave me alone with her!\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are at least four hundred people in this town. You will not be alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what?\" Jessie stood and put her hands on her hips. \"I don\u0027t need her help. I did Justine in Miniwa without any training at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I heard about that,\" I sneered. \"Thanks to you, the werewolf population has doubled in this area and there are fresh new recruits running all over Canada. I just spent the last three months thinning them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie\u0027s fingers clenched into fists, and she took one step toward me before the apartment door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had only an instant to register that a man was running through the room; then he grabbed Jessie around the waist and lifted her off her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started forward, but Mandenauer\u0027s hand on my arm stopped me. Good thing, too, because the guy locked lips with Jessie and the two of them shared the deepest, hottest, wettest kiss I\u0027d ever witnessed outside of a pornographic movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I should look away, but I couldn\u0027t tear my eyes from the sight. In my line of work, I didn\u0027t get a chance to see much affection. I didn\u0027t get a chance to see anything but death, and that was the way I wanted it. So why was I watching Jessie and whoever with misty, longing eyes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I\u0027d caught my first sight of a half-naked male in several years. My libido was acting up. My skin felt prickly, my stomach wobbly. I couldn\u0027t get Damien Fitzgerald out of my head, and that just wasn\u0027t like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stared into Jessie\u0027s face and very gently touched her cheek with his knuckle. She smiled and covered his hand with hers. It was as if Edward and I, maybe the whole world, didn\u0027t exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue love. Hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s going to get us killed,\" I muttered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-3.html","bookId":2089,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM"}
