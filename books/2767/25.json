I mean, you know he\u0027s gone and all, but it\u0027s like you\u0027re in this fog. Then life kind of gets into a routine and you follow it.\" He shrugs. \"Eventually you stop thinkin\u0027 about it so much and move on. There\u0027s no other choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s kind of like a test.\" I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror on the opposite wall. I absently run my fingers through my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re always doin\u0027 that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doing what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fixin\u0027 your hair or makeup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027s wrong with trying to look good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothin\u0027, unless it becomes an obsession.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands down, wishing I could superglue them to my sides. \"I\u0027m not obsessed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs. \"Is it so important that people think you\u0027re beautiful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what people think,\" I lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Cause you are . . . beautiful, I mean. But it shouldn\u0027t matter so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that. But expectations mean a lot where I come from. Speaking of expectations . . . \"What did Mrs. Peterson say to you after class?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, the usual. That if I don\u0027t take her class seriously she\u0027ll make my life miserable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow, not knowing if I should reveal my plan. \"I\u0027m going to tell her you switched the tests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do that,\" he says, stepping away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it doesn\u0027t matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it does. You need good grades to get into . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? A good college? Give me a fuckin\u0027 break. I\u0027m not goin\u0027 to college and you know it. You rich kids worry about your GPA as if it\u0027s a symbol of your worth. I don\u0027t need it, so don\u0027t do me any favors. I\u0027ll get by with a C in that class. Just make sure those hand warmers kick ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I have anything to do about it, we\u0027ll get an A+ on the project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your room?\" I ask, changing the subject. I drop my book bag on the living room floor. \"A bedroom tells a lot about a person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestures to a doorway off to one side. Three beds take up most of the small space, with enough room for one small dresser. I walk around the small room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I share it with my two brothers,\" he states. \"Not a lot of privacy here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me guess which bed is yours,\" I say, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scan the areas around each bed. A small picture of a pretty Hispanic girl is taped to one wall. \"Hmmm . . . ,\" I murmur, glancing at Alex and wondering if the girl staring back at me is his ideal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly walk around him and examine the next bed. Pictures of soccer players are taped above it. The bed is messy, and clothes are strewn from the pillow to the foot of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing adorns the wall by the third bed, as if the person who sleeps here is a visitor. It\u0027s almost sad, the first two walls saying so much about the people who sleep below them and this one totally bare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on Alex\u0027s bed, the hopeless and empty one, and my eyes meet his. \"Your bed says a lot about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? What does it say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder why you don\u0027t think you\u0027ll stay here long,\" I say. \"Unless it\u0027s because you really do want to go to college.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans on the door frame. \"I\u0027m not leavin\u0027 Fairfield. Ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you want a degree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you sound like the damn career counselor at school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to get away and start living your own life? Away from your past?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see goin\u0027 to college as an escape,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Escape? Alex, you have no clue. I\u0027m going to a college that\u0027s close to my sister. First it was Northwestern, now it\u0027s the University of Colorado. My life is dictated by the whims of my parents and where they want to send my sister. You want the easy way out, so you stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think it\u0027s a breeze being the man of the house? Shit, makin\u0027 sure my mama doesn\u0027t get mixed up with some loser or that my brothers don\u0027t start shootin\u0027 shit up their arms or smokin\u0027 crack is enough to keep me here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I warned you never to pity me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I say, my eyes moving up to meet his. \"You feel such a family connection, yet you don\u0027t place anything permanent beside your bed, as if you\u0027re going to leave at any moment. I feel sorry for you about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps back, shutting me out. \"You done with the psychoanalysis?\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow him into the family room, still wondering what Alex wants for his future. It seems the guy is ready to leave this house ... or this earth. Could it be in some way Alex is preparing for his death by not placing anything permanent beside him? That he\u0027s destined to end up like his father?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that what he meant by his demons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next two hours, we sit on his family room couch and hatch a plan for our hand warmers. He\u0027s a lot smarter than I\u0027d realized; that A on his test wasn\u0027t a fluke. He has a lot of ideas about how we can research online and get information from the library on how to construct the hand warmers and various uses for them to incorporate into our paper. We need the chemicals Mrs. Peterson will provide, Ziploc bags to enclose the chemicals, and to get extra brownie points we\u0027ve decided to encase the Ziploc bags in material we\u0027ll pick out at the fabric store. I purposely keep the discussion on chemistry, careful not to touch on any subject too personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I close my chemistry book, out of the corner of my eye I see Alex run his hand through his hair. \"Listen, I didn\u0027t mean to be rude to you before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay. I got too nosy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand, feeling uncomfortable. He grabs my arm and urges me back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he says, \"I mean you\u0027re right about me. I don\u0027t place anything permanent here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad,\" Alex says, staring at the picture on the opposite wall. He squeezes his eyes shut. \"God, there was so much blood.\" He opens his eyes and captures my gaze. \"If there\u0027s one thing I learned, it\u0027s that nobody is here forever. You have to live for the moment, each and every day . . . the here, the now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do you want right now?\" Right now I itch to heal his wounds and forget my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touches my cheek with the tips of his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath hitches. \"Do you want to kiss me, Alex?\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dios mio, I want to kiss you ... to taste your lips, your tongue.\" He gently traces my lips with the tips of his fingers. \"Do you want me to kiss you? Nobody else would know but the two of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 32 Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany\u0027s tongue snakes out to wet her perfect heart-shaped lips, which are now shiny and oh, so inviting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tease me like that,\" I groan, my lips inches from hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer books hit the carpet. Her eyes follow, but if I lose her attention, I may never get this moment back. My fingers move to her chin, gently urging her to look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up at me with those vulnerable eyes. \"What if it means something?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if it does?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise me it won\u0027t mean anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean my head back on the couch. \"It won\u0027t mean anythin\u0027.\" Aren\u0027t I supposed to be the guy in this scenario, laying down the no-commitment rules?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And no tongue,\" she adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mi vida, if I kiss you, I guarantee there\u0027s gonna be tongue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise it won\u0027t mean anythin\u0027,\" I assure her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really don\u0027t expect her to do it. I think she\u0027s teasing me, testing to see how much I can take before I crack. But as her eyelids close and she leans closer, I realize it\u0027s going to happen. This girl of my dreams, this girl who is more like me than anyone I\u0027ve ever met, wants to kiss me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take over control as soon as she tilts her head. Our lips touch for the briefest moment before I lace my fingers in her hair and keep kissing her soft and gentle. I cup her cheek in my palm, feeling her baby-soft skin against my rough fingers. My body urges me to take advantage of the situation, but my brain (the one inside my head) keeps me in check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA satisfied sigh escapes Brittany\u0027s mouth, as if she\u0027s content to stay in my arms forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brush the tip of my tongue against her lips, enticing her to open her mouth. She tentatively meets my tongue with her own. Our mouths and tongues mingle in a slow, erotic dance until the sound of the front door opening makes her jerk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. I\u0027m pissed off. First, for losing myself in Brittany\u0027s kiss. Second, for wanting that moment to last forever. Last, I\u0027m pissed at mi\u0027ama and brothers for coming home at the most awful time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch Brittany trying to look busy as she bends down and picks up her books. My mother and brothers are standing in the doorway with their eyes bugged out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Ma,\" I say, more flustered than I should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the stern look on mi\u0027ama\u0027s face, I know she\u0027s not pleased at catching us making out like there was a promise of more to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luis and Carlos, go to your bedroom,\" she orders, stepping into the room and composing herself. \"Aren\u0027t you going to introduce me to your friend, Alejandro?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany stands, books in hand. \"Hi, I\u0027m Brittany.\" Even with her sun-kissed hair mussed from my fingers and the motorcycle ride, she\u0027s still kick-ass beautiful. Brittany extends her hand in greeting. \"Alex and I were studying chemistry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I saw wasn\u0027t studying,\" my ma says, ignoring her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany winces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mama, leave her alone,\" I say roughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My home is not a whorehouse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Por favor, Mama,\" I say, exasperated. \"We were only kissin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kissing leads to making ninos, Alejandro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" I say, totally embarrassed. I whip my jacket off the couch and shrug into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry if I disrespected you in any way, Mrs. Fuentes,\" Brittany says, visibly upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother takes the groceries she\u0027s carrying, ignoring the apology as she walks into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we\u0027re outside, I hear Brittany take a deep breath. I swear it sounds as if she\u0027s holding herself together by a thin thread. Not the way it\u0027s supposed to go down: bring girl home, kiss girl, mom insults girl, girl leaves crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t sweat it. She\u0027s just not used to me bringin\u0027 girls in the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany\u0027s expressive blue eyes appear remote and cold. \"That shouldn\u0027t have happened,\" she says, throwing back her shoulders in a stance as stiff as a statue\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? The kiss or you likin\u0027 it so much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a boyfriend,\" she says as she fidgets with the strap on her designer book bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tryin\u0027 to convince me, or yourself?\" I ask her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t turn this around. I don\u0027t want to upset my friends. I don\u0027t want to upset my mom. And Colin . . . I\u0027m just really confused right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold out my hands and raise my voice, something I usually avoid because like Paco says, it means I actually care. I don\u0027t care. Why should I? My mind says to shut the fuck up at the same time words spout from my mouth. \"I don\u0027t get it. He treats you like you\u0027re his damn prize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t even know what it\u0027s like with me and Colin. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, dammit,\" I say, unable to hide the edge to my voice. Initially I hold myself back from what I really want to say, but I can\u0027t resist and tell it to her straight up. \" \u0027Cause that kiss back there ... it meant somethin\u0027. You know it as well as I do.
