{"id":109343,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u003cp\u003eI set out to Dorian with a sense of foreboding, made worse by the fact that I wore a skirt with a slit all the way up to my hip. Both Shaya and Nia had wanted me to go see him in a dress, arguing it befitted my station and would endear me to Dorian. I\u0027d argued that I wouldn\u0027t be able to ride in a dress, and this slit thing had been their solution. And like always, I had a handful of guards in tow. Their constant presence still continued to make me feel like a child. In this case, a kind of slutty child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn keeping with the Otherworld\u0027s bizarre geography, we passed through another village. My visit was brief, just long enough to see how they were doing. Their situation wasn\u0027t too different from Westoria\u0027s, though they had a woman who was pretty adept at finding water sources. Her technique, the way she wove magic, was more skilled than mine, though she didn\u0027t possess my strength. After observing her, I mimicked what she did and managed to find a spot ripe for well-digging. The dress kept me from getting out there and shoveling along with them, but it didn\u0027t matter. I left regarded as a savior yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching Dorian\u0027s took less time than it had taken to get to Maiwenn\u0027s. Unlike that journey, much of our trip today passed primarily through my own land, with no respite in one of the more temperate kingdoms. The heat beat down on us, and I sweated profusely into the violet silk of my dress. I would have given anything for a breeze, anything to stir that stagnant air. My own Tucson was often windy; I didn\u0027t get why the Otherworldly version wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father had been able to control all things connected with storms: water, air, charged particles, temperature, et cetera. So far, I only had a hold of water, but every once in a while I could feel the air with the same senses that could touch and control water. Reaching out now, I had that same experience: I could sense the air. It hummed to me. It called. But when I called back, nothing happened. Over and over I tried, attempting the same technique I used with water, urging it to bend and stir and cool me off. Nothing. I finally gave up when Dorian\u0027s castle came into sight. It was stone like mine and somehow managed to be both imposing and graceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere once I had been greeted with hostility and suspicion, I was now welcomed with respect and a fair amount of groveling. And, yeah, some wariness too. My guards were led away, and Dorian\u0027s servants fell all over me, offering me any refreshment I wanted. I declined. I simply wanted to get these negotiations done with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA servant led me to an opulently decorated chamber and announced me, titles and all. Dorian sat there, casual in a long-sleeved, cream-colored shirt, leaning over a chess board. An old man with a beard that went all the way to the floor sat opposite him. Dorian\u0027s green-gold eyes lifted at my name, and he broke out into a dazzling smile. Honestly. The man was too good-looking sometimes, and he knew it. A moment later, Dorian turned a disapproving glance toward his chess partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the gods, Kasper. Have you no manners at all? The Thorn Queen is here. Show some respect before I have you flogged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to protest as the old man rose. The hunched-over posture he\u0027d held in the chair appeared to be permanent, and it took him forever to actually get up. He managed something that passed for a bow-really, it was hard to tell the difference between that and his normal stance-and gave me a grave \"Your majesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as the old man\u0027s back was to the board, Dorian leaned over and moved some of the pieces around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth, more in shock than to make any sort of protest. Dorian raised one finger to his lips in a shushing motion. I swallowed my comments and smiled at Kasper. \"Thank you. Please sit down again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, my dear,\" said Dorian. \"Come join us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe servant who\u0027d led me in hastily pulled a velvet-cushioned chair over to the chess table. I thanked him and sat down, crossing my legs out of habit. When I saw half the skirt spill over and reveal nearly the whole length of my leg, I hastily uncrossed them. Dorian saw the leg, of course. He always saw everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKasper\u0027s eyes, underneath his bushy gray brows, were fixed on the board. He made a play, capturing one of Dorian\u0027s pieces. Dorian frowned briefly, then put his smile back on as he turned to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are radiant as always,\" he said. \"That dress is particularly lovely. Kasper, look at her. Do you see the way that shade matches her eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKasper looked like he wanted to study the board, but he turned to me obediently and gave a quick bob of the head. \"Yes, your majesty. Most becoming.\" Dorian quickly swapped a few more pieces and then put on a look of deep pondering when Kasper turned back around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, Dorian moved his bishop. \"Not my greatest play, but it\u0027ll have to do.\" He seized one of Kasper\u0027s pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe move clearly took Kasper by surprise, not all that astonishing considering the pieces weren\u0027t where they\u0027d been the last time he looked. He studied the board for almost a minute and then moved a knight, though it didn\u0027t yield a capture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie, you look as though you\u0027ve been stranded in a desert,\" mused Dorian. \"But then, I suppose that\u0027s the case, isn\u0027t it? Such a shame, all those towns suffering and starving, towns like Songwood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man looked up sharply, eyes wide as he stared at me. \"Songwood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Songwood?\" I asked in equal confusion. Dorian covertly moved more pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was born in Songwood,\" said Kasper. \"People are starving there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, wait,\" said Dorian. \"Songwood\u0027s in the Willow Land, isn\u0027t it? Sorry for the scare. I was thinking it had been part of Aeson\u0027s kingdom. I\u0027m sure Songwood\u0027s perfectly fine.\" He studied the board for a moment and then deftly moved his queen. \"Checkmate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKasper gaped. \"That\u0027s not...\" His eyes roved over the board, no doubt looking for any possible way to counter Dorian\u0027s move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t fight against the queen,\" said Dorian glibly. \"Once she\u0027s decided to take the king, you might as well give in and enjoy it.\" I rolled my eyes. Kasper sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent game, your majesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian gave him a comforting pat as the old man stood up. \"Don\u0027t take it so hard. You played pretty decently yourself. Sloppy here and there, but who knows? There\u0027s always next time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKasper gave another wizened bow and then left us alone. I gave Dorian a censuring look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a bad man. You should be ashamed of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly,\" he said. \"That man\u0027s the grand chess champion of seven kingdoms. A little humbling will do him good. And speaking of humbling, shall we get on to our business?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up and extended a hand to me. I didn\u0027t take it and simply followed as he walked over to the far side of the room. He sank down onto an ivory satin couch while I chose a velvet loveseat the same color as my dress. I felt adrift in a sea of purple. Dorian produced a stack of parchment from a nearby table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are. Just sign, and we can get this out of the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped through the papers, astonished. I didn\u0027t understand most of it. It detailed amounts and shipments of assorted goods, listed interest rates, and laid out some sort of schedule. I gave Dorian an incredulous look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to negotiating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poured two glasses of white wine from a carafe that sat on the table to his other side. \"Oh, come now. You don\u0027t want to actually do that. I don\u0027t want to do that. So why waste our time? I assure you, the terms are very, very generous. Probably more generous than you deserve, considering the way you toy with my affections. Your people will be getting a lot of goods on faith for copper that has yet to materialize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why did you make me come here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have to ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I grumbled, signing my name with a quill. A quill. Honestly. \"You\u0027re a bad man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I try. Wine?\" He gestured to the glass he\u0027d poured for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Wouldn\u0027t want you to run out. So, I guess me sitting here is part of the price I pay for my kingdom\u0027s food. What do you want to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes held mine over the top of his wineglass. \"I could make up a list of things to do longer than that contract.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. I\u0027d set myself up for that one. \"Okay, then. What would you like to talk about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" he said. \"And why you never come see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know why. Because you used me and stuck me with that kingdom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure do hold a grudge. Is that a human trait?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a Eugenie trait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Of course. You know, Rurik tried to rape you, yet now you welcome him with open arms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not exactly how I\u0027d put it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I mean. How can you forgive him and not me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at my lap and played with the dress\u0027s fabric. I didn\u0027t have a good answer for that. Rurik had really been a total asshole when we\u0027d met, yet now I took him as a normal fixture around my household. Why did I hold such animosity for Dorian? Because things hadn\u0027t started as hostile between us, I realized. Sure, I hadn\u0027t trusted him initially, but he\u0027d never done me any true harm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had grown to like him-care about him, even-which made what he\u0027d done hurt that much more. Dorian was the one who\u0027d guided me through claiming the Thorn Land after we\u0027d killed Aeson in a pretty horrific battle. I\u0027d simply followed Dorian\u0027s direction, having no clue what I was doing until it was too late. Once I realized what I\u0027d been stuck with, I\u0027d felt like every interaction with Dorian had been one big setup. It had seemed like his endgame the whole time had been to oust Aeson and give me that land so that Dorian could eventually control it. That was why I resented him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you sure that\u0027s it? a sneaky voice inside me wanted to know. No, there might be more. Even I could admit that to myself. The truth was I\u0027d developed physical and emotional attachments to Dorian, and I didn\u0027t want them. I didn\u0027t want to be bound to someone like him, someone who was full-blooded gentry-and had the annoying tendency to make me lose control. Slamming up walls of animosity between us was a way to protect myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you thinking?\" Dorian asked, sparing me from his other question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wondering if I just blindly signed my name to sexual favors in that contract.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" he said. \"I wish I\u0027d considered that.\" From the tone of his voice, I think he meant it. \"Oh, well. Perhaps next time since I\u0027m sure this will be the first of many dealings between our kingdoms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, he almost looked hurt. \"Is it that painful coming here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt bad. \"No, I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean it like that. I mean...I hope I don\u0027t need any more help. I hope things will just work themselves out in the Thorn Land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis easy smile returned as he finished off his wine. He reached for my untouched glass. \"Well, according to rumor, things are on the mend, thanks to the omnibenevolent Thorn Queen. Why, I heard the other day that you were out digging ditches and feeding orphans. It\u0027s a wonder you have the time for that, what with your hypocritical job of battling your own subjects in the human world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My subjects don\u0027t cross into the human world,\" I said loftily. Of course, the irony was that might not be true, not if the evidence surrounding those girls was any indication. \"And I never did any of that other stuff. I just found water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tsked, eyes sparkling with delight. \"Yes, which is a hundred times more than most monarchs do. You\u0027re out with your people, maybe not working beside them exactly, but it\u0027s close enough. They think you\u0027re some kind of messiah. I guess that sets a good precedent for your son, hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a face. \"Don\u0027t even go down that road. And anyway, I\u0027m not trying to be a messiah. I\u0027m just trying to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good gods,\" he said, downing the glass in one gulp. \"The frightening thing is that you\u0027re actually serious. Were you helping them before you arrived here today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er, well, a little. We stopped in a village and helped find some water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can tell. When you use your magic, it wreaths you like some sort of afterglow. It\u0027s very...becoming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about the way he spoke and looked at me made me want to cross my arms and legs protectively-until I remembered crossing my legs wouldn\u0027t do me any favors. Fucking dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I daresay your control of water is becoming very useful,\" he added. \"Too bad you didn\u0027t continue your lessons with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need your help anymore. I\u0027ve practiced on my own-I\u0027ve gotten a lot stronger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm. I see. And what about the rest of your inherited powers? Have you been practicing with, say, air?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor half a second, I thought he\u0027d been spying on me. No, that wasn\u0027t his style. He\u0027d guessed I would attempt air magic because...well, he knew me. And because he was Dorian and canny about such things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a matter of fact, I have,\" I said loftily. There. Take that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips twitched. \"I see. And have you been successful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t fast enough with my answer. He laughed and moved to sit beside me. I tried to scoot over, but there wasn\u0027t much room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie, Eugenie. When are you going to stop fighting this-stop fighting me? You\u0027re only going to create more trouble down the road if you don\u0027t learn to fully harness your abilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" I said, trying not to notice the apple and cinnamon scent that always surrounded him. Why couldn\u0027t I shake this attraction when I found him so annoying half the time? \"It\u0027s for my benefit, right? Not because of your desire to rule the Otherworld and see the prophecy fulfilled?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it\u0027s for those reasons,\" he scoffed. One thing you had to love about Dorian was his unflinching honesty. \"But that doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t benefit too. You don\u0027t think it\u0027d be useful to control air? You don\u0027t think that would aid you in helping those poor suffering souls under your control?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it. Don\u0027t involve them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re already involved. Learn to control storms, and there\u0027ll never be a drought again.\" His voice was low, filled with promise and temptation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the things I\u0027d seen, the fields gone barren and hungry faces. I shook my head. \"I\u0027m not going to let you teach me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I got you another teacher?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I shifted so that we could look at each other eye to eye. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what I sound like. As hard as it is to believe, I\u0027m not the only one who knows how to use magic around here. True, I\u0027m the most stunningly attractive and dazzlingly intelligent, but if you\u0027re dead set against my help, there are others whom you could benefit from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned away and stared off across the room. The water finder I\u0027d worked with today had certainly been useful. She was actually the first gentry I\u0027d met who had any sort of magic compatible enough to mine to teach me anything. Dorian\u0027s magic was actually completely different from my own, but he was skilled enough to still transfer the basic principles. But what if I had someone else to tutor me? Someone more in sync with my powers-who wasn\u0027t always trying to get me into bed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Self-chastisement instantly arose. Magic was dangerous. It made you crave more of it, and the more I used, the more I embraced my gentry side and lost some of my humanity. Kiyo had advised against it over and over, and I didn\u0027t even want to think about what Roland would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve actually got someone in mind?\" I asked, turning back to Dorian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"She\u0027s not an exact fit for your powers-honestly, no one is-but she\u0027s close and is an excellent instructor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe. That was promising. No one who\u0027d want to father a child on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seized on my hesitation. \"Eugenie, why resist this? It\u0027s obvious you want to learn more, no matter how haughty you pretend to be about dirtying your hands in the affairs of the shining ones. Stop your pandering and accept this as a gift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I have to do in return for this gift?\" I asked warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing except learn. If you take my tutor back with you to the Thorn Land, I just want you to promise me you\u0027ll give her a fair chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You already know all my other motivations for doing this, so there\u0027s no trick there. The rest is on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue. He had been up-front about his larger designs on me and his megalomania. \"Okay...\" Kiyo was going to freak out. \"I\u0027ll give her a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, every time I agreed to something with Dorian, I always felt like I was signing my soul away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll make an all-powerful queen out of you yet.\" He reached his hand over and smoothed out where some of my dress\u0027s fabric had wrinkled up near the slit. His motion actually covered up more of my leg with the skirt, though it did involve his fingers brushing against my skin. For a brief, dangerous instant, I kind of wished he\u0027d move his fingers underneath the dress. Instead, he simply left his hand on my thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dorian,\" I said warningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked pointedly down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed my gaze. \"Oh, look at that. It seemed so natural, I hardly noticed,\" he said cheerfully, removing the guilty hand. I almost felt...disappointed. \"Let me fetch your new teacher since I\u0027m guessing you won\u0027t be lured into staying for dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guessed right. You really are dazzlingly intelligent,\" I said wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up and flashed me a grin. \"And stunningly attractive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just go get her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the room, and I watched the way his long, lean build moved and how the sunlight streaming through a window turned his hair every shade of red, orange, and gold. Dorian was trouble. Yes, I suspected I really had made a deal with the devil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParticularly when I saw who his instructor was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her?\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot up from my chair. Dorian had just entered the room, and standing beside him was Ysabel-the Eugenie-clone strumpet from the party. Her blue eyes widened when she saw me. Apparently I wasn\u0027t the only one who had been caught by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this?\" she demanded. \"You said you wanted me to instruct someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" he said calmly. \"You\u0027re going to pack your things and return with the Thorn Queen. You will teach her to use her magic to the best of her ability.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said icily. \"I will not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pleasant demeanor dropped. \"Yes, you will. This isn\u0027t a request. You\u0027re my subject, ergo you follow my commands. And I am commanding you to go with her. Unless you\u0027re openly defying me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help a shiver. I\u0027d occasionally seen this hard side of Dorian, and it always unnerved me. It was such an abrupt change from his usual laconic self, the self who bantered and tried to feel me up...and I found the change kind of terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dorian,\" I said uneasily. \"Don\u0027t make her do anything she doesn\u0027t want to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at me. \"I don\u0027t need your assistance here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What she wants is irrelevant,\" said Dorian. I was a bit surprised at how casually he was able to order her about and objectify her. I\u0027d assumed whomever he was sleeping with at any given time would be someone he had feelings for. Who knew? Maybe he cared about her a lot but was still able to treat her as a subject. Or maybe he just cared about me more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, I don\u0027t want her,\" I retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also irrelevant,\" he replied, eyes still fixed on Ysabel. \"You made a promise to give your teacher a fair chance-unless you\u0027re going to be human and go back on your word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t quite what I expected!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. You\u0027re either going to keep your promise or you won\u0027t. And you,\" he said to Ysabel, \"are either going to obey or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYsabel\u0027s eyes were ablaze with rage, and her breathing was heavy. I had the feeling she wanted to burst forth with a million expletives, but she bit her lip as though physically forcing them back. At last, she swallowed and took a deep breath. When she spoke, her words were to Dorian, but her gaze was on me. I hadn\u0027t seen malevolence like that in quite some time-no, wait. That wasn\u0027t entirely true. Her look was a lot like the one Volusian often gave me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, I will obey, your majesty. With great pleasure.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thorn-queen-dark-swan-2/page-10.html","bookId":2039,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:53 PM"}
