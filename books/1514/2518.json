Nonetheless, despite their failed attempt, Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace was turned into ruins. Moreover, their palace master died from serious injuries, while all their elders were severely wounded. Hence, Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace was currently at its weakest moment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You should bring the disciples from your Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace and follow me back to Dao Sect. You guys can’t stay in this place anymore. After all, if Yuan Gate launches another sneak attack, the disciples of your Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace will definitely suffer terribly.” When he realized that the current Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Place lacked the ability to protect itself, Lin Dong decided to ask for Ling Qingzhu’s opinion.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu hesitated for a moment after hearing this. If they were to simply head to Dao Sect now, it would feel as though they were imposing on them. Therefore, even though she knew that what Lin Dong proposed was the ideal solution, she inevitably felt a little resistant in her heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You are now the palace master of Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace.” Lin Dong glanced at her before he slowly said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLing Qingzhu clenched her hand tightly, before she promptly nodded her head. Currently, she had to think on behalf of the disciples of Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace.

Within a few days, a super sect, which once towered over the Eastern Xuan Region, was nearly exterminated.

After which, he sat on a mountain top and observed the scene after the news spread.

After which, she stared at the ruins in front of her and muttered, “Actually, I can empathize with her. This is because I was also carrying the burden of the entire Dao Sect before your return. After all, Yuan Gate has countless powerful individuals and the three great heads had yet to make a move. Hence, I was also worried that should I fail, the many disciples from Dao Sect would also wound up just like them…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“During the past three years, I was missing you badly. However, I also had to do my best to protect Dao Sect…” Ying Huanhuan folded her long legs. Her pretty snow white face was lowered to her knees.

Evidently, she had a hard time over the last three years. However, did any of them here have an easy time? Three years ago, she was a lively and cute girl, the little princess that all disciples from Dao Sect cherished. She could have fun everyday without any worries. However, soon after, the lives of every Dao Sect disciple fell onto her delicate shoulders. Just by thinking about the heavy burden that she had to carry, one’s heart began to ache.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It has been tough on you.

Immediately, she gently bit her red lips, while some chaotic ripples were actually stirred in her typically unemotional heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Tsk tsk, senior sister Qingzhu, it seems like you have met a formidable opponent this time around.” A low voice suddenly sounded from her side.

Those disciples from Dao Sect looked at the gloomy and dispirited disciples from Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace, before they sighed quietly. This war had affected the entire Eastern Xuan Region. If it was not because their Dao Sect had Ying Huanhuan and Lin Dong’s timely return, it was likely that their fate would be even more miserable than those Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace disciples.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWithin the main hall of Dao Sect, Ying Xuanzi released a deep sigh after he heard about what happened to Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace.

It was likely that “Devil Prison” were the ones supporting Yuan Gate. Moreover, it was clear that they were plotting to pull off a massive scheme.

At that time, the situation would be reversed and Yuan Gate will end up falling into a disadvantage.” Ling Qingzhu’s cool voice resounded through the hall, causing the eyes of many to brighten abruptly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong also glanced at Ling Qingzhu in surprise. What she proposed was indeed quite ruthless and it directly addressed the heart of the problem. By taking advantage of the hatred that Yuan Gate had created, they would be able to gather all the hidden experts and band them together to fight against Yuan Gate. After which, Yuan Gate would be forced to fight a life and death battle with the entire Eastern Xuan Region.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Lin Dong, what do you think?” A glint flashed across Ying Xuanzi’s eyes.

Currently, he looked somewhat agitated. After all, over the last year, his Dao Sect was pushed by Yuan Gate until they could barely catch their breath.

Although there was little activity initially, the entire region quickly boiled after the news was confirmed. Following which, countless experts hidden in different parts of the Eastern Xuan Region rose and hurried towards Dao Sect. Meanwhile, these powerful practitioners all had the same expression, that was hatred towards Yuan Gate…\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe sky of the Eastern Xuan Region became incomparably lively within a short two to three days.

Instead, black demonic aura enveloped the interior of the sect, while dark chilly winds blew continuously.

Once we destroy that alliance, no one in the Eastern Xuan Region will be able to oppose us. At that time, our Yuan Gate shall become the only overlord.” Standing in the middle, a white robed man said. His eyes were black and white in colour, and it looked as though Yin and Yang were suspended in them, giving him an incomparably mysterious look. This person was precisely Tian Yuanzi.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I exchanged blows with Lin Dong before.
