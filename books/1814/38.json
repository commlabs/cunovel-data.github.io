You can’t treat me like this!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kate, I’m—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whirl around and point a finger at him. “If you tell me you’re sorry, I will kick your balls up into your eye sockets, I swear to God!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe closes his mouth. Smart move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push my hair out of my face. And pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I supposed to feel better now? Because it really was all just a mistake?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a house gets destroyed by lightning, do you think the owners are cheered by the fact that the lightning didn’t mean to strike their house?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the damage is already done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ruined it, Drew. I was so excited to tell you . . . and now whenever I think about it, all I’ll remember is how horrible this has all been!” I stop pacing. And my voice trembles. “I needed you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I saw the blood . . . when they told me I was losing the baby . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew reaches for me, still on his knees. “Baby, I don’t know what you’re saying . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you weren’t here! If you’d been here then you’d know, but you weren’t! And . . .” My voice cracks and tears blur my vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you promised. You promised you wouldn’t do this . . .” I cover my face with my hands, and I cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cry for every second of useless pain. For the crevasse that’s still between us—and for the stupid choices that created it. And I don’t mean just his. I’m a big girl—I can take my share of the blame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew may have pulled the trigger, but I loaded the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kate . . . Kate, please . . .” he holds his hand out to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, Kate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe looks shattered. And I know, then and there, that I’m not the only one who’s suffered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I shake my head. Because do-overs only exist in playground games. Real life doesn’t have take backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Drew.” I turn my back on him and walk toward the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I only make it a few steps before I pause and look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you see him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his knees, his head in his hands. Like a man waiting for the executioner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I think of Drew, two words always stand out: passion and pride. They’re ingrained. Who he is. Arguments, work, love— it’s all the same to him. Full steam ahead. No hesitation, no holding back. And Drew knows what he’s worth. he doesn’t settle; he doesn’t compromise. he doesn’t have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you here?” I whisper, so low I don’t know if he’ll even hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his head snaps up. “What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You thought I cheated on you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe grimaces. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You thought I could be in love with someone else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you came . . . for me. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis eyes drift across my face. It’s the way he looks at me in the morning, when he wakes up before I do. It’s the way he watches me, when he thinks I’m not looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I can’t live without you, Kate. I don’t even know how to try.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in advanced placement English in high school. For weeks, we analyzed Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë. In most of it, heathcliff is the villain. he’s ruthless, often cruel. And as a reader, you’re supposed to hate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I never could. Because in spite of all his despicable actions, he loved Cathy so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe with me always—take any form—drive me mad! only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you. . . . I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul! Some of you are going to say that I should’ve punished Drew more. But he’ll do a better job of that than I ever could. Others are going to say that I should’ve made him work for it more. But we all know that he would have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sometimes, forgiveness is selfish. We give it not because it’s earned, but because it’s what we need. To find peace. To be whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can live without Drew Evans. I know that, now. But if given the choice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won’t ever want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s only a dozen steps separating us, and I run every one of them. I throw myself at him, and he catches me. he wraps his arms around me and holds me so tight, I can’t get air in my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it doesn’t matter. Because Drew is holding me—who needs to breathe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Kate . . . God, I’m so f**king sorry.” he sounds so forlorn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd tears well up in my eyes. “I didn’t think we’d ever . . . when you said . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh . . . I didn’t mean it. I swear on Mackenzie I didn’t mean any of it. I never wanted to . . .” he buries his face in my neck, and his regret leaks from his eyes and soaks into my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press closer against him. “I know, Drew. I know you didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis hands run through my hair—they caress my face, my arms, my back. “I love you, Kate. I love you so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast year, Drew and I went to Japan. One day we stopped in a bonsai tree shop. They’re kind of strange-looking, don’t you think?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith their stunted trunks and twisted branches. The shop owner told us that it’s the knots and twists that make them strong, that keep from splintering even during the harshest storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what Drew and I are like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis lips touch my forehead, my cheeks. he holds my face in his hands, and I frame his with mine. And we kiss. Our mouths move in sync—fierce and bruising, tender and slow. And all the rest, every injury, every harsh word, melts away like snow in the sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey don’t matter. Because we’re together. We’ll find our way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew presses his forehead against mine, then his hand covers my stomach. his touch is reverent and his voice is awed. “Are we really having a baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, even though the tears are still falling. “Yeah. We are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you really want to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe wipes the wetness from my cheeks. “With you? Are you crazy? It’s one of the few fantasies I have left. I’d have twenty kids with you—give those freaky Duggar people a run for their money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh again, and it feels so good. So right. I lay my head on Drew’s shoulder. his face rests against my hair, breathing it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he vows, “It’s okay, Kate. We’re gonna be okay now.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-tangled-2/page-38.html","bookId":1814,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM"}
