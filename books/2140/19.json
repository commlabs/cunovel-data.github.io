He walked swiftly along the streets of Mirabar, heading for the connections to the Undercity, but not traveling in a direct line. Nanfoodle was trying hard-too hard-to avoid being detected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was cognizant of that fact, and so he tried to straighten out his course and settle his stride to a more normal pace. Why shouldn\u0027t he go into the Undercity, after all? He was the Marchion\u0027s Prime Alchemist, often working with fresh ore and often visiting the dwarves, so why was he trying to conceal his destination?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle shook his head and scolded himself repeatedly, then stopped, took a deep breath, and started again with a more normal stride and an expression of forced calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, a calm expression that lasted until he considered again his course. He had told Councilor Agrathan of Torgar\u0027s imprisonment and had thought to let his incidental knowledge of the situation go at that, figuring that he had done his duty as a friend-and he truly felt that he was a friend-of the dwarves. However, with so much time behind them and no apparent action coming on Torgar\u0027s behalf, Nanfoodle had come to realize that Agrathan had taken the issue no further than the marchion. Even worse, to the gnome\u0027s sensibilities, Mirabar\u0027s dwarves were still under the impression that Torgar was on the road to, or perhaps had even arrived at, Mithral Hall. For several days, the gnome had wrestled with his conscience over the issue. Had he done enough? Was it his duty as a friend to tell the dwarves, to tell Shingles McRuff at least, who was known to be the best friend of Torgar Hammerstriker? Or was it his duty to the marchion, his employer and the one who had brought him to Mirabar, to keep his mouth shut and mind his own business?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs these questions played yet again in poor Nanfoodle\u0027s thoughts, the gnome\u0027s strides became less purposeful and more meandering, and he brought his hands together before him, twiddling his thumbs. His eyes were only half-open, the gnome exploring his heart and soul as much as paying attention to his surroundings, and so he was quite surprised when a tall and imposing figure stepped out before him as he turned down one narrow alleyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle skidded to an abrupt stop, his gaze gradually climbing the robed, shapely figure before him, settling on the intense eyes of Shoudra Stargleam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Urn, hello Sceptrana,\" the gnome nervously greeted. \"A fine day for a walk it is, yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fine day above ground, yes,\" Shoudra replied. \"Can you be so certain that the Undercity is similarly pleasant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Undercity? Well, I would know nothing about the Undercity . . . have not been down there with the dwarves in days, in tendays!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A situation you plan to remedy this very day, no doubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"W-why, no,\" the gnome stammered. \"Was just out for a walk. Yes, yes . . . trying to sort a formula in my head, you see. Must toughen the metal...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spare me the dodges,\" Shoudra bade him. \"So now I know who it was who whispered in Agrathan\u0027s ear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agrathan? The Councilor Hardhammer, you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle realized how unconvincing he sounded, and that only made him seem more nervous to the clever Shoudra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Djaffar was a bit loud in the hallway on the night when Torgar Hammerstriker was dragged back to Mirabar,\" Shoudra remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Djaffar? Loud? Well, he usually is, I suppose,\" Nanfoodle bluffed, thinking himself quite clever. \"In any hallway, I would guess, though I\u0027ve not seen nor heard him in any hallway that I can recall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Truly?\" Shoudra said, a wry grin widening on her beautiful face. \"And yet you were not surprised to hear that Torgar Hammerstriker was dragged back to Mirabar? How, then, is this not news to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,!... well...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little gnome threw up his hands in defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard him, that night, outside my door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you told Agrathan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle gave a great sigh and said, \"Should he not know? Should the dwarves be oblivious to the actions of their marchion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it is your place to tell them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" Nanfoodle gave a snort, and another, and stamped his foot. \"I do not know!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gnashed his teeth for a few moments, then looked up at Shoudra, and was surprised to sec an expression on her face that was quite sympathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel as betrayed as T,\" he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The marchion owes me, and you, nothing,\" the woman was quick to respond. \"Not even an explanation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet you seem to think that we owe him something in return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoudra\u0027s eyes widened and she seemed to grow very tall and terrible before the little gnome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You owe to him because he is Mirabar!\" she scolded. \"It is the position, not the man, deserving and demanding of your respect, Nanfoodle the Foolish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not of Mirabar!\" the gnome shot back, with unexpected fury. \"I was brought in for my expertise, and T am paid well because I am the greatest in my field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your field? You are a master of illusion and a master of the obvious all at once,\" Shoudra countered. \"You are a carnival barker, a trickster and a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How dare you?\" Nanfoodle yelled back. \"Alchemy is the greatest of the Arts, the one whose truths we have not yet uncovered. The one that holds the promise of power for all, and not just a select few, like those powers of Shoudra and her ilk, who guard mighty secrets for personal gain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alchemy is a means to make a few potions of minor magic, and a bit of powder that blows up more often on its creator than on its intended target. Beyond that, it is a sham, a lie perpetrated by the cunning on the greedy. You can no more strengthen the metal of Mirabar\u0027s mines than transmute lead into gold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, from the solid earth I can create hungry mud at your feet to swallow you up!\" Nanfoodle roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With water?\" Shoudra calmly asked, the simple reply taking most of the bluster from the excited gnome, visibly shrinking him back to size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to reply, stammering indecipherably, and just gave a snort, and remarked, \"Not all agree with your estimation of the value of alchemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed, and some pay well for the unfounded promises it otters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle snorted again. \"The point remains that I owe nothing to your marchion beyond my position to him as my employer,\" he reasoned, \"and only as my current employer, as I am a freelance alchemist who has served many well-paying folks throughout the wide lands of the North. I could walk into Waterdeep tomorrow and find employ at near equal pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True enough,\" Shoudra replied, \"but I have not asked you for any loyalty to Elastul, only to Mirabar, this city that you have come to name as your home. I have been watching you closely, Nanfoodle, ever since Councilor Agrathan came to me with his knowledge of the imprisonment of Torgar. I have replayed many times my encounter with Djaffar, and I know whose door it is that abuts my own. You are out this day, walking nervously, meandering your course, which is obviously to the mines and the dwarves. I share your frustration and understand well that which gnaws at your heart, and so, since Councilor Agrathan has taken little action, you have decided to tell others. Friends of Torgar, likely, in an effort to start some petition against the marchion\u0027s actions and gel Torgar freed from his cell, wherever that may be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have decided to tell the friends of Torgar only so that they might know the truth,\" Nanfoodle admitted, and corrected. \"What actions they might take are their own to decide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How democratic,\" came the sarcastic reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just said you share my frustrations,\" Nanfoodle retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not your foolishness, it would seem,\" Shoudra was quick to respond. \"Do you truly understand the implications? Do you truly understand the brotherhood of dwarf to dwarf? You risk tearing the city asunder, of setting human against dwarf. What do you owe to Mirabar, Nanfoodle the Illusionist? And what do you owe to Marchion Elastul, your employer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do I owe to the dwarves I have named as my friends?\" the little gnome asked innocently, and his words seemed to knock Shoudra back a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know not,\" she admitted with a sigh, one that clearly showed that frustration she had spoken of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor do I,\" Nanfoodle agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoudra straightened herself, but she seemed not so tall and terrible to Nanfoodle, seemed rather a kindred soul, befuddled and unhappy about the course of events swirling around her and outside of her control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped a hand on his shoulder, a gesture of sympathy and friendship, and said quietly, \"Walk lightly, friend. Understand the implications of your actions here. The dwarves of Mirabar are on the fine edge of a dagger, stepping left and right. They among all the citizens bear the least love and the most loyalty to the present marchion. Where will your revelations leave them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle nodded, not disagreeing with her reasoning, but he added, \"And yet, if this city is all you claim it to be, if this wondrous joy of coexistence that is Mirabar is worthy of inspiring such loyalty, can it suffer the injustice of the jailing of Torgar Hammerstriker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, his words seemed to set Shoudra back on her heels, striking her as profoundly as any slap might. She paused, closed her eyes, and gradually began to nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what you will, Nanfoodle, with no judgment from Shoudra Stargleam. I will leave your choice to your heart. None will know of this conversation, or even that you know of Torgar-not from me, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled warmly at the little gnome, patted him again on the shoulder, and turned and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle stood there, watching her depart and wondering which course would be better. Should he return to his apartment and his workshop and forget all about Torgar and the mounting troubles between the dwarves and the marchion? Or should he continue as he had intended, knowing full well the explosive potential of his information, and tell the dwarves the truth about the prisoner in the marchion\u0027s jail?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo question of alchemy, that most elusive of sciences, had ever perplexed the gnome more than this matter. Was it his place to start an uproar, perhaps even a riot? Was it his place, as a friend, to sit idly by and allow such injustice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what of Agrathan? If the marchion had convinced the dwarf councilor to remain silent, as seemed obvious, was Nanfoodle playing the part of the righteous fool? Agrathan must know more than he, after all. Agrathan\u0027s loyalty to his kin could not be questioned, and Agrathan had apparently said nothing about Torgar\u0027s fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere did that leave Nanfoodle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, the little gnome turned back and started walking for home, thinking himself very foolish and very uppity for even beginning such a course. He had barely gone ten strides, though, when a familiar figure crossed before him, and paused to say hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greetings to you, Shingles McRuff,\" Nanfoodle responded, and he felt his stomach turn and his knees go weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis short legs churning, Councilor Agrathan burst into Marchion Elastul\u0027s audience chamber completely unannounced and with several door guards hot on his heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They know!\" the dwarf cried, before the surprised marchion could even inquire about the intrusion, and before any of the four Hammers who were standing behind Elastul could scold him for entering without invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They?\" Elastul replied, though it was obvious to all that he knew exactly of whom Agrathan was speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Word\u0027s out about Torgar,\" Agrathan explained. \"The dwarves know what you did, and they\u0027re none too happy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed,\" Elastul replied, settling back in his throne. \"And how is it that your people know, Councilor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no mistaking the accusation in his lone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not from me!\" the dwarf protested. \"You think I\u0027m pleased by this development? You think it does my old heart good to see the dwarves of Mirabar yelling at each other, throwing words and throwing fists? But you had to know they would learn of this and soon enough. You cannot keep such a secret, Marchion, not about one as important as Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis emphasis on that telling middle name, a distinguished title indeed among the dwarves of Mirabar, had Elastul\u0027s eyes narrowing dangerously. Elastul\u0027s middle name, after all, was not Delzoun, nor could it be, and to all the marchions of Mirabar, humans all, the Delzoun heritage could be both a blessing and a curse. That Delzoun heritage bound the dwarves to this land, and this land bound them to the marchion. But that Delzoun heritage also bound them to a commonality of their own race, one apart from the marchion. Why was it, after all, that every time Agrathan spoke of the weight of Elastul\u0027s decision to imprison the traitor Torgar, he used, and emphasized, that middle name?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they know,\" Elastul remarked. \"Perhaps that is the proper thing, in the end. Surely most of the dwarves of Mirabar recognize Torgar Hammerstriker as the traitor that he is, and surely many of those same dwarves, merchants among them, craftsmen among them, understand and appreciate the damage the traitor might have caused to us all if he had been allowed to travel to our hated enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enemies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rivals, then,\" the marchion conceded. \"Do you believe that Mithral Hall would not welcome the information that the traitor dwarf might have offered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not certain that I believe that Torgar would have offered anything other than his friendship to King Bruenor,\" Agrathan replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that alone would be worthy of hanging him,\" Elastul retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hammers laughed and agreed, and Agrathan paled, his eyes going wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t be thinking.. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, Councilor,\" Elastul assured him. \"I have not constructed any gallows for the traitor dwarf. Not yet, at least. Nor do T intend to. It is as I told you before. Torgar Hammerstriker will remain in prison, not abused, but surely contained, until such time as he sees the truth of things and returns to his own good senses. I\u0027ll not risk the wealth of Mirabar on his judgment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgrathan seemed to calm a bit at that, but the cloud did not leave his soft (for a dwarf, at least) features. He stroked his long white beard and paused for a bit, deep in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All that you say is true,\" he admitted, his vernacular becoming more sophisticated as he calmed. \"I do not deny that, Marchion, but your reason, for all of its worth, docs little to alleviate the fires burning brightly beneath this very room. The fires in the hearts of your dwarf subjects-in a good number of them, at least, who named Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker as a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will come to their senses,\" Elastul replied. \"I trust that Agrathan, beloved councilor, will convince them of the necessity of my actions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgrathan stared at Elastul for a long time, his expression shifting to one of simple resignation. He understood the reasoning, all along. He understood why Torgar had been taken from his intended road, and why he had been jailed. He understood why Elastul considered it up to him to calm the dwarves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat didn\u0027t mean that Agrathan believed he had any chance of succeeding, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well good enough for him, I\u0027m saying,\" one dwarf cried, and banged his fist on the wall. \"The fool would o\u0027 telled them all our tricks. If he\u0027s to be a friend o\u0027 Mithral Hall, then throw him in a hole and leave him there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The words of a fool, if ever I heared \u0027em,\" yelled another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who ya callin\u0027 a fool?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yerself, ye fool!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first dwarf charged forward, fists flying. Those around him, rather than try to stop him, came forward right beside him. They met the name-caller and his friends of similar mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToivo Foamblower leaned back against the wall as the fight exploded around him, the fifth fight of that day in his tavern, and this one looking as if it would be the largest and bloodiest of them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the street, just beyond his windows, a score of dwarves were fighting with a score of dwarves, rolling and punching, biting and kicking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye fool, Torgar,\" Toivo muttered under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And ye bigger fool, Elastul!\" he added as he dodged a living missile that soared over him, smashing the wall and a sizeable amount of good stock before falling to the floor, groaning and bitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was going to be a long night in the Undercity. A long night indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene was repeated in every bar along the Undercity and in the mines, where miner squared off against miner, sometimes with picks raised, as the news of the imprisonment of Torgar Hammerstriker spread like wildfire among the dwarves of Mirabar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for Elastul!\" was shouted all along the dwarven enclaves, only to be inevitably refuted by a shout of \"Damn the marchion!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaised voices, predictably, led to raised fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside Toivo\u0027s tavern, Shingles McRuff and a group of friends confronted a host of other-minded dwarves, the group spouting the praises of the man who had \"stopped the traitor afore he could betray Mirabar to Mithral Hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027re seeming a bit happy that Elastul\u0027s quick to jail one o\u0027 yer own,\" Shingles argued. \"Ye\u0027re thinking it a good thing to have a dwarf rotting in a human jail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might be that I\u0027m thinking it a good thing to have a traitor to Mirabar rotting in a Mirabar jail!\" retorted the other dwarf, a tough-looking character with a black beard and eyebrows so bushy that they nearly hid his eyes. \"At least until we\u0027ve built the dog a proper gallows!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought applause from the dwarves behind him, roars of anger from those beside Shingles, and an even more direct opposition response from old Shingles himself in the form of a well-aimed fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-bearded dwarf hopped backward beneath the weight of the blow, but thanks to the grabbing arms of his companions, not only didn\u0027t he fall, but he came rushing right back at Shingles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old dwarf was more than ready, lifting his fists as if to block the attack up high, then dropping to his knees at the very last second and jamming his shoulder into the black-bearded dwarf\u0027s waist. Up scrambled Shingles, lifting the outraged dwarf high and launching him into his fellows, then leaping in right behind, fists and feet flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattling dwarves rolled all about the street, and the commotion brought many doors swinging open. Those dwarves who came to view the scene wasted little time in jumping right in, flailing away, though in truth they often had little idea which side they were joining. The riot went from street to street and snaked its way into many houses, and more than one had a fire pit overturned, flames leaping to furniture and tapestries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmidst it all, there came the blaring of a hundred horns as the Axe of Mirabar charged down from above, some on the lifts, others just setting ropes and swinging over, trying to get down fast before the rioting swept the whole of the Undercity into disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwarf against dwarf and dwarf against man, they battled. In the face of the battle joined by humans, some with weapons drawn, many of the dwarves who had initially opposed Shingles and his like-minded companions changed sides. To many of those in the middle ground concerning the arrest of Torgar, it then became a question of loyalty, to blood or to country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough nearly half of the dwarves were fighting beside the Axe, and though many, many humans continued to filter down to quell the riot, it took hours to get the supporters of Torgar under control. Even then, the soldiers of the marchion were faced with the unenviable task of containing more than a hundred prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundreds more were watching them, they knew, and the first sign of mistreatment would likely ignite an even larger riot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Agrathan, who came late upon the scene, the destruction along the streets, the bloodied faces of so many of his kin, and even more than that the expressions of sheer outrage on so many, showed him the very danger of which he had warned the marchion laid bare. He went to the Axe commanders one by one, pressing for lenience and wise choices concerning the disposition of the prisoners, always with a grim warning that though the top was on the boiling kettle, the fire was still hot beneath it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep the peace as best ye can, but not a swing too far,\" Agrathan warned every commander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter reciting that speech over and over, after pulling one angry guard after another off a prisoner, the exhausted councilor moved to the side of one avenue and plopped down on a stone bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They got Torgar!\" came a voice he could not ignore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up to see a bruised and battered Shingles, who seemed more than ready to break free of the two men who held him and start the row all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They dragged him from the road and beat him down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgrathan looked hard at the old dwarf, gently patting his hands in the air to try to calm Shingles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye knew it!\" Shingles roared. \"Ye knew it all along, and ye\u0027re not for caring!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I care,\" Agrathan countered, leaping up from the bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah! Ye\u0027re a short human, and not a thing more!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he shouted the insult, the guards holding Shingles gave a rough jerk, one letting go with one hand to slap the old dwarf across the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all the opening he needed. He accepted the slap with a growing grin then leaped around, breaking completely free of that one\u0027s grasp. Then, without hesitation, he launched his free fist hard into the gut of the soldier still holding him, doubling the man over and loosening his grasp. Shingles tore free completely, twisting and punching to avoid the grasp of the first man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier backed, calling for help, but Shingles came in too fast, kicking the man in the shin, and snapping his forehead forward and down, connecting solidly -too solidly-on the man\u0027s codpiece. He doubled over and dropped to his knees, his eyes crossing. Shingles came back around wildly, charging for the second soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when that soldier dodged aside, the dwarf didn\u0027t pursue. Instead he continued ahead toward his true intended target: poor Councilor Agrathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgrathan had never been a fighter of Shingles\u0027s caliber, nor were his fists near as hard from any recent battles as those of the surly miner. Even worse for Agrathan, his heart wasn\u0027t in his defense nearly as much as Shingles\u0027s was in his rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe councilor felt the first few blows keenly, a left hook, a right cross, a few quick jabs, and a roundhouse that dropped him to the ground. He felt the bottom of Shingles\u0027s boot as the dwarf, lifted right off the ground by a pair of pursuing guards, got one last kick in. Agrathan felt the hands of a human grabbing him under the arm and helping him to his feet, an assist the dwarf roughly pushed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGnashing his teeth, wounded inside far more than he could ever be outside, Councilor Agrathan stormed back for the lifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that he had to get to the marchion. He had no idea what he was going to say, had no idea even what he expected or wanted the marchion to do, but he knew that the time had come to confront the man more forcefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-thousand-orcs-hunter-s-blades-1/page-19.html","bookId":2140,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:59 PM"}
