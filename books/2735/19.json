Every surface, including the floor, was mirrored. We had to pull the door to shut ourselves in and then the old thing creaked slowly up to the second floor. I was tired and sweaty and worried that I generally looked and smelled gross, but even so I kissed him in that elevator, and then he pulled away and pointed at the mirror and said, “Look, infinite Hazels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some infinities are larger than other infinities,” I drawled, mimicking Van Houten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What an assclown,” Augustus said, and it took all that time and more just to get us to the second floor. Finally the elevator lurched to a halt, and he pushed the mirrored door open. When it was half open, he winced in pain and lost his grip on the door for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a second, he said, “Yeah, yeah, door’s just heavy, I guess.” He pushed again and got it open. He let me walk out first, of course, but then I didn’t know which direction to walk down the hallway, and so I just stood there outside the elevator and he stood there, too, his face still contorted, and I said again, “Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just out of shape, Hazel Grace. All is well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were just standing there in the hallway, and he wasn’t leading the way to his room or anything, and I didn’t know where his room was, and as the stalemate continued, I became convinced he was trying to figure out a way not to hook up with me, that I never should have suggested the idea in the first place, that it was unladylike and therefore had disgusted Augustus Waters, who was standing there looking at me unblinking, trying to think of a way to extricate himself from the situation politely. And then, after forever, he said, “It’s above my knee and it just tapers a little and then it’s just skin. There’s a nasty scar, but it just looks like—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My leg,” he said. “Just so you’re prepared in case, I mean, in case you see it or what—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, get over yourself,” I said, and took the two steps I needed to get to him. I kissed him, hard, pressing him against the wall, and I kept kissing him as he fumbled for the room key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe crawled into the bed, my freedom circumscribed some by the oxygen, but even so I could get on top of him and take his shirt off and taste the sweat on the skin below his collarbone as I whispered into his skin, “I love you, Augustus Waters,” his body relaxing beneath mine as he heard me say it. He reached down and tried to pull my shirt off, but it got tangled in the tube. I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you do this every day?” he asked as I disentangled my shirt from the tubes. Idiotically, it occurred to me that my pink underwear didn’t match my purple bra, as if boys even notice such things. I crawled under the covers and kicked out of my jeans and socks and then watched the comforter dance as beneath it, Augustus removed first his jeans and then his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were lying on our backs next to each other, everything hidden by the covers, and after a second I reached over for his thigh and let my hand trail downward to the stump, the thick scarred skin. I held the stump for a second. He flinched. “It hurts?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flipped himself onto his side and kissed me. “You’re so hot,” I said, my hand still on his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m starting to think you have an amputee fetish,” he answered, still kissing me. I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have an Augustus Waters fetish,” I explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole affair was the precise opposite of what I figured it would be: slow and patient and quiet and neither particularly painful nor particularly ecstatic. There were a lot of condomy problems that I did not get a particularly good look at. No headboards were broken. No screaming. Honestly, it was probably the longest time we’d ever spent together without talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one thing followed type: Afterward, when I had my face resting against Augustus’s chest, listening to his heart pound, Augustus said, “Hazel Grace, I literally cannot keep my eyes open.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Misuse of literality,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said. “So. Tired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face turned away from me, my ear pressed to his chest, listening to his lungs settle into the rhythm of sleep. After a while, I got up, dressed, found the Hotel Filosoof stationery, and wrote him a love letter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDearest Augustus,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyrs,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHazel Grace\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, our last full day in Amsterdam, Mom and Augustus and I walked the half block from the hotel to the Vondelpark, where we found a café in the shadow of the Dutch national film museum. Over lattes—which, the waiter explained to us, the Dutch called “wrong coffee” because it had more milk than coffee—we sat in the lacy shade of a huge chestnut tree and recounted for Mom our encounter with the great Peter Van Houten. We made the story funny. You have a choice in this world, I believe, about how to tell sad stories, and we made the funny choice: Augustus, slumped in the café chair, pretended to be the tongue-tied, word-slurring Van Houten who could not so much as push himself out of his chair; I stood up to play a me all full of bluster and machismo, shouting, “Get up, you fat ugly old man!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you call him ugly?” Augustus asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just go with it,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m naht uggy. You’re the uggy one, nosetube girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a coward!” I rumbled, and Augustus broke character to laugh. I sat down. We told Mom about the Anne Frank House, leaving out the kissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you go back to chez Van Houten afterward?” Mom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugustus didn’t even give me time to blush. “Nah, we just hung out at a café. Hazel amused me with some Venn diagram humor.” He glanced at me. God, he was sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds lovely,” she said. “Listen, I’m going to go for a walk. Give the two of you time to talk,” she said at Gus, an edge in it. “Then maybe later we can go for a tour on a canal boat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, okay?” I said. Mom left a five-euro note under her saucer and then kissed me on the top of the head, whispering, “I love love love you,” which was two more loves than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus motioned down to the shadows of the branches intersecting and coming apart on the concrete. “Beautiful, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Such a good metaphor,” he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it now?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The negative image of things blown together and then blown apart,” he said. Before us, hundreds of people passed, jogging and biking and Rollerblading. Amsterdam was a city designed for movement and activity, a city that would rather not travel by car, and so inevitably I felt excluded from it. But God, was it beautiful, the creek carving a path around the huge tree, a heron standing still at the water’s edge, searching for a breakfast amid the millions of elm petals floating in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Augustus didn’t notice. He was too busy watching the shadows move. Finally, he said, “I could look at this all day, but we should go to the hotel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do we have time?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled sadly. “If only,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded back in the direction of the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked in silence, Augustus a half step in front of me. I was too scared to ask if I had reason to be scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there is this thing called Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Basically, this guy Abraham Maslow became famous for his theory that certain needs must be met before you can even have other kinds of needs. It looks like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce your needs for food and water are fulfilled, you move up to the next set of needs, security, and then the next and the next, but the important thing is that, according to Maslow, until your physiological needs are satisfied, you can’t even worry about security or social needs, let alone “self-actualization,” which is when you start to, like, make art and think about morality and quantum physics and stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Maslow, I was stuck on the second level of the pyramid, unable to feel secure in my health and therefore unable to reach for love and respect and art and whatever else, which is, of course, utter horseshit: The urge to make art or contemplate philosophy does not go away when you are sick. Those urges just become transfigured by illness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaslow’s pyramid seemed to imply that I was less human than other people, and most people seemed to agree with him. But not Augustus. I always thought he could love me because he’d once been sick. Only now did it occur to me that maybe he still was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrived in my room, the Kierkegaard. I sat down on the bed expecting him to join me, but he hunkered down in the dusty paisley chair. That chair. How old was it? Fifty years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the ball in the base of my throat hardening as I watched him pull a cigarette from his pack and stick it between his lips. He leaned back and sighed. “Just before you went into the ICU, I started to feel this ache in my hip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I said. Panic rolled in, pulled me under.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “So I went in for a PET scan.” He stopped. He yanked the cigarette out of his mouth and clenched his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch of my life had been devoted to trying not to cry in front of people who loved me, so I knew what Augustus was doing. You clench your teeth. You look up. You tell yourself that if they see you cry, it will hurt them, and you will be nothing but A Sadness in their lives, and you must not become a mere sadness, so you will not cry, and you say all of this to yourself while looking up at the ceiling, and then you swallow even though your throat does not want to close and you look at the person who loves you and smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed his crooked smile, then said, “I lit up like a Christmas tree, Hazel Grace. The lining of my chest, my left hip, my liver, everywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverywhere. That word hung in the air awhile. We both knew what it meant. I got up, dragging my body and the cart across carpet that was older than Augustus would ever be, and I knelt at the base of the chair and put my head in his lap and hugged him by the waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was stroking my hair. “I’m so sorry,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you,” he said, his voice calm. “Your mom must know. The way she looked at me. My mom must’ve just told her or something. I should’ve told you. It was stupid. Selfish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew why he hadn’t said anything, of course: the same reason I hadn’t wanted him to see me in the ICU. I couldn’t be mad at him for even a moment, and only now that I loved a grenade did I understand the foolishness of trying to save others from my own impending fragmentation: I couldn’t unlove Augustus Waters. And I didn’t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not fair,” I said. “It’s just so goddamned unfair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The world,” he said, “is not a wish-granting factory,” and then he broke down, just for one moment, his sob roaring impotent like a clap of thunder unaccompanied by lightning, the terrible ferocity that amateurs in the field of suffering might mistake for weakness. Then he pulled me to him and, his face inches from mine, resolved, “I’ll fight it. I’ll fight it for you. Don’t you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I’m okay. I’ll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was crying. But even then he was strong, holding me tight so that I could see the sinewy muscles of his arms wrapped around me as he said, “I’m sorry. You’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. I promise,” and smiled his crooked smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed my forehead, and then I felt his powerful chest deflate just a little. “I guess I had a hamartia after all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, I pulled him over to the bed and we lay there together as he told me they’d started palliative chemo, but he gave it up to go to Amsterdam, even though his parents were furious. They’d tried to stop him right up until that morning, when I heard him screaming that his body belonged to him. “We could have rescheduled,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, we couldn’t have,” he answered. “Anyway, it wasn’t working. I could tell it wasn’t working, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “It’s just bullshit, the whole thing,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ll try something else when I get home. They’ve always got a new idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I said, having been the experimental pincushion myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I kind of conned you into believing you were falling in love with a healthy person,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. “I’d have done the same to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you wouldn’t’ve, but we can’t all be as awesome as you.” He kissed me, then grimaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does it hurt?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Just.” He stared at the ceiling for a long time before saying, “I like this world. I like drinking champagne. I like not smoking. I like the sound of Dutch people speaking Dutch. And now . . . I don’t even get a battle. I don’t get a fight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You get to battle cancer,” I said. “That is your battle. And you’ll keep fighting,” I told him. I hated it when people tried to build me up to prepare for battle, but I did it to him, anyway. “You’ll . . . you’ll . . . live your best life today. This is your war now.” I despised myself for the cheesy sentiment, but what else did I have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some war,” he said dismissively. “What am I at war with? My cancer. And what is my cancer? My cancer is me. The tumors are made of me. They’re made of me as surely as my brain and my heart are made of me. It is a civil war, Hazel Grace, with a predetermined winner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gus,” I said. I couldn’t say anything else. He was too smart for the kinds of solace I could offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he said. But it wasn’t. After a moment, he said, “If you go to the Rijksmuseum, which I really wanted to do—but who are we kidding, neither of us can walk through a museum. But anyway, I looked at the collection online before we left. If you were to go, and hopefully someday you will, you would see a lot of paintings of dead people. You’d see Jesus on the cross, and you’d see a dude getting stabbed in the neck, and you’d see people dying at sea and in battle and a parade of martyrs. But Not. One. Single. Cancer. Kid. Nobody biting it from the plague or smallpox or yellow fever or whatever, because there is no glory in illness. There is no meaning to it. There is no honor in dying of.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-fault-in-our-stars/page-19.html","bookId":2735,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:56 PM"}
