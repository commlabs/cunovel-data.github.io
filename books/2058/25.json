I kept going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me into his condo, deftly kicking the door shut with his foot. His arms gripped me close, and we never broke the kiss as we stumbled through the living room and into his bedroom. We fell onto the bed, removing each other\u0027s clothing with practiced ease, almost like Mexico had just been the warm-up. My hands ran over the lean muscles of his chest, the scent of his skin drowning me. Letting down all restraint made me feel that much giddier - as did the sweet, glorious taste of his soul wrapping around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it my imagination, or was it a little purer than it had been in Mexico? Had one decision to come back and face his fears cleaned that darkness even a little? I didn\u0027t know for sure, and even if it wasn\u0027t perfect, the energy still felt amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he asked at last. His thoughts and feelings were coming through with the energy, and I\u0027d wondered when he\u0027d bring up the question warring with his desire. His hands continued touching me the whole time, one sliding up between my thighs. \"Why now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arched my hips against his, crying out softly as his fingers slid into me. His mouth crushed mine, killing off my response for a moment. \"Because I\u0027m tired of fighting it. You\u0027re right. We\u0027re going to keep coming back to each other over and over....\" My eloquent speech was put on hold again when his mouth moved down to my breast, letting his tongue toy with my nipple. \"You\u0027ve said before you\u0027ll risk the shortening of your life.... I\u0027ll risk your mortality. I\u0027ll risk it all to be with you...to help you. If you still want it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he breathed against my flesh. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t leave you alone through this,\" I murmured. \"And I don\u0027t want to be alone either....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were my last coherent words. He gently rolled himself onto me and slid his hands up my arms so that they could hold my wrists against the bed. I spread my legs, welcoming his body as it pushed into mine. Just like the first time we\u0027d had sex, there was one perfect moment - one moment of astonishing, total completion. Like we\u0027d found something we\u0027d lost and were afraid we\u0027d lose it again if we moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, the metaphysical sentiment was gone, replaced by the driving desire of our bodies. He thrust into me, gently at first, then steadily increased the strength. I stared at him wide-eyed, taking in every feature, refusing to miss one instant of this experience. And believe me, I was getting quite the experience. Aside from the ecstasy of our bodies moving together, I still had his energy and feelings coming in. Knowing what he was thinking as we made love added a whole new dimension to it all. Sometimes with men it would be coherent thoughts. With him, it was just pure emotion. Love and trust and longing...feelings so strong that he was willing to risk anything for them, anything to be with me. Even his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body burned against his, growing increasingly turned on by the rapture and love on his face juxtaposed with the fierceness of the way he held me and kept pushing into me. Everything grew more intense - both physically and spiritually - and my body finally reached its breaking point. I came with a loud cry and thrashed against him, wanting to free my arms and wrap them around him. He continued holding me until he came, which didn\u0027t take much longer. The full burst of his soul\u0027s energy flooded me with his orgasm, and I heard myself moaning again at the joy of it. He thrust in a few more times, the motions growing slower and longer as his body took its release. The grip on my wrists loosened, and he shifted over to his side, taking me with him. I pressed against his chest, feeling the racing of his heart and sweat on his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own heart was pounding too as my body reveled in its own satiation. Every part of me still tingled, and though there was really no way to get closer, I tried anyway. I wanted as much skin to touch as possible. I wanted as much of him blending into me as possible. He brushed the hair from my face and rained kisses down upon my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s the full succubus effect, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worth it,\" he murmured. Already, I could see the loss of energy taking its toll. \"Whatever the cost, worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI refused to allow myself to ponder that cost. Making love in the full throes of my succubus abilities might have added a powerful element, but it had undoubtedly taken years off his life. It wasn\u0027t for me to decide if it had been worth it, though. He\u0027d made this choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaid choice was exhausting him, and I knew he\u0027d soon sleep for a very long time as his body and soul recovered their losses. I shifted so that we changed positions, bringing his head to lie against my breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rest,\" I said, wrapping my arms around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tilted his head, looking up at me with warm, sleepy eyes. \"Don\u0027t want to sleep yet...I want to stay with you. Will you be here in the morning this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said, kissing the top of his head. \"I promise. I won\u0027t leave you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small smile played over his lips, and he allowed his lids to close. He snuggled against me, body relaxing. \"The world...\" he said softly, as sleep began taking him. \"You are the world, Letha....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice was too loud, jarring enough to momentarily startle him out of the slumber his body now longed for. \"Hmm? I said you were the world, Georgina.\" He gave a small yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what you called me,\" I said, trying to keep my voice calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did I call you? Thetis?\" Oh, if only. If only it had been his nickname for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You called me...Letha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fought to keep his eyes open and yawned again. \"Why would I have said that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...don\u0027t know. Where did you hear it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, indeed. Where would he have heard my name? Hardly anyone knew it. Greater immortals knew it, and that was pretty much it. The only lesser immortals who did were Niphon and Kristin, who\u0027d had access to my records. I was pretty sure they\u0027d never told my other immortal friends. I was confident they\u0027d never told Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth\u0027s brow furrowed a little, then smoothed as he closed his eyes again. \"Don\u0027t know. Greek myths, I guess. The River Lethe, where the dead go to wash away the memories from their souls...to forget the past. Isn\u0027t that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said, scarcely breathing. Where did he pull that name from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Letha, Lethe...\" I could barely hear him now. \"Almost the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost,\" I agreed. My voice was nearly as inaudible as his. My name. He shouldn\u0027t have known my name. A panic I couldn\u0027t explain began fluttering within me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about my mood must have still penetrated his haze because he stirred slightly, though his eyes remained closed. There was worry in his drowsy words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. Get some rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had he heard my name? Minutes ago I\u0027d been on fire. Now I felt cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure?\" he murmured. \"Everything\u0027s okay?\" He exhaled deeply, and I felt him succumb to sleep with those last words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said, staring off into the night. \"Everything\u0027s fine.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-shadows-georgina-kincaid-5/page-25.html","bookId":2058,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:59:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:59:24 PM"}
