You don\u0027t want to hurt him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA harsh laugh rose in her throat. “Why are you worrying about my hurting him? I\u0027m going to kill him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you don\u0027t have to kill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t? But I thought…isn\u0027t that what Vampires do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not all of us. Whether you kill him or not is up to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if I can\u0027t stop myself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a soft cry of resignation, Susie wrapped her arms around the man and buried her fangs in his neck. His head lolled back against her arm, his body quivering, but he made no sound, offered no protest, no cry of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe stood nearby, his own hunger rising as he watched Susie feed. When he judged she had taken enough, he put his hand on her arm and drew her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned on him with a feral hiss, her eyes blazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No more,” Rafe said. “If you\u0027re still hungry, we\u0027ll find someone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, her gaze fixed on his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vampires don\u0027t feed on Vampires,” Rafe said, his voice sharp. “They take a drink now and then, but never more than that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe spoke a few words to the man, erasing the memory of what had happened from his mind, and then sent him on his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusie stared after him. Gradually, the heat faded from her eyes as her fangs retracted. “I have a lot to learn, don\u0027t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027ll come to you, bit by bit. Or,” he said, grinning, “bite by bite. How do you feel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wonderful! Like I could fly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe grinned. “You will, in time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about my kids? Will they be safe around me? And what about my parents, my friends? How will I explain my sudden aversion to food and the fact that I can\u0027t go out during the day and…” Her shoulders slumped in defeat. “Maybe you should have just let me die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop it. You\u0027ve got a lot to live for. And, unless I miss my guess, Cagin will be right there to help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression softened at the mention of Cagin\u0027s name. “He asked me to marry him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m not surprised.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can I? How can I trust myself to marry anyone, or trust anyone I marry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you love him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know. I think so, but…” She shook her head. “He killed Rick, and even though he did it to save my life…how can I live with the man who killed the father of my children?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can you live without him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe put his arm around Susie\u0027s shoulders and gave her a squeeze. “It\u0027ll all work out, one way or the other. Now, do you want to go back to my place, or are you still hungry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe licked her lips, her eyes glowing. “I want some more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was watching the news, or pretending to, when Rafe and Susie entered the room. I hadn\u0027t heard them come in and couldn\u0027t hide my surprise at seeing them, nor could I stop staring at Susie. She had been a pretty young woman before, but now she was radiant. Her skin seemed to glow, her eyes looked brighter, her hair appeared thicker and more lustrous. Apparently, becoming a Vampire was better than a face-lift or a day at the spa. Of course, there were a few trade-offs, like giving up food and sunshine for blood and moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCagin sprang to his feet when he saw her. “Where the hell have you been?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Rafe, as though for reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027ve been hunting,” Rafe said calmly. He glanced around the room, making me wish I had cleared the empty pizza box and plastic coffee cups from the coffee table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes narrowed, Cagin looked at Susie as if he had never seen her before, and then he sighed. “I shouldn\u0027t have yelled at you like that, but, dammit, didn\u0027t you think I\u0027d be worried when I went in to check on you and you were gone? For all I knew, those crazy hunters had you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m sorry,” she murmured, moving closer to Rafe. “I didn\u0027t think about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, everybody just calm down,” Rafe said. “If anyone\u0027s to blame, it\u0027s me. I thought it would be best for all concerned if Susie went hunting with me the first time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” Cagin said, obviously ill at ease with the idea of his lady love hunting for prey, “how was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusie smiled up at Rafe. “Not as bad as I thought it would be. Rafe was very kind and patient with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCagin glared at Rafe. “Is that right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back off, Cagin,” Rafe said, bristling. “She needed someone to teach her what to do. If I didn\u0027t do it, who would? You?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCagin clenched his hands at his sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a minute, I thought the two of them were going to fight again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Joe, please don\u0027t be angry,” Susie said, moving to his side. “Please don\u0027t make this any more difficult than it already is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCagin muttered an oath, but the anger washed out of his eyes. “I\u0027m sorry.” He glanced at Rafe and then at me. “If you two will excuse us, I think Susie and I need to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe inclined his head, and Cagin and Susie left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did you go?” I asked. “What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just what I said. I took her hunting, just as my father once took me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re not her father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong. She\u0027s my fledgling, and I\u0027m her sire. She belongs to me now, in a way she\u0027ll never belong to Cagin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t think I like the sound of that. In fact, I\u0027m sure of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe smiled indulgently as he sat beside me on the sofa. “We\u0027re not bound the way you and I are bound,” he assured me. “No one else will ever share what we have.” His knuckles slid over my cheek. “Don\u0027t you know that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he looked at me like that, how could I doubt him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, she\u0027s going to be all right, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She looks different. Does becoming a Vampire affect everyone that way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too bad you can\u0027t bottle it,” I muttered. “You could make a fortune.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re angry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tossed a lock of hair over my shoulder. “Why should I be angry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jealous, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have denied it, but what was the point? He could read the truth in my mind. I blew out a sigh, annoyed with myself for being jealous of a Vampire, no matter how pretty she was. So what if she would never grow old, never get sick? She would never enjoy a good meal again, never take her children to the park on a sunny day, never share her whole life with her sons, or with the man she loved. Shape-shifters lived longer than humans, but not as long as Werewolves or Vampires. Susie, it seemed, was destined to live a long life as one creature or the other. Barring accidents, she might outlive Cagin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kathy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to talk about Susie anymore, didn\u0027t want to delve too deeply into the reason for my jealousy, so I changed the subject. “What do you suppose Edna and Pearl are up to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know,” Rafe said, his voice brittle, “but I intend to find out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you going to do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m going after them, back to the lab, if necessary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you crazy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t worry. They won\u0027t take me unaware this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone has to stop them,” he said. “If I don\u0027t do it, who will?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Mara?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mara\u0027s not here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Clive? Or…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe silenced me by pulling me into his arms and kissing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMumbling, “You don\u0027t fight fair,” I closed my eyes and lost myself in his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forgot everything else until I heard Cagin clear his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want?” Rafe asked gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to decide what to do. Susie and I can\u0027t stay here forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe kissed the tip of my nose, then drew me against his side. “I\u0027m going after Edna and the others.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Later tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll go with you,” Cagin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, too,” Susie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe nodded. “We\u0027ll wait until after midnight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do you think they\u0027ll be?” Cagin asked. He sat in one of the chairs, and Susie sat in the one across from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No telling. We\u0027ll start at Edna\u0027s place. If she\u0027s not there, we\u0027ll assume they\u0027re out at the lab.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if they aren\u0027t there?” Susie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then they\u0027re probably out looking for us,” Rafe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we should bait a trap and let them come to us,” Cagin suggested. “Take them on our turf, on our terms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe frowned. “What do you have in mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could let the girls go to Kathy\u0027s house. Sooner or later, one of the hunters will come looking for them there, and when they do, we\u0027ll be waiting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe shook his head. “Forget it. I\u0027m not using Kathy for bait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it\u0027s a good idea,” Susie said. “Don\u0027t you think so, Kathy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe glared at me. “I said forget it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Susie will be with me,” I argued. “She\u0027s a Vampire now. Doesn\u0027t she have the same powers that you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More or less,” Rafe admitted grudgingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No matter what we decide to do, I need a change of clothing,” Susie declared. “I can\u0027t stand my own smell.” She looked at Cagin and wrinkled her nose. “You could do with a change of clothes, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit,” Rafe said, “we\u0027ve got more important things to worry about than that.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-41.html","bookId":2301,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:58 PM"}
