A bee flew at my face and stung right here.\" She touched a spot just below her right eye, high on the crest of her cheek. \u0027The side of my face swelled until my eye closed... I couldn\u0027t see from it for almost two weeks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingertips smoothed over her cheek as if to soothe the long-ago injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"â€”and my brother and sister called me Cyclops.\" She watched him struggle not to smile. \u0027They still do, whenever a bee flies too near.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe regarded her with friendly sympathy. \"Everyone\u0027s afraid of something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you afraid of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ceilings and walls, mostly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him in puzzlement, her thoughts still coursing too slowly. \"You mean .. . you would rather live outside like a wild creature?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s what I mean. Have you ever slept outside before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the ground?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer bewildered tone made him grin. \"On a pallet beside a fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia tried to imagine it, lying undefended on the hard ground, at the mercy of every creature that crawled, crept, or flew. \"I don\u0027t think I could fall asleep that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt his hand playing slowly in the loose locks of her hair. \"You could.\" His voice was soft. \"I would help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no idea what he meant by that. All she knew was that as his fingertips reached her scalp, she felt a sensual shiver run down her spine. Clumsily she reached for her bodice, trying to pull the reinforced fabric together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allow me. You\u0027re still unsteady.\" His hands brushed hers aside and he began to hook her corset deftly. Clearly he was familiar with the intricacies of a woman\u0027s undergarments. Amelia didn\u0027t doubt there had been more than a few ladies willing to let him practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlustered, she asked, \"Was I stung anywhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Mischief flickered in his eyes. \"I checked thoroughly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia suppressed a little moan of distress. She was tempted to push his hands away from her, except that he was restoring her clothing far more efficiently than she would have. She closed her eyes, trying to pretend she wasn\u0027t sprawled in a man\u0027s lap while he fastened her corset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll need a local beekeeper to remove the hive,\" Rohan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking of the enormous colony in the wall, Amelia asked, \"How will he kill them all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He may not have to. If possible, he\u0027ll sedate them with smoke and transfer the queen to a movable frame hive. The rest will follow. But if he can\u0027t manage that, he\u0027ll have to kill the colony with soap water. The larger problem is how to remove the comb and the honey. If you don\u0027t take it all out, it will ferment and attract all kinds of vermin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes opened, and she looked up at him in worry. \"Will the entire wall have to be removed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Rohan could reply, a new voice entered the conversation. \"What\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Leo, who had just arisen from bed and pulled on his clothes. He came barefoot from the direction of his\u0027 bedroom. His bleary gaze moved over the pair of them. \"Why are you on the floor with your buttons undone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia considered the question. \"I decided to have a spontaneous tryst in the middle of the hallway with a man I hardly know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, try to be quiet about it next time. A fellow needs his sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia stared at him quizzically. \"For heaven\u0027s sake, Leo, aren\u0027t you worried that I may have been compromised?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...\" Her face turned hot as she glanced into Rohan\u0027s vivid topaz eyes. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re not sure about it,\" Leo said, \"you probably weren\u0027t.\" He came to Amelia, sank to his haunches, and stared at her steadily. His voice gentled. \"What happened, sis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed an unsteady finger at the closed door. \u0027There are bees in there, Leo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bees. Good God.\" Her brother gave her an affectionately mocking smile. \"What a coward you are, Cyclops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia scowled, levering herself upward from Rohan\u0027s lap. He braced her automatically, his arm firm behind her back. \"Go see for yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo sauntered lazily to the room, opened it, and stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn two seconds, he had sped out, slammed the door, and lodged his shoulders against it. \"Christ!\" His eyes were wide and glazed. \"There must be thousands of them!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d estimate at least two hundred thousand,\" Rohan said. Finishing the last of Amelia\u0027s buttons, he helped her to her feet. \"Slowly,\" he murmured. \"You might be a bit light-headed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let him support her while she assessed her uncertain balance. \"I\u0027m steady now. Thank you.\" Her hand was still clasped in his. Rohan\u0027s fingers were long and graceful, the thumb band gleaming against honey-colored skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUneasily Amelia drew her hand away and told her brother, \"Mr. Rohan saved my life twice today. First I nearly fell out the window, and then I found the bees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This house,\" Leo muttered, \"should be torn down and used for matchsticks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should order a full structural inspection,\" Rohan said. \"The house has settled badly. Some of the chimneys are leaning, and the entrance hall ceiling is sagging. You\u0027ve got damaged joinery and beams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what the problems are.\" The calm appraisal had annoyed Leo. He\u0027d retained enough of his past architectural training to assess the house\u0027s condition accurately. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-32.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
