Ron wants me to help, but what if he gives me a job I can\u0027t do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to give him a reason to resent I\u0027m his kid. And if the opposite happened, if he bragged to everyone how great I am, I don\u0027t want the truth to come out that I\u0027m less than perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep down, even though we have major issues to overcome, I want him to be proud of me. I know it\u0027s a dumb thought, but it\u0027s true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend the next hour rearranging my side of the closet. My eye catches on the skimpy clothes on the other side. Snotty sure does like showing a lot of skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk outside and wouldn\u0027t you know the yelping pup is waiting for me at the door. Great, the only one who likes me here is a dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arg!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dumb mutt,\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arg!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore the mop following me at my feet. My spirits lift a bit when in front of the house, right under a nice big tree, is a hammock. I maneuver myself into it and put my hands behind my head as a pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arg!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look in between the holes in the hammock and notice the mutt under me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" I ask it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arg! Arg! Arg!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groan. Dogs aren\u0027t my thing. They\u0027re really not. But just to shut it up I get off the hammock and pick up the nuisance. I get back on the hammock with the thing in my arms. It has to lay on me because he\u0027d fall through the holes otherwise. He finds a comfortable spot on my stomach and sighs contentedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst my better judgment, I find myself petting him. Even though he probably has fleas and other insects living off his body, he\u0027s soft and fluffy, like a down comforter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down and spot a cherubic face smiling up at me. It\u0027s my little cousin, Matan. He can\u0027t say my name right, he just calls me I-me. I think it\u0027s cute so I don\u0027t correct him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMutt jumps off my lap and I sit up. I see Matan has collected flowers in his chubby hands, and they\u0027re for me. My frozen heart starts to melt as he hands me the yellow, purple, and white wildflowers (or weeds, however you choose to look at them).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile widens when I take the flowers from him, smell them, and say, \"Mmmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s amazing how little effort it takes to make a child happy. Unfortunately, they all grow up and become cynical sixteen-year-olds like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicking Matan up, I set him on the hammock next to me. He laughs as I swing the thing back and forth. I take one of the flowers and push the stem into his hair, the flower sticking out of his long, curly locks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty,\" I say, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know he doesn\u0027t understand a word of English, but he laughs back, then takes a flower out of my hand and puts it into my hair. We do this for about ten minutes, until we\u0027re both full of colorful wildflowers sticking out of our hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe speaks Hebrew to me and I speak English back to him. It doesn\u0027t matter that we\u0027re both oblivious to what the other is saying, we\u0027re having fun. And fun is universal in any language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lady who I haven\u0027t seen before comes up to us and says something to Matan. He jumps off the hammock and runs to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yucky left him with me, but he wanted to come see you. I hope it was okay,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine,\" I say. \"What does the name Matan mean in Hebrew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks down at my little cousin. \"It means \u0027gift,\u0027\" she explains before leading him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns back, runs to me, and gives me a big hug. \"Shalom, I-me,\" he says, then bounds off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give a little wave. \"Shalom, Matan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he looks back with his hair full of flowers and furiously waves back at me, I realize I\u0027ve just made my second friend in Israel (Mutt being the first).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t trust males. Human or otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing into the house, I take out my nail polish and hold it up. Cotton Candy is the name of the color. It\u0027s a bright, shiny pink that sparkles in the sunlight. I think it\u0027ll look great when the hellish sun reflects off of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide to paint my nails outside in the sun after I take the old polish off. Sitting down on the concrete in front of the house, I open the bottle. I feel better. I guess doing something I\u0027m used to doing back home helps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mutt lies down next to me, using me as his shady tree. I let him, just because he\u0027ll keep bugging me anyway. I paint my toenails until I hear a sound coming out of the mutt\u0027s butt that sounds surprisingly like a fart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eww,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog doesn\u0027t get up, he just looks at me like I\u0027m bothering him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, if you\u0027re going to hang around me there\u0027s a couple of rules. Rule number one: bark like a dog. Rule number two: take a bath before you rub up against me. Rule number three: I don\u0027t want a dog, so go find someone else to bug. Rule number four, five, and six: no dog farts. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWouldn\u0027t you know it the mutt gets his lazy ass up and walks away. Did I say something wrong? Maybe I should go play with him later. Just so there\u0027s no hard feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go back to painting my nails when I hear someone walk up to the house. I look over and it\u0027s Avi, the last guy in the universe I want to see. And he\u0027s staring at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dip the brush in the nail polish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why stare? You\u0027ve already seen me without my clothes on,\" I say, trying not to look in his direction. It\u0027s pretty hard, because he looks like an Abercrombie model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I remember he saw me naked and I want him to be anywhere but in my line of vision. I can\u0027t walk because my toenails are wet and I don\u0027t want to smudge them. Anyway, why should I be the one to move?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMutt decides at that moment to come back. I expect him to come directly to me, but instead he hobbles over to Avi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t touch that thing,\" I say. \"He\u0027s dirtier than my Uncle Bob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Bob works in a factory. He cleans up okay, but no matter how many times he washes his hands, there\u0027s always this black, gooey gunk stuck under his nails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi bends down and pets the traitor, who wags his tail so vigorously you\u0027d think it was a flag in some parade. Then he looks at me. Not the traitor, Avi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not much for helping, are you?\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t even have to try and sneer, his comment makes my lip curl on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I go back to painting my toenails a second coat. But now I\u0027m so pissed at what Avi said my hand starts shaking and I\u0027m getting nail polish on my toe-skin. Each stroke now looks like a two-year-old kid had a field day with the brush on my toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog trots over to me and buries his wet nose under my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe won\u0027t leave, he just sits down in front of me. I look over at Avi again, who\u0027s still eyeing me. Why does he do that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arg!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Traitor,\" I grumble through gritted teeth to the mutt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arg!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I tell you what the mutt does next you\u0027re not going to believe me. He sticks that butt of his in the air, like he\u0027s trying to play with me or something. When I don\u0027t take the bait, he grabs my shoe with his teeth and runs away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow this isn\u0027t just any shoe, it\u0027s my one and only pair of Ferragamo jelly sandals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give that back!\" I yell. \"Do you have any idea how much that cost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to grab for it, but the white devil-pup starts shaking it back and forth in its mouth like a chew toy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it,\" I say in a loud, warning tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he doesn\u0027t. He starts running away with it. I get up, trying not to ruin my still-wet toenails in the process. But it\u0027s no use. As I head toward the dog, it trots away in the opposite direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it\u0027s war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the time I go through life at a relatively slow pace, but that doesn\u0027t mean I can\u0027t haul ass every once in a while. The only problem is my boobs bob up and down when I run fast. But I try not to think of that. I\u0027m concentrating on saving my Ferragamo sandal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mutt stops beside one of the houses and I pretend I\u0027m not going to get it. I sneak behind a lemon tree with the hugest lemons I\u0027ve ever seen. They\u0027re as big as a baby\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I think he might forget I\u0027m behind the tree, I sneak a look at him. His butt is in the air again and his tail is wagging a mile a minute. He\u0027s looking straight at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd my sandal is still in his mangy, slobbery mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should get neutered,\" I say as I step from behind the tree. Maybe then he\u0027d have some respect for Ferragamo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grrrr.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, no \u0027arg\u0027?\" While I\u0027m talking to him, I\u0027m sneaking up to him. \"Keep that tail wagging so I can have something to grab at when I catch you, you slimy mutt.\" Grrrr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t scare me,\" I continue, inching closer. I\u0027m almost within reach. Grrrr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy concentration is solely on the sandal until I step and feel something squishy squeeze in between my toes. I look down and realize I\u0027ve just stepped on an old, rotten cucumber. But at second glance, I realize it\u0027s not a cucumber, it\u0027s a DEAD SNAKE. It\u0027s black, but shimmers a bright fluorescent green in the sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never been more grossed out as I am now, running toward my uncle and aunt\u0027s house. Obscenities, some I even make up, are streaming out of my mouth. I\u0027m trying hard not to think about the snake-guts that must be in the crevices of my toes as I run as fast as my legs can carry me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ho ...\" I say to Avi in-between gagging. Please dear God let me get the word out before gagging again. \"Ho ...\" Gag. \"Hose!\" I point to my foot just in case he doesn\u0027t get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jerk gives a short laugh (at my expense) and I follow him to the back of the house. When I see the hose, I run toward it as fast as my snake-encrusted feet can carry me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi turns the handle and I quickly chance a glance at my gross foot. Little pieces of black, stringy guts are peeking out from in between my toes. My toenails are dry now, with pieces of grass or hay stuck to them permanently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m still gagging, I can\u0027t help it. I think if I stop looking at my toes I can get through this. When the water starts spurting out of the hose, I take it from him and aim the water toward my foot. My gaze lands on Avi. \"Thanks a lot for helping me get my sandal,\" I say sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks a lot for helping with the sheeps,\" he counters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s sheep, not sheeps. Whether you have one sheep or a million of\u0027 em, it\u0027s still sheep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks forward and pulls the hose out of my hand. I watch wide-eyed as he bends on one knee and lifts my gross foot and places it in his hand. Then, if you can believe it, he washes my foot thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m about to lose my balance, I really am. And it\u0027s not because I want Avi to catch me or anything. I hate playing the damsel in distress every time he\u0027s around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m lightheaded because it\u0027s ungodly hot outside and I just busted my ass to run after a Ferragamo-stealing mutt. To top it off, this boy who I\u0027m determined to hate has one of my feet in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can stop gagging. Whatever you stepped in is gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a snake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs. Like it\u0027s no biggie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ever stepped on a snake?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I usually watch where I step.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yank my foot out of his grasp. \"Well, where I live there are no snakes. Dead or otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands, which is not so great because I was feeling superior when he was on his knee. But he\u0027s probably six feet tall and when he looks down at me I feel small. Instead of responding, he gently pulls a flower out of my hair. \"Cute,\" he says, twirling the stem between his fingers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-9.html","bookId":2764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM"}
