Once out of the charnel house, Beauregard realised that though the mystery was solved, he was faced with a quandary. The women were dead, Seward hopelessly mad. What justice would be served by turning him over to Lestrade? In whose interests was he to act now? Sir Charles Warren\u0027s, by letting the police take credit for an arrest? The Prince Consort\u0027s, by turning over another vanquished foe to the spikes outside the Palace?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He bit me,\u0027 the Ripper said, remembering some trivial incident, \u0027the madman bit me.\u0027 Seward held out his gloved, swollen hand. Blood was pooled in the palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Vlad Tepes will make him immortal, just so he can torture him forever,\u0027 Genevieve said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone came out of the chandler\u0027s shop and stood in the archway. Beauregard saw red eyes in the dark and made out the silhouette of a big man in a check ulster and a billycock hat. How much had this vampire witnessed? He stepped into the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well done, sir. You\u0027ve put an end to Jack the Ripper.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Sergeant Dravot from the Diogenes Club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All along, sir, there were two murderers, working together,\u0027 said Dravot. \u0027It should have been obvious.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world was spinning again, the cobbles beneath him falling away. Beauregard did not know where it would stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDravot bent down and whipped a ragged blanket away from a human bundle that had been shoved into a corner. A dead white face stared up, lips drawn back in a last snarl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s Godalming,\u0027 Beauregard exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Lord Godalming, sir,\u0027 Dravot said. \u0027He was in it with Dr Seward. They fell out last night.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard could not make all the pieces fit. He knelt by the body. There was a large patch of black blood on his breast, soaking his shirt. In the patch was a ragged wound, over the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How long have you known all this, Dravot?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You caught the Rippers, sir. I\u0027ve just been looking out for you. The cabal set me up as your guardian angel.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve was standing apart from them, holding Jack Seward\u0027s arm. Her face was shadowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And Jago? Was that you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDravot shrugged. \u0027Another matter, sir.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard stood, pushing the cobbles with his cane, and brushed off his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027ll be a fearful scandal. Godalming was well-thought-of. He had a reputation as a coming man.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027His name will be entirely blackened, sir.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And he was a vampire. That will cause a stir. The assumption was that the Ripper was warm.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDravot nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I should think the cabal will be delighted,\u0027 Beauregard continued. \u0027This will embarrass a great many people. There will be repercussions. Careers will be smashed, reputations overturned. The Prime Minister will look foolish.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve spoke bitterly. \u0027It\u0027s all very tidy, gentlemen. But what about Jack?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDravot and Beauregard looked at her. And at Seward. The Ripper was propped against the wall of the court. His face was wearily free of expression. Blood dribbled from his wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027His mind is gone completely,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027Whatever glue held him together is dissolved.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It would be best if Mr Beauregard did the honours.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve looked at Dravot with something approaching loathing. Beauregard felt he had no choice. His actions had been directed by others. He was almost at the end of his duty. With a great weariness, he realised he had done little but leap hurdles on a course set out for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hold him up,\u0027 Beauregard said. \u0027Against the wall.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve\u0027s hand was at Seward\u0027s throat, her nails extending. \u0027Charles,\u0027 she said. \u0027You don\u0027t have to. If it must be done, I can...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. She could not spare him this. It had been the same with Elizabeth Stride. He had simply been merciful. \u0027It\u0027s alright, Genevieve,\u0027 he said. \u0027Just hold him.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew what he was about and gave her consent. She took her hand from Seward\u0027s throat. \u0027Good-bye, Jack,\u0027 she said. He gave no sign of understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard drew his sword-cane. The rasp cut through the tiny night-sounds. Genevieve nodded and Beauregard slipped his blade through Seward\u0027s heart. The point scraped brickwork. Beauregard withdrew the sword, and sheathed it. Seward, cleanly dead, crumpled. He fell beside Godalming. Two monsters together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good work, sir,\u0027 Dravot said. \u0027You cornered the murderers and Dr Seward became frenzied. He destroyed his confederate and you bested him in single combat.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard was irritated to be treated as if he were a schoolboy being tutored by his fellows in an excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And what of me?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard and Dravot both looked at Genevieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Am I a \"loose end\"? Like Jack, like Godalming? Like that poor girl in there?\u0027 She nodded to Mary Jane Kelly\u0027s doorway. \u0027You let him butcher her, didn\u0027t you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDravot said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You or Jack killed Godalming. Then, knowing what he was, you stood back in the shadows and let him account for her. It was tidier that way. You didn\u0027t even dirty your hands.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDravot deferred. Beauregard was sure the Sergeant had a revolver about him, loaded with silver bullets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We came along at a convenient time,\u0027 she continued. \u0027To finish off the story.\u0027 Genevieve held out Seward\u0027s scalpel. \u0027Do you want to use this? That would be neater.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Genevieve,\u0027 Beauregard said, \u0027I don\u0027t understand...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, you wouldn\u0027t. Poor Charles. Between bloodsuckers like Godalming and this creature,\u0027 meaning Dravot, \u0027you\u0027re a lost lamb. Just as Jack Seward was.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard stared long at Genevieve before he turned to Dravot. If it came to it, he would protect her with his life. There were limits to his devotion to the plans of the Diogenes Club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sergeant was gone. Beyond the archway, the fog was dispersing. It was nearly dawn. Genevieve came to him and he embraced her. The world stopped tilting and turning. Together, they were the fixed point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What happened here,\u0027 she asked, \u0027what truly happened?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not yet know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, bone-tired, they emerged from Miller\u0027s Court. On the other side of Dorset Street, a pair of constables strolled, chatting together on their beat. Genevieve whistled, to get their attention. Her trilling was not a human sound. It pierced his eardrums like a needle. The coppers, truncheons out, trotted towards them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027ll be the hero,\u0027 she whispered to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027ve no choice.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe policemen were with them. They both looked terribly young. One was Collins, whom he remembered from his visit with Sergeant Thick. He recognised Beauregard and all but saluted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s a dead woman in that court,\u0027 he told them. \u0027And a pair of murderers, also dead. Jack the Ripper is finished.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollins looked shocked. Then he grinned. \u0027Is it over?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s over,\u0027 Beauregard said, uncertain but convincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two constables dashed into Miller\u0027s Court. After a moment, they rushed out again and began blowing their whistles. Soon the area would be thick with policemen, journalists, sensation-seekers. Beauregard and Genevieve would have to explain at length, more times than either could really bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his mind, Beauregard saw Jack Seward on his knees in the ground-floor back room with the bloody thing that had been Mary Jane Kelly. Genevieve shuddered along with him. The memory was something they would share forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He was mad,\u0027 she said \u0027and not responsible.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then who,\u0027 he asked, \u0027was responsible?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The thing who drove him mad.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard looked up. The last moonlight shone down through thinning fog. He fancied he saw a bat, large and black, flit across the face of the moon. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/anno-dracula-anno-dracula-1/page-56.html","bookId":2524,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:17 PM"}
