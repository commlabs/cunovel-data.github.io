There had only beensix, then;\u0026nbsp; the five old Encyclopedists\u0026nbsp; ?all dead now\u0026nbsp; ?and himself, theyoung figurehead\u0026nbsp; of a mayor. It had been on that\u0026nbsp; day, that he, with YohanLee\u0027s\u0026nbsp; assistance\u0026nbsp; had removed\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; \"figurehead\" stigma\u0026nbsp; from his\u0026nbsp; office.\n\u003cbr\u003e It was\u0026nbsp; quite different now; different\u0026nbsp; in every respect. Every\u0026nbsp; man of theCity\u0026nbsp; Council\u0026nbsp; was awaiting\u0026nbsp; Seldon\u0027s\u0026nbsp; appearance. He,\u0026nbsp; himself, was\u0026nbsp; stillmayor,\u0026nbsp; but\u0026nbsp; all-powerful\u0026nbsp; now;\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; since\u0026nbsp; the utter\u0026nbsp; rout\u0026nbsp; of\u0026nbsp; Anacreon,all-popular. When he had\u0026nbsp; returned from Anacreon with the news of the deathof\u0026nbsp; Wienis, and\u0026nbsp; the new treaty\u0026nbsp; signed with\u0026nbsp; the trembling Lepold,\u0026nbsp; he wasgreeted with\u0026nbsp; a vote\u0026nbsp; of confidence of\u0026nbsp; shrieking unanimity. When\u0026nbsp; this wasfollowed in rapid order,\u0026nbsp; by similar treaties signed with each of the otherthree kingdoms\u0026nbsp; ?treaties\u0026nbsp; that gave the\u0026nbsp; Foundation powers such\u0026nbsp; as wouldforever\u0026nbsp; prevent any\u0026nbsp; attempts at\u0026nbsp; attack similar\u0026nbsp; to that of\u0026nbsp; Anacreon\u0027s ?\n\u003cbr\u003e torchlight processions had been\u0026nbsp; held in every city street of Terminus. Noteven Hari Seldon\u0027s name had been more loudly cheered.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hardin\u0027s lips twitched. Such popularity had been his after the first crisisalso.\n\u003cbr\u003e Across\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; room, Sef\u0026nbsp; Sermak\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; Lewis Bort\u0026nbsp; were\u0026nbsp; engaged in\u0026nbsp; animateddiscussion, and recent events\u0026nbsp; seemed to have put them out not at all. Theyhad joined in the\u0026nbsp; vote of confidence; made speeches in which they publiclyadmitted that they had been in the wrong, apologized handsomely for the useof\u0026nbsp; certain phrases\u0026nbsp; in earlier\u0026nbsp; debates, excused themselves\u0026nbsp; delicately bydeclaring\u0026nbsp; they had\u0026nbsp; merely followed\u0026nbsp; the dictates\u0026nbsp; of their\u0026nbsp; judgement andtheir\u0026nbsp; conscience\u0026nbsp; ?and\u0026nbsp; immediately\u0026nbsp; launched a\u0026nbsp; new Actionist\u0026nbsp; campaign.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yohan Lee\u0026nbsp; touched Hardin\u0027s sleeve and\u0026nbsp; pointed significantly to his watch.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hardin looked up. \"Hello there, Lee. Are you still sour? What\u0027s wrong now?\"\"He\u0027s due in five minutes, isn\u0027t he?\"\"I presume so. He appeared at noon last time.\"\"What if he doesn\u0027t?\"\"Are\u0026nbsp; you going\u0026nbsp; to wear\u0026nbsp; me down with\u0026nbsp; your worries\u0026nbsp; all your life?\u0026nbsp; If hedoesn\u0027t, he won\u0027t.\"Lee\u0026nbsp; frowned and\u0026nbsp; shook his\u0026nbsp; head slowly.\u0026nbsp; \"If this\u0026nbsp; thing flops,\u0026nbsp; we\u0027re inanother mess. Without Seldon\u0027s\u0026nbsp; backing for what we\u0027ve done, Sermak will befree to start all\u0026nbsp; over. He wants outright annexation of the Four Kingdoms,and immediate\u0026nbsp; expansion of the\u0026nbsp; Foundation ?by force,\u0026nbsp; if necessary. He\u0027sbegun his campaign, already.\"\"I know.\u0026nbsp; A fire eater must\u0026nbsp; eat fire even if he\u0026nbsp; has to kindle it himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e And you,\u0026nbsp; Lee, have got to\u0026nbsp; worry even if you\u0026nbsp; must kill yourself to inventsomething to worry about.\"Lee would\u0026nbsp; have answered, but he\u0026nbsp; lost his breath at\u0026nbsp; just that moment ?asthe lights\u0026nbsp; yellowed and went dim. He raised his arm\u0026nbsp; to point to the glasscubicle that dominated half the room and then collapsed into a chair with awindy sigh.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hardin himself straightened at\u0026nbsp; the sight of the figure that now filled thecubicle ? a figure in a wheel chair! He alone,\u0026nbsp; of all those present couldremember the day, decades\u0026nbsp; ago, when that figure had appeared first. He hadbeen young then, and\u0026nbsp; the figure old. Since then, the figure had not aged aday, but he himself had in turn grown old.\n\u003cbr\u003e The\u0026nbsp; figure stared\u0026nbsp; straight\u0026nbsp; ahead, hands\u0026nbsp; fingering\u0026nbsp; a book\u0026nbsp; in its\u0026nbsp; lap.\n\u003cbr\u003e It said, \"I am Hari Seldon!\" The voice was old and soft.\n\u003cbr\u003e There\u0026nbsp; was a\u0026nbsp; breathless\u0026nbsp; silence in\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; room and\u0026nbsp; Hari Seldon\u0026nbsp; continuedconversationally, \"This\u0026nbsp; is the\u0026nbsp; second time I\u0027ve\u0026nbsp; been here. Of\u0026nbsp; course, Idon\u0027t know if any\u0026nbsp; of you were here the first time. In\u0026nbsp; fact, I have no wayof telling, by sense perception, that there is anyone here at all, but thatdoesn\u0027t\u0026nbsp; matter. If\u0026nbsp; the second\u0026nbsp; crisis has\u0026nbsp; been overcome safely,\u0026nbsp; you arebound to be here; there is no way out. If you are not here, then the secondcrisis has been too much for you.\"He\u0026nbsp; smiled engagingly.\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0026nbsp; doubt\u0026nbsp; that,\u0026nbsp; however,\u0026nbsp; for my\u0026nbsp; figures\u0026nbsp; show aninety-eight point\u0026nbsp; four percent probability there\u0026nbsp; is to be no significantdeviation from the Plan in the first eighty years.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"According\u0026nbsp; to our\u0026nbsp; calculations, you\u0026nbsp; have now\u0026nbsp; reached domination\u0026nbsp; of thebarbarian kingdoms\u0026nbsp; immediately surrounding the Foundation.\u0026nbsp; Just as in thefirst crisis\u0026nbsp; you held them off\u0026nbsp; by use of the Balance\u0026nbsp; of Power, so in thesecond, you\u0026nbsp; gained mastery\u0026nbsp; by use of\u0026nbsp; the Spiritual Power\u0026nbsp; as against theTemporal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"However, I might warn you here against overconfidence. It is not my way togrant you\u0026nbsp; any foreknowledge in these\u0026nbsp; recordings, but it would\u0026nbsp; be safe toindicate that what you have now achieved is merely a new balance-though onein which\u0026nbsp; your position is considerably\u0026nbsp; better. The Spiritual Power, whilesufficient to ward off\u0026nbsp; attacks of the Temporal is not sufficient to attackin turn. Because of\u0026nbsp; the invariable growth of the counteracting force knownas Regionalism,\u0026nbsp; or Nationalism,\u0026nbsp; the Spiritual Power cannot\u0026nbsp; prevail. I amtelling you nothing new, I\u0027m sure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You must pardon me, by the way, for speaking to you in this vague way. Theterms I\u0026nbsp; use are at best mere approximations, but\u0026nbsp; none of you is qualifiedto understand\u0026nbsp; the true\u0026nbsp; symbology of psychohistory,\u0026nbsp; and so I\u0026nbsp; must do thebest I can.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"In this\u0026nbsp; case, the Foundation is only at the start\u0026nbsp; of the path that leadsto the\u0026nbsp; Second Galactic\u0026nbsp; Empire. The neighboring kingdoms,\u0026nbsp; in manpower andresources\u0026nbsp; are still\u0026nbsp; overwhelmingly\u0026nbsp; powerful as\u0026nbsp; compared to\u0026nbsp; yourselves.\n\u003cbr\u003e Outside them lies the\u0026nbsp; vast tangled jungle of barbarism that extends aroundthe entire\u0026nbsp; breadth of the Galaxy.\u0026nbsp; Within that rim there\u0026nbsp; is still what isleft of the Galactic Empire ?and that, weakened and decaying though it is,is still incomparably mighty.\"At this\u0026nbsp; point, Hari\u0026nbsp; Seldon lifted his\u0026nbsp; book and opened it.\u0026nbsp; His face grewsolemn. \"And\u0026nbsp; never forget there was\u0026nbsp; another Foundation established eightyyears ago; a Foundation at the other end of the Galaxy, at Star\u0027s End.

In the babble that followed, Lee leaned overto Hardin\u0027s ear. \"He didn\u0027t say when he\u0027d be back.\"Hardin replied, \"I\u0026nbsp; know ?but I trust he won\u0027t return\u0026nbsp; until you and I aresafely and cozily dead!\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47176.html","bookId":127,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 4:38:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 4:38:24 AM"}
