{"id":75257,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003eAt her desk Monday morning, Phoebe attacked paperwork, returned calls, then squeezed out time to go over her plans for the upcoming training session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might have been kicking Arnie Meeks when he was down-and absent-but she wanted to lay out the protocol, procedure and psychology of the first responder\u0027s actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSets the tone, she thought. Arnie had sure as hell set the tone for the Gradey incident. What happened, why it happened, would be strong points made in training, and would illustrate, she hoped, why there were guidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe added a copy of her own report to the day\u0027s packet, added it along with logs and tapes and transcripts from other incidents. She got to her feet when Dave came into her office. \"Captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Need a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, I\u0027ve got a few before a training session. Want coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks.\" When he shut the door behind him, the muscles between her shoulder blades tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could be. I got a call from Sergeant Meeks, Arnold Meeks\u0027s father. He\u0027s making noises about filing a complaint against you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The unwarranted suspension of his son. Also there was some mention of a legal suit for slander, defamation. He wants a sit-down with you, me and his son\u0027s rep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m available for that, at any time. I instructed Arnie he was free to contact his delegate at the time of his suspension. And,\" she added, \"that\u0027s on the record.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to stand by the thirty-day rip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. He violated every guideline. He goaded Gradey, a hostagetaker, into suicide, and he\u0027s lucky Gradey didn\u0027t kill the hostages, too. You read the report, Captain, including the witness statementscivilian and law enforcement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I did.\" Wearily, Dave rubbed the back of his neck. \"He couldn\u0027t have screwed it up more if he\u0027d set out to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure he didn\u0027t. That\u0027s not colored by personal dislike,\" she continued when Dave frowned. \"He\u0027s a power-tripper, and he\u0027s bigoted, sexist and rash. He shouldn\u0027t be a cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phoebe, that kind of stand, the bias in it, isn\u0027t going to help hold up your end of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not bias, it\u0027s fact. And, I believe, the psych eval will bear me out. Dave, he put that mutilated doll outside my house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave shoved his hands into his pockets, and inside the pockets they curled into fists. \"I\u0027m not going to contradict you on that, but you\u0027re going to want to be careful about making that accusation to anyone but me. You\u0027re going to need more to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He called me a bitch to my face, that\u0027s not counting the number of times he\u0027s called me one behind my back. He stood just about where you\u0027re standing now and threatened me. He has no respect for my authority, and, in fact, only contempt for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think I don\u0027t want him out?\" Dave tossed back, and for the first time he let some of the anger, some of the frustration show. \"Out of this squad, out of the department? I\u0027ve got no cause to put him off the job, not at this point. And, Phoebe, sitting behind that desk means you have to demand respect for your authority.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so I have,\" she said evenly. \"Thirty days may give him time to consider that. Captain, he stood in this office and accused me of being behind this desk because I\u0027ve performed sexual acts with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave stared at her a moment. \"Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch.\" He sucked in a breath. \"Were there any witnesses to those accusations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, and I\u0027d turned off the recorder before he made them. But he made them. Very specifically. Which indicates he has as much contempt for you as for me. Moreover, I believe he was about to make a move on me-physically. Detective Sykes interrupted. I don\u0027t like playing it this way. I don\u0027t like spreading this kind of crap around, but the fact is, I think Arnold Meeks is dangerous. So ask Sykes about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do that. I\u0027m going to schedule that sit-down for this afternoon. Make sure you\u0027re clear for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to file sexual harassment charges?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at this time. I\u0027ll stand with the insubordination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, turned toward the door. \"You may want to contact your own rep.\" He glanced back. \"The Meekses have some muscle in the department, connections, history. Keep your ass covered, Phoebe, because even if we\u0027re able to take this asshole down, he could do some damage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. Dave? I\u0027m sorry I had to pull you into it this way, this personal way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t,\" Dave said shortly. \"He did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrouble, she thought when she was alone again. Trouble was coming. Well, she\u0027d dealt with trouble before. When the morning session was finished, she\u0027d make some time to review Meeks\u0027s jacket, the statements from the Gradey incident and her own personal report of her altercation with Meeks in her office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the glass wall of her office, she saw Dave was already gesturing Sykes toward the break room. A private talk. Her captain\u0027s protective instincts were up, and she was sorry, damn sorry, she\u0027d had to incite them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was damned if Meeks was going to endanger lives, threaten her, upset her family, then pull out his departmental pedigree as a shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t care who his father was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right now, she reminded herself, she needed to put this aside and get downstairs. She swung by the PAA on the way through the squad room. \"I\u0027m in the conference room for the next ninety minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, okay. Lieutenant?\" Annie Utz, the squad\u0027s public administrative assistant, sent Phoebe a quick, nervous smile. \"I, ah, may have to take a day off later in the week for some, um, personal business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. If you can let me know ahead of time, that\u0027d be good. We\u0027ll see the desk is covered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... um... Lieutenant?\" The smile wavered around the edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I\u0027m still new and all. But I like working here. I hope I\u0027m doing a good job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re doing fine.\" Wouldn\u0027t hurt to tone down the makeup and buy the next size up in your shirt, Phoebe thought, but the work itself wasn\u0027t a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... I brought in pralines today. Homemade.\" She held up a covered paper plate. \"Maybe you\u0027d like one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After the session.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re taking the stairs, right? The way you run up and down those stairs instead of taking the elevator, sugar sure won\u0027t hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My fondness for sugar is why I run up and down the stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried out before Annie could make her any later. With the opening of her lecture winding through her mind, she pushed through the door, started the jog down the stairway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer car had to be ready today, she remembered. Had to. She\u0027d call the mechanic during the break and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe barely saw the flash of movement, had no time to react much less reach her weapon as the attack slammed her against the stairwell wall. Pain burst along with an explosion of fear when her head rammed hard against the concrete. And her vision hazed with red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds, it took only the few seconds when her instincts were screamingfight and the stun from the blow buckled her knees for tape to slap over her mouth, for her arms to be wrenched back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStruggling, dizzy from the blow, she tried to bring her heel down, missed the mark. Then she was blind from the hood yanked over her head. Her scream muffled to nothing against the tape as she pitched forward from a violent shove. Shock and pain radiated as her body hit the landing, rolled. She tasted blood, and through the thunder of her own gasps, heard her attacker laugh. Praying for a miracle, she kicked out. And when hands closed around her throat, she thrashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot this way, she couldn\u0027t die this way. Unable to look into the eyes of who killed her. Who took her away from her baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body bucked, her legs pushed and kicked while her lungs wept for air. When the pressure released, she gasped and gulped it in only to fight to scream it out again when she felt a knife, the point of a knife, cutting through her clothes, and the quick, horrible sting of that point slicking carelessly into her flesh. Hands-gloved hands, part of her mind registered-squeezed her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn\u0027t be happening. Attack and rape a cop in her own precinct? It was madness. But her kicks and struggles didn\u0027t stop his hands from tearing, from touching, from pushing roughly between her legs. And she hated herself from the sobs and pleas that babbled behind the tape. Hated that they made him laugh, that they gave him power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry.\" He whispered it, the first words he\u0027d spoken. \"I don\u0027t fuck your kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFresh pain erupted from the blow to her face. She teetered toward unconsciousness, almost welcomed it. Dimly she heard, thought she heard, footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone coming. Please, God. But no, no, leaving. He was leaving. Leaving her alive. She moaned. Everything wept, everything wept with pain. But survival, that primal need to survive, was stronger. She was afraid to roll, to try to get to her knees, to her feet. How close was she to the stairs, how close to a nasty, perhaps fatal, fall?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cuffs he\u0027d snapped on her bit brutally into her flesh, weighed down by her own body. The need to see-escape, survive-was greater than the need for relief. She hunched her shoulders, turned her head right and left, inching tortuously forward as she tested the ground with her feet. Slowly, keeping a vicious grip on panic, she worked the hood up her face until her chin was clear, her mouth, her nose. Then blessedly her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd those eyes wheeled around. She could see spots and smears of her own blood on the wall of the stairwell where her head had hit, just as she could taste it in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she could see the door below. She had to reach that door, get down the short flight of steps to that door. To survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she rolled, and her gasp went to a keening as she pushed to her knees. Tattered strips of her shirt and skirt hung on her. The rags of the rest were scattered on the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d left her naked, humiliated, bound. But he\u0027d left her alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe used the wall to brace herself, used her trembling legs to push, push, until she could stand, leaning back on the wall. Giddiness and nausea rolled through her, and she prayed she could hold off both until she reached help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the voice inside her head screamed to hurry, hurry, he could come back, she made herself step carefully down, back to the wall for safety. At the bottom, with her body quivering with fear and exhaustion, she had to find the strength to turn, to grip the door handle with her clammy hands and pull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell through the doorway, into the corridor. Shuddering, she began to crawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone shouted. She heard it like some dim bell through a fog. And, spent, she collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t out long, the pain wouldn\u0027t allow it, but when she groped back, she was on her side and the rawness around her mouth told her someone had ripped the tape away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get a blanket. Give me your damn jacket, and somebody get a key that\u0027ll open these cuffs. You\u0027re all right, Lieutenant. It\u0027s Liz Alberta. Do you hear me? You\u0027re going to be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz? Phoebe stared into grim brown eyes. Detective Elizabeth Alberta. Yes, yes, she knew that name, she knew those eyes. \"The stairwell.\" Her voice was a raw wheeze. \"He got me in the stairwell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A couple of guys are already in there, checking it out. Don\u0027t worry. Paramedics are coming. Lieutenant.\" Liz leaned closer. \"Were you raped?\" ioo I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No, he just...\" Phoebe closed her eyes. \"No. How bad am I hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My weapon.\" Phoebe\u0027s eyes flew open. \"God, my weapon. I couldn\u0027t get to it in time. Did he get my piece?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on, Lieutenant. I\u0027m going to get these cuffs off.\" Phoebe didn\u0027t know who spoke from behind her, kept her eyes trained on Liz. \"I need you to take my statement. I want you to take it.\" \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe couldn\u0027t stop the sharp indrawn breath as the cuffs slipped off, or bite back the whimper when she moved her arms. \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027re broken. I don\u0027t think anything\u0027s broken.\" She clutched the jacket to her breasts even as someone wrapped a blanket around her shoulders. \"Can you help me sit up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should stay down until-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a rush of footsteps, and a shout. Then Dave was kneeling beside her. \"What happened? Who did this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see him. He caught me in the stairwell. He put something over my head.\" Tears slid down her cheeks to sting the abraded skin. \"I think he got my weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get her statement, Captain, if that\u0027s clear with you. I\u0027ll go with the lieutenant to the hospital and get her statement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" But he gripped Phoebe\u0027s hand as if he couldn\u0027t bear to let go. \"Don\u0027t call my family. Captain, please don\u0027t call them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her hand a squeeze, pushed to his feet. \"I want this building searched, floor by floor. This is red status. Nobody comes in or out without a search. I want the whereabouts of every cop and civilian in this building accounted for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t a civilian, Captain.\" Phoebe spoke quietly as his furious face turned toward her. \"It was one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all blurred, but Phoebe counted that as a blessing. The paramedics, the ambulance, the ER. There were a lot of voices, a lot of movement, more pain. Then less, blessedly less. She let herself drift while people poked and prodded, lifted. While cuts and scrapes were treated, she kept her eyes closed. When pieces of her were X-rayed, she shut down her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be tears, she knew. There would probably be floods of them, but they could wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz stepped into the exam room. \"They said you wanted to talk to me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Phoebe sat on the exam table. Her ribs ached, that rottedtooth throb she already knew would give her trouble for days if not weeks. But the sling around her arm eased the pain in her shoulder. \"Mild concussion, bruised ribs, sprained shoulder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz stepped closer. \"Nasty cut on your forehead and a shiner coming on. Split lip. Your jaw\u0027s swollen. Son of a bitch did some work on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t kill me, there\u0027s that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always a plus. Your captain was in. He left after the docs gave him your status. I\u0027m to tell you he\u0027ll come back to take you home when you\u0027re ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s better if he stays at the house, finds... I don\u0027t know what there\u0027ll be to find. I was coming down from my office to the conference room for my training session. That\u0027s habitual. I use the stairs habitually.\" \"Claustrophobia? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, vanity. I don\u0027t always have time to work out, so I go for the stairs instead of the elevator. He was waiting for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you didn\u0027t see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Cautiously, Phoebe touched her fingers to her face, just under her eye. She\u0027d never had a black eye before, never appreciated how much it hurt. \"I was going down pretty fast, and I caught just a blur of movement out of the corner of my eye-on the right. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the ice bag Liz offered, laid it gently on the side of her face. \"He had me before I could even turn my head, before I could reach for my weapon. He knew what he was doing. Disabled me immediately with the blow to the head. Rapped me face-first into the wall, stunned me. Taped my mouth and cuffed me quick. He\u0027s used cuffs before. Anticipated my defensive moves, such as they were, and had the hood on me, or whatever it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laundry bag. It\u0027s in evidence. You\u0027re thinking you should have been quicker, fought harder. Don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t get a single lick in. I realize, intellectually, that I was stunned, physically outmatched, and still... My weapon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It hasn\u0027t been recovered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look between them held for a long moment. It was a hard blow when a cop was disarmed. It was a harder one when the cop was female. \"No one\u0027s going to blame you for that, Lieutenant. Not under these circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some will. You know it, I know it. He knows it. That\u0027s why he took it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some are idiots. Did you get an idea of height? Build?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not of height. He shoved me and I went down. But he was strong. He choked me at first...\" Her fingers traced over the bruises on her throat, and she remembered the feel of those hands cutting off her air. \"Choked me when I was down, put his hands around my throat and choked me. He had big hands. Big, strong hands. He wore gloves. I f e l\u0027t... I felt gloves-thin, probably latex-when he groped me. And a knife, maybe scissors, but I think a knife to cut through my clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He touched you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He...\" Facts, Phoebe ordered herself. Think of them as facts. \"He squeezed my breasts. He pulled my nipples, hard. He laughed. Just kind of a wheezing laugh, like he was real tickled and trying to hold it back. He pushed his hand- Shit. Oh shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnticipating, Liz grabbed a bedpan, shoved it under Phoebe\u0027s face. Held it steady while Phoebe was sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheet white under the bruises, Phoebe leaned back. \"God. God. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just take a breath, take your time. Here.\" Picking up the plastic cup and straw on the table, Liz offered it. \"Drink some water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Thanks. I\u0027m okay. He put his fingers inside me. Rammed them in. It wasn\u0027t sexual. He just wanted to hurt me, humiliate me. Then, I think he leaned down because his voice was close to my ear. He whispered. \u0027Don\u0027t worry. I don\u0027t fuck your kind.\u0027 Then he hit me in the face. And he left me there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a gauge how long the attack went on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seemed like forever, but probably two, maybe three minutes. No more than that. He had his plan in place, and he executed it efficiently. It probably took me longer to get the hood off and get down to the door. Altogether, it was probably six or seven minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Did he say anything else? Anything at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he only spoke that one time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you notice anything else about him. A scent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Wait.\" Phoebe closed her eyes again. \"Baby powder. I smelled baby powder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about his voice? Would you recognize it again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. We\u0027re trained to pay attention to details, but I was so scared, and the blood was pounding in my head, and the hood. He was local,\" she said suddenly. \"There was enough of an accent that he sounded like a local.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you had trouble with anyone? Anyone you think would want to hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I have. We may not work the same division, but we work in the same house. You know I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it was him? You think it was Arnie Meeks who attacked you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do. I can\u0027t prove it, but yes, I think it was. I reported an incident on Saturday morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What incident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told Liz about the doll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll touch base with Detective Sykes on that. And I\u0027ll make some discreet inquiries as to Meeks\u0027s whereabouts this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t raped, Lieutenant, but you were violated sexually. If you want to talk to a rape counselor, I know a good one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but thanks. You\u0027re good at what you do, Detective. I appreciate you being the one to take my statement, to be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be following up. I promise you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now, can you steal me some scrubs so I can get out of here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t I call someone for you. If you don\u0027t want the captain, someone else. Have them bring you some clothes, take you home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhoebe shook her head. \"I don\u0027t want to go home until after I\u0027ve had my breakdown, which is going to come along pretty soon now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone else I can call for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually... \" Phoebe touched her fingertips to the trio of butterfly bandages that closed the wound on her forehead. \"There\u0027s a friend, if he\u0027s around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old building had potential. Of course its current owner was giving the deal what Duncan thought of as the pitch-and-wish. He let that play in one side of his brain while the other side played with the possibilities. The warehouse was currently a dump, and no question about it. But it could be transformed into very decent apartments-close enough to the plants and the docks to fill up with blue-collar families. Reasonable space for a reasonable rent. Well off the tourist track, of course, well apart from the green elegance of the historic district. But toss maybe a bakery or a coffee shop on the first floor, a deli or a small family restaurant, and you\u0027d get a return on your investment. Eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood thing he wasn\u0027t in a hurry for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rank and file of the city needed good, safe housing as well as the rest. He should know. He\u0027d been one of them most of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhin stood with the owner, shaking his head as Duncan wandered. That was Phin\u0027s fine skill, in Duncan\u0027s opinion. Just putting on that dour, disapproving look could lasso the pitch-and-wish and yank it back toward reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy wanted the moon for the dilapidation, figuring he had a bright gold fish on the line. Duncan didn\u0027t mind being thought of as a fish, especially since he\u0027d already set his maximum offer at a couple of asteroids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his cell phone rang, he was studying a trio of broken windows. He kept studying them while he pulled it out. \"Yeah, this is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan. What? When? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned when Phin, obviously hearing the alarm in his tone, crossed the pocked concrete floor to him. \"Where? Okay, all right,\" he said a moment later. \"I\u0027m on my way. I have to go.\" Already heading for the doors, Duncan shoved the phone into his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Swift,\" the owner began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Personal emergency. Do what you do,\" he said to Phin and rushed outside to his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen horrific images flashed and burned into his mind as he set the car racing toward the hospital. The woman who\u0027d identified herself as Detective\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlberta said Phoebe was being released, he reminded himself. She couldn\u0027t be that badly hurt if they were releasing her from the hospital. Then again, the detective had been very brief. Coplike, Duncan thought in annoyance as he was forced to brake for a red light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t said how; she hadn\u0027t said how bad. And when was this fucking light going to turn green?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she\u0027d been shot. Jesus, Jesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peeled out when the light changed. He threaded his way through traffic, then chewed his way through more. Years of hacking had taught him how to get from point to point fast-or how to get there round about and pad the fare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung into the parking lot, cursing bitterly as he searched for a space. By the time he found one and was running for the ER doors, he\u0027d worked himself up into a frantic mix of nerves and temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d have run right by her if not for the hair. The beacon of red caught his eye, had him stopping, spinning back around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat with the other wounded and the sick in the waiting area. She wore pale blue scrubs. Her arm was in a sling, and her face-her fascinating face-was bruised and battered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jesus, Phoebe.\" He crouched down in front of her, took her hand in both of his. \"How bad are you hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ambulatory.\" She nearly managed to smile. \"Not so bad. You just popped into my head as someone to call. I shouldn\u0027t have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be stupid. What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan... Since I did call, and you did come, I need to go somewhere for a couple hours, so I can fall apart and put myself back together again before I go home. Can you just take me somewhere quiet for a couple of hours? Big favor, I know, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I can. Are you sure you can walk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" When she started to rise, he slid an arm around her waist, drew her up with the care of a man lifting a fragile work of art. \"Lean on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already did, calling you out here.\" And God, it was a relief to put a little weight on someone else. \"I didn\u0027t even think you might be busy with something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? Idle rich.\" He dug out his sunglasses as she winced and turned her face away from the glare. \"Put these on. That\u0027s a hell of a shiner you got coming up. What\u0027s the other guy look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time she couldn\u0027t manage the smile. \"I wish I knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could wait, he told himself. The questions could wait until he got her inside, got her settled. Got her tea or something. He helped her into the car, hooked her seat belt himself. \"Lets put you back a little.\" He eased the seat back. \"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good. It\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they give you anything for the pain?\" he asked when he got behind the wheel, and she tapped the purse Liz had brought to the hospital with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good drugs. Got some in me right now. I\u0027m just going to close my eyes if you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead. Try to relax, rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t sleep. He could see her hand fist. It might relax for a moment or two, but then it would fist again as if she was determined to hold something tight inside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBandages bound her wrists, and baffled him. If she\u0027d been in an accident, why hadn\u0027t she contacted her family? And what sort of accident injured both wrists, bruised up the face and caused enough injury otherwise to have a woman walk as though her bones were brittle glass?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it hadn\u0027t been an accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs other options began to circle in his mind, he shut them down. No point in speculating, not when speculation-where were her clothes?sent him into a minefield of possibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her silence. He\u0027d hauled enough passengers in his time to know what people wanted. Chat, debate, information, quiet. Phoebe wanted silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe barely moved but for that restless hand-into-fist over that span of bridge from mainland to island, as he passed the marshes and creeks and drove through the green tunnels of arching trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly when he slowed for the last turn, eased to a stop, did she stir and open her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d gone for grand with the house, leaning on traditional elegance and adding bits of quirk with the widow\u0027s walk that topped it like a crown. Oaks draped with moss fanned around it, strong accents for the soft blue with its delicate white trim. Gardens-azaleas just ready to pop and burst-flowed out and about in a casual way that turned the grand into charming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePots and baskets of mixed flowers decked veranda and terrace along with gliders and generous chairs that invited visitors to sit awhile, relax, have a cool drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s growing on me.\" He got out, came around to her. \"Let me give you a hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" She leaned into him. \"Really. Thank you, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\" He led her to the steps, up to the veranda to the door with its Celtic knot in stained glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you lived here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess about five years now. Mostly. I figured I\u0027d sell it, b u\u0027t... long story.\" He gave her a quick smile as he unlocked and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolden light basked over rich colors, a wealth of space sweetened by curves from the elegant staircase, the wide archways. She moved beside him, stiffly, across the foyer into the parlor. There the atrium doors opened to a terrace, and beyond that more gardens danced, centered by an arbor where wisteria climbed and twined in a riot of beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA piano angled to face the front windows, while chairs and divans in soft grays to offset the strong burgundy of the walls sat in groups. There was art on the walls, and she had an impression of marsh and river, Georgia dreamscapes along with a mix of antiques and the odd touch of a fat ceramic pig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he would have led her to a seat, she stepped away, crossed to the glass doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like your gardens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too. I got into that kind of thing when I moved out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I imagine so. It seems a lot of house for one man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. That\u0027s why I figured to sell it. But I actually use most of the place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you...\" She rested her forehead against the glass, closed her eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry. We\u0027re coming to the falling-apart portion of the program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right.\" He laid a hand on her back and, feeling her shake, knew they\u0027d hit the eye of the storm. \"You go right ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gathered her in when she turned to him, gathered her up when she began to sob. He carried her to the divan, then sat with her cradled in his arms. And he held her there while the storm raged through. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-7.html","bookId":2412,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:45 AM"}
