TO THE RESCUE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Herbert and his companion drew near the forest cabin, which had been the home of the former, without a suspicion that George Melville was in such dire peril. The boy was, indeed, thinking of him, but it was rather of the satisfaction his employer would feel at his good fortune. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Somehow I feel in a great hurry to get there, Jack,” said Herbert. “I shall enjoy telling Mr. Melville of my good luck.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He\u0027s a fine chap, that Melville,” said Jack Holden, meaning no disrespect by this unceremonious fashion of speech.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That he is! He\u0027s the best friend I ever had, Jack,” returned Herbert, warmly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s a pity he\u0027s ailing.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, he\u0027s much stronger than he was when he came out here. All the unfavorable symptoms have disappeared.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Maybe he\u0027ll outgrow it. I had an uncle that was given up to die of consumption, when he was about Melville\u0027s age, and he died only last year at the age of seventy-five.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That must have been slow consumption, Jack,” said Herbert, smiling. “If Mr. Melville can live as long as that, I think neither he nor his friends will have reason to complain.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is he so rich, lad?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t know how rich, but I know he has plenty of money. How much power a rich man has,” said Herbert, musingly. “Now, Mr. Melville has changed my whole life for me. When I first met him I was working for three dollars a week. Now I am worth twelve thousand dollars!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert repeated this with a beaming face. The good news had not lost the freshness of novelty. There was so much that he could do now that he was comparatively rich. To do Herbert justice, it was not of himself principally that he thought. It was sweet to reflect that he could bring peace, and joy, and independence to his mother. After all, it is the happiness we confer that brings us the truest enjoyment. The selfish man who eats and drinks and lodges like a prince, but is unwilling to share his abundance with others, knows not what he loses. Even boys and girls may try the experiment for themselves, for one does not need to be rich to give pleasure to others.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Come, Jack, let us ride faster; I am in a hurry,” said Herbert, when they were perhaps a quarter of a mile distant from the cabin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They emerged from the forest, and could now see the cottage and its surroundings. They saw something that almost paralyzed them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n George Melville, with a rope round his neck, stood beneath a tree. Col. Warner was up in the tree swinging the rope over a branch, while Brown, big, burly and brutal, pinioned the helpless young man in his strong arms.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good heavens! Do you see that?” exclaimed Herbert. “It is the road agents. Quick, or we shall be too late!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jack had seen. He had not only seen, but he had already acted. Quick as thought he raised his weapon, and covered Brown. There was a sharp report, and the burly ruffian fell, his heart pierced by the unerring bullet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert dashed forward, and, seizing the rope, released his friend.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank Heaven, Herbert! You have saved my life!” murmured Melville, in tones of heartfelt gratitude.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There\u0027s another of them!” exclaimed Jack Holden, looking up into the tree, and he raised his gun once more.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t shoot!” exclaimed the man, whom we know best as Col. Warner; “I\u0027ll come down.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So he did, but not in the manner he expected. In his flurry, for he was not a brave man, outlaw though he was, he lost his hold and fell at the feet of Holden.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What shall we do with him, Mr. Melville?” asked Jack. “He deserves to die.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t kill him! Bind him, and give him up to the authorities.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hate to let him off so easy,” said Jack, but he did as Melville wished. But the colonel had a short reprieve. On his way to jail, a bullet from some unknown assailant pierced his temple, and Jerry Lane, the notorious road agent, died, as he had lived, by violence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2962/81541.html","bookId":427,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:04:17 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:04:17 AM"}
