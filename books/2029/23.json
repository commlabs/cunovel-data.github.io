{"id":108443,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\u003cp\u003eJeb put his hands behind his head and looked up at the dark ceiling, his face thoughtful. His chatty mood had not passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve wondered a lot what it\u0027s like-getting caught, you know. Saw it happen more than once, come close a few times myself. What would it be like, I wondered. Would it hurt, having something put in your head? I\u0027ve seen it done, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened in surprise, but he wasn\u0027t looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems like you all use some kind of anesthetic, but that\u0027s just a guess. Nobody was screaming in agony or anything, though, so it couldn\u0027t be too torturous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrinkled my nose. Torture. No, that was the humans\u0027 specialty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those stories you were telling the kid were real interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened and he laughed lightly. \"Yeah, I was listening. Eavesdropping, I\u0027ll admit it. I\u0027m not sorry-it was great stuff, and you won\u0027t talk to me the way you do with Jamie. I really got a kick out of those bats and the plants and spiders. Gives a man lots to think about. Always liked to read crazy, out-there stuff, science fiction and whatnot. Ate that stuff up. And the kid\u0027s like me-he\u0027s read all the books I\u0027ve got, two, three times apiece. Must be a treat for him to get some new stories. Sure is for me. You\u0027re a good storyteller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my eyes down, but I felt myself softening, losing my guard a bit. Like anyone inside these emotional bodies, I was a sucker for flattery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone here thinks you hunted us out to turn us over to the Seekers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word sent a shock jolting through me. My jaw stiffened and my teeth cut my tongue. I tasted blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What other reason could there be?\" he went on, oblivious to my reaction or ignoring it. \"But they\u0027re just trapped in fixed notions, I think. I\u0027m the only one with questions... I mean, what kind of a plan was that, to wander off into the desert without any way to get back?\" He chuckled. \"Wandering-guess that\u0027s your specialty, eh, Wanda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned toward me and nudged me with one elbow. Wide with uncertainty, my eyes flickered to the floor, to his face, and back to the floor. He laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That trek was just a few steps shy of a successful suicide, in my opinion. Definitely not a Seeker\u0027s MO, if you know what I mean. I\u0027ve tried to reason it out. Use logic, right? So, if you didn\u0027t have backup, which I\u0027ve seen no sign of, and you had no way to get back, then you must\u0027ve had a different goal. You haven\u0027t been real talkative since you got here, \u0027cept with the kid just now, but I\u0027ve listened to what you have said. Kind of seems to me like the reason you almost died out there was \u0027cause you were hell-bent on finding that kid and Jared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only why would you care?\" Jeb asked, expecting no answer, just musing. \"So, this is how I see it: either you\u0027re a really good actress-like a super-Seeker, some new breed, sneakier than the first-with some kind of a plan I can\u0027t figure out, or you\u0027re not acting. The first seems like a pretty complicated explanation for your behavior, then and now, and I don\u0027t buy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you\u0027re not acting...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spent a lot of time watching your kind. I was always waiting for them to change, you know, when they didn\u0027t have to act like us anymore, because there was no one to act for. I kept on watching and waiting, but they just kept on actin\u0027 like humans. Staying with their bodies\u0027 families, going out for picnics in good weather, plantin\u0027 flowers and paintin\u0027 pictures and all the rest of it. I\u0027ve been wondering if you all aren\u0027t turning sort of human. If we don\u0027t have some real influence, in the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, giving me a chance to respond. I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saw something a few years ago that stuck with me. Old man and woman, well, the bodies of an old man and an old woman. Been together so long that the skin on their fingers grew in ridges around their wedding rings. They were holding hands, and he kissed her on her cheek, and she blushed under all those wrinkles. Occurred to me that you have all the same feelings we have, because you\u0027re really us, not just hands in a puppet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I whispered. \"We have all the same feelings. Human feelings. Hope, and pain, and love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, if you aren\u0027t acting... well, then I\u0027d swear to it that you loved them both. You do. Wanda, not just Mel\u0027s body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my head down on my arms. The gesture was tantamount to an admission, but I didn\u0027t care. I couldn\u0027t hold it up anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s you. But I wonder about my niece, too. What it was like for her, what it would be like for me. When they put somebody inside your head, are you just... gone? Erased? Like being dead? Or is it like being asleep? Are you aware of the outside control? Is it aware of you? Are you trapped there, screaming inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat very still, trying to keep my face smooth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plainly, your memories and behaviors, all that is left behind. But your consciousness... Seems like some people wouldn\u0027t go down without a fight. Hell, I know I would try to stay-never been one to take no for an answer, anyone will tell you that. I\u0027m a fighter. All of us who are left are fighters. And, you know, I woulda pegged Mel for a fighter, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t move his eyes from the ceiling, but I looked at the floor-stared at it, memorizing the patterns in the purple gray dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027ve wondered about that a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel his eyes on me now, though my head was still down. I didn\u0027t move, except to breathe slowly in and out. It took a great deal of effort to keep that slow rhythm smooth. I had to swallow; the blood was still flowing in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did we ever think he was crazy? Mel wondered. He sees everything. He\u0027s a genius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, maybe this means we don\u0027t have to keep quiet anymore. He knows. She was hopeful. She\u0027d been very quiet lately, absent almost half the time. It wasn\u0027t as easy for her to concentrate when she was relatively happy. She\u0027d won her big fight. She\u0027d gotten us here. Her secrets were no longer in jeopardy; Jared and Jamie could never be betrayed by her memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the fight taken out of her, it was harder for her to find the will to speak, even to me. I could see how the idea of discovery-of having the other humans recognize her existence-invigorated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb knows, yes. Does that really change anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about the way the other humans looked at Jeb. Right. She sighed. But I think Jamie... well, he doesn\u0027t know or guess, but I think he feels the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might be right. I guess we\u0027ll see if that does him or us any good, in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb could only manage to keep quiet for a few seconds, and then he was off again, interrupting us. \"Pretty interesting stuff. Not as much bang! bang! as the movies I used to like. But still pretty interesting. I\u0027d like to hear more about those spider thingies. I\u0027m real curious... real curious, for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and raised my head. \"What do you want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at me warmly, his eyes crinkling into half moons. \"Three brains, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twelve-one at each juncture of the leg and the body. We didn\u0027t have lids, just a lot of fibers-like steel wool eyelashes-to protect them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, his eyes bright. \"Were they furry, like tarantulas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Sort of... armored-scaled, like a reptile or a fish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slouched against the wall, settling myself in for a long conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb didn\u0027t disappoint on that count. I lost track of how many questions he asked me. He wanted details-the Spiders\u0027 looks, their behaviors, and how they\u0027d handled Earth. He didn\u0027t flinch away from the invasion details; on the contrary, he almost seemed to enjoy that part more than the rest. His questions came fast on the heels of my answers, and his grins were frequent. When he was satisfied about the Spiders, hours later, he wanted to know more about the Flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t half explain that one,\" he reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I told him about that most beautiful and placid of planets. Almost every time I stopped to breathe, he interrupted me with a new question. He liked to guess the answers before I could speak and didn\u0027t seem to mind getting them wrong in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So did ya eat flies, like a Venus flytrap? I\u0027ll bet you did-or maybe something bigger, like a bird-like a pterodactyl!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we used sunlight for food, like most plants here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s not as much fun as my idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I found myself laughing with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were just moving on to the Dragons when Jamie showed up with dinner for three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Wanderer,\" he said, a little embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Jamie,\" I answered, a little shy, not sure if he would regret the closeness we\u0027d shared. I was, after all, the bad guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he sat down right next to me, between me and Jeb, crossing his legs and setting the food tray in the middle of our little conclave. I was starving, and parched from all the talking. I took a bowl of soup and downed it in a few gulps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoulda known you were just being polite in the mess hall today. Gotta speak up when you\u0027re hungry, Wanda. I\u0027m no mind reader.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t agree with that last part, but I was too busy chewing a mouthful of bread to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda?\" Jamie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, letting him know that I didn\u0027t mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kinda suits her, doncha think?\" Jeb was so proud of himself, I was surprised he didn\u0027t pat himself on the back, just for effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kinda, I guess,\" Jamie said. \"Were you guys talking about dragons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Jeb told him enthusiastically, \"but not the lizardy kind. They\u0027re all made up of jelly. They can fly, though... sort of. The air\u0027s thicker, sort of jelly, too. So it\u0027s almost like swimming. And they can breathe acid-that\u0027s about as good as fire, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let Jeb fill Jamie in on the details while I ate more than my share of food and drained a water bottle. When my mouth was free, Jeb started in with the questions again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, this acid...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie didn\u0027t ask questions the way Jeb did, and I was more careful about what I said with him there. However, this time Jeb never asked anything that might lead to a touchy subject, whether by coincidence or design, so my caution wasn\u0027t necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light slowly faded until the hallway was black. Then it was silver, a tiny, dim reflection from the moon that was just enough, as my eyes adjusted, to see the man and the boy beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie edged closer to me as the night wore on. I didn\u0027t realize that I was combing my fingers through his hair as I talked until I noticed Jeb staring at my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded my arms across my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Jeb yawned a huge yawn that had me and Jamie doing the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell a good story, Wanda,\" Jeb said when we were all done stretching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what I did... before. I was a teacher, at the university in San Diego. I taught history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A teacher!\" Jeb repeated, excited. \"Well, ain\u0027t that amazin\u0027? There\u0027s something we could use around here. Mag\u0027s girl Sharon does the teaching for the three kids, but there\u0027s a lot she can\u0027t help with. She\u0027s most comfortable with math and the like. History, now -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only taught our history,\" I interrupted. Waiting for him to take a breath wasn\u0027t going to work, it seemed. \"I wouldn\u0027t be much help as a teacher here. I don\u0027t have any training.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your history is better than nothing. Things we human folks ought to know, seeing as we live in a more populated universe than we were aware of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I wasn\u0027t a real teacher,\" I told him, desperate. Did he honestly think anyone wanted to hear my voice, let alone listen to my stories? \"I was sort of an honorary professor, almost a guest lecturer. They only wanted me because... well, because of the story that goes along with my name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the next one I was going to ask for,\" Jeb said complacently. \"We can talk about your teaching experience later. Now-why did they call you Wanderer? I\u0027ve heard a bunch of odd ones, Dry Water, Fingers in the Sky, Falling Upward-all mixed in, of course, with the Pams and the Jims. I tell you, it\u0027s the kind of thing that can drive a man crazy with curiosity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited till I was sure he was done to begin. \"Well, the way it usually works is that a soul will try out a planet or two-two\u0027s the average-and then they\u0027ll settle in their favorite place. They just move to new hosts in the same species on the same planet when their body gets close to death. It\u0027s very disorienting moving from one kind of body to the next. Most souls really hate that. Some never move from the planet they are born on. Occasionally, someone has a hard time finding a good fit. They may try three planets. I met a soul once who\u0027d been to five before he\u0027d settled with the Bats. I liked it there-I suppose that\u0027s the closest I\u0027ve ever come to choosing a planet. If it hadn\u0027t been for the blindness...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many planets have you lived on?\" Jamie asked in a hushed voice. Somehow, while I\u0027d been talking, his hand had found its way into mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my ninth,\" I told him, squeezing his fingers gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, nine!\" he breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why they wanted me to teach. Anybody can tell them our statistics, but I have personal experience from most of the planets we\u0027ve... taken.\" I hesitated at that word, but it didn\u0027t seem to bother Jamie. \"There are only three I\u0027ve never been to-well, now four. They just opened a new world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expected Jeb to jump in with questions about the new world, or the ones I\u0027d skipped, but he just played absently with the ends of his beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you never stay anywhere?\" Jamie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never found a place I liked enough to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Earth? Do you think you\u0027ll stay here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to smile at his child\u0027s confidence-as if I were going to get the chance to ever move on to another host. As if I were going to get the chance to live out even another month in the one I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earth is... very interesting,\" I murmured. \"It\u0027s harder than any place I\u0027ve been before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harder than the place with the frozen air and the claw beasts?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In its own way, yes.\" How could I explain that the Mists Planet only came at you from the outside-it was much more difficult to be attacked from within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttacked, Melanie scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yawned. I wasn\u0027t actually thinking of you, I told her. I was thinking of these unstable emotions, always betraying me. But you did attack me. Pushing your memories on me that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI learned my lesson, she assured me dryly. I could feel how intensely aware she was of the hand in mine. There was an emotion slowly building in her that I didn\u0027t recognize. Something on the edge of anger, with a hint of desire and a portion of despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJealousy, she enlightened me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb yawned again. \"I\u0027m being downright rude, I guess. You must be bushed-walking all over today and then me keepin\u0027 you up half the night talking. Ought to be a better host. C\u0027mon, Jamie, let\u0027s go and let Wanda get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was exhausted. It felt as if it had been a very long day, and, from Jeb\u0027s words, perhaps that wasn\u0027t in my imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Uncle Jeb.\" Jamie jumped lightly to his feet and then offered his hand to the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, kid.\" Jeb groaned as he got up. \"And thanks to you, too,\" he added in my direction. \"Most interesting conversation I\u0027ve had in... well, probably forever. Rest your voice up, Wanda, because my curiosity is a powerful thing. Ah, there he is! \u0027Bout time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then did I hear the sound of approaching footsteps. Automatically, I shrank against the wall and scooted farther back into the cave-room, and then felt more exposed because the moonlight was brighter inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised that this was the first person to turn in for the night; the corridor appeared to house many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, Jeb. I got to talking with Sharon, and then I sort of dozed off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was impossible not to recognize this easy, gentle voice. My stomach rolled, unstable, and I wished it were empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t even notice, Doc,\" Jeb said. \"We were having the time of our lives here. Someday you\u0027ll have to get her to tell you some of her stories-great stuff. Not tonight, though. She\u0027s got to be pretty worn out, I\u0027d bet. We\u0027ll see you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor was spreading a mat out in front of the cave entrance, just as Jared had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep an eye on this,\" Jeb said, laying the gun beside the mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay, Wanda?\" Jamie asked. \"You\u0027re shaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t realized it, but my whole body was quivering. I didn\u0027t answer him-my throat felt swollen shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, now,\" Jeb said in a soothing voice. \"I asked Doc if he minded taking a shift. You don\u0027t need to worry about anything. Doc\u0027s an honorable man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor smiled a sleepy smile. \"I\u0027m not going to hurt you... Wanda, is it? I promise. I\u0027ll just keep watch while you sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip, and the quivering didn\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb seemed to think everything was settled, though. \"Night, Wanda. Night, Doc,\" he said as he started back down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie hesitated, looking at me with a worried expression. \"Doc\u0027s okay,\" he promised in a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon, boy, it\u0027s late!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie hurried off after Jeb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the doctor when they were gone, waiting for some change. Doc\u0027s relaxed expression didn\u0027t waver, though, and he didn\u0027t touch the gun. He stretched his long frame out on the mat, his calves and feet hanging off the end. Lying down, he looked much smaller, he was so rail thin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night,\" he murmured drowsily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I didn\u0027t answer. I watched him in the dull moonlight, timing the rise and fall of his chest by the sound of the pulse thudding in my ears. His breathing slowed and got deeper, and then he began to quietly snore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could have been an act, but even if it was, there wasn\u0027t much I could do about it. Silently, I crept deeper into the room, till I felt the edge of the mattress against my back. I\u0027d promised myself that I would not disturb this place, but it probably wouldn\u0027t hurt anything if I just curled up on the foot of the bed. The floor was rough and so hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the doctor\u0027s soft snoring was comforting; even if it was put on to calm me, at least I knew exactly where he was in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLive or die, I figured I might as well go ahead and sleep. I was dog tired, as Melanie would say. I let my eyes close. The mattress was softer than anything I\u0027d touched since coming here. I relaxed, sinking in...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a low shuffling sound-it was inside the room with me. My eyes popped open, and I could see a shadow between the moonlit ceiling and me. Outside, the doctor\u0027s snores continued uninterrupted. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-23.html","bookId":2029,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM"}
