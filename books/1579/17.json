My knees feel as if a jackhammer has done a number on them, and my heads spins crazily from the spiraled descent. No one else is fatigued; if anything, the energy level has risen as anticipation draws to a climax. There\u0027s a lot of chatter, a lot of teeth grinding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are there enough posts for all of us?” Ashley June asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone is jostling for position in front of the closed double doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t you worry, any of you,” Fril y Dress answers. “There are ten posts inside. Only seven of you. The posts are equidistant from the center, none has an advantage over another. A food item is placed near each post so all of you wil get a chance to see the heper up close and personal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite her words, they\u0027re still pushing. I separate myself inconspicuously to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are we waiting for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just a bit longer. Paperwork needs to be pro cessed upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027l let us know when we\u0027re good to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFril y Dress shakes her head. “You\u0027l see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it really as great as she put it?” Phys Ed asks his escort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better than advertised. So much better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can smel it!” Beefy says. “Stronger than ever!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense,” chides Fril y Dress. “The heper\u0027s still in its chambers.” But she seems uncertain, her nostrils moistening and fl aring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s the same smel ! We\u0027ve been smel ing this heper all this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take two steps back, slowly moving away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Getting stronger by the second.” More drool and shivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play along. But those doors better open soon, because this is a smal enclave we wait in, and in such tight, unventilated quarters, my odor is amplifi ed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaunt Man\u0027s head fl icks violently toward me. He\u0027s not just hissing; he\u0027s slobbering in his saliva. Foolishly, I meet his eyes. He is staring at me with a dawning realization, his eyes blinking, blinking, blinking with a new— At that very moment, the double doors swing open, an expulsion of steam and smoke enveloping us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouts of excitement as we sweep into the room. The expanse, with its high arching ceiling (rounded and bal ooned like an indoor sports stadium) and wide spread of the dusty ground beneath, catches me by surprise. The heper\u0027s door is on the ground, in the very center of the arena, shaped and sized like a manhole. Ten wooden posts are spaced evenly around it. We disperse quickly, each of us running like kids choosing horses on a carousel. As Fril y Dress said, there\u0027s more than enough for all of us, but that doesn\u0027t stop general bedlam from ensuing. It\u0027s the morsels. Hunters are fi ghting over posts positioned before morsels deemed most attractive to the heper. Abs and Ashley June are having a feline fi ght over a post in front of a bunch of bananas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was here fi rst,” snarls Ashley June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wel , I\u0027m already strapped in,” Abs hisses back. She snaps shut a latch in the strap around her ankles. “There.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan\u0027t get out now even if I wanted to. And I don\u0027t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross from me, Crimson Lips and Phys Ed are bickering over a post in front of some ears of corn. My attention shifts over to Gaunt Man, whose eyes are glowing at me like a bat\u0027s. I can\u0027t read his expression, but I sense confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s still trying to fi gure me out, questioning if he really did smel heper odor coming off me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore him, busy myself with the straps. There are four metal ic cuffs that lock around our wrists and ankles. Each cuff is tethered to the post by thick leather straps. Even strapped in, we have quite a lot of room to range: about a body length from the post. As long as the heper doesn\u0027t stray past the perimeter delineated by the morsels, it\u0027l be safely out of our reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn escort walks in, stoic faced, and hands each of us a pair of shades. “Lights will be turned up in a moment,” he murmurs, “so the heper can see.” He checks each of our straps, spending the most time on Gaunt Man, whose straps are way too loose. Gaunt Man objects, raising his arm; as he does so, his shirt becomes untucked and he quickly reaches down to tuck it back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not before I see it. A dul glint coming from his belt, curved and long like a dagger\u0027s blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn uneasy feeling touches the back of my neck. When the escort checks on my straps, it\u0027s on the tip of my tongue to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the escort walks off before I can speak. He stops at the very center of the arena and says, “Welcome to the Introduction, ladies and gentlemen.” Before walking out, he stamps his boot heavily on the circular door three times, a deep boom sounding. The lights inside the arena turn brighter. We throw on our shades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mechanical whirring sounds from the circular door in the ground, fol owed by a series of robotic beeps. The door opens, just a crack. And then, just as swiftly, it drops shut, coughing up a puff of dust. Heads cock to the side. Then the door opens not a second later, a little wider this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough to see the outline of a head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twin dots of eyes peering out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall the hunters explode toward the heper. Almost in unison, bodies snap against the restraints, fl ip in the air, and fal to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door, again, fal s shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a blink, everyone is upright and lurching against the restraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pul against my mine, frothing at the mouth as I swing my head wildly to and fro. My shades fl y off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink at the sudden brightness of the arena, now awash in vivid, keen colors. I see the hunters with a clarity that seems to enliven them. They are animals, bestial and overtaken with heper lust. Phys Ed and Crimson Lips have given to scratching their necks, leaving long white etches where their nails rake into skin. Their mouths gape wide, then snap shut like a steel trap, the harsh, rocky sound of teeth gnashing against teeth fi l ing the fetid air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trapdoor opens again; a ful y extended arm holds up the door. A head emerges from underneath, peering around like a peri-scope. Apparently assured, it steps out, leaving the door opened, all the better for a quick escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, all is quiet. The sloshing of saliva ceases; the crack of necks and knuckles and spines stop. We study the heper with an almost innocent curiosity, as if we don\u0027t mean to pil age its intestines and suck its blood and gorge it at the drop of a hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the same heper as the one on TV, frail and wispy. It blinks, surveys the piles of morsels distributed around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Ashley June lets loose a horrifi c scream of desire into the air. Within seconds, we\u0027re all yowling and mewling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heper is unmoved by the cacophony as it walks to the fi rst pile of food. Two loaves of bread, placed in front of Crimson Lips\u0027 post. The heper picks up a loaf, rams it into its mouth, and tears off a mouthful. It moves effi ciently, businesslike, as it grabs the other loaf and tosses it into the open door without so much as a glance at the hissing Crimson Lips. It\u0027s done this before. It shuffl es over to the next pile, bottles of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt twists open a cap, hoists the bottle upside down, and guzzles down water. Doesn\u0027t linger. Cradling the remaining bottles in the crook of its arm, it carries them over to the open door and drops them in. Then it is up and moving to another pile, the candy. all the while, even with snarls and screams about it, the heper never looks up. It is cool y minding its own business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heper moves past a stack of notebooks in front of Gaunt Man and toward the candy. My eyes catch a glimmer of stale light from Gaunt Man\u0027s waist. The dagger; Gaunt Man is taking it out now. White veins in his bony hand bulge out like sickly squirming worms as he grips the dagger and starts fi ling away at the leather strap. He knows he has to move fast: the heper isn\u0027t exactly laying out a picnic mat to dine in our midst. It\u0027s simply going to throw all the food and drinks and notebooks into its chamber and then dis-THE HUNT 101 appear. It\u0027l be gone in less than a minute. A rage fi l s the arena, an explosion of frustration at the feeling of being cheated. Ashley June gives another bloodcurdling scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strains against the straps, a desperation attending her desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaunt Man attacks the straps with extra fervor. He pul s taut the strap tethered to his left wrist while his right arm pistons back and forth, sawing away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, the strap fal s in two. He stares stupidly at it dangling in half. Then it hits him; I see his body go erect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFantasy is now a dusking reality. And he\u0027s hunched over again, fi ling away at the straps tied to his legs, his right arm a blizzard of speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heper has no idea. It is standing over the pile of candy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s unwrapping a candy, sucking on it, oblivious to what\u0027s going on behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaunt Man has sliced through the two leg straps. He switches hands, starts sawing away at the fi nal strap on his right wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heper pauses, lifting its head into the air like a dog catching a scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it bends down and picks up another piece of candy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last strap is giving Gaunt Man some trouble. Perhaps in his excitement he\u0027s not focusing, or perhaps it\u0027s on account of having to use his left arm. But he\u0027s slower, and it\u0027s frustrating him. He lets out a scream of frustration that knifes into my ear drums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heper winces, then spins around. It sees Gaunt Man, the sliced straps dangling from his left arm and ankles, and it understands the situation immediately. In a blink, it spins, dropping the candy, its legs already pumping to the door in the ground. Just fi ve paces to get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that very moment, Gaunt Man slices through the fi nal strap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spins around. He is twenty paces from the trapdoor. The heper is fl ying toward it, now only three paces away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the heper takes another step, it is tackled by Gaunt Man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rol in the dirt, Gaunt Man\u0027s tackle carry ing them ten yards. They separate briefl y: the heper leaps to its feet, lunges for the trapdoor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaunt Man sideswipes it, sends it back down to the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heper scrabbles against the ground like a rabid crab; Gaunt Man leaps atop it. They\u0027re about the same size, but it\u0027s no match. Not even close. Gaunt Man\u0027s fi ngers sink sickeningly into the heper\u0027s back; blood quickly spreads on its shirt. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-17.html","bookId":1579,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM"}
