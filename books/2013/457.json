Come on, let’s go find ‘em!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wait-hold it, sapper-what are-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s the Fourteenth, you thick-skulled halfwit!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey began hurrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Next time I see Cotillion,’ Quick Ben hissed, ‘I’m going to strangle him with his own rope.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix leagues to the north, a bone-white dragon with eyes of lurid red sailed through the morning sky. Wings creaking, muscles bunching, the wind hissing against scales and along bared fangs that were the length of shorts words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning, after all this time, to the city of Letheras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannan Mosag had been warned. The Crippled God had been warned. And yet neither had heeded Silchas Ruin. No, instead, they had conspired with Sukul Ankhadu and Sheltatha Lore, and possibly with Menandore herself. To get in his way, to oppose him and what he had needed to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than this, the Letherii Empire had been hunting them for an inordinate amount of time, and out of forbearance Silchas Ruin had ignored the affront. For the sake of the Acquitor and the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, he was no longer ignoring anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn empire, a city, a people, a Tiste Edur Ceda and a mad Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brother of Anomander and Andarist, for ever deemed the coldest of the three, the cruellest, Silchas Ruin flew, a white leviathan with murder in its heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite as bone, with eyes red as death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhulad Sengar stumbled away, dragging his sword. Sweat streamed from him, his hair hanging ragged and dripping. He had struck again and again, not once piercing the defensive net of his challenger’s stone sword. Six paces between them now, chewed-up sand soaked and clumped with nothing but spatters from the glistening oil that made the coins gleam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilent as all the other witnesses, Samar Dev watched on, wondering how all this would end, wondering how it could end. As long as Karsa refused to counter-attack…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the Toblakai raised his sword and walked forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStraight for the Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs easy as that, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho rose with a sudden smile and lifted his weapon into a guard position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flint sword lashed out, an awkward cut, yet swung with such strength that Rhulad’s block with his own weapon knocked one of his hands loose from the grip, and the iron blade nailed outward, and then, all at once, that cursed sword seemed to acquire a will of its own, the point thrusting into a lunge that dragged the Emperor forward with a scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the blade sank into Karsa’s left thigh, through skin, muscle, narrowly missing the bone, then punching out the back side. The Toblakai pivoted round, even as with appalling fluidity he brought his sword in a downward cut that sliced entirely through Rhulad’s shoulder above the sword-arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the arm, its hand still gripping the weapon now bound-trapped in Karsa’s leg-parted from Rhulad’s body, the Toblakai back-swung the flat of his blade into Rhulad’s face, sending him sprawling onto the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Samar Dev found that she held the knife, the blade bared, and as Karsa turned to face her, she was already slicing deep across her palm, hissing the ancient words of release-letting loose the imprisoned spirits, the desert godlings and all those who were bound to the old knife-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpirits and ghosts of the slain poured forth, freed by the power in her blood, streaming down over the rows of benches, down onto the floor of the arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the terrible sounds of Rhulad Sengar’s shrieking, those spirits rushed straight for Karsa, swept round, engulfed him-swirling chaos-a blinding moment as of fires unleashed-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– and Karsa Orlong, the Emperor’s sword and the arm still holding it, vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying alone on the sands of the arena, Rhulad Sengar spilled crimson from the stump of his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no-one moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo dwell within an iron blade had proved, for the ghost of Ceda Kuru Qan, a most interesting experience. After an immeasurable time of exploration, sensing all the other entities trapped within, he had worked out a means of escaping whenever he wished. But curiosity had held him, a growing suspicion that all dwelt in this dark place for some hidden purpose. And they were waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnticipation, even eagerness. And, indeed, far more bloodlust than Kuru Qan could abide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had considered a campaign of domination, of defeating all the other spirits, and binding them to his will. But a leader, he well understood, could not be ignorant, and to compel the revelation of the secret was ever a chancy proposition. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-457.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
