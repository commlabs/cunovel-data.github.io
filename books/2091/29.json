There wasn\u0027t a crescent moon tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I did want to scout the area and figure out the best location for the cage when the time was right. I should be safe in the sunshine, at least from a loup-garou. If there were rabid wild dogs, coyotes, or even a real wolf, I might be in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept I didn\u0027t believe that. Not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loaded the tranquilizer gun before I took a walk. I also had the pistol Adam had given me, but the thing made me nervous. What if I shot someone accidentally? Heck, what if I shot them on purpose?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs jumpy as I was, that could easily happen. There\u0027d been enough death in the Honey Island Swamp. I preferred not to cause more. The tranquilizer gun would only put someone to sleep for a few hours instead of permanently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so close to proving what Simon had always known. Werewolves existed right under our very noses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow they managed to do so and not be found was a mystery. One I wanted to unravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood now what had obsessed my husband. My guilt at not supporting him while he was alive returned, but I refused to let depression take hold. I could atone for my lack of foresight if I proved his theory. If I found a loup-garou and presented the beast to the world, Simon\u0027s reputation would be saved. No one would ever dare speak his name and laugh again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t realized in what direction I was walking until I reached the top of a small rise and saw Adam\u0027s shack in the narrow valley below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess I don\u0027t need the map anymore,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not going in there. I was not talking to him again; I was definitely not going to get close enough for him to seduce me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a derisive sound. \"As if.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t going to jump into bed with a man who didn\u0027t mink I was fit to share airspace with his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere. I felt better now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why didn\u0027t I leave? I stood on the ridge and stared at the shack, watching a shadow moving beyond the window. I remembered what we\u0027d shared there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the yard. And there. Not to mention several other places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sigh was pathetic. I stiffened my spine and forced myself to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t as if I\u0027d loved him. I\u0027d wanted him. I\u0027d had him. We were done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why did I feel as if I\u0027d buried my best friend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause you did. You just forgot about him while you were boning a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice,\" I murmured. \"With a conscience like that, who needs enemies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, my conscience was right. I\u0027d let myself be distracted by bulging biceps, rippling abs, and an excellent dick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich just might be an oxymoron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I was having this conversation with myself I\u0027d kept walking and managed to get all turned around. The swamp was tricky; a section could appear similar or very different depending on the time of day, the direction of the sun, the slant of the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly slipped into a tributary that was far too wide to cross without an airboat, even without the alligators bobbing in the center. One splashed at the edge of the water and slunk onto the bank. I patted my pocket, relieved to find the gris-gris still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling the bag free, I rolled it in my hand, as much for courage as magic. My heart rate returned to normal when the gator did an about-face and slid noiselessly into the water. That was so weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBacktracking to a familiar path, I glanced at the sky, then took off down the trail double time. The sun was fading fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a rustle, then the thud of pursuit - something that possessed more feet than two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would not glance over my shoulder. How many times has the idiot heroine in a horror movie tried to catch a glimpse of what\u0027s chasing her? Then she trips over her feet, falls to her knees, and we\u0027ve got snarling and screaming and blood. Basically, she\u0027s too stupid to live, so she\u0027s dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot me. I heard the pitter-patter of multiple feet, and I ran. I\u0027d thought I was within shouting distance of the mansion, not that there was anyone to shout to, but I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes later I still hadn\u0027t burst out of the tall grass and into the overgrown yard. I wished like hell I hadn\u0027t run. I\u0027d have been better off facing the predator than making myself the prey. Although I had a feeling I\u0027d been the prey since that fire iris had made an appearance on my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA body bit me between the shoulder blades and I fell. Hard. My hands took the brunt of the fall, but still my forehead banged into the ground, and I saw stars. Whatever had knocked me down ran right over my back and kept going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefinitely not a person - a little too quadrapedal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my head as the tip of a tail disappeared into the foliage. With a groan I rolled onto my back and stared at the night sky. Three-quarters of the way up, a full moon shone. How could the loup-garou be out now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn\u0027t. Or at least not according to legend. However, according to legend, and Mrs. Favreau, wolves made wolves. Which explained the howls I\u0027d heard in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Charlie, Mrs. Beasly, the other missing persons, and the missing bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere might not be wolves in New Orleans, but if there were werewolves, there were probably a lot of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dragged myself to my feet, sore and scraped but thrilled to be alive. My dart gun had flown into the weeds when I\u0027d fallen, and I bent stiffly to pick it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only person who\u0027d been of any use in this mystery was Marie Favreau. Well, Arianna Beasly had been helpful, too, but she was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I ever got back to the mansion, I\u0027d call Mrs. Favreau and ask if she knew anything else worth knowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued down the path, skittering into a semi-run when the howl of a wolf from the east was answered by another from the west Then a whole chorus began, making the hair on my arms stand up almost as high as that on the back of my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the howls died away, I could have sworn I heard the grass swishing in my direction, from several locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to run, but it was hard. I wanted to be at the mansion, inside, right now. Why hadn\u0027t I stayed there in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter what seemed hours, I caught a glimpse of the Ruelle place between the dripping branches of the cypress trees. I hesitated at the edge of the swamp, concerned any number of beasts could be waiting for me once I left the cover of the greenery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore howls commenced, much farther away, and I stepped into the yard. Nothing attacked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI popped the trunk of the car and retrieved Adam\u0027s pistol; then I went into the house and shut the door, not bothering with the lock, since all the windows were broken anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way I was sleeping here tonight, but first things first. I called information and moments later the phone was picked up in the French Quarter. \"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognized Anne\u0027s voice and considered hanging up, but that would be childish. \"Is Marie there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence came over the line. I didn\u0027t like the sound of that silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diana Malone. I visited the other day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s dead,\" Anne said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers tightened on the phone. \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was old. Heart attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"Didn\u0027t Arianna have a heart attack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This wasn\u0027t the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? How was it different?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother wasn\u0027t attacked. She just... died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t much care for the way people were dropping like flies not long after I talked with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the garden. She likes to sit outside and watch the stars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the moon, too, I\u0027d bet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There weren\u0027t any bite marks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s gone.\" Anne made a disgusted sound. \"Can\u0027t she rest in peace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so. Did you happen to stuff her mouth with wolfsbane and draw a pentagram on her chest? Maybe shoot her with silver, just to be sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started when Anne slammed down the phone hard enough to damage my eardrum. I couldn\u0027t say I blamed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie\u0027s death disturbed me. The old woman\u0027s heart might have given out. Then again, she could have been confronted by a werewolf and gotten a little help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way people were dying around here, they\u0027d be dubbing me Typhoid Diana soon. I was tempted to call Cassandra, make sure she had no plans to stand outside and stare at the moon. Ask if she owned any silver jewelry. Tell her to put some on and save a piece for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I\u0027d just tell her in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to gather my things, but a soft footfall on the porch made me lift the pistol. The door slid open, creaking loudly. I had an instant to think, Wolves can\u0027t open doors, before a figure darted inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure too small to be a man and too human to be a wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-29.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
