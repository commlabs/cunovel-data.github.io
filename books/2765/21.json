No amount of begging my dad to stay home and ditch the algebra/trig test today so I can stay home with Avi worked. Nathan isn\u0027t at the bus stop, so I\u0027m standing alone. On the bus, Jess is eager to grill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So? How was it last night after we texted each other?\" she asks before I even sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uneventful. I went to bed.\" And neglected to do my homework, but I\u0027m hoping to ignore that issue until I\u0027m forced to deal with it. A person can only handle so much at one time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I took a shower, ate breakfast with Avi and my dad, and left for school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess looks disappointed there isn\u0027t more to the story. I am, too. I wish I had more exciting news to tell her, but I\u0027m not about to make anything up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you\u0027re going to be a mom,\" Kyle says from the seat behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know yet,\" I say, playing along so no one realizes how freaked out I am about Mutt\u0027s little escapade yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch, who has been hiding in the back row of the public CTA bus in an obvious attempt to avoid being confronted by a jilted Jessica, says, \"Dude, that dog is an animal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, he is. And yes, he\u0027s mine. \"Where\u0027s Nathan, Amy?\" Roxanne asks. \"How would I know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s your boyfriend, isn\u0027t he? Or are you just going to the Valentine\u0027s Dance with him out of pity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePity? Nathan doesn\u0027t need pity from me. Okay, so he needs a new wardrobe... but not pity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For your information,\" Jess says, turning around, \"Amy has a boyfriend, and he\u0027s in town visiting her. Nathan was just a...a brain fart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, I\u0027m sure Nathan will definitely appreciate being described as a fart. Sometimes Jess gets me in more trouble than I\u0027m already in and has no clue she\u0027s done it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys should come to my place tonight,\" Kyle says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My p\u0027s are out of town. A bunch of us are gonna hang out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica says, \"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you, Amy? You can even pick one of the guys in your harem to bring,\" Kyle says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is Friday, and I am committed to showing Avi a great time while he\u0027s here. It wouldn\u0027t hurt to stop by Kyle\u0027s and hang out. Avi might actually like it. In the dark recesses of my mind, I\u0027m a little excited to show Avi off to Roxanne, who\u0027ll inevitably show her face. She\u0027s always hanging on Kyle and his friends like one of those disgusting neck skin tags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find myself promising I\u0027ll be at the party with Avi. I turn back around and lean in to Jessica. \"Where are you going tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Youth group meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOops. I forgot I was supposed to go with her and Miranda again. \"Are you upset if I don\u0027t go with you guys? I mean, Avi is here and all...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s cool,\" she says. \"We\u0027re supposed to do a scavenger hunt together, but Miranda and I can do it without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Avi would think a scavenger hunt with the teen youth group would be lame. I\u0027m convinced he\u0027ll have a better time at a party where everyone is dancing and hanging out. Besides, I think he\u0027s had enough organized activities in Israel lately; he doesn\u0027t need another one while he\u0027s on vacation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring lunch, Jess is sitting at Miranda\u0027s table and not at our usual spot. Nathan is sitting next to Miranda. They\u0027re all in a deep conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take my tray of the Chef\u0027s Pizza Special and sit next to Jessica. \"What\u0027s so interesting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda glances up and then back down at the paper she was writing on. She mumbles, \"We\u0027re figuring out strategy for tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the youth group thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess looks up. \"Yeah. We\u0027re dividing the city up into monuments, parks, and sports arenas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at Nathan. \"Are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts his arm around Miranda and smiles at her. \"Miranda invited me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe poor girl looks nervous. \"You don\u0027t mind, do you, Amy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you guys seem pretty close and everyone thinks you two have something going on.\" She says it as a statement and a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan has a girlfriend,\" I inform her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Amy has a boyfriend,\" Nathan blurts out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, I don\u0027t get it. If you have a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend, why are you going to the Valentine\u0027s Dance together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my mouth to say something, but nothing comes out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan takes his arm from Miranda\u0027s shoulder. \"Now that is a great question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s the answer?\" Jess asks impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, since Avi will be back in Israel, and Bicky... well, I\u0027m not convinced she\u0027s real but if she\u0027s not a figment of Nathan\u0027s imagination she\u0027s, nonetheless, not in Chicago. So we\u0027re going together...as friends. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan puts his hands up. \"That pretty much sums it up, except for the part about my girlfriend being a figment of my imagination. She\u0027s real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What school does she go to?\" Miranda asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of answering, Nathan gathers his lunch, shoves it into his bag, and stands up. \"I just remembered I forgot to study for my chem exam. I\u0027ll catch you guys after school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure thing,\" Jessica says. \"What\u0027s his issue?\" she asks when he\u0027s out of earshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the door Nathan just bolted out of, I say, \"No clue. But if you guys find out, you gotta tell me. He lives with his aunt and uncle, he doesn\u0027t talk about his past or his parents, and never talks about any brothers or sisters. Something\u0027s off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027s an undercover police officer investigating something illegal at school. Or maybe he\u0027s a reporter doing an expose on private schools.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes. \"Miranda, I think you\u0027ve been watching too much television.\" Nathan is definitely a teenager, as messed up and confused as I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI catch up to that messed up kid at his locker after school. \"Miranda thinks you\u0027re an undercover reporter doing an expose on private schools... or a cop.\" With those glasses and skinny frame you\u0027d think he was Clark Kent. Nah, he\u0027s too skinny and wouldn\u0027t be able to fill out any Superman outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027s your deal? Why are you living out of a suitcase? Why do you bring flowers to someone every week? Why do you say you have a girlfriend but she\u0027s never around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan shoves his books into his backpack. \"Why do you care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slings the backpack around his back and glares at me. \"Well, when you do know maybe then I\u0027ll tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was preparing for conversion class today and read the Bible scenario if a man suspects his wife was not a virgin when they got married The woman, if found guilty, gets stoned to death by the men in her village. If the man is found to be proven wrong he gets fined and flogged(Deuteronomy 22:18). I seriously need to have a talk with Rabbi Glassman about this. Because there are just so many things wrong with this scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take Avi to Kyle\u0027s party in the evening, ready to show my boyfriend off to all my school friends (besides Jessica, Miranda, and Nathan, who are doing the temple youth group scavenger hunt). With a huge smile on my face, I take Avi\u0027s hand and lead him through Kyle\u0027s condo. It\u0027s bigger than my dad\u0027s--Kyle\u0027s dad owns one of the best steak houses in Chicago and likes to show off his wealth with big cars, big condos, and big boats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the kitchen, Kyle passes out cans of beer. \"Dude, you must be Amy\u0027s boyfriend,\" Kyle says with a slurred voice. He\u0027s plastered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi declines the beer and Kyle tosses the can to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not drinking, are you?\" Avi asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be honest, I think beer is gross. \"Nope,\" I say, and toss the can back to Kyle, who mumbles something under his breath about sober people being boring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading Avi to the back of the house where most of the crowd has gathered, we find an unoccupied chair. Avi sits on it and I park myself on his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music is loud in the back room, almost to the point that my ears are pounding to the bass of the song. While everyone else is either drinking or making out or trying to talk above the music, I lean into Avi\u0027s chest while he holds me close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I catch sight of Roxanne arriving, I quickly turn my head toward Avi and start to kiss him. Our lips touch first, then I slide my tongue over his while I slip my arms up his chest and around his neck. As I pull back, I lick my lips and give him a sexy, knowing smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nuzzles his mouth close to my ear and says, \"Why the big show?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my head and try to say to him so only he can hear me above the blaring song, \"Don\u0027t you want to kiss me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. But not with a bunch of drunk kids watching us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you saying I\u0027m a kid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he answers, I hear Roxanne\u0027s squeaky voice saying, \"Hi, Amy. Hi, Nathan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up. Roxanne is standing next to us, her fingers over her open mouth while she gasps. \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry. I thought you were Nathan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m in trouble. Avi is expressionless, but his arm loosens from around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would she think you were kissing Nathan?\" he asks me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat. \"I can explain.\" Roxanne is still standing over us, a wicked smirk painted on her face. \"Do you mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring me, Roxanne holds out her hand. \"I\u0027m Roxanne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Avi,\" he tells her in his slow, sexy Israeli accent as he shakes her hand. I swear she turns her hand as if she expects him to kiss the back of it. \"I\u0027m Amy\u0027s boyfriend from Israel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxanne bursts out laughing. \"Oh, I heard about you. So glad you and Amy decided to see other people. You\u0027re such an understanding guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he releases her hand, I wave my fingers at her and say, \"Shoo, go away.\" She\u0027s like an annoying gnat that I wish I could squash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxanne moves away when Kyle walks in the room with a bottle of champagne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you kiss Nathan?\" Avi asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUmm...\"No. Roxanne is the enemy, Avi. Don\u0027t listen to her. She just likes spreading lies about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands (I have to pretend not to have fallen off his lap) and walks over to Roxanne. She cocks her head to the side and says, \"Wanna play Spin the Bottle? You can, you know, switch partners. Amy likes switching partners, right?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-my-teenage-life-how-to-ruin-2/page-21.html","bookId":2765,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:16 PM"}
