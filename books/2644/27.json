She\u0027d thought that when Hugh left he would relax some, but if anything, he\u0027d grown more on edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was denying her because he couldn\u0027t father children, then that was simply unacceptable. Whenever she thought about his admission, she wondered if he\u0027d been ill as a child, and her heart hurt to think of him in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was doing this because he saw her as spoiled and closed-minded, then she\u0027d have to force him to see that she wanted to learn, that she wanted to be better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnal¨ªa knew the most pressing reason why he was distant with her. So clearly they needed to get this lovemaking completed so they could be together. Decided on her course of action, she began planning. Tonight she\u0027d bathed with the scented soaps the seamstress had brought her - the peculiar woman had returned with more clothing and evidently everything else she could lay hands on. After her bath, Annal¨ªa had slipped on a new nightdress she\u0027d chosen from the selection, chosen specifically for particular characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she was ready. She wasn\u0027t as nervous as she\u0027d imagined she might be - after all, this would be a bold move - but she knew that this was the course she was meant to take....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MacCarrick!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door burst open a second later. \"Anna, what is it - \" He lost his voice when he saw her standing at the foot of the bed. \"Go back to bed,\" he ordered in a harsh tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t faze her. She stood determined before him and tugged the left string strap of her nightgown loose. The jet black silk slid down one side, just above her nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened as if in realization, then narrowed. \"Doona do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached back and unpinned her hair, shaking her head until it spilled down her back. Her fingers rested at the other tie strap of her nightgown, ready to pluck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand was shaking as he ran it over his face. \"You canna keep temptin\u0027 me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her eyebrows and tugged. The tie was on the verge of unraveling. She thought he was on the verge of unraveling. His body seemed to thrum with energy and tension throughout. She could hardly wait to touch it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice low, he said, \"Anna, I am askin\u0027 you, please, doona - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled it loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nightgown dipped, hesitating over her hard nipples before floating down past her waist and legs. \"What were you saying?\" she asked in a purring voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw slackened. Taking down her hair had been merciless. The nightgown? Without the nightgown, the ground he\u0027d managed to gain, or at least maintain, was now unrecoverable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you keep pushing me, I will take you to bed, but it will no\u0027 be just to kiss you. It will no\u0027 be like last time.\" He struggled to keep his eyes on her face - away from her high breasts, away from her curving hips that he wanted to clench - yet even the look in her eyes was carnal. \"There will be repercussions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it, Anna,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"I will take you this night, I swear it.\" How could a man not be expected to make love to the woman he coveted above all things? When she presented herself like a newly unwrapped gift? He might as well be expected to voluntarily forgo breathing. Which was impossible. Denying himself the feel of her body?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a hit, things became very clear. She wanted him to make love to her, and he wanted her desperately. The reasons he\u0027d come up with not to couldn\u0027t withstand this. Right now, he couldn\u0027t recall a single one anyway. He would take her so long and hard that she\u0027d regret pushing. He kicked the door closed then strode to her, lifting her against his chest, forcing her to wrap her legs around his waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Courtland,\" she said with a gasp as he carried her to the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on the edge, keeping her spread over his lap, his hands splayed against her bottom, squeezing. He scarcely believed she was naked on him, and had begun eagerly kissing his neck and face and removing his shirt as if she were hungry for him. He lowered his head to her chest, drawing her nipple into his mouth. When she cried out, he stopped, not quite kissing her, his lips just next to her skin. \"Mo cridhe, are you tae be mine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threaded her fingers into his hair. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grasped her face and met her eyes. \"In all the ways, Anna?\" he asked, his voice a rasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered without looking away. \"I will be yours in all ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to revel in what she\u0027d just promised, but when he shrugged out of his shirt, she pressed her breasts against him, moaning softly and shivering from the contact, and he could only clutch her tighter against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands petting him, her sex resting on his...He grated, \"You\u0027ll make me lose control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I canna. I need to - \" He hissed in a breath when she ground against his lap. \"I need to make sure you\u0027re ready.\" He lifted her up until her breasts were before his lips and dragged his tongue across her nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moaned, \"I am ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your body must be ready.\" When she shivered once more, he stood and placed her on the bed, then removed his boots and his trousers. Unclothed, he lay on his side, easing her to her back so he could trace his fingertips around her wet nipples and down her belly until her stomach twitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said against her ear, \"I need you wet.\" When she bent one leg and her hips rose, he captured that leg and put it over his side, locking her there, parting her to him. \"I want you tae ache with need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am,\" she assured him. \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes at the feeling of her sex as he spread the wetness all around. \"More than this. That means I\u0027ll need tae tease you again and again....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlow, gentle strokes. Her flesh felt like heaven, and he groaned thinking he was going to be inside her tonight. When he slipped a finger into her, her back arched. As he continued to push in and out of her tight sex, she reached for his cock, but he drew his hips back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...I want to put my hand on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Canna do that.\" He could scarcely keep from bucking against her now. He knew she was about to ask why, so he cut off her question by working two fingers inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped in surprise. \"That\u0027s different than before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe withdrew. \"It is. But does it please you?\" he asked with a slow push.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I don\u0027t know,\" she said, beginning to sound nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no hurry,\" he lied. Already he wondered how he would get through this without losing his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, after several more slow strokes, she grew accustomed and wetter. \"It does please me,\" she whispered. \"Very much.\" Her hands rubbed his chest as he did it again and again, learning her body, coaxing it to accept him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like me touching you inside?\" he grated at her neck where he\u0027d been licking, though he knew she couldn\u0027t possibly like it better than he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" She arched her back to come down hard on his fingers. She was so wet, so close even with his unhurried strokes. \"I-I can\u0027t take much more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked against her ear, \"Do you need to come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she whimpered, her body trembling, just on the verge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was his permission. He kissed her mouth hungrily as he released her, then rose over her to kneel between her legs. She was breathing fast, eyes heavy lidded, body supple. So desirable it hurt him. He returned two fingers to stir her. Just when she was on the verge, head thrashing, body tensing, he grasped himself to rub the tip against her wetness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Si us plau,\" she said on a moan. \"Please,\" she\u0027d said, sounding like she was in agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith care, he slowly worked just the head inside, though every part of him screamed to sink his hips into her. He didn\u0027t, even when she grew used to him. Even when she rolled her hips on the tip, the movement making her breasts quiver. \"Ah, God, Anna.\" No greater torture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it, he had discipline. He knew what he wanted to happen, and now he just had to make sure it played out as he wanted. He put his hands against the wall and tried to focus on them - on the diametrical patterns of the paper, on anything but the exquisite woman writhing beneath him. On him. Focusing until he was not directly on the verge of ejaculating inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall indented under his fingers, and the paper crumbled. Sweat dripped down his forehead. Every muscle in his body began to ache from strain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt her putting her hands on his hips, trying to pull him inside. Somehow he resisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinding no luck with his hips, she grasped the base of his rod. With her soft fingers wrapped around him, the head inside her...he could imagine...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned, his head falling back. Without thought he pumped against her hand. He was losing control. \"No, Anna - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eControl? He bucked against her hand again, pulled back to thrust harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe surged in, ripping through the barrier, groaning from the tightness even as she cried out in pain. At once she tried to shake him loose from her. She shoved at him and struggled to close her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Anna. No.\" He took her by the shoulders and held her. He didn\u0027t want her to stop now. She would only remember pain. He remained still, praying the hurt would fade. Praying he wouldn\u0027t give in to the screaming urge to pin her down into the mattress and pump into her as hard as he needed to. He shuddered at the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d quit moving, but her eyes were still squeezed shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have tae let your body adjust tae me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is what the girls at school talked about, isn\u0027t it? The pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will no\u0027 have it like this again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said without taking a breath, \"It hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked her hair from her forehead and kissed her there. \"Mo cridhe, I wish it dinna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes. They were glittering. She was hurting, and he felt it a thousand times. He cursed himself. Too delicate, her skin too soft beneath his hands. He carefully began to withdraw -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, wait,\" she whispered, and he froze. \"It isn\u0027t as bad as it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe not for her. He hurt as he\u0027d never known. His sack was heavy and ached, his body pained him. The throbbing pressure was unbearable when her body was squeezing him like a fist. He rubbed his face against her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should finish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned, knowing it was over. No control. He took her legs and pinned them against his hips, then sank into her once. He pulled out and drove harder, gnashing his teeth from need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his head down and licked at her damp breast, and on his third stroke he came. Like an explosion, shooting into her heat, unable to stop himself from grinding mindlessly against her as it went on and on. He yelled out from deep within his chest, lashed by a pleasure he\u0027d never imagined. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1/page-27.html","bookId":2644,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM"}
