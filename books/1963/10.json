Steve looked around, pleased to note that his sister had cleaned up the house a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Stevie,” Meg whined, “you never told me what a beautiful home you have.” She trailed one finger along the underside of his jaw. “But then, we haven’t had time to discuss much of anything, have we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make yourself comfortable,” Steve said and watched as Meg chose to sit on the sofa. She sat, crossing her legs with great ceremony. Then she patted the empty space beside her, silently requesting Steve to join her there. He glanced longingly at his favorite chair, but moved across the room and sat down next to Meg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minute he was comfortable, Meg placed her hand possessively on his knee and flexed her nails into his thigh. Inch by provocative inch she raked her nails up his leg until it was all Steve could do not to pop straight off the sofa. He caught her hand and stopped her from reaching what seemed to be her ultimate destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression was mildly repentant when she looked at him, but Steve knew her well enough to know the action had been deliberate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you might be hungry before Steve takes you to dinner, so I made a few hors d’oeuvres,” Nancy said and excused herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” Steve whispered the minute his sister was out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doing? What do you mean?” She had wide-eyed innocence down to an art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind,” he muttered as Nancy returned from the kitchen carrying a small silver platter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those look wonderful,” Meg said sweetly when his sister put the tray on the coffee table in front of them. “But I couldn’t eat a thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the best of his knowledge it was the first time his sister had cooked from the moment she’d moved in with him, and he wasn’t about to let it go to waste. He chose a tiny wiener wrapped in some kind of crispy dough and tossed it in his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shouldn’t have gone to all this trouble,” Meg told his sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy sat across the room from them, apparently at a complete loss for words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suspect you’re wondering about all these letters and e-mails I wrote,” Meg said, getting the conversation going. “I hope you aren’t unhappy with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, not at all,” Nancy said, rushing the words together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just that I’ve come to know what people really want from me by the things they say.” She turned, and with the tip of her index finger wiped a crumb from the corner of his mouth. Her tongue moistened her lips and Steve’s insides turned to mush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I learned a long time ago what men want from a woman,” Meg continued after a moment, “especially when I went to work for a phone sex line. Most of the guys are just looking for a woman to talk dirty to them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see.” Nancy folded her hands primly in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was the occasional guy who was looking for a good girl to shock, of course. I got very talented at acting horrified.” She made a soft, gasping sound, then laughed demurely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why … why would someone like you place an ad in Dateline?” Nancy asked, nervously brushing the hair from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, first,” Meg said, holding his sister’s gaze, “it’s just about the only way someone like me can meet anyone decent. But it wasn’t your brother who answered the ad, now, was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not that it matters,” Meg said, cutting her off. “I was tired of my job and all those guys asking me to say those nasty things, and I didn’t want to start working on my back again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On your … back,” Nancy repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, sugar. I didn’t mean to shock you. I’ve got a colorful past—but that doesn’t mean I’m a bad girl. I’ve got a heart just brimming with love. All I need is the right man.” Her gaze wandered to Steve and was long and deliberate. “Your brother’s given me a reason to dream again,” Meg said softly. “Lots of people think women like me don’t have feelings, but they’re wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure that’s true,” Nancy said tentatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew I chose right when I found out your brother has his own business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s struggled financially for years,” Nancy was quick to tell her. “It’s still touch and go. He lives from one month to the next.” Nancy glared at him pointedly. “Don’t you, Steve?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not anymore. I’m more than solvent now,” Steve tossed in for good measure, struggling not to laugh. He was enjoying this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg tightened her arm around his. “I can see how well Stevie’s doing for himself. He’s wonderful,” she said, refusing to look away. The adoration on her face embarrassed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why, Steve here could make enough money to keep me in the lifestyle to which I’d like to become accustomed.” She laughed coyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah …” It sounded to Steve as if his sister was close to hyperventilating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, I wouldn’t take anything from him without giving in return. That wouldn’t be fair.” She snuggled closer to his side and gave him a look so purely sexual Steve was convinced he’d embarrass them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are things I could teach your brother,” Meg said in a husky voice full of sexual innuendo. She acted as though she was eager to get started right that moment and the only thing holding her back was propriety. Her breathing grew heavy—and if he didn’t know better he’d think she actually had worked for one of those disreputable phone services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon he was having a problem controlling his own breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Steve!” Nancy snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his attention back to his sister, staring at her blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t you hear Meg?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. He knew the two women were talking, but he’d barely noticed their conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meg’s talking about moving in with you,” Nancy said through clenched teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t mean to rush you, darling’,” Meg whispered. Leaning forward, she licked his earlobe with the tip of her tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHot sensation shot down his spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg threw back her head and laughed softly, then whispered just loudly enough for Nancy to hear, “I have an incredibly talented tongue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy closed her eyes as if she couldn’t bear to watch another minute of this. Frankly, Steve didn’t know how much more he could take himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s time we left for dinner,” he said. Otherwise he was going to start believing all the promises Meg was making. Heaven knew, he wanted to believe them. The demure bookseller had turned into something completely different. All traces of innocence had disappeared and in their place was the most sexually provocative female he’d ever met. Just being in the same room with her made his blood sizzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to leave already?” Meg gave the impression that she was terribly disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s probably best,” Nancy muttered, and then realizing what she’d said, hurried to add, “I mean, you two don’t want to waste your evening with me, do you?” She frowned at Steve. “You won’t be late, will you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unfortunately, I’m still working for the phone people,” Meg said, “so I won’t keep him too long, but I can’t promise he’ll have much kick left in him when I’m finished.” Apparently thinking herself exceptionally clever, Meg laughed at her own joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t until they were back in the car and on the freeway that Steve recognized how angry he was. It made no sense, but he wasn’t exactly rational just then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you so mad?” Meg asked about halfway back to the bookstore. They hadn’t spoken a word from the time they’d left his house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talk about overkill,” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I did a good job,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You came off like a—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. That’s what I wanted. After meeting me, do you honestly think your sister’s going to encourage our relationship?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can guarantee you that Lindsey doesn’t want me to see you, either. I thought that’s what this whole scheme of yours was about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It sounded like a good idea at the time.” He tightened his hands on the steering wheel. “It seemed like a surefire way to convince your daughter that I was the wrong man for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And your sister that I was equally wrong for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled over them like nightfall. Neither of them seemed inclined to talk again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve edged his car into the alley behind Meg’s store and parked his car behind hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not so sure anymore,” he said without looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The two of us. Somewhere in the middle of all this, I decided I kind of like you.” It hadn’t been easy to admit, and he hoped she appreciated what it had cost his pride. “It probably wouldn’t have been as obvious if you hadn’t made yourself out to be so cheap. That isn’t you any more than the rebel without a cause is me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wished she’d say something. When she did speak, her voice was timid and small. “Then there was the kiss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kisses,” he corrected. “They were pretty great and we both know it,” he said with confidence. He knew what his own reaction had been, and she hadn’t fooled him with hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Especially the one on the motorcycle,” he said, prompting her to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Especially the one on the motorcycle,” she mimicked. “Honestly, Steve, you must’ve known.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was full blown. “I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I … I didn’t do a very good job of disguising what I was feeling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn’t, but he was in a gracious mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about dinner?” he suggested. He was eager to have the real Meg Remington back. Eager to experiment with a few more kisses—see if they were anything close to what his memory kept insisting they’d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated. “I want to, but I can’t,” she eventually said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bristled and turned in the driver’s seat to face her. “Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promised Lindsey I’d be home by seven and it’s nearly that now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call her and tell her you’re going out to dinner with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dragged in a deep breath and seemed to hold it. “I can’t do that, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After meeting you, I promised her we’d talk. She wanted to last evening, and we didn’t …. That was my fault. You kissed me,” she said, “and I didn’t feel like a heart-to-heart with my daughter after that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And it’s all my fault?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know what Lindsey wants to discuss?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-mother-s-wish/page-10.html","bookId":1963,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:49 AM"}
