{"id":38797,"no":7,"title":"Part One Chapter 7","content":"The following ten days were, as W. C. Fields said, \"fraught with emi- nent\u0026nbsp; peril\"--and\u0026nbsp; mad.\u0026nbsp; I\u0026nbsp; moved\u0026nbsp; in\u0026nbsp; with\u0026nbsp; Roland\u0026nbsp; Major in\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; really swank\u0026nbsp; apartment that belonged to Tim Gray\u0027s folks. We each had a bedroom, and there was a kitchenette with food in the icebox, and a huge living room where Major sat in his silk dressing gown composing his latest Hemingwayan short story--a choleric, red-faced, pudgy hater of everything, who could turn\u0026nbsp; on the warmest and most charming smile in the world when real life confronted him sweetly in the night. He sat like that at his desk, and I\u0026nbsp; jumped around over the thick soft rug, wearing only my chino pants. He\u0027d\u0026nbsp; just written a story about a guy who comes to Denver for the first time. His name is Phil. His trav- eling companion is a mysterious and quiet fellow called Sam. Phil goes out to dig Denver and gets hung-up with arty types. He comes back to the hotel room. Lugubriously he says, \"Sam, they\u0027re here too.\" And Sam is just looking out the window sadly. \"Yes,\" says Sam, \"I know.\" And the point was that Sam didn\u0027t have to go and look to know this. The arty types were all over America, sucking up its blood. Major and I were great pals; he thought I was the farthest thing from an arty type. Major liked good wines, just like Hemingway. He reminisced about his recent trip to France. \"Ah, Sal, if you could sit with me high in the Bas- que country with a cool bottle of Poignon Dix-neuf, then you\u0027d know there are other things besides boxcars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"I know that. It\u0027s just that I love boxcars and I love to read the names on them like Missouri Pacific, Great Northern, Rock Island Line. By\u0026nbsp; Gad, Major, if I could tell you everything that happened to me hitching here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003eThe Rawlinses lived a few blocks away. This was a delightful family--a youngish mother, part owner of a decrepit, ghost-town hotel, with five sons and two daughters. The wild son was Ray Rawlins, Tim Gray\u0027s boyhood buddy. Ray came roaring in to get me and we took to each other right away. We went off and drank in the Colfax bars. One surf-riding doll of the West. She was Tim Gray\u0027s girl. And Major, who was\u0026nbsp; only passing through Denver and doing so in real style in the apartment, was going out with Tim Gray\u0027s sister Betty. I was the only guy without a\u0026nbsp; girl. I asked everybody, \"Where\u0027s Dean?\" They made smiling negative answers.Then finally it happened. The phone rang, and it was Carlo Marx. He\u0026nbsp; gave\u0026nbsp; me\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; address\u0026nbsp; of\u0026nbsp; his\u0026nbsp; basement\u0026nbsp; apartment.\u0026nbsp; I\u0026nbsp; said, \"What\u0026nbsp; are you\u0026nbsp; doing\u0026nbsp; in\u0026nbsp; Denver? I\u0026nbsp; mean\u0026nbsp; what are you\u0026nbsp; idoingi? What\u0027s going on?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh, wait till I tell you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003eI rushed over to meet him. He was working in May\u0027s depart- ment store nights; crazy Ray Rawlins called him up there from a bar, getting janitors to run after Carlo with a story that somebody had died. Carlo immediately thought it was me who had died. And Rawlins said over\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; phone,\u0026nbsp; \"Sal\u0027s\u0026nbsp; in\u0026nbsp; Denver,\"\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; gave\u0026nbsp; him\u0026nbsp; my\u0026nbsp; address\u0026nbsp; and phone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\"And where is Dean?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Dean is in Denver. Let me tell you.\" And he told me that Dean was making love to two girls at the same time, they being Marylou, his first wife, who waited for him in a hotel room, and Camille, a new girl, who waited for\u0026nbsp; him in a hotel room. \"Between the two of them he rushes to me for our own unfinished business.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"And what business is that??\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Dean and I are embarked on a tremendous season together. We\u0027re trying to communicate with absolute honesty and absolute com- pleteness everything on our minds. We\u0027ve had to take benzedrine. We sit on the bed,\u0026nbsp; crosslegged, facing each other. I have finally taught Dean that he can do\u0026nbsp; anything he wants, become mayor of Denver, marry a millionairess, or become the greatest poet since Rimbaud. But he keeps rushing out to see the midget auto races. I go with him. He jumps and yells, excited. You know,\u0026nbsp; Sal, Dean is really hung-up on things like that.\" Marx said \"Hmm\" in his soul and thought about this.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\"What\u0027s the schedule?\" I said. There was always a schedule in Dean\u0027s life.\n\u003cbr\u003e\"The schedule is this: I came off work a half-hour ago. In that time Dean is balling Marylou at the hotel and gives me time to change and dress. At one sharp he rushes from Marylou to Camille--of course neither one of them knows what\u0027s going on--and bangs her once, giv- ing me time to arrive at one-thirty. Then he comes out with me--first he has\u0026nbsp; to\u0026nbsp; beg\u0026nbsp; with\u0026nbsp; Camille,\u0026nbsp; who\u0027s\u0026nbsp; already\u0026nbsp; started hating\u0026nbsp; me--and\u0026nbsp; we come here to talk till six in the morning. We usually spend more time than that, but it\u0027s getting awfully\u0026nbsp; complicated and he\u0027s pressed for time. Then at six he goes back to Marylou--and he\u0027s going to spend all day tomorrow running around to get\u0026nbsp; the necessary papers for their divorce. Marylou\u0027s all for it, but she insists on banging in the interim. She says she loves him--so does Camille.\"\n\u003cbr\u003eThen he told me how Dean had met Camille. Roy Johnson, the poolhall boy, had found her in a bar and took her to a hotel; pride tak- ing over his sense, he invited the whole gang to come up and see her. Everybody sat around talking with Camille. Dean did nothing but look out the window.\u0026nbsp; Then when everybody left, Dean merely looked at Camille, pointed at his wrist, made the sign \"four\" (meaning he\u0027d be- back at four), and went out. At three the door was locked to-Roy John- son. At four it was opened to Dean. I wanted to go right out and see the madman. Also he had promised to fix me up; he knew all the girls in Denver.\n\u003cbr\u003eCarlo and I went through rickety streets in the Denver night. The air was soft, the stars so fine, the promise of every cobbled alley so great, that I thought I was in a dream. We came to the rooming house where Dean\u0026nbsp; haggled with Camille. It was an old red-brick building surrounded by wooden garages and old trees that stuck up from be- hind fences. We went up carpeted stairs. Carlo knocked; then he darted to the back to hide; he\u0026nbsp; didn\u0027t\u0026nbsp; want Camille to see him. I stood in the door. Dean opened it stark\u0026nbsp; naked. I saw a brunette on the bed, one beautiful creamy\u0026nbsp; thigh covered with\u0026nbsp; black\u0026nbsp; lace,\u0026nbsp; look up\u0026nbsp; with mild wonder.\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Why, Sa-a-al!\" said Dean. \"Well now--ah--ahem--yes, of course, you\u0027ve arrived--you old sonumbitch you finally got on that old road. Well,\u0026nbsp; now, look here--we must--yes, yes, at once--we must, we really must! Now Camille--\" And he swirled on her. \"Sal is here, this is my old buddy from New Yor-r-k, this is his first night in Denver and it\u0027s absolutely necessary for me to take him out and fix him up with a girl.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"But what time will you be back?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"It is now\" (looking at his watch) \"exactly one-fourteen. I shall be back at exactly ithreei-fourteen, for our hour of reverie together, real sweet reverie, darling, and then, as you know, as I told you and as we agreed, I have to go and see the one-legged lawyer about those pa- pers--in the middle of the night, strange as it seems and as I tho-ro-ly explained.\" (This was a\u0026nbsp; coverup for his rendezvous with Carlo, who was still hiding.) \"So now in this exact minute I must dress, put on my pants, go back to life, that is to outside life, streets and what not, as we agreed, it is now one-fifteen and time\u0027s running, running--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Well, all right, Dean, but please be sure and be back at three.\" \"Just\u0026nbsp; as\u0026nbsp; I\u0026nbsp; said,\u0026nbsp; darling,\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; remember\u0026nbsp; not\u0026nbsp; three\u0026nbsp; but\u0026nbsp; three-\n\u003cbr\u003efourteen. Are we straight in the deepest and most wonderful depths of our\u0026nbsp; souls, dear darling?\" And he went over and kissed her several times. On the wall was a nude drawing of Dean, enormous dangle and all, done by Camille. I was amazed. Everything was so crazy.\n\u003cbr\u003eOff we rushed into the night; Carlo joined us in an alley. And we proceeded down the narrowest, strangest, and most crooked little city street\u0026nbsp; I\u0027ve ever seen, deep in the heart of Denver Mexican-town. We talked in loud voices in the sleeping stillness. \"Sal,\" said Dean, \"I have just the girl waiting for you at this very minute--if she\u0027s off duty\" (looking at his watch). \"A waitress, Rita Bettencourt, fine chick, slightly hung-up on a few sexual difficulties which I\u0027ve tried to straighten up and I think you can manage,\u0026nbsp; you fine gone daddy you. So we\u0027ll go there at once--we must bring beer, no, they have some themselves, and damn!\" he said socking his palm. \"I\u0027ve just got to get into her sister Mary tonight.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"What?\" said Carlo. \"I thought we were going to talk.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Yes, yes, after.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh, these Denver doldrums!\" yelled Carlo to the sky.\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Isn\u0027t he the finest sweetest fellow in the world?\" said Dean, punching me in the ribs. \"Look at him. Look at him!\"\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd Carlo began his monkey dance in the streets of life as I\u0027d seen him do so many times everywhere in New York.\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd all I could say was, \"Well, what the hell are we doing in Denver?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Tomorrow, Sal, I know where I can find you a job,\" said Dean, reverting to businesslike tones. \"So I\u0027ll call on you, soon as I have an hour off from Marylou, and cut right into that apartment of yours, say hello to Major, and take you on a trolley (damn, I\u0027ve no car) to the Ca- margo\u0026nbsp; markets,\u0026nbsp; where you can begin working at once and collect a paycheck come Friday. We\u0027re really all of us bottomry broke. I haven\u0027t had time to work in weeks. Friday night beyond all doubt the three of us--the old threesome of Carlo, Dean, and Sal--must go to the midget auto races, and\u0026nbsp; for\u0026nbsp; that I can get us a ride from a guy downtown I know ... \" And on and on into the night.\n\u003cbr\u003eWe got to the house where the waitress sisters lived. The one for me\u0026nbsp; was still working; the sister that Dean wanted was in. We sat down on her couch. I was scheduled at this time to call Ray Rawlins. I did. He came over at once. Coming into the door, he took off his shirt and undershirt and began hugging the absolute stranger, Mary Betten- court. Bottles rolled on the floor. Three o\u0027clock came. Dean rushed off for his hour of reverie with Camille. He was back on time. The other sister showed up. We all needed a car now, and we were making too much noise. Ray Rawlins called up a buddy with a car. He came. We all piled in; Carlo was trying to conduct his scheduled talk with Dean in the back seat, but there was too much confusion. \"Let\u0027s all go to my apartment!\" I shouted. We did; the moment the car stopped there I jumped out and stood on my head in the grass. All my keys fell out; I never found them. We ran, shouting, into the building. Roland Major stood barring our way in his silk dressing gown.\n\u003cbr\u003e\"I\u0027ll have no goings-on like this in Tim Gray\u0027s apartment!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"What?\" we all shouted. There was confusion. Rawlins was roll- ing in the grass with one of the waitresses. Major wouldn\u0027t let us in. We swore to call Tim Gray and confirm the party and also invite him. In- stead we all rushed back to the Denver downtown hangouts. I sudden- ly found myself alone in the street with no money. My last dollar was gone.\n\u003cbr\u003eI walked five miles up Colfax to my comfortable bed in the apartment. Major had to let me in. I wondered if Dean and Carlo were having their heart-to-heart. I would find out later. The nights in Denver are cool, and I slept like a log.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/17/162.html","bookId":295,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:50:45 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:50:45 AM"}
