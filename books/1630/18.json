They materialize slowly, characteristic of Precursor transit, shedding multiverse residues at a rate that makes them temporarily vulnerable to the Falchion’s immediate response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe presence of Forerunner forces within this region is apparently a surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo begins the clench. While the re-emerging enemy forces are most vulnerable, still surrounded by a haze of alternate realities, the Falchion orders a carefully pre-positioned series of stabbing harrier attacks. The cloaked harriers engage first not with obvious and traceable beam weapons or projectiles, but entrained local asteroids, delivering them through gravity slings into the emergence field of each arriving enemy vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe asteroids interfere with the collapsing function of each emerging ship; in effect, either forcing them to abandon the transit, or to combine asteroid mass with the ship’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result: half of the arriving vessels dematerialize in brilliant flashes, while the other half desperately reposition by a few thousand kilometers. This affords a multi-pronged force of uncloaked harriers opportunity to engage in open beam attacks, swiftly destroying another third.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remaining enemy ships, largely intact but no longer in fighting trim, are examined by ancillas assigned to the Falchion, and the ships’ designators are fed into sentinels which then deploy from an apex fortress. They gather with harriers to penetrate shields and hulls, board the vessels, and quickly reprogram all control ancillas. Triumph seems assured. A hundred more such actions could guarantee victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur sentinels and monitors have supposedly been proofed against Gravemind logics. But upon ship entry, they are not successful; transmissions show all succumbing. The ships filled with infected Forerunners are deemed lost, and destroyed one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFRAGMENT 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite isolated victories, the conquest of the Capital System is nearly complete. Strategic control of the ecumene now passes to the greater Ark—it has effectively become all that remains of Forerunner governance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFRAGMENT 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome facts regarding the most recent and devastating incursions. From the diffuse outer reaches of our galaxy to the tight-packed stars around the central Eater, Precursor artifacts have continued their methodical process of confining and deactivating Forerunner fleets, then carving them into manageable units to be parasitized, converted, and re-tasked. Only a few vessels have been able to self-destruct—less than one half of one percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA very few ships have been reclaimed and purged of Flood infection. Due to rampant deception and possible corruption, this program has been suspended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe logic plague is now pandemic. It is no longer limited to direct Gravemind communication, but can be passed through interactions with any Flood-infected individuals, or even ancillas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppression fields emanating from retasked star roads and double-bow formations often finish by completely deactivating uninfected ancillas throughout a sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vessels that have not been converted are severely handicapped by loss of their AIs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFRAGMENT 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… estimated two out of three remaining battle fleets destroyed or parasitized. All surviving vessels appear to have been assimilated into Offensive Bias’s fleet.

DO NOT ACCESS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTRING 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCATALOG\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE UR-DIDACT HAS returned to his home planet of Far Nomdagro in his personal ship of war, Mantle’s Approach. His privileges have been restored, but he is not in command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatalog has been reassigned to him, without his objection—to my surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe IsoDidact has not yet arrived, nor has the Librarian. She and the Ur-Didact have not seen each other for a thousand years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ur-Didact stands motionless in the middle of their estate’s main dwelling, clad in a new suit of combat armor, a dark presence in a grim, chaotic scene. Council agents ransacked the private quarters as well. The house is in a state of perilous confusion. In two of the six wings, chambers and rooms climb up and over each other and rearrange randomly beneath the glowing night sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has attempted to restore some order, but the quarters where he and his wife raised their children and lived through their brightest and darkest centuries are too traumatized to recover without demolition, wiping, replacement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the Librarian’s specimen stasis bubbles have been breached by Council agents attempting to find evidence against her. Their contents set free, many of them attacked each other or fled. Mangled cadavers have been arranged in odd heaps by house monitors. Few are now alive to eat or to be eaten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe approaches a badly injured tarantovire, fifty times his size, a gentle beast of intelligence and wisdom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She will return soon, old one,” he murmurs, stroking the great head behind one glazed and fading eye. “What will she find? A broken and crippled home, a broken and crippled husband.” He glances at me, still stroking the leathery hide. The beast is dead. “We have become our own enemy, Catalog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am too saddened to reply, and it takes a great deal to sadden a Juridical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlowing clouds of interstellar gas slide below the horizon, remnants of the supernova wavefront that passed a thousand years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ur-Didact summons memories of children from long ago. The young ones leap and scamper about, and I glimpse the Didact in those far-gone years, reaching out to lift a young female to his shoulders, or parrying a stick playfully swung by a young male, or bending to pet a furry creature held by another child … a pet not unlike a small human, I think. There is something different about this Didact from his younger, projected self. Something I cannot completely understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No war, no fighting,” he murmurs. “Eternal bliss, progress and development without pause! Impossible dream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Librarian’s dream?” I ask, too boldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not at all. She understands life! How could they not? Peace and cooperation, never painful or deadly competition—that’s what they must have desired. They understood nothing about their creations, really—else why open themselves to that sort of rebellion? Madness! It could only lead to madness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You speak of the Precursors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignores my question and asks his own:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this other like, the foolish Manipular I was forced to imprint?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To my knowledge, he has conducted himself well, even impressively,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should not resent him. The choices they made…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Precursors?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forerunners,” he mutters, shaking his great head. He stretches out his arms to imitate the image of his younger self, then moves into the image, until he is swarmed by translucent children, all of whom grew up and chose their father’s rate, all of whom died in the war with the humans. The sight is striking—a glowering old Warrior-Servant surrounded by happy youths. These memories must bring far more pain than relief or peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese memories are not meant to soothe. They are meant to prepare. At a wave of his hand, the children vanish. The house seems to draw in a breath of cold wind. He slowly turns and examines me as if I am new and unfamiliar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I reject the assertion that you are all the same,” he says. “The unit the Master Builder sent with us into the Burn helped to save me, of that I’m convinced. It performed with extraordinary courage. It was special. He was special.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy curiosity is intense. The Ur-Didact has yet to tell what happened on the hulk sent into the Burn. No other survivors have been found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It—he—came between me and the Gravemind, just as I was being delivered up. Then monitors moved in. Grapplers held and froze Catalog. Before I could see more, I was removed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ur-Didact shudders, then points his arm along a line that thrusts down through the planet. “She’s here. She’s in the system,” he says, as if sensing the Librarian’s presence across time and space. Instead of joy, however, he exhibits a peculiar bleakness, then contorted anger. He squares his body with mine. “Send Bornstellar to me when his ship arrives. Alone.” He stalks off to a side chamber, and when I try to follow, he waves me off. I am alone on the plaza, under the night’s knotted weave of interstellar mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a few of the house monitors still function. Many hide in the shadows, eyes glowing like small animals. I am little more than a servant myself now, not of the Didact but of a system of reckoning and justice that may no longer exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadows grow deeper and longer as the stars wheel westward and a great black torso of uncondensed nebula rises to zenith. One of the functioning monitors approaches. “We should all greet our mistress,” it says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” I am now indeed at the level of these cowering servants. I wonder about the courage of the Ur-Didact’s Catalog. We are all the same. We are not all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut one or many, same or different, I must seek truth. And so I go with the monitor away from the plaza to the landing platform, which minutes later fills with light and echoes with thunder as a Lifeworker ship pushes through the heated air and comes to a pause just centimeters from the buffering arms of its hard light cradle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE GATHERING\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe IsoDidact has reunited with the Librarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach is accompanied by Catalog. Catalog becomes a triad: one unit with three points of view. Three Juridical agents, brought together, create a personal network and share information. This affords a unique opportunity to observe the reunion of the Ur-Didact, the Bornstellar or IsoDidact, and the Librarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonitors—the few that still function—assign the gathering to a wing of the house only lightly damaged by the Council agents’ rough work. A long, wide hall proudly configures itself for the reunion of the two greatest defenders of the ecumene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the time being, at the request of the Ur-Didact, the Librarian does not attend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two versions of the Didact differ only slightly in mass and are much the same in shape. Both wear battle armor. The IsoDidact has fewer scars than his original, but both have obviously survived serious combat. Between them there is no preamble, no greeting or amenities. They know each other as well as one may know himself. Thousands of years of both life and experience, nevertheless, define the Ur-Didact, but something substantive is different, something unparalleled in Juridical experience with this Promethean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe IsoDidact is calm, expectant but not tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ur-Didact speaks first. “I’ve never apologized,” he says. “It had to be done, what she and I did to you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I serve,” the IsoDidact says. “It was my privilege.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have been partner, and a good one, to my wife, while I could not … Husband or protector. While I was in my Cryptum she made her deals, got what she needed. You saw the results. Now our testimony, our evidence, has been gathered. Was there a great crime? Did we kill the last of our creators?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We did. With full justification.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you believe that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What were they like—the Precursors—when we sent fleets to hunt them down and destroy them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unlike the Primordial, unlike the Gravemind on the rogue Halo. Unlike the Flood, almost certainly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were they like you and me … Warriors??”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Lifeshaper has not shared that knowledge with me,” the IsoDidact tells him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ur-Didact reaches out as if to touch his duplicate. The IsoDidact withdraws a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You feel it,” the Ur-Didact says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what I feel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are no longer the same,” the Ur-Didact says. “Look at that forsaken sky. The shadowy dust of old suns glowing deep inside with young light. New stars being born. Planets condensing like rain, covering themselves almost immediately in a velvet of life. When I was young, I saw a universe filled with threat and constant danger. It took the Librarian to teach me it was more beautiful than I could bear … Beauty second only to her own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now?” the IsoDidact asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I see are the colors of nightmare,” the Ur-Didact says. “Every star turned against us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so it is,” his second agrees. “The last combined Forerunner fleet made a stand out beyond Jad Sappar. Thousands of star roads sheltered and magnified the enemy’s strength, protecting swarms of ships—Forerunner ships—crewed by our own infected warriors. A perversion beyond imagining, but not beyond reality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not need to imagine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They will need us. Both of us … together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the Ark?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s our last defense. All that remains of the Forerunners.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two Didacts look up and out at the great swath of dusty darkness that is the nebula’s outstretched arm. The new-fired young suns within this black cloud are buried deep and do not yet shine through, though in thousands of years they certainly will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else do you see?” the IsoDidact asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I’ve always seen, what we’ve always seen,” the Ur-Didact answers. “But now it’s different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is something about this one that makes even Catalog uneasy, a coiled potential only partly visible in his duplicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The light is over a hundred years old,” the IsoDidact says. “What could change?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something deeper than frequency. Look again,” the Ur-Didact says. “The way it invades our eyes. Piercing. Slicing. Concealing. The light shuns us, space itself wishes to expel us. Can’t you see? We are no longer welcome here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis opening is not fortuitous. There is a slow calculation between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Flood changes everything. Not just flesh. Space itself is infected,” the Ur-Didact continues. “That’s the power the Precursors once had … isn’t it? They shaped and moved galaxies! They created us! How did we ever manage to defeat them?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-silentium-the-forerunner-saga-3/page-18.html","bookId":1630,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:36 PM"}
