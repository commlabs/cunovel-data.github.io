He reacted with revulsion at the thought, and leaped off. Then he saw that his left hand was holding a sheet of paper. He carried it to the meager light source and read it quickly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ron—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Don\u0027t wait another moment. You\u0027ll find a suit of clothes in the closet left. Leave through back stairway marked N. There is money in suit. Use it to leave the city. Do not return if you value your safety and the life of\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n M.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He found the clothes as directed, a neatly-cut suit of boy\u0027s clothing, with a small wallet stuffed with bills amounting to three hundred dollars. He dressed rapidly, opened the door, and peered down the hall. It was empty as he ran silently towards the exit marked N.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now he was doubly in debt to Dr. Minton. But he couldn\u0027t spare the doctor even now, for his life had been given a new direction and purpose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was going to kill the Scholar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He walked rapidly through the dark streets towards the public parking lot where the helicopter had been stored. He took the lift to the roof, and walked up to it quickly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s about time, pal.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was Shock, his hair tousled over his hard, bright eyes. There was a gun in his hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ve been waitin\u0027 an hour, you punk. Think you were gettin\u0027 off so easy?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Look, Shock—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You thought you were a clever boy, didn\u0027t you? Well, I got news for you—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Look, I don\u0027t want to be leader. I just needed a copter for a few hours.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yeah, sure. Only you forgot something. We put Finder equipment on this baby a long time ago, so we could keep tabs on it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can have the copter—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t want just the copter, Ronnie boy. I want to square a few things with you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Look, Shock. I\u0027ll make a deal with you. I\u0027ll give you two hundred bucks for that gun.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The tall boy\u0027s face changed. \"What?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You heard me. You hand over that gun, I\u0027ll give you two hundred dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His eyes narrowed. \"Then what? I suppose you\u0027d shoot me and take off. Uh-uh, pal.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can check the gun downstairs, and sell me the key.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Okay,\" Shock said slowly. \"But if you\u0027re pullin\u0027 something—\" He balled his hands menacingly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They went down to the lower level together. Shock bought himself a public locker, and shoved the gun inside. Then he held up the key.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Here it is, pal. Two hundred bucks worth.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ron handed him the money. Shock whistled at the sight of the bills.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now,\" Ron said. \"Would you like to make a hundred more?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He looked at Ron with respect. \"Okay. What\u0027s the pitch?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I want you to make a phone call for me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yeah, sure.\" Shock looked bewildered. Then Ron explained.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They reached the guard in the East Wing of the Medical Center without much difficulty. Shock crouched over the receiver and said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This is Dr. Luther. Something\u0027s happened; you better connect me with him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Okay, hold on.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a wait. Then Ron Carver\u0027s own voice, in its eerie new inflection, was on the other end.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This is Luther. Something\u0027s happened down here. I think the boy got away.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What? Where are you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In the morgue, downstairs. I think you better come down yourself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How could it happen?\" The Ron-voice was raging. \"How?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know. But you better meet me here in ten minutes—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ron jabbed Shock in the side, and the tall boy slammed the receiver back into place with a relieved sigh.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t get it,\" he said. \"Who was that guy?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Me,\" Ron said, with a grim smile. He handed Shock the money, and watched him depart, still looking baffled. Then he went to the locker and removed the gun, stuffing it inside his jacket. It bulked large against his narrow chest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He raced through the streets back to the medical center, heading for Exit N and the morgue.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3272/89523.html","bookId":513,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:53:08 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:53:08 AM"}
