{"id":16888,"no":31,"title":"Letter XIV.","content":"Now this is, as I said, an era. I called it that of Western Occultism, but you may give it any name you like. But it is western. The symbol is the well-intended American Republic, which was seen by Tom Paine beforehand \"as a new era in the affairs of the world.\" It was meant as near as possible to be a brotherhood of nations, and that is the drift of its declaration and constitution. The T.S. is meant to be46 the same, but has for many years been in a state of friction. It has now, if possible, to come out of that. It cannot be a brotherhood unless each, or some, of its units becomes a brother in truth. And brother was the noble name given in 1875 to the Masters. Hence you and I and all of us must cultivate that. We must forgive our enemies and those who assail us, for only thus can the great brothers properly help by working through us. There seems to be a good deal to forgive, but it is easily done inasmuch as in fifty years we\u0027ll all be gone and forgot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cut off, then, thoughts about those \"foolish children\" until harmonious vibrations ensue to some extent. That absurdity ... let go. I have deliberately refrained from jumping at such a grand chance. So you see forgive, forgive and largely forget. Come along, then, and with me get up as fast as possible the feeling of brotherhood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now then, you want more light, and this is what you must do. You will have to \"give up\" something. To wit: have yourself called half an hour earlier than is usual and devote it before breakfast to silent meditation, in which brood upon all great and high ideas. Half an hour! Surely that you can spare. And don\u0027t eat first. If you can take another half before you go to bed and without any preliminaries of undressing and making things agreeable or more comfortable, meditate again. Now don\u0027t fail me in this. This is much to give up, but give it up, recollecting that you are not to make all those preparations indulged in by people.... \"The best and most important teacher is one\u0027s seventh principle centered in the sixth. The more you divest yourself of the illusionary sense of personal isolation, and the more you are devoted to the service of others, the more Maya disappears and the nearer you approach to Divinity.\" Good-bye, then, and may you find that peace that comes from the self.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1908/54931.html","bookId":918,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 8:07:05 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 8:07:05 AM"}
