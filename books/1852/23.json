When she requested additional light, she was almost blinded by the number of candles the soldiers held up for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie asked for another goblet of warm water. She opened yet another one of her jars, sprinkled a fair amount of orange powder into the liquid, and then surprised the priest by handing it to him. \"Drink this. It will cure your cough,\" she told him. \"I can tel it pains you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest was speechless. Her consideration astonished him. He took a fair gulp, then grimaced. \"Drink every bit of it, Father,\" Jamie ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a child, he balked for a minute, then did as she ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie turned her attention to Angus\u0027s chest injury. She worked well into the night. The wound was crusted with dirt and dried blood. Jamie was meticulous in her task, for she knew from past experience, and from her mother\u0027s instructions, the terrible damage a single fleck of dirt could do if left inside the wound. She didn\u0027t understand the reason behind this truth but believed it to be fact all the same. Since the wound was ragged, she used needle and thread to sew the edges together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had ordered a bed carried into the great hall . He knew Jamie would wish to have her patient nearby, and Angus\u0027s cottage was a good distance away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus\u0027s wife hadn\u0027t spoken another word during the long night. She hadn\u0027t moved from her position across from Jamie and watched her every move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie barely paid her any attention. She\u0027d been bent over the warrior for such a long time that when she finally straightened away from the table, pain rushed up her spine, startling a gasp out of her. She stumbled backwards. Before she could regain her balance, she felt at least a dozen hands on her back bracing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elizabeth, please help me bandage your husband\u0027s chest,\" she asked, thinking to include the worried-looking woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth was eager to assist. As soon as the task was done, Alec carried his friend over to the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie and Elizabeth followed behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be spitting mad with pain when he wakes up,\" Jamie predicted. \"You\u0027re going to have a bear on your hands, Elizabeth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he will wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a smile in Elizabeth\u0027s voice. \"Aye, he will wake up,\" Jamie confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let Elizabeth tuck the covers around her husband\u0027s shoulders before she asked, \"Where did Edith and Annie go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to their cottage to sleep,\" Elizabeth answered. She brushed her hand across Angus\u0027s brow in a gentle, loving action that told how very much she cared for her husband. \"I\u0027m to wake them when Angus… when he dies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie gave Alec a perplexed look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Murdock started snoring, drawing everyone\u0027s attention. The old priest was sprawled in a chair he\u0027d pul ed up next to the table. \"Oh, dear,\" Jamie said. \"I forgot to tel him the potion would make him sleepy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can sleep there,\" Alec announced. He turned to Angus\u0027s wife and said, \"Elizabeth, go and get some rest. Gavin and I will take turns sitting with your husband until you return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the crestfal en look on Elizabeth\u0027s face, Jamie could tel she didn\u0027t want to leave her husband. Yet she immediately nodded and started for the door. Jamie assumed that obedience to her laird overrode all other considerations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec, if you were ill , I certainly wouldn\u0027t leave your side. Why can\u0027t Elizabeth sleep here? She could rest in a chair or perhaps use one of the rooms above the stairs, don\u0027t you suppose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth whirled around. \"I would be most comfortable,\" she interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec looked from one woman to the other, then nodded. \"Go and gather your things,\" he said. \"You\u0027l sleep in one of the rooms upstairs, Elizabeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou must remember your condition. Angus will be angry if he wakes up and finds you exhausted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth made a formal curtsy. \"Thank you, milord,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marcus? Take Elizabeth to her cottage to get her things,\" Alec called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie stood next to the bed, watching Angus. Elizabeth walked over to her side, hesitated, then reached out to touch her hand. \"I would thank you, mistress,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t have to wake Edith and Annie,\" Jamie replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth smiled. \"No, I won\u0027t have to wake them.\" She started to turn away, then changed her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My son will carry his father\u0027s name when he arrives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When does this blessed event take place?\" Jamie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In six months\u0027 time. And if it\u0027s a girl…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shal name her after you, milady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie would have laughed if she\u0027d had the strength. She was so exhausted, though, she could only manage a smile. \"Did you hear her promise, Alec? Elizabeth doesn\u0027t seem to think Jamie is a man\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat think you of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth smiled at Alec, received his nod, and then said, \"Jamie? I thought your name was Jane, milady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec laughed for his wife. Elizabeth squeezed Jamie\u0027s hand to let her know she was jesting, then left the hall with Marcus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that man ever smile?\" Jamie asked Alec when they were once again alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marcus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, he doesn\u0027t, Jamie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He dislikes me immensely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, he does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie gave Alec a disgruntled look over his easy compliance, then mixed another potion that was known to chase fever away. She was walking back to the bed when she suddenly realized she hadn\u0027t looked at the lower half of Angus\u0027s body to see if there were other injuries needing her attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to let Alec do the looking while she kept her eyes closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There aren\u0027t any other injuries,\" Alec announced after he\u0027d done as Jamie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer relief was short-lived. When she opened her eyes, Alec was standing just a foot or so away, smiling down at her. \"You\u0027re blushing, wife. Answer me this question,\" he commanded in a soft, teasing voice. \"If there had been injury, what would you have done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Repaired it if possible,\" Jamie answered. \"And probably blushed all the while. You must remember, Alec, I\u0027m a mere woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for him to contradict her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, you are that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he was looking at her made her blush intensify. Whatever was the matter with him? He acted as though he wanted to say something more to her, yet couldn\u0027t make up his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I back to looking ugly, husband? I know I must look a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were never ugly,\" Alec answered. He brushed a lock of her hair back over her shoulder. The tender action sent a shiver down her arms. \"But you do look a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know how to take that remark. He was smiling at her, so she guessed he hadn\u0027t just insulted her. Or had he? The man did have an odd sense of what was amusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe longer he continued to stare at her, the more nervous she became. \"Here, make Angus drink this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thrust the goblet into his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the last several hours you\u0027ve snapped out orders like a commander on a field of battle, Jamie. Now you act shy with me. What has caused this change?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" Jamie replied. \"You make me shy when you stare at me like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Tis good to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it certainly is not good to know,\" Jamie muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snatched the goblet out of his hands, hurried over to Angus\u0027s side, and nagged her patient into drinking the full portion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to wear my plaid,\" Alec said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to wear my colors, wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you belong to me now,\" Alec patiently explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027l wear your plaid when my heart wants to belong to you, Kincaid, and not a minute sooner. What think you of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could order you to—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec smiled. His gentle little wife was beginning to understand him, after all . But he was also learning just how her mind worked. The foolish woman didn\u0027t realize her heart had already softened toward him. Stil , he wanted her to admit it. \"Did you mean what you said to Elizabeth? Would you have stayed by my side if I\u0027d been wounded?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t even look over her shoulder when she added, \"You can rid yourself of that cocky smile, husband. Any wife would stay by her husband. It\u0027s her duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you would always do your duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will give you two weeks to make up your mind, Jamie, but you will eventual y wear my plaid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he watched Jamie, the truth nudged a rather contradictory admission from him. He actually wanted her to care for him. He wanted her to love him. He was, however, quite determined not to love her. His reason was simple: a warrior did not love his wife; he owned her. There was good reason for this, of course: love complicated a relationship. It could also undermine the duties of a laird. No, he could never love Jamie. But he\u0027d be damned if she didn\u0027t start to love him soon. \"Two weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t need that reminder. \"You are very arrogant, husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Tis good of you to notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec left the hall before she could stifle her laughter enough to bait him again. His soldiers would be waiting in the courtyard and the bailey below, wishing to hear how their friend was doing. Several hundred men were keeping Angus\u0027s deathwatch. They wouldn\u0027t take to their pal ets until they\u0027d come inside to see their friend. It was their right, and Alec wouldn\u0027t deny them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus was just waking up from his drug-induced sleep when Jamie was closing her eyes. She knelt on the floor, her feet tucked under the hem of her robe. Her long hair was spread like a blanket across her back. Angus groaned when he tried to move his throbbing arm. He wanted to rub the sting away, yet when he tried to move his other hand, he felt someone take hold of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes and immediately saw the woman. Her head rested next to his thigh. Her eyes were closed. He didn\u0027t know how he knew, but he was certain her eyes were violet, clear, enchanting violet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus thought she was asleep, yet when he tried to pul his hand away from her grasp, she wouldn\u0027t let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers began to file into the hall then, drawing his attention. His friends were all smiling at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus tried to return their greeting. He was in pain, aye, but their smiles told him he was not dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps, he thought, the last rites he\u0027d overheard were for someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec, with Gavin at his side, stood near the entrance, waiting. Alec stared at his wife, but Gavin watched the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a magical moment, by Gavin\u0027s reckoning. The soldiers looked stunned by the sight they witnessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne and all knew Lady Kincaid had saved their friend from certain death. Angus\u0027s weak smile confirmed the miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall could only hold a third of their number, yet when the first man knelt down and bowed his head, the others followed his lead, until even the soldiers outside were kneeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a united show of loyalty, Alec knew, but it wasn\u0027t for Angus that the soldiers knelt. No, Angus was their equal. They wouldn\u0027t kneel before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers were now giving Lady Kincaid their loyalty, their complete trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his wife slept through their silent pledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I boasted it would take her a long time to earn their trust,\" Gavin told Alec. \"I was wrong. It has taken her less than one day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus, with his sister Edith, walked into the hall just as the last of the soldiers filed past. They waited by Gavin\u0027s side, until Elizabeth, holding on to Annie\u0027s hand, caught up with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you see, Annie? I told you Angus was better. Look how he\u0027s smiling.\" Elizabeth whispered her happy news, then dropped Annie\u0027s hand to rush forward to her husband\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady Kincaid saved Angus,\" Gavin told Marcus.\" \u0027Tis a time for joy, my friend, not anger. Why do you frown so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angus would have made it with or without Lady Kincaid\u0027s assistance. It was God\u0027s decision, not hers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe harshness in his tone turned Alec\u0027s attention to him. \"You do not accept my wife, Marcus?\" he asked, his voice deceptively mild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior immediately shook his head. \"I accept her because she\u0027s your wife, Alec, and I would protect her with my life,\" he added. \"But she won\u0027t win my loyalty so easily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna and Edith stood by Marcus\u0027s side, mimicking his frown as they listened to the conversation. Alec looked at each one, then spoke again. \"Al of you will make her welcome. Do you understand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women immediately nodded their compliance. Marcus took a bit longer to agree. \"Have you forgotten our Helena so soon, Alec?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been almost three years,\" Gavin interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t forgotten,\" Alec announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I married to please my king, Marcus, and you damn well know it. Before you turn your back on my wife, remember this, all of you. Jamie also married by command from her king. She didn\u0027t want this marriage any more than I did. Honor her for doing her duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She really didn\u0027t wish to marry you?\" Annie asked. Her brown eyes mirrored her surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec shook his head. \"The only reason I discuss such matters with you, Annie, is because of your sister, Helena. Jamie was pledged to another man. Why would she want to marry me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The English dislike us as much as we dislike them,\" Gavin interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wife doesn\u0027t know how fortunate she is,\" Annie shyly interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec smiled at the sincerity in Annie\u0027s voice. He left the three staring after him as he walked over to his sleeping wife and gently lifted her into his arms. He held her close against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin followed behind, thinking to take over the watch by Angus\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder, Alec, how long it\u0027s going to take your wife to accept us?\" he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Little time at all ,\" Alec predicted. He started toward his bed, then called over his shoulder, \"She\u0027ll settle in, Gavin. You\u0027l see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eleven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started three wars the first week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie\u0027s intentions were quite honorable.
