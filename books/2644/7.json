{"id":103535,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003eAnnal¨ªa had awakened before dawn to wretched memories of her deeds the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d known several unsavory things about her character. She\u0027d realized flaws in her morality - apparently inherent flaws. Now she knew another fact: In the presence of whisky, the simple application of a man\u0027s lips to her own, and then to her chest, induced her to lose her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this morning she would have to ask that Philistine for his help in front of his hulking...associates. She would force herself to do it, even though she knew that if he did decide to help her, he would first make her...grovel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut by no means did she count on his assistance. Before the sun had risen, she\u0027d dragged Vitale from bed and instructed him to have Iambe ready. She was due at Pascal\u0027s today, and if she couldn\u0027t persuade the Highlander to help her, then she was gone. She\u0027d left her travel bags in the stable, confident that if she needed to leave in a hurry, she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet Vitale had quarreled with her over her plan because he didn\u0027t want her to leave under any circumstances, whether she could sway the mercenaries or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven lusty old Vitale feared what a monster like Pascal would do to her on their wedding night. She wasn\u0027t as nervous as she had been, though. She quite liked kissing, and that had been with a ruffian she loathed. The rumors had it that Pascal was very meticulous about his dress and cleanliness, so truly, how much worse could it be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d returned to her room before the Highlanders had risen and had taken extra care with her hair and dress. Now that she heard them milling about, she descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she approached the parlor, she had to bite her tongue to keep from screeching at their boots on the table, at the smell of tobacco cloying inside the room, at the food they\u0027d already rooted through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMare de D¨¦u! There were empty bottles of wine everywhere. She glanced around, eyes wide. Had more Highlanders come in the night? No, just the six of them had run through the abundant supply in the sideboard and raided their collection in the cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey saw her then, and she forced a smile to her face. \"Good morning, gentlemen,\" she said, pleasantly enough. When they stood and seemed as if they might approach her, no doubt to touch her hands again, she backed to the doorway and pressed her palms against the molding behind her. \"I trust you slept well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye. Thank you for your hospitality.\" She thought that one was Niall. They\u0027d introduced themselves last night, but all their names had sounded the same, alike in their oddness and unfamiliarity. More ridiculous, every surname began with Mac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should we no\u0027 cut through the chatter and get to what you wanted to ask me?\" MacCarrick muttered. He appeared exhausted, his eyes bloodshot again, and when she\u0027d walked in he\u0027d been rubbing his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brittle smile. \"Of course, Mr. MacCarrick. Your directness is always...refreshing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his eyebrows. \"Refreshing, is it now? How did you put it before? Aye, I remember. You said my people lacked delicacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel herself blushing. These mercenaries looked embarrassed for her. She hated this man. Hated him. But she would do whatever it took to help Aleix. Remember that, Annal¨ªa. \"I would like to hire you to help me and my family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked, clearly relishing her discomfiture. \"And just what would you have us do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a private and mistrustful person by nature, and above all else she was proud, but she would have to overcome these traits for they didn\u0027t serve her now. \"M-My brother, Aleixandre Llorente, has been captured by Pascal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scanned the room to see their reactions. The youngest one was about to say something, but then there was a sound under the table, as if he\u0027d been kicked. He shut his mouth. What had he been about to tell her? Did he know something?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacCarrick insolently waved her on, and with effort she continued, \"He is the only family I have left, and he is in Pascal\u0027s jail. I would pay to have him freed. I would pay more than Pascal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacCarrick asked, \"Why would you think he\u0027s still alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the blood leaving her face at the thought of Aleix dead, and to her shame her eyes watered. She found herself twining her fingers in front of her, then forced her hands to her sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older man hissed something to MacCarrick in a foreign language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacCarrick shot him a look and snapped, \"It\u0027s a valid question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know how to handle these people. She\u0027d been taught a perfect stitch and elegant table manners, but no one had instructed her on how to negotiate with ruthless men. Her idea of trying to manipulate MacCarrick with a kiss last night had been laughably far off the mark, but if she was as everyone thought, then why hadn\u0027t it worked? \"He will be alive because he has value to Pascal. The people here love him and would do anything for him. The general will use that as leverage over them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does he need leverage over them, when he\u0027s already terrorized them into submission?\" MacCarrick asked as he leaned back in his seat. He sounded gloating about the fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He terrorized them? Or his lackeys terrorized them?\" She regretted her words the second she said them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced around to the men with his eyebrows raised as if she\u0027d just proven some theory, then his lips curled into a mean, mocking smirk. \"Run along, Annal¨ªa. We\u0027ll be here for only a few days more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis cretin was ordering her in her own home, and yet she pleaded, \"But I will pay you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have coin on the property?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I have jewelry. Priceless jewelry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a patronizing expression. \"And where could we sell that around here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then my fortune. If you free Aleix, he can get it for you. I\u0027ll give it freely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Canna imagine your \u0027fortune\u0027 would be the kind of money we usually command.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because your imagination is limited!\" When the man called Niall and two others chuckled, she again commanded herself to bite her tongue. \"Take anything you like in this house, anything! I\u0027m sure you could find your pay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything, then?\" he asked with a strange expression. Niall shook his hung head, then rose to leave. The four followed him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill she nodded eagerly. \"Just name your price, Mr. MacCarrick. I will gladly pay it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it\u0027s settled.\" He looked her over shamelessly. \"I want you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"P-Pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard me. I can sense desperation and you\u0027re there. You were willing to kiss me last night to sway me to your cause, and I\u0027ll bet you\u0027re willing to do more than that. Why no\u0027 do it with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes went wide. Hate you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will free him, but before I do, I\u0027ll get to enjoy you,\" he said, his tone smug. \"Those are my terms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit out each word when she said, \"There is material wealth here that could satisfy even you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean \u0027someone such as me.\u0027 Forget it, then.\" He unfolded a dated newspaper, shook it out to read, then kicked his boots up on the table. \"I\u0027ll no\u0027 work for you for anything less than you,\" he said behind the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brows drew together in bewilderment. Those were Aleix\u0027s boots, stolen. And they were carelessly propped on her table. Hers and Aleix\u0027s table. She and her brother, who was more like a father to her, had breakfast there each morning and talked about the ranch. Aleix was gone. No one would help her and she didn\u0027t understand why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other men returned and sat. She dimly noted that they appeared angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe realization struck her that for the first time in her life she truly needed help and had asked for it, and no one would give it to her. For the first time in her life she\u0027d been...vilely propositioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he continued reading, ignoring her, MacCarrick crossed his ankles, and a bottle by his feet drew her attention. She recognized that particular wine because it had been bottled the year of Aleix\u0027s marriage to his beloved Mariette and had been stored with great care. They had saved it to toast the birth of their first baby. The wine never, never should have been drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it sat on the table, opened and nearly full, forgotten among the refuse they\u0027d scattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to move, and frowned because she had little idea of what she was doing. She watched her feet advancing her toward MacCarrick, and perceived her hand closing hard around the bottleneck just before she raised it high and poured the wine on his head. The growling noise in his throat was getting louder and louder, and still, when the bottle was empty, she dropped it, hitting his thick skull. She thought he bellowed, thought someone might be restraining him. She said in Catalan to no one in particular that the wine had had meaning for her and that they could all go to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grandfather clock struck eight. She plucked up her skirt and waltzed from the room. She grabbed her gloves at the table by the door, then strolled to meet Vitale in the stable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to go riding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacTiernay and Niall wouldn\u0027t release him until they saw through the window that she was riding away. Court had been so shocked, he\u0027d hardly comprehended what she was doing. Then, when he\u0027d lunged for her, MacTiernay snagged him as Niall caught his other arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged them loose and whipped his drenched head around to find Niall glowering at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again. What the hell is wrong with you, Court?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With me? Did you no\u0027 just see the most arrogant woman ever to live pour a bottle over me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You deserved it, every drop of it. Talking to her that way after she asked us for help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin added, \"And turning her down? Granted, we doona go about doin\u0027 good deeds, but there\u0027s wealth here like I\u0027ve never seen. She could pay us just as well as anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt wiped his sleeve over his face. \"In case you dinna realize this, she never asked for anything, and in case you dinna understand, she just told us all to go to hell.\" He shook his hair out and wine splattered everywhere. \"Still, I was going to help her. Niall, you ken that I would. I would have before this. I only wanted to bait her a bit. Just for a day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiall\u0027s expression was incredulous. \"I\u0027ve seen you happily snap necks and slit throats, but I\u0027ve never seen you be callous to someone who is weaker than you and in such a vulnerable position. Her only family is in that bastard\u0027s cell, and you would use that over her? To bait her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt ran his hand over the new knot on his head. \"God damn it, I said I\u0027d get him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye. Because you\u0027re the one who put him there.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1/page-7.html","bookId":2644,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM"}
