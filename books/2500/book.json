Delhi\u0027s civilized veneer crumbles along with its walls. Foreigners, which the vampire Saint-Germain-here called Sanat Ji Mani-surely is, lose their positions, homes, wealth, and sometimes their lives, if they cannot escape the falling city. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBefore he can flee Delhi, Sanat Ji Mani must ensure the safety of Avasa Dani, his beautiful ward, who has been abandoned by her husband. Sanat Ji Mani\u0027s love has awakened Avasa Dani\u0027s every sense; even she will become a vampire upon her death, but she finds no terror in this fate. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAvasa Dani and Rojire, Sanat Ji Mani\u0027s servant, successfully make their way out of Delhi, but Sanat Ji Mani himself is trapped. His life is bought by his skills with medicine, but, at Timur\u0027s command, he must travel-by day, and exposed to the sun-with the conqueror\u0027s army. Crippled and unable to escape, he knows that his vampire nature will soon be revealed, and then... \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAvasa Dani, with a worried Rojire at her side, considers her options as a woman without a visible male protector in a land and time ruled by men. While one of Sanat Ji Mani\u0027s allies searches desperately for the missing vampire, Saint-Germain and a young acrobat, with whom he has escaped from Timur\u0027s forces, make their slow and painful way to freedom. The journey changes them both forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-feast-in-exile-saint-germain-14.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-feast-in-exile-saint-germain-14.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:56:49 PM"}
