DEAN LOSES HIS PARTNER.","content":"\u0026nbsp;When the two partners returned to the hotel with the proceeds of the entertainment in their pockets, they were in high spirits. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I feel as rich as Vanderbilt,\" said Montgomery in exultation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And I feel like an Astor or a Gould,\" chimed in Dean. \"Peter Kirby did me a good turn when he discharged me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dean, you are star! I had no idea of your talent.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t flatter me, Mr. Montgomery,\" said Dean blushing. \"You will make me self-conceited. I was lucky in falling in with you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well said, my boy! I see you don\u0027t grudge me my share of the credit. We will keep on, will we not?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"As long as there is any money in it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Precisely. Your hand on that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 163\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In pursuance of this agreement, three evenings later they gave an entertainment in the town of Cameron, twenty miles away. Circumstances were not as favorable, but they divided twenty dollars net profits.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We mustn\u0027t complain of that, Dean,\" said his companion. \"It isn\u0027t as much, to be sure, as we made at Granville.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But it seems to me ridiculously large for the little I did, Mr. Montgomery.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are modest, Dean. That is not artistic. You must set a proper value on your talent.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think I do,\" said Dean, smiling. \"I feel very much like a humbug, Mr. Montgomery. A young lady came up to me last evening and asked me if I had played before any of the crowned heads of Europe, and if I were personally acquainted with Queen Victoria.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope you told her you were.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, Mr. Montgomery, I shouldn\u0027t be willing to tell such a falsehood.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All business, my dear boy, all business! We must blow our own trumpets if we want to be appreciated. By the way, what did you tell her?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That I had not yet played before the queen, but should I go to England, and could arrange to do so, I would.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 164\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very good! You kept up appearances. What did she say?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She asked me if I would get her Queen Victoria\u0027s autograph, in that case. She also asked me for my own. I promised her the queen\u0027s if I were able to obtain it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Didn\u0027t she ask for my autograph?\" asked Mr. Montgomery, with a twinge of professional jealousy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She said she was going to ask you for it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall be glad to gratify her,\" said Montgomery, condescendingly. \"I am often asked for an autograph.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That was my first application,\" said Dean smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are not as old as I. Long before you are, your autograph will be in demand.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For three weeks the combination continued to give entertainments, arranging from two to three a week. They did not again meet with the success which had greeted them at Granville, but in almost every case they made expenses, and a fair sum besides. At the end of this time, each of the partners found himself possessed of about forty dollars.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the close of a concert at a small town in Missouri, on returning to the hotel, Mr. Montgomery chanced to take up a copy of the New York Herald165 in the office. He ran over the advertisements on the first page, including the \"Personals,\" when all at once his color changed, and he looked agitated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s the matter, Mr. Montgomery?\" asked Dean.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Bad news, my boy!\" said the actor sadly. \"Look at that!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean read the following among the personals:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n CECIL MONTGOMERY, Jr. Come home at once! Your mother is very sick.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My poor old mother!\" said the actor feelingly. \"She may be dead by this time. Why couldn\u0027t I have seen this notice before?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is the date of the paper?\" asked Dean.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is five days old.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose you will go at once.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, I must. I never would forgive myself if I did not hurry home on the chance of seeing the dear old mother once more.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are right, Mr. Montgomery. I would do the same if I were fortunate enough to have a mother living.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course that ends our partnership for the present. Will you go home with me, Dean?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean shook his head.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I have nothing to go home to. It would166 take all my money, and there would be nothing for me to do in Waterford.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you can\u0027t give entertainments alone.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can make my living somehow. I have forty dollars, and that would last me some time even if I got nothing to do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Dean bade his companion good-bye at the station the next morning, and turned away, a forlorn feeling came over him, and he felt tempted to take the next train East himself. But the thought of going back to Waterford as poor as he started, and with no prospect of employment, braced him up, and he resolved to push on westward and take his chances. He returned to the hotel, and sat down to consider his plans.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There a pleasant surprise awaited him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s a gentleman to see you, Mr. Dunham,\" said the clerk.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where is he?\" asked Dean.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He went out to make a call in the village but will be back in fifteen minutes. This is his card.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean took the card in his hand, and read the name\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Samuel Gunnison.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Any acquaintance of yours?\" asked the clerk.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; I never heard the name.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 167\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think he wants you to play to-morrow evening. He lives in the next town, Carterville.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Montgomery has been called East. I am afraid this will stop our entertainments.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He did not ask for Mr. Montgomery, only for you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Gunnison soon came in. He was a slender, dark complexioned man, with a pleasant face.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I know you are Dean Dunham,\" he said, extending his hand, \"for I heard you play last evening. Are you engaged for to-morrow?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I should like to engage your services. An entertainment is to be given in our town hall for the benefit of our town library. For the most part local talent is employed. We are to have a short play, and a few songs. I, as manager, have thought it would help us if we could advertise you in connection with the home attractions.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall be glad to make an engagement,\" said Dean pleasantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What would be your terms?\" asked Mr. Gunnison a little anxiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How much can you afford to pay me?\" asked Dean.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We would not think of offering a player of your reputation less than ten dollars if it were not desirable168 to make expenses as small as possible, but——\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Under the circumstances,\" said Dean, interrupting him, \"I will be willing to come for five.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you, Mr. Dunham. You are very kind,\" said Mr. Gunnison, warmly, grasping our hero by the hand. \"I will try to make it up to you. Instead of going to the hotel you shall be my guest, and your expenses will be nothing. If you are ready I will take you over at once. I have a buggy at the door.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you, sir, I will accept your kind invitation.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So Dean, feeling less lonesome than he did, secured his valise, and taking a seat beside his new friend, rode in the direction of Carterville. He was destined to meet an old acquaintance there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81490.html","bookId":428,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:28:29 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:28:29 AM"}
