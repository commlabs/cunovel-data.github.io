Once we fully understood what you and Tehol were doing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where?’ Bugg asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Should I tell you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re not going after it,’ Tehol said. ‘Right, Bugg?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course not. I just want to be sure it’s, uh, far enough removed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRucket’s eyes narrowed. ‘Are you that close?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither man replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at the plate for a moment, then settled back like a human canal lock, her belly re-emerging from the shadows in silky waves. ‘Very well, gentlemen. South Pilott. Far enough away, Bugg?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That answer makes me nervous.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am about to default on everything 1 owe,’ Bugg said. ‘This will cause a massive financial cascade that will not spare a single sector of industry, and not just here in Letheras, but across the entire empire and beyond. Once I do it, there will be chaos. Anarchy. People may actually die.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Bugg’s Construction is that big?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not at all. If it was, we’d have been rounded up long ago. No, there are about two thousand seemingly independent small-and middling-sized holdings, each one perfectly positioned according to Tehol’s diabolical planning to ensure that dread cascade. Bugg’s Construction is but the first gravestone to tip-and it’s a very crowded cemetery.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your analogy makes me even more nervous.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your glamour fades a touch when you’re nervous,’ Tehol observed. ‘Please, regain your confidence, Rucket.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Shut your mouth, Tehol.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In any case,’ Bugg resumed, ‘this meeting was to deliver to you and the Guild the final warning before the collapse. Needless to say, I will be hard to track down once it happens.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes settled on Tehol. ‘And you, Tehol? Planning on crawling into a hole as well?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I thought we weren’t talking about that any more.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘By the Abyss, Master,’ Bugg muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol blinked, first at Bugg, then at Rucket. Then, ‘Oh, Sorry. You meant, um, was I planning on going into hiding, right? Well, I’m undecided. Part of the satisfaction, you see, is in witnessing the mess. Because, regardless of how we’ve insinuated ourselves in the machinery of Lether’s vast commerce, the most bitter truth is that the causes behind this impending chaos are in fact systemic. Granted, we’re hastening things somewhat, but dissolution-in its truest sense-is an integral flaw in the system itself. It may well view itself as immortal, eminently adaptable and all that, but that’s all both illusional and delusional. Resources are never infinite, though they might seem that way. And those resources include more than just the raw product of earth and sea. They also include labour, and the manifest conceit of a monetary system with its arbitrary notions of value-the two forces we set our sights on, by the way. Shipping out the lowest classes-the dispossessed-to pressure the infrastructure, and then stripping away hard currency to escalate a recession-why are you two staring at me like that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRucket smiled. ‘Defaulting to the comfort of your scholarly analysis to deflect us from your more pathetic fixations. That, Tehol Beddict, is perhaps the lowest you have gone yet.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But we’ve just begun.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You may wish to believe that to be the case. For myself, my own curiosity is fast diminishing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But think of all the challenges in store for us, Rucket!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe surged to her feet. ‘I’m going out the back way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You won’t fit.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Alas, Tehol, the same will never be said of you. Good day, gentlemen.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wait!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Tehol?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, uh, I trust this conversation will resume at a later date?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m not hanging around for that,’ Bugg said, crossing his brawny arms in a show of… something. Disgust, maybe. Or, Tehol reconsidered, more likely abject envy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nothing is certain,’ Rucket told him. ‘Barring the truth that men are wont to get lost in their illusions of grandeur.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh,’ murmured Bugg, ‘very nice, Rucket.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If that hadn’t left me speechless,’ Tehol said as she rolled away, ‘I’d have said something.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have no doubt of that, Master.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your faith is a relief, Bugg.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Small comfort in comparison, I’d wager.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-237.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
