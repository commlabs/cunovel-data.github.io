Her head spun as he displayed and then described each item. When he was finished, they were given a price list. Charlotte studied it and gasped aloud. But, my goodness, it all looked so delicious. She made a mental note to tell Justine every detail she could remember. Her granddaughter would want to know about this. After the elaborate presentation, she ordered the grilled swordfish and both men ordered steaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meal was superb and so was the service. The conversation, too, was enjoyable. David had an engaging manner and did most of the talking. He chatted about the weather and recent movies and how he planned to go to Vegas for Christmas. Ben remained stubbornly quiet, as he had before; it was up to Charlotte to respond to his son’s questions and remarks. The one irritation was David’s cell phone, which rang four times during the course of their meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the fourth call, Ben snapped, “Turn that damn thing off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry.” David did look apologetic as he reached for his cell and pushed a button. The telephone sang a brief song and then went silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte breathed a sigh of relief and smiled at the waiter who brought coffee to their table with several varieties of sugar from which to choose. Charlotte was quite taken with the hard candy sticks that looked like something out of a confectionary store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver coffee, David grew quiet. “You might’ve guessed why I wanted to meet with you, Dad,” he said as he stirred in the cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“David, if this is about money—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad, I’m in a tight spot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t or won’t?” David asked with barely suppressed anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen’s shoulders heaved as if he’d inhaled sharply in an effort to control his own annoyance. “Since you put it like that, the answer is won’t. I refuse to give you another dime. You haven’t paid back the last two loans. I’d be a fool to give you more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m good for it. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what you said last time and the time before that. Why should I believe you now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because it’s true. Dad, do you think it’s easy, coming to you like this? Do you think I’d do this if I had any other options?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed about to say more but Charlotte could see that his arguments increased Ben’s irritation. “How much do you need?” she asked. She didn’t mean to intrude, but if it was a reasonable amount then perhaps Ben wouldn’t mind so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five thousand,” he said after a moment. “That’s considerably less than I needed before,” he added with a hopeful expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you need it for?” Charlotte asked, wanting to help and not knowing how. Her questions didn’t please Ben, she could see that, but she felt badly for the young man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid shrugged. “It’s complicated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The usual, no doubt,” Ben cut in. “His credit cards are maxed out, he hasn’t paid his taxes and he’s paying alimony for two ex-wives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m getting a bonus this Christmas,” David said. “I only need the money for a couple of months, just to carry me through. You know I wouldn’t ask if I wasn’t desperate. I’m telling you, Dad, money pressures are the worst. I can’t sleep nights. I can hardly eat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You certainly didn’t have a problem tonight,” Ben pointed out. David had obviously enjoyed his meal, and Charlotte was glad of that after seeing those prices. Fifty years ago, she could’ve fed her family for a week for the price of a single steak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid looked hurt. “This is the first decent meal I’ve had in ages. You have to know how difficult this is for me. There’s no one else I can ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure it’s painful to ask for a loan,” Charlotte said sympathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid thanked her for her understanding with a smile. “I swear to you, Dad, I’ll pay you back. I don’t know what’ll happen if you turn me down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How old are you now?” Ben asked his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid straightened slightly. “Forty-three.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really,” Charlotte said conversationally. “I would’ve guessed much younger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid ignored her, holding his father’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forty-three is old enough to stand on your own two feet and stop expecting someone else to bail you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid’s shoulders slumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte felt dreadful for him, but she couldn’t advise Ben when it came to dealing with his own child. She reached for Ben’s hand under the table and he gripped it hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you the last time that I’m not lending you another dime, and I’m sticking to that. I have to, David. I’m sorry you’re experiencing financial troubles, but apparently you didn’t learn your lesson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re telling me no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am. Save your breath, because no amount of talking will change my mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid didn’t argue, didn’t get upset, but nodded as if he understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So far, all I’ve taught you is to come to me when you have money problems and that isn’t healthy for either of us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I agree,” David said reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You pay me back what you owe from the first two loans, and then we’ll discuss future possibilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid pinched his lips together and nodded again. Pushing out his chair, he stood. “If you’ll excuse me, I’d better get back to my hotel. Thank you for the pleasant dinner. Charlotte, I think the smartest thing my father’s done in the last fifteen years was marrying you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte blushed with pleasure. “Thank you, David.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bowed slightly and walked out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his exit, the waiter walked over to the table and promptly delivered the bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHome from work early because of her doctor’s appointment, Cecilia Randall sat in front of her computer in the spare bedroom and logged on. She treasured every e-mail Ian sent, and when there wasn’t one waiting for her at the end of the day, she immediately felt discouraged. To her delight, there were two messages. She clicked her mouse on the first, but before the computer brought it up on screen the phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia glanced over her shoulder, willing it to be silent. It was probably Cathy, wanting to hear how her appointment had gone. Everything was wonderful, and she had exciting news to share with Ian. She couldn’t tell Cathy before she told her husband. By rights, he should hear first. If she picked up the phone and Cathy was on the line, Cecilia knew she wouldn’t be able to keep the information to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the third ring, she couldn’t stand it any longer and ran into the kitchen to grab the phone before the answering machine kicked in. “Hello,” she said breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cecilia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ian?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, baby, I’m so glad you’re home. You wouldn’t believe what I went through to make this call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ian, oh, Ian, it’s so good to hear your voice.” Tears filled her eyes. She loved her husband and missed him terribly. Every time he went to sea it was the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me about the doctor’s visit,” Ian demanded, worry in his voice. “It was this afternoon, wasn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes, and everything went really well.” She was nearly bursting with what she’d learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They did the ultrasound?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everything’s all right with the baby?” He sounded afraid, and she didn’t blame him. If they’d had more than one ultrasound with Allison, the doctors would’ve discovered her heart condition before the birth. “Did the ultrasound show anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned against the kitchen wall, almost giddy with happiness. “It did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan gasped as if this was his biggest fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ian, Ian, it isn’t anything like that. Oh, Ian, we’re going to have a son!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The technician had a good view this time, and she showed me his little penis. We’re having a son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband was silent for half a second and then let out a yelp that must’ve echoed a hundred miles. Cecilia was sure everyone on the aircraft carrier had heard him. She understood; it was the proof he needed that this pregnancy was different from their first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia laughed with joy. They’d been told this second baby was likely a girl and that had only added to her husband’s fears. As Ian had said over and over, everything was the same as it had been with Allison. Cecilia was going to deliver another baby girl while he was away. Ian was so afraid for her, for them both. If they lost another baby…Cecilia couldn’t allow her mind to go down those dark paths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re sure about the baby being a boy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what I saw.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you feeling?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wonderful. Ecstatic. And very much in love with my husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you, Cecilia.” His voice lowered with the weight of his emotion. “I think of you day and night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Working isn’t too much for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not at all.” Ian was such a worrier. But this job was vital to her. Without it, she’d sit at home all day with nothing to do. Using her accounting skills and providing a portion of their income weren’t the only reasons Cecilia chose to be employed. “Mr. Cox is so thoughtful and Allison’s coming in to the office every day after school.” Ian already knew this but she told him again. She made sure her e-mails were full of news about her everyday life. That seemed to reassure him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, yes. Allison Cox,” Ian said, sighing deeply. “You’re concerned about her, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She has that new boyfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you don’t like him,” Ian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I don’t really know him, so I can’t dislike him, but he worries me. Did I tell you his name is Anson? What kind of name is that, anyway? He’s not the boy for Allison. He’s one of those Goth kids, dresses totally in black and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan interrupted her. “Your father said I wasn’t the right man for you, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the mention of her father, Cecilia rolled her eyes. She’d come to Cedar Cove four years earlier in an effort to get to know her father. Her parents had divorced when she was ten, and her memories of him were vague and mingled with her mother’s bitterness. Cecilia wanted to form her own impressions of him. He’d seemed eager to know her, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia’s mother had warned her against having any expectations when it came to Bobby Merrick, but this was something she had to learn on her own. It hadn’t taken her long to discover that her father was unreliable and irresponsible. When Cecilia lost her baby, his idea of comforting her was a sympathy card sent through the mail. He was sorry for her loss, he’d written. But not once had he come to see his daughter in the hospital. Not once had he offered to help her with the financial burden. He couldn’t even be bothered to attend Allison’s burial. The only thing her father had done for Cecilia was get her a job at The Captain’s Galley, where she’d met Ian. For that one small twist of fate, she would always be grateful. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/50-harbor-street-cedar-cove-5/page-10.html","bookId":1945,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:30 AM"}
