Not with what she spends on clothes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop talking about the Countess! As a special favor. Before you drive me maaaaaaaad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtercup looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you understand anything that’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtercup shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWestley shook his too. “You never have been the brightest, I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you love me, Westley? Is that it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t believe it. “Do I love you? My God, if your love were a grain of sand, mine would be a universe of beaches. If your love were—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t understand that first one yet,” Buttercup interrupted. She was starting to get very excited now. “Let me get this straight. Are you saying my love is the size of a grain of sand and yours is this other thing? Images just confuse me so—is this universal business of yours bigger than my sand? Help me, Westley. I have the feeling we’re on the verge of something just terribly important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have stayed these years in my hovel because of you. I have taught myself languages because of you. I have made my body strong because I thought you might be pleased by a strong body. I have lived my life with only the prayer that some sudden dawn you might glance in my direction. I have not known a moment in years when the sight of you did not send my heart careening against my rib cage. I have not known a night when your visage did not accompany me to sleep. There has not been a morning when you did not flutter behind my waking eyelids… Is any of this getting through to you, Buttercup, or do you want me to go on for a while?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There has not been—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re teasing me, Westley, I’m just going to kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can you even dream I might be teasing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you haven’t once said you loved me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all you need? Easy. I love you. Okay? Want it louder? I love you. Spell it out, should I? I ell-oh-vee-ee why-oh-you. Want it backward? You love I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are teasing now; aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little maybe; I’ve been saying it so long to you, you just wouldn’t listen. Every time you said ‘Farm Boy do this’ you thought I was answering ‘As you wish’ but that’s only because you were hearing wrong. ‘I love you’ was what it was, but you never heard, and you never heard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hear you now, and I promise you this: I will never love anyone else. Only Westley. Until I die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, took a step away. “I’ll send for you soon.

(Before then couples hooked thumbs.) And the precise rating of kisses is a terribly difficult thing, often leading to great controversy, because although everyone agrees with the formula of affection times purity times intensity times duration, no one has ever been completely satisfied with how much weight each element should receive. But on any system, there are five that everyone agrees deserve full marks. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-24.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
