Something must have come up,\" he surmised. \"Besides, I\u0027m sure he\u0027s just lonely. I\u0027ve never seen him at school, so he probably needs a friend,\" he said, stopping at the foot of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter; you have a friend already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not my boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Running around with him can lead to all sorts of mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know? You don\u0027t even know him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can just tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, because he has tattoos and wears black? You\u0027re judging Valentine, just like everyone judges you. Just because he has black fingernails doesn\u0027t mean he\u0027s a monster--that\u0027s how you\u0027ve defended yourself for years. And now look at you, behaving just like the town reacts to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy would\u0027ve had a point if Valentine wasn\u0027t a vampire. Even so, maybe my brother was right. Maybe Valentine was more like Alexander than Jagger. Maybe I was making assumptions that weren\u0027t fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The day you start listening to others is the day I start listening to you,\" he said, and stormed up the stairs to his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" my mom asked as I entered the kitchen to find her wiping off the countertop. \"I heard you two shouting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I replied, opening the refrigerator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One minute you\u0027re insisting we include your brother at dinner, the next you\u0027re yelling at each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought that was normal,\" I said, grabbing a soda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it is...,\" she admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed the refrigerator door. \"I have some news,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going to prom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother\u0027s face lit up as if I were a twenty-five-year-old woman announcing my engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations!\" she exclaimed, hugging me hard. \"We\u0027ll have to buy you a dress and shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not necessary,\" I said, twisting off the plastic bottlecap. \"I\u0027ll find something at the thrift store.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother wrinkled her nose. \"You\u0027ll be attending prom, not a nightclub. We\u0027ll get you something beautiful to wear that isn\u0027t torn, adorned with staples, or riddled with safety pins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s exactly what I was afraid of. I\u0027d finally seen Valentine--even if it was only for a moment through a telescope. As I tried to finish my language arts essay, my mind was distracted by the eleven-year-old vampire. I imagined what he wanted at the treehouse--a hidden treasure, Jagger\u0027s leftover blood supply, a place to lay his coffin? I also envisioned all the places he could be speeding off to on his skateboard--Dullsville\u0027s cemetery, a hidden sewer, or an abandoned church. And most important, I wondered when I\u0027d see him again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dance-with-a-vampire-vampire-kisses-4/page-6.html","bookId":2143,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:14 PM"}
