I protest that.\" I held up my glass of wine. \"What do you call this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis snorted, unconvinced, \"A smokescreen is what I call it. Or propaganda. Nope, just make that prop. That, Mr. Crow, is a stage prop. I\u0027d take a phony beard more seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed \"Okay. I give. Get to your point, O Great Fisherman without fish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath and, taking great care to pronounce each word clearly, said: \"Point is, Crow, that you\u0027re not- among the many things you\u0027re not-a serious drinker. You are a pretender.\" He broke off, relaxing, and nudged Lya with his shoulder. \"Didja notice how well I\u0027nunciated that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lovely,\" replied Lya gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed delighted. \"You really think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely, Lewis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled broadly. \"Wanna hear it again?\" That reminded me. \"Lewis! You are Lewis, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Course I am. Whadja think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, you\u0027re the same Lewis that runs this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Nobody runs this place that I know of.\" He paused, took a sip from his jug. \"I do, however, own this rock. Have for a long time.\" He turned again to Lya. \"Raised it from a pup. Boulder, to you. Yep,\" he continued, patting the turf fondly beside his leg, \"boulder first, then he became, uh...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bigger?\" Lya offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" he nodded. He eyed her with scrutiny. \"Hey, you know an awful lot about this sort of thing for a hussy. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Boulder. Then a bigger boulder-all easy so far. But next comes the toughie when he got to be an asteroid.\" He shook his head. \"Ugly, ugly, stage in life, let me tell you, is that adolescent asteroid period. No respect at all. No values.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But with a will of iron,\" broke in Lya, \"and the determination nation of a god...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis looked delighted. \"Golly, that\u0027s pretty! Oh, yeah. With iron will and the determination of a god, I...\" he paused, right index finger poised, \"I did it.\" Lya clapped her hands. \"Hooray! At last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The suspense was wrecking me,\" I remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smartass!\" sneered Lewis without rancor. \"Smartass pretender-drinker!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to Lya. \"Do I feel a challenge in the air? \" She smiled. \"Could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your hands off my air,\" growled Lewis, \"and accept, dammit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I get when I win?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"That\u0027s\u0027if you win, I believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. What do I get? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis reached for my cigarettes, lit one. \"Why, the fish, of course! What the hell else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head as if to clear it. \"I think I\u0027m having a relapse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No excuse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what have fish got to do with... We are talking about a drinking contest, aren\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are when you can keep up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what have fish got to do with that?\" He exhaled a long stream of smoke. \"Everything, Dummy. That\u0027s how you tell who won.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t just drink. Crow,\" he said impatiently. \"We drink and fish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the same time?\" Lya asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, yes. Drink till you catch one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been doing that without Jack,\" Lya pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True,\" Lewis admitted. \"But not fish-drinking. That was celebration-drinking. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you celebrating?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My last fish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long ago was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sneered at her. \"Hussy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up abruptly, swaying. He seemed confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" asked Lya, concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scratched his head. \"Can\u0027t remember... What was I about to do a bit ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many guesses?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis shook his head. \"No, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, challenge Jack?\" offered Lya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell about raising the planet?\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLya winked at me. \"How about stagger around dripping water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doing that,\" said he and I in unison and the three of us laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis cut short his laughter ahead of us with: \"Aha!\" \"Aha, what?\" prompted Lya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, pointed in the direction of Karen. \"Aha\u0027m gonna see what read this girl to the grave.\" And he stepped awkwardly over me toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to Lya, getting to my feet. \"Bout ready to go in?\" She nodded. I started to gather up the mess around us. Her hand on my arm stopped me. I looked at her and saw that the tightness had returned to her features. I was amazed at how temporary an effect all the laughter had had on her capacity to worry. I squatted down beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack...\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut her off. \"Lya, would you stop fretting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you will talk to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I would. And I will. Relax. Holly\u0027s a big boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Jack,\" she said, her eyes pleading, \"he\u0027s taking such a terrible risk!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, patted her arm. \"Well, he hasn\u0027t taken it yet.\" But he had. We heard Cortez\u0027s screams a second after that. He was bounding toward us across the meadow, slipping and sliding, falling once, waving his arms. We rushed to meet him. Through his panting and hysteria he managed to get out that Holly had been discovered lying unconscious on the laboratory floor, babbling incoherently. He was clutching some sort of plastic skullcap or something with all sorts of tubes and wires running out of it. Nobody had been able to pry his fingers loose from it. A seizure, the doctors had said. Catatonic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLya was already running back to the Dome before hearing all that Cortez had to spout. Karen, now wide awake, sprinted athletically after her. I gave it up after about a hundred meters. Damned bug still had a piece of me. I had to slow up to wait for Sanction to stop spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis appeared beside me, looking benignly helpful. \"Here you go. Jack,\" he said and offered a shoulder. He was a good crutch, in considerably better shape than most drunks I had seen. But even with his help, it seemed to take forever to cross the field, enter the Dome, and work our way down into the lab. All the time the thought kept streaking through my mind that Holly, with his genius fried, would now be nothing more than the timid lad he had at first seemed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we stepped through the seal, I heard Holly\u0027s voice. He was sitting up on the workbench, surrounded by nervous faces. I broke loose from Lewis and rushed ahead to see him. Hot damn! He was alive, anyway...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...no, really, really,\" he was saying to them. \"I\u0027m fine. A little weak, but...\" He noticed my stumbling approach. \"I\u0027m okay. Jack,\" be assured me with a smite that contained equal parts of shyness and pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still worried. \"I can see that. You look great, but...\" How to put the next question?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe anticipated me. \"It\u0027s still me. Jack.\" He turned to Lya, putting a weary arm around her shoulders. \"Really. It\u0027s still me. I\u0027m fine. Just a little tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor was reading a gauge off a medigrip attached to Holly\u0027s other arm. \"You\u0027re considerably more tired than that. Dr. You\u0027re near physical exhaustion.\" He pulled one of Holly\u0027s eyelids up with a thumb and scanned the pupil underneath. \"And emotionally drained as well. I\u0027d say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly nodded vaguely. \"Well, maybe a...\" he began before pitching forward into Lya\u0027s arms, out cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor was quickly reassuring. \"He\u0027s all right,\" he said to Lya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked about to faint herself. \"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor nodded, gestured toward his gauges. \"I\u0027m sure. Just worn out, like I said. He\u0027ll be all right with plenty of rest and care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll get that,\" asserted Cortez importantly. \"I\u0027ll see to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLya smiled at him. \"Thank you, Cortez. That\u0027s very sweet of you. Why don\u0027t you start right now.\" She nodded at Holly\u0027s still form, still crumpled between her and the tabletop. Cortez stepped to her side and the bunch of them managed him into a prone position. Lya stepped back. \"Thank you, everybody,\" she said to us, \"for showing such...\" She froze at the sight of something over my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all turned around. Lewis was still standing at the entrance of the seal. His face was hard as stone, his muscles drum tight. He was staring at the black scout suit which had been propped into a sitting position in a chair beside the workbench, wires and tubes streaming outward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLya took a step toward Lewis. \"Lewis? Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned slowly at the sound of her voice. He raised a trembling arm and pointed at the suit. \"What... is... that??\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a scout suit, Lewis. Holly\u0027s been using...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, that\u0027s... WAR SHIT!\" he shouted, livid with rage. \"What\u0027 sit doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Lewis,\" protested Lya meekly, clearly unnerved by the incredible transformation of personality, \"you knew this was a Fleet Proj...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you were in Fleet! I didn\u0027t know you were Fleet, godammit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and stared at us, fury and disgust rippling his features into a fist. Then he walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody moved for several seconds. Then came the collective sighs and all was activity again. Lya hovered over Holly mumbling rapid-fire questions the doctor gamely answered. Karen strode to the intercom and ordered a springer team to the lab and intensive hook-ups for Holly\u0027s sleeping quarters. Cortez and a couple of techs began clearing a path through the electronics for the springers to better reach the bench. I sat down heavily in a chair and lit a cigarette and pondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the opportunity moments later to add my superfluous assurances to those Lya had already heard while Holly was being loaded. Then I managed to evade questions put to me by the curious and morbid stopping by out of rumor. When Holly and most of the rest had gone, I stayed and talked briefly with the doctor, learning nothing new. Then, when he was gone, I helped the techs guess what should and should not be keyed off in the lab during Holly\u0027s absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they left, I was alone. And so, with Holly safe in his bed and surrounded by professional concern and laymen\u0027s good intentions, I found the chance to betray him. In all the confusion I was sure to have several minutes alone with the security systems. It was a rotten act, to take advantage of him that way, but perhaps no worse than the act of sabotage itself which took a surprisingly short time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half hour later, only I knew how helpless Holly really was...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore still. She was waiting in my suite when I got back, flushed still with the excitement and the running and... the point of being there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How dare you leave me in there the other night...\" she began, clutching my arm furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMad, guilty, upset too much, I clamped my fist around her upper arm to jerk her away, clamped too hard, and she moaned with the sudden pain and our eyes met and her lips parted and I knew what our point really was. As I had known for some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was it. Strength on her. The clamping fist, anger and muscles together. Brute, from me. And she screamed when I threw her down and was upon her, ripping at the spotlessly white Crewjumpsuit and she struggled and kicked but writhed too. She surged into it. Maybe I did too. But both of us fell toward it, scratching and clutching and it got very, very, rough. Perfectly awful/awfully perfect...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then laid flat out, pinned and twisting. Blood seeping from her nose and a shiner coming on and screaming at me for... begging me to make her beg and please/oh/please- YES, YES, tell her over and over what she really was! She loved to hear me tell her what she really was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I did. But damned if I really knew. Either of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was spectacular and all-encompassing and it racked through me, shocking, stunning bolts of pleasure and pain. Both of us beating on her, abusing her, degrading the angel\u0027s exquisite form and yes, the angel herself and, of course, whatever was left of both of us and always, always, so damn rich with rippling ecstasy. So damn good, somehow. So damn rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo horrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, mercifully, we slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the nick of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXIII\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had no faith\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly said it like he still couldn\u0027t believe it was true. He looked at me with all the wide-eyed incredulity of a child learning for the first time that \"fair\" has nothing to do with the real world. Shocked, hurt, more than a little frightened. Angry, too, and morally indignant. Demanding an explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had none. None, anyway, that would do any good to him right then. So I changed the subject: \"I thought you said you couldn\u0027t read the guy\u0027s mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t. Not really. I mean, I couldn\u0027t tell when he was going to move until he moved or what he was going to say until he said it. But I... felt it when it happened. It was so close. So intimate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean emotions?\" I persisted. \"You could read those?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not read them,\" he replied carefully. \"Feel them. Or rather, feel him feeling them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced across the bed to Lya for some reaction. No luck. She sat as she had for the entire hour I had been there: hunched forward in her chair with her elbow propped on a knee, her chin propped in her palm, and her eyes staring dead blank at the floor. The only signs of animation came when she put out one cigarette in order to light another. But she was listening. Her face was drawn so tightly across her cheeks it looked like it should hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted back to Holly, looking skinny and out of place against the vast expanse of linen. Even his bedclothes dwarfed him, ignoring all but his broadest gestures. He was constantly having to drag his huge collar around to match the motions of his neck. And there was a lot of motion there. His eyes darted constantly about the room. From the ceiling to the walls to Lya to me and back again, pausing only when he had trouble choosing the right words. Then he would stare at the palms of both hands held plaintively before his face like twin viewscreens and his eyes would glaze and he would be back there, in the suit. In the War.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was particularly eerie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t away long this time. He dropped his hands on his lap. \"He had no faith!\" he said again, the same way as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, exactly as if I had any notion whatsoever. \"Well, I\u0027ve got to run,\" I lied, standing up. \"See you... tomorrow, Holly. Lya.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in my uneasiness must have leaked through. Holly looked up at me, at me this time for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Jack. Uh...\" He glanced at Lya. \"Tonight. Can you come back tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed Lya watching me too. I nodded. \"Tonight it is,\" I said and scooted too quickly out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried through the seals outside where the sun was shining and the sky was Earthblue and lovely, where there were horses and cattle-things on the meadows surrounding the western edge of the Dome. The guards on the bridge smiled at me and waved and said something unintelligible but nice. I took all of this in and relished it, filled my lungs with it. Got all the way across the bridge, sat down at the far end of it and got my cigarette lit before I let myself think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, I told myself furiously. Holly could be simply stunned. Instead of the vegetable he appeared to be. Or, maybe he was just stark raving mad, an improvement over being a carrot anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe it was just my usual guilt funk dripping those pitiful images. I made a command decision. I decided to forget about it. Holly was just tired out and a little disillusioned, that was all, by the reality of war vs. the flag waving. OK? OK. Besides, I was busy with traitor business. I had to see Wice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked across the sewer bridge into the City. It was its usual teeming desperate self. People stomped or strolled or wandered about looking for spots to hide what little bits of their past lives they had dragged through the staggering jolt of getting this far. The maze was dry now, but miserably pock- marked with hundreds of hard and dusty footprint-craters. I limped and tripped alongside everybody else on my way to Wice\u0027s passage. I was about halfway up the gradually ascending length of it in about a tenth of the time it had taken me before in the rain and darkness and despair. It was more than just the physical conditions which made this day different, however. There seemed to be a new touch of something in the air, crisp and clean and... hopeful, maybe, the way the people clamored about. Like the rain had washed something away and what was left was good and purposeful and... And so feeling poetic and the like, I got a little careless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guy came suddenly hopping out of a narrow side tunnel moaning in pain and fluttering his right hand in the air.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Damn-damn-damn-damn... damn!\" he said to himself and then, apparently seeing that he wasn\u0027t alone, to me. Then he stopped his hopping long enough to hold his left thumb up and examine it critically. It was purple and, I assumed-yes, assumed-it was swelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you believe it?\" he asked. \"This is the fourth damn time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, partly because of the way I was feeling and partly because of the way the guy was. Nice-looking man. Big,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;broad-shouldered with long black hair that was maned, squared- off around his forehead. He was oriental. Earth-orient, that is. He had an easy, powerful voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems like a lot,\" I agreed pleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dumb-ass helper,\" he added with a shrug in the direction from which he had appeared. \"Idiot has no grip whatsoever.\" He shook his head and sucked briefly on the purple digit. He grimaced slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged consolingly, made a step past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" he said, brightening. \"Can you give me a hand? It\u0027ll just take a second. Just help Idiot hold it in place long enough so that I can...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd blah blah blah with me following him around the comer and, sure enough, there was a corner of one of the local throw-togethers exposed with this huge piece of what looked like plassteel heat shielding resting beside it that looked to have been carved out to fit the hole. Up above on the second \"story\" was this little guy with red hair, the Idiot, no doubt, leaning out of what had once been an escape hatch back during the time when this erector set used to be a star ship. And it looked all right. The redhead was in a good position to bold the piece of plassteel, if he leaned out the hatch, while the oriental on the ground could brad it in tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I nodded and stepped forward and the oriental picked up one side and I reached for the other and the redhead stretched both arms down to get it and then I noticed that it really wasn\u0027t plassteel at all. It was that plastoform crap that was so popular because it was cheap and looked like plassteel and I thought: Well, hell, he oughta be able to just hold this with one hand...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s when the oriental hit me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a big guy and it was a damn good blow, a forearm to the side of my head. I went down flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen rolling away into position for the next shot and then there was red hair flying through the air onto me out that batch and be hit me as hard as the local gravity allowed for his fall-which was plenty-and before I got a good grip on him or the oriental who loomed over me or anything else, the sun was blotted out by many others crowding in for a piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd worked well together, each getting a good grip on me and lifting me up off the ground making me helpless and, worse, making me know it. They hustled me around a owner and then around a couple others, the passage getting narrower and narrower until we stopped in this tight square claustrophobic little area surrounded on three sides by three stories of maze, crooked and ugly and seeming to lean in on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had me. Absolutely goddamn had me. No one broke his concentration or loosened his grip or looked like he was going to. Two on each leg, two on each arm. One held the back of my head against his chest with two huge hands, the thumb of the left one painted purple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit because they had me, really had me and I hated, loathed, was repulsed... sickened by having hands on me without my consent. And double shit because I had been so utterly fooled and, come to think of it, triple shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause not only did this group know how to handle itself against an enemy, they knew how to handle themselves against me. This wasn\u0027t a shake-down or a robbery or any other sort of thug-mugging gang. This was the execution of a plan dreamed up by someone who used well-trained, or at least well-drilled, disciplined people who knew just how good I was and who weren\u0027t taking any chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring him here,\" said somebody I couldn\u0027t see. And they did, all eighteen legs of them spiraled around so that I might face the man who had spoken. He stood on a jutting piece of webform a couple of meters over our heads. He looked about fifty, which meant nothing, of course. Still, I had the impression that his appearance was \"natural,\" non-cosmetic. Which would have made him a couple of decades younger than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I only noticed those details in passing, the way I noticed his well-worn tunic and his beard and the unusually long thin fingers on the hands hanging clasped before him. For beside him, stood Eyes. Clean now and, amongst her folk, safe. Long brown hair tucked into something functional. Logging-things on the legs of her pants. Simple tunic like her father\u0027s... was it her father who stood at her side? I never found out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked strong and capable and lovely and well worth the fighting that had gone on for her sake. Still Eyes, too. Hers shone in the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must forgive us,\" began their leader, opening his hands in an expression of regret, \"for having treated you in this fashion. But your somewhat lethal reputation has preceded you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that supposed to be an apology?\" I snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That the best you can do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stiffened. So, in fact, did a couple of the ones holding me. Eyes, I noticed, showed no reaction at all. She was still waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume,\" be began again, \"that your statement implies release.\" He paused, wiped his brow clear of a lock of sandy-gray hair with one of those long fingers. \"Quite understandable, of course,\" he resumed. \"Even reasonable, under normal circumstances.\" Those hands clasped together again and he peered forcefully into my eyes. \"You, sir, are hardly normal circumstances, even for us. If I were to have you set free, how many of your captors would be killed or maimed or otherwise handicapped before they could get free?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned, shrugged. \"Three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"At least three, Mr. Crow. At least.\" His hands separated again, palms upward. \"So you see how my hands are tied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. I had to. So, apparently, did everyone else. At the absurdity of the situation. And at our own, each and everyone of us. So bizarre... So often.\u0027 Eyes, sparkling, laughed herself beautiful. I forced my thoughts and my feelings and... and me, away from the idea of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leader had resumed. \"...do hope you won\u0027t be too uncomfortable while I say what little I have to say. In any case, I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get on with it,\" I snapped, hating buddy-buddy while being held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat cooled\u0027em off instantly. We all got a lot more tense. The muscles on the hands that held me grew more taut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. This was not fun, dammit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, Mr. Crow,\" said the leader stiffly. \"I shall indeed get on with it. First let me tell you a little bit about who we are.\" He spread his hands wide to indicate, not just the immediate throng, but the City itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then be gave a speech. It was a pretty good one. And he didn\u0027t ease up much, either. He really did tell me who they were. And what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were crewmen and women from the starships or couples with girls and boys of draft age or merchants fleeing the growing restrictions of wartime. They were Societies Against the Loss of Something or Other. They were people who had pushed off into the unknown one step ahead of Fleet expansion or two steps ahead of prison. They fled the loss of freedom, the courts, their wives or husbands, their past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost simply fled the Antwar. Quite a few were deserters. Each had, or had been, deserted. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/armor/page-15.html","bookId":2119,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:55 PM"}
