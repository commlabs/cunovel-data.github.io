In 2000 the University of Rochester was granted a patent for a gene calledCOX-2 , which produced an enzyme that caused pain. The university promptly sued the pharmaceutical giant Searle, which marketed a successful arthritis drug, Celebrex, that blocked theCOX-2 enzyme. Rochester said Celebrex had infringed on its gene patent, even though their patent only claimed general uses of the gene to fight pain. The university had not claimed a patent on any specific drug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was what the judge pointed out, four years later, when Rochester lost. The court ruled that Rochester\u0027s patent was \"little more than a research plan,\" and ruled that its claim against Searle was invalid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut such rulings did not alter the long-standing behavior of the patent office. They continued to grant gene patents that included lists of vague claims. A patent might claim all uses of a gene to control heart disease or pain, or to fight infection. Even though the courts ruled that these claims were meaningless, the patent office granted them anyway. Indeed, the grants accelerated. Your tax dollars at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get to the point,\" Josh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attorney consulted a notepad. \"Your best candidate is a patent application from 1998 for aminocarboxymuconate methaldehyde dehydrogenase, orACMMD .

So if you ownedACMMD , you would effectively control the maturity gene because you would control its expression.

Filed for Chapter 11 in 1995. As part of the settlement, all patent apps went to the principal investor, Carl Weigand, who died in 2000. Patents passed to his widow.

He read a book on the female orgasm. Two books, actually. One with pictures. And he watched a video. He ran it three times, and even took notes. Because, one way or another, he had sworn he would get a reaction from Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was down there between her legs, hard at work for the last half hour, his fingers stiff, tongue aching, knees sore - but Lisa\u0027s body remained completely relaxed, indifferent to his every attention.

Like a person waiting for something vaguely unpleasant to be over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then...wait a minute...her breathing changed. Only slightly at first, but then distinctly. Sighing. And her stomach was tensing, rhythmically tensing. She began to squeeze her breasts and moan softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRick redoubled his efforts. She responded strongly.

Anyway, what\u0027s relevant now are the inconsistencies in her story. If you look at the hotel security camera\" - he tapped another key - \"you see here that she turns her body away from the camera while waiting for the elevator, opens her purse, and touches her face. We think she is putting drops, or s?ome irritant, in her eyes. When she gets in the elevator a moment later she is visibly crying. But notice: as a supposed rape victim, crying in the elevator, apparently very upset, she doesn\u0027t go right to the hotel desk to report that she has been raped. You have to wonder why not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" Brad said, eyes narrowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Instead, she goes straight through the lobby to her car. Security camera in the parking lot shows her driving away at five-seventeen p.m. Depending on traffic, the drive from the hotel to the hospital is between eleven and seventeen minutes. She doesn\u0027t show up until six-oh-five p.m. Forty-five minutes later.

They were stronger and tougher than Cro-Magnons, and they made excellent tools. They survived several ice ages before the Cro-Magnons came on the scene. Why, then, did Neanderthals die out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer, according to Professor Sheldon Harmon of the University of Wisconsin, was that the Neanderthals carried a gene that led them to resist change. \"Neanderthals were the first environmentalists. They created a lifestyle in harmony with nature. They limited game hunting, and they controlled tool use. But this same ethos also made them intensely conservative and resistant to change. They disapproved of the newcomer Cro-Magnons, who painted caves, made elaborately decorated tools, and who drove whole herds of animals over cliffs, causing species extinction. Today we consider the cave paintings a wondrous development. But the Neanderthals regarded them as so much graffiti. They saw it as prehistoric tagging. And they viewed the elaborate Cro-Magnon tools as wasteful and destructive of the environment. They disapproved of these innovations, and they stuck to the old ways. Eventually, they died out as a species.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Harmon insists that the Neanderthals bred with the modern Cro-Magnons. \"They unquestionably did, because we have identified this same gene in modern human beings. This gene is clearly a Neanderthal remnant, and it promotes cautious or reactionary behavior. Many of the people who today wish to return to the glorious past, or at the very least to keep things as they are, are driven by this same Neanderthal gene.\" Harmon described the gene as modifying dopamine receptors in the lateral posterior cingulate gyrus and in the right frontal lobe. \"There\u0027s no question about its mode of action,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarmon\u0027s claim has provoked a firestorm of criticism from academic colleagues. Not since E. O. Wilson published his sociobiology thesis two decades ago has such furious controversy erupted. According to Columbia University geneticist Vartan Gorvald, Harmon was injecting politics into what should be a purely scientific inquiry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all,\" Harmon said. \"The gene is present in both Neanderthals and modern humans. Its action has been confirmed in scans of brain activity. The correlation between this gene and reactionary behavior is indisputable. It\u0027s not a matter of politics, of left or right. It\u0027s a question of basic attitude - whether you are open to the future, or fearful of it. Whether you see the world as emergent, or deteriorating. We have long known that some people favor innovation and look positively toward the future, while others are frightened of change and want to halt innovation. The dividing line is genetic, and represents the presence or absence of the Neanderthal gene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story was picked up in theNew York Times the next day:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNEANDERTHAL GENE PROVES ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFears of \u0027Rampant Technology\u0027 Justified\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTUTTGART, Germany �C Anthropologist Sheldon Harmon\u0027s discovery of a Neanderthal gene which promotes environmental preservation \"proves the need for sound environmental policy,\" said Greenpeace spokesperson Marsha Madsden. \"The fact that Neanderthals lost the battle for the environment should serve as a warning to us all.

Most rehab doesn\u0027t work for most people. That\u0027s a fact. How many addicts are there in this country? Christ, we got more than a million in prisons. So how many are on the streets? Twenty million? Thirty million?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh was beginning to sweat. \"That would be like, eight or ten percent of the population.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds about right.

He felt drenched in cold sweat. \"So, what are you going to do?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRick Diehl smiled. \"Give you a promotion, of course,\" he said. \"Did you keep records of the dosages you administered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHapter 030\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a glass-walledconference room on Madison Avenue, the marketing firm of Watson \u0026amp; Naeme was engaged in naming a new product. The room was packed with hip young people in their teens and twenties, all casually dressed, as if they were attending a rock concert instead of a dry lecture from a professor standing at a lectern wearing a bowtie and talking about a gene calledA 58799-6B. The professor was now showing graphs of enzymatic action, black squiggly lines on white. The kids sagged, slumped in their seats, thumbed their BlackBerrys. Only a few tried to focus on the material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting in the back of the room, the team leader, a psychologist named Paul Gode, spun his finger in the air, signaling the professor to wind it up. Bowtie looked surprised, but he concluded smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In summary,\" the professor said, \"our team at Columbia University has isolated a gene that promotes social harmony and group cohesion. It does this by activating the prefrontal cortex of the brain, an area known to be important in determining belief and credence. We have demonstrated this gene action by exposing experimental subjects to both conventional and controversial ideas. Controversial ideas produce a distinctive prefrontal signature, whereas conventional ideas create a diffused activation - what you might call a warm glow. Thus subjects with the gene show a marked preference for conventional thinking and familiar ideas. They also show a preference for group thinking of all kinds. They like television. They like Wikipedia. They like cocktail parties. They like small talk. They like to be in agreement with people around them. Our gene is an important force for social stability and civilization. Since it\u0027s the gene that promotes conventional wisdom, we call it the conventional gene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe audience sat silent. Stunned. Finally one of them said, \"You call itwhat ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The conventional gene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, that\u0027s terrible!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suicide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or,\" the professor said quickly, \"we call it the civilizing gene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroans in the room. \"Thecivilizing gene? That\u0027s worse!

Civilization is a good thing, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" said the team leader, coming forward from the back. Paul Gode stepped up to the lectern. \"The only trouble is, nobody in this country wants to think of themselves as joiners or civilizers. Just the opposite - we\u0027re all rugged individualists. We\u0027re all rebels. We\u0027re antiestablishment. We stand out, we strike out, we do our own thing, go our own way. The herd of independent minds, somebody called it. Nobody wants to feel they\u0027renot a rebel. Nobody wants to admit that they just want to fit in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But in truth, everybodydoes want to fit in,\" the professor said. \"At least, almost everybody. About ninety-two percent of people have the conventional-wisdom gene. The real rebels lack it, and they are - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop right there,\" the team leader said, holding up his hand. \"Just stop. You want to make your gene valuable. That means your gene creates something peoplewant to possess - something exciting and desirable. Conventional wisdom is not exciting or desirable. It\u0027s mundane. It\u0027s buttered toast with grape jelly. That\u0027s what the group is telling you.\" He gestured to a chair. \"You might want to take a seat, professor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGode turned to the group, which now looked slightly more alert. \"All right.

A furious argument ensued as names were deleted, though of course all the names would be concept-tested with focus groups. In the end, everybody agreed the winner would be the comfort gene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s test itin the field,\" Gode said. \"Professor? Tell us: Where is this gene going, commercially?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too early to say, the professor explained. They had isolated the gene, but they didn\u0027t yet know the full range of diseases associated with it. However, since nearly everybody in the world carried the comfort gene, they believed that many people probably suffered from genetic anomalies involving the gene. For example: People who were overly desirous of joining the majority - that might prove to be a genetic disorder. And people who felt depressed when they were alone, by themselves - conceivably, another disorder. People who joined protest marches, went to sports games, who sought out situations where they would be surrounded by lots of like-minded people - a potential genetic disorder. Then there were people who felt obliged to agree with whomever they were with, no matter what was said - yet another disorder. And what about people who were afraid to think for themselves? Fear of independence from the surrounding group?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s face it, that\u0027s a lot of people,\" the professor said. \"Nobody thinks for themselves if they can help it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean all this behavior is going to be considered pathological?\" someone asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any compulsive behavior is pathological,\" the professor answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But positive behavior? Protest marches?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our position,\" the professor said, \"is that we are on the verge of identifying a range of disease states all related to sociability.\" These genetic anomalies involving the comfort gene had not yet been definitively established, but Columbia University had applied for a patent on the gene itself, meaning that the gene would have increasing value as disorders involving it were identified with certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGode coughed. \"We\u0027ve made a mistake.
