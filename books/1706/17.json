See you.\" She hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans turned the ignition of his Prius and it hummed to life. He was pleased to have the hybrid; the waiting list in Los Angeles to get one was now more than six months. He\u0027d had to take a light gray one, which wasn\u0027t his preferred color, but he loved the car. And he took a quiet satisfaction in noticing how many of them there were on the streets these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove down the alley to Olympic. Across the street he saw a blue Prius, just like the one he had seen below Margo\u0027s apartment. It was electric blue, a garish color. He thought he liked his gray better. He turned right, and then left again, heading north through Beverly Hills. He knew there would be rush hour traffic starting at this time of day and he should get up to Sunset, where traffic moved a little better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he got to the traffic light at Wilshire, he saw another blue Prius behind him. That same ugly color. Two guys in the car, not young. When he made his way to the light at Sunset, the same car was still behind him. Two cars back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned left, toward Holmby Hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Prius turned left, too. Following him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans pulled up to Morton\u0027s gate and pressed the buzzer. The security camera above the box blinked on. \"Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Peter Evans for Sarah Jones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA momentary pause, and then a buzz. The gates swung open slowly, revealing a curving roadway. The house was still hidden from view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he waited, Evans glanced down the road to his left. A block away, he saw the blue Prius coming up the road toward him. It passed him without slowing down, and disappeared around a curve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo. Perhaps he was not being followed after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, and let it out slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gates swung wide, and he drove inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 25\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHOLMBY HILLS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTUESDAY, OCTOBER 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3:54 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost four o\u0027clock as Evans drove up the driveway to Morton\u0027s house. The property was crawling with security men. There were several searching among the trees near the front gate, and more in the driveway, clustered around several vans marked anderson security service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans parked next to Sarah\u0027s Porsche. He went to the front door. A security man opened it. \"Ms. Jones is in the living room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked through the large entryway and past the staircase that curved up to the second floor. He looked into the living room, prepared to see the same disarray that he\u0027d witnessed at his own apartment, but here everything seemed to be in its place. The room appeared exactly as Evans remembered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorton\u0027s living room was arranged to display his extensive collection of Asian antiquities. Above the fireplace was a large Chinese screen with shimmering gilded clouds; a large stone head from the Angkor region of Cambodia, with thick lips and a half-smile, was mounted on a pedestal near the couch; against one wall stood a seventeenth-century Japanese tansu, its rich wood glowing. Extremely rare, two hundred-year-old wood-cuts by Hiroshige hung on the back wall. A standing Burmese Buddha, carved in faded wood, stood at the entrance to the media room, next door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of the room, surrounded by these antiquities, Sarah sat slumped on the couch, staring blankly out the window. She looked over as Evans came in. \"They got your apartment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This house was broken into, too. It must have happened last night. All the security people here are trying to figure out how it could have happened. Look here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up and pushed the pedestal that held the Cambodian head. Considering the weight of the head, the pedestal moved surprisingly easily, revealing a safe sunk in the floor. The safe door stood open. Evans saw neatly stacked manila folders inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was taken?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As far as I can tell, nothing,\" she said. \"Seems like everything is still in its place. But I don\u0027t know exactly what George had in these safes. They were his safes. I rarely went into them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved to the tansu, sliding open a center panel, and then a false back panel, to expose a safe in the wall behind. It, too, was open. \"There are six safes in the house,\" she said. \"Three down here, one in the second-floor study, one in the basement, and one up in his bedroom closet. They opened every one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cracked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Someone knew the combinations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans said, \"Did you report this to the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to talk to you first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head was close to his. Evans could smell a faint perfume. He said, \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\" she said. \"Someone knew the combinations, Peter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean it was an inside job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It had to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who stays in the house at night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two housekeepers sleep in the far wing.

What about the security cameras?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all over the property,\" she said, \"inside the house and out. They record onto a hard drive in the basement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve played it back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Nothing but static. It was scrubbed. The security people are trying to recover something, but amp;\" She shrugged. \"I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll get anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would take pretty sophisticated burglars to know how to wipe a hard drive. \"Who has the alarm codes and safe combinations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As far as I know, just George and me. But obviously somebody else does, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you should call the police,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re looking for something,\" she said. \"Something that George had. Something they think one of us has now. They think George gave it to one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans frowned. \"But if that\u0027s true,\" he said, \"why are they being so obvious? They smashed my place so I couldn\u0027t help notice. And even here, they left the safes wide open, to be sure you\u0027d know you\u0027d been robbed amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" she said. \"They want us to know what they\u0027re doing.\" She bit her lip. \"They want us to panic, and rush off to retrieve this thing, whatever it is. Then they\u0027ll follow us, and take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans thought it over. \"Do you have any idea what it could be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans was thinking of the list George had mentioned to him, on the airplane. The list he never got around to explaining, before he died. But certainly the implication was that Morton had paid a lot of money for some sort of list. But something made Evans hesitate to mention it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did George give you anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me neither.\" She bit her lip again. \"I think we should leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of town for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s natural to feel that way after a robbery,\" he said. \"But I think the proper thing to do right now is to call the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"George wouldn\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"George is no longer with us, Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"George hated the Beverly Hills police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He never called them.

It said: n. drake come to office immed. urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" he said. \"I have to go see Nick for a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come back,\" he said, \"as soon as I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine,\" she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, and she stood, too. On a sudden impulse he gave her a hug. She was so tall they were almost shoulder to shoulder. \"It\u0027s going to be okay,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t worry. It\u0027ll be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe returned the hug, but when he released her, she said, \"Don\u0027t ever do that again, Peter. I\u0027m not hysterical. I\u0027ll see you when you get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left hastily, feeling foolish. At the door, she said, \"By the way, Peter: Do you have a gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a 9-millimeter Beretta, but it\u0027s better than nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, okay.\" As he went out the front door, he thought, so much for manly reassurances for the modern woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got in the car, and drove to Drake\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not until he had parked his car and was walking in the front door to the office that he noticed the blue Prius parked at the end of the block, with two men sitting inside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBEVERLY HILLS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTUESDAY, OCTOBER 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:45 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, no!\" Nicholas Drake stood in the NERF media room, surrounded by a half-dozen stunned-looking graphic designers. On the walls and tables were posters, banners, flyers, coffee mugs, and stacks of press releases, and media kits.
