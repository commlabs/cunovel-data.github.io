He quickly returned the firecracker to its hiding place. Maybe he\u0027d better wait until he returned to the States. If his Mom found out about his little treasure… no, he\u0027d better play it cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe zipped up his bag, still unsure what to do with his free time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, he moved from the steps, shifting his gym bag to his other hand. Just then, angling around the corner of the hut, a group of officers passed by, one of whom was decked out with enough medals to choke an elephant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe decorated man took off his hat and wiped his brow. \"Is it always this damned hot down here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his companions spoke up. \"It\u0027s not the heat, it\u0027s the humidity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the heat, Lieutenant,\" the man said with authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir, yes, Admiral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason, impressed by the fear this man could generate, stood transfixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, where is that Blakely fellow?\" the admiral asked, replacing his hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way, sir.\" The lieutenant bumbled his way around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow! Something big must be happening. Jason peered around the corner. The men disappeared into one of the concrete-block buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason knew that building. It was the communications center. He had been in it three times, when he was allowed his two minutes of morning air time to talk to his mother. Usually the conversation consisted of his mother questioning if he was obeying his \"baby-sitters.\" Still, he thought with a sigh, it had been good to hear her voice over that static.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratching behind an ear, Jason wondered what all that brass wanted with Dr. Blakely. He pursed his lips. Maybe he could find out. He knew his mother hated his eaves-dropping, but he couldn\u0027t resist a good scoop. Besides, it might be information about his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slinked around the corner and crept to the door. No one was around. The secretary, Sandy, was not at her desk. What luck! He slipped inside. As he reached for the door to the main hallway, the doorknob turned and the door swung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandy stood in front of him, a half-empty coffeepot in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jason!\" she said with a big smile, pushing a stray lock of blond hair back over an ear. \"I didn\u0027t know you were coming by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason bit his lip and backed a step, ready to bolt. He cleared his throat. \"I… I just wanted to tell something to Dr. Blakely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe placed the coffeepot down and fingered out a new filter. \"I\u0027m sorry, hon, but the doctor is busy. Why don\u0027t I tell him for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!… You see,\" he stammered, wide-eyed, \"it\u0027s something personal… private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pursed her lips, then smiled. \"I see. Well, then why don\u0027t you have a seat, and we can wait until Dr. Blakely is free?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. This was getting him nowhere. Perhaps he should just leave and say he\u0027d talk to Blakely later. That would be the smart thing to do. His mouth had other ideas. \"I have to use the restroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, dear. It\u0027s just through the door on the left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he already knew that. More importantly, it was also next to the main communications room. He crossed to the door. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandy smiled up from her computer keyboard and winked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding his breath, Jason passed into the hallway. His sneakers squeaked on the waxed linoleum. No one was in the hall, but he could hear the buzz of voices from the various offices. Raising on tiptoe, he crept down the hall, trying to move as silently as possible. He reached the door that led to the main communications room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreezing in midstep, he listened. Blakely\u0027s voice was clear and curt. \"Why the hell do you think I wanted this communications net? You damned well know from my reports that there is an undetermined danger down here. We need to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe admiral\u0027s voice interrupted. \"Be that as it may, your team\u0027s evening report is only an hour late. I think calling this red alert was premature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If able, Michaelson would not be a second late with his reports.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The major\u0027s too close to this mission. It\u0027s too personal for him. You should never have allowed him to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve had this argument before. It\u0027s done. Now I want to know what you\u0027re going to do about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large crash. \"Listen here, I have motion sensors going crazy. Yesterday, another man was lost in Sector Four. And now my team is late with their report. And you\u0027re going to do what? Sit on your ass and wait for more of my people to disappear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next words were so cold that Jason shivered. \"No. Washington sent me to do only one thing: upon my judgment, to decide if you are fit to continue command. You\u0027ve made my decision easy. As of this moment, you\u0027re relieved of duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence, then words spat with vehemence: \"You jackasses planned this all along, didn\u0027t you? You never had any intention of keeping this a civilian project. When did the brass decide to snag this facility from me? Was it when the last team was lost? Or since the very beginning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead silence followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Jason could react, the door burst open. Blakely, wild-eyed, bowled into the boy, knocking him down. \"Jason!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I… I… I…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to… I mean…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\" Blakely bent down, helping Jason up. \"C\u0027mon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushed toward the door, Jason stumbled ahead. \"What\u0027s going on? Is my mom okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man ignored him. \"I need to get you somewhere safe. I should never have allowed you to come down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe admiral stepped out into the hall. \"If that is Jason Carter, leave him be. He is my responsibility now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to fucking hell!\" Blakely yelled, pushing Jason through the hallway door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf shoved, Jason tumbled into the reception area. Too frightened to think, focused on trying to keep one step ahead of the raving doctor, he bumped into the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandy, her mouth hanging open in surprise, stood up from her typing. \"What\u0027s happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one gave her an answer. Jason was brushed through the door, Blakely\u0027s arm around his shoulder. By now, tears started to flow down Jason\u0027s cheek; he clutched his gym bag to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the open air, Blakely seemed to be calming down. \"I\u0027m sorry, Jason. I didn\u0027t mean to scare you. But you should know-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA siren blasted through the cavern, its scream so piercing that Jason cringed, covering his ears. \"What is it?\" he yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Periphery sensors. The base is under attack. Hurry.\" Blakely yanked Jason\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSILENCE NOW. TEN LONG HEARTBEATS HAD PASSED SINCE the scream had blasted from the tunnel. The dark entrance was beginning to clear of smoke from Villanueva\u0027s assault. Was it killed? Swallowing hard, Ashley stared down the length of her pistol\u0027s barrel. From the corner of her eye, she could see Halloway\u0027s head; it still lay a yard from her toe, staring at her as if asking why she let this happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe risked a quick glance toward Ben on her right. He caught her look and shrugged. Maybe whatever killed the SEAL was dead. Maybe they had lucked-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a bellow, it burst from the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of teeth, needle-sharp and serrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ!\" Ashley yelled. In shock, she stumbled backward, losing her shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen knocked her to the side, out of the way of the lunging jaws, then hauled her behind a jumble of boulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere far off she heard Linda screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell-\" Ashley began, but Ben silenced her with a hand over her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA foul carrion scent flooded their hiding place as a massive snouted head, reptilian, like a crocodile, swung over the lip of a boulder, weaving on a scaled neck; its nostrils, open wide, snorted the air, searching. Oily black skin stretched over skull and jaw. Then its snout swept toward them, rolling a lidless black eye, like a chunk of polished obsidian, in her direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her, Ben struggled to free his rifle, to swing it around, but the narrow space behind the boulder was too small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley went to raise her pistol, but her hand was empty, the gun lost in the fall. Shit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva stood his ground, silent, fearing movement would distract the beast and ruin his shot. He studied his target, searching for a weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva squinted through his rifle sight. It stood ten feet tall, pitch-black, towering on two heavily muscled hind limbs, balanced with a thick tail. Its arms, spindly when compared to the muscled hind limbs, ended in articulated claws like some feral cat. He could see the claws, razor-edged, extending and retracting as it scrabbled at the boulder\u0027s surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva continued to watch as it stalked back and forth, its head out of sight behind the boulder. The hooked scimitars of its hind limbs gouged the cavern floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to kill it? The creature was thick across the chest, layered in mud and scales that looked iron-hard. Could a rifle blast to the chest penetrate to the heart? Maybe. But it was risky. He would get only one shot. He swung his rifle sight forward. It would have to be the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature still probed behind the pile of boulders where Ben and Ashley had fled, keeping Villanueva\u0027s target out of sight. Suddenly its body tensed; its tail stopped twitching. It had discovered something behind that boulder… and he could guess what that was-either Ben or Ashley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud hiss arose from it. Like a rabid dog raising a hackle, a ridge of spiked bristles sprouted in a crest along the back of its snaking neck, tracing down the length of its body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShow me your head, you fuckin\u0027 monster, Villanueva thought. Gimme one clean shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ground his molars. A nonfatal shot would just enrage the beast, making a second shot impossible. He tried to will it to move. Helpless, he watched the beast\u0027s muscles bunch up as it prepared to spring on its quarry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to distract it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillanueva\u0027s knuckles whitened as he gripped his rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetreat, thought Michaelson. Linda and Khalid were his responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe huddled behind the sheltering boulder. He hated to abandon the others, but he was in no real position to offer any help. He glanced over at Linda, who still shook in Khalid\u0027s arms. They needed to retreat to a more defensible position. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-23.html","bookId":1526,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM"}
