That\u0027s almost how long it\u0027s been. It\u0027ll be two weeks Monday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I haven\u0027t accomplished very much in that amount of time. It seems as though- well, the hell with it, I\u0027m doing what I can. Anyway, the point is that I can afford to take the chance that I won\u0027t get reimbursed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so.\" She frowned. \"How do you get two thousand dollars? Say one-fifty for a hotel room, and a thousand for the two Kongs. How much Coca-Cola can two kids drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I drink Coke, too. And don\u0027t forget TJ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He drinks a lot of Coke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All he wants. And he gets five hundred dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For introducing you to the Kongs. I didn\u0027t even think of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For introducing me to the Kongs, and for thinking of introducing me to the Kongs. They\u0027re the perfect way to spirit information out of the phone company, and I never would have thought of looking for someone like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you hear about computer hackers,\" she said, \"but how would you find one? They don\u0027t list them in the Yellow Pages. Matt, how old is TJ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never asked him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never got a straight answer. I\u0027d say fifteen or sixteen, and I don\u0027t think I could be off by more than a year either way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he lives on the street? Where does he sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says he\u0027s got a place. He\u0027s never said where or with whom. One thing you learn on the street, you don\u0027t want to be too quick to tell your business to people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or even your name. Does he know how much he\u0027s getting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"We haven\u0027t discussed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t be expecting that much, will he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but why shouldn\u0027t he have it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not disagreeing with you. I just wonder what he\u0027s going to do with five hundred dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever he wants. At a quarter a shot, he could call me up two thousand times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess,\" she said. \"God, when I think of the different people we know. Danny Boy, Kali. Mick. TJ, the Kongs. Matt? Let\u0027s not ever leave New York, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Sundays Jim Faber and I usually have our weekly dinner at a Chinese restaurant, although we occasionally go somewhere else. I met him at six-thirty at our regular place, and a few minutes after seven he asked me if I had a train to catch. \"Because that\u0027s the third time in the past fifteen minutes you looked at your watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t realize it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You anxious about something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s something I have to do later,\" I said, \"but there\u0027s plenty of time. I don\u0027t have to be anywhere until eight-thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be going to a meeting myself at eight-thirty, but I don\u0027t suppose that\u0027s what you\u0027ve got scheduled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I went to one this afternoon because I knew I wouldn\u0027t be able to fit one in tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This appointment of yours,\" he said. \"You\u0027re not nervous because you\u0027re gonna be around booze, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, no. There won\u0027t be anything stronger than Coca-Cola. Unless somebody picks up some Jolt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a new drug I don\u0027t know about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a cola drink. Like Coke, but twice as much caffeine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if you can handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know that I\u0027m going to try. You want to know where I\u0027m going after I leave here? I\u0027m going to check into a hotel under a phony name and then I\u0027m going to have three teenage boys up to my room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me any more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t, because I wouldn\u0027t want you to have foreknowledge of a felony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re planning on committing a felony with these kids?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re the ones who\u0027ll be committing a felony. I\u0027m just going to watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have some more of the sea bass,\" he said. \"It\u0027s especially good tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBY nine o\u0027clock all four of us were assembled in a $160-a-night corner room in the Frontenac, a 1,200-room hotel built a few years ago with Japanese money and since sold to a Dutch conglomerate. The hotel was on the corner of Seventh Avenue and Fifty-third Street, and from our room on the twenty-eighth floor you could get a glimpse of the Hudson. Or you could have, if we hadn\u0027t drawn the shades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a spread of snack food laid out on the top of the dresser, including Cheez Doodles but not including Pringles. The little refrigerator held three varieties of cola, a six-pack of each. The telephone had been relocated from the bedside table to the desk, with something called an acoustic coupler attached to its earpiece and something else called a modem plugged into its rear. It shared the desk with the Kongs\u0027 laptop computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had signed the register as John J. Gunderman and gave an address on Hillcrest Avenue, in Skokie, Illinois. I paid cash, along with the fifty-dollar deposit required of cash customers who wanted access to the telephone and mini-bar. I didn\u0027t care about the mini-bar, but we damn well needed the phone. That was why we were in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy Hong was seated at the desk, his fingers flashing on the computer\u0027s keyboard, then punching numbers on the phone. David King had drawn up another chair but was standing, looking over Jimmy\u0027s shoulder at the computer screen. Earlier he had tried to explain to me how the modem allowed the computer to hook into other computers through the telephone lines, but it was a little like trying to explain the fundamentals of non-Euclidean geometry to a field mouse. Even when I understood the words he used, I still didn\u0027t know what the hell he was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kongs had worn suits and ties, but only to get through the hotel lobby; their ties and jackets were on the bed now, and they had their sleeves rolled up. TJ was in his usual costume, but they hadn\u0027t hassled him at the desk. He\u0027d come lugging two sacks of groceries, disguised as a delivery boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy said, \"We\u0027re in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we\u0027re into NYNEX but that\u0027s like being inside the hotel lobby when you need to be in a room on the fortieth floor. Okay, let\u0027s try something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers danced and combinations of numbers and letters popped up on the screen. After a while he said, \"Bastards keep changing the password. You know the amount of effort they spend just trying to keep people like us out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if they could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they put the same energy into improving the system-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore letters, more numbers. \"Damn,\" Jimmy said, and reached for his can of Coke. \"You know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time for our people-to-people program,\" David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I was thinking. You feel like refining your human-contact skills?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid nodded and took the phone. \"Some people call this \u0027social engineering,\u0027 \" he told me. \"It\u0027s hardest with NYNEX because they warn their people about us. Good thing for us that most of the people who work there are morons.\" He dialed a telephone number, and after a moment he said, \"Hi, this is Ralph Wilkes, I\u0027m trouble-shooting your line. You\u0027ve been having trouble getting into COSMOS, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They always do,\" Jimmy Hong murmured. \"So it\u0027s a safe question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right,\" David was saying. There was a lot of jargon I couldn\u0027t follow, and then he said, \"Now how do you log in? What\u0027s your access code? No, right, don\u0027t tell me, you\u0027re not supposed to tell me, it\u0027s security.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, I know, they give us grief about the same thing. Look, don\u0027t tell me the code, just punch it in on your keyboard.\" Numbers and letters appeared on our screen and Jimmy\u0027s fingers were quick to enter them on our keyboard. \"Fine,\" David said. \"Now can you do the same thing with your password for COSMOS? Don\u0027t tell me what it is, just enter it. Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beautiful,\" Jimmy said softly as the number came up on our screen. He punched it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That ought to do it,\" David told whoever he was talking to. \"I don\u0027t think you should have any problems from here on in.\" He broke the connection and let out a huge sigh. \"I don\u0027t think we should have any problems, either. \u0027Don\u0027t tell me the number, just enter it. Don\u0027t tell me, darling, just tell my computer.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot damn,\" Jimmy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yay!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt, what\u0027s your phone number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call me,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to call you. I want to check your line. What\u0027s the number? Never mind, don\u0027t tell me, see if I care. \u0027Scudder, Matthew.\u0027 West Fifty-seventh Street, right? That look familiar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the screen. \"That\u0027s my phone number,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. You happy with it? You want me to change it, give you something easier to remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you call the phone company to get your number changed,\" David said, \"it takes them a week or so to run it through channels. But we can do it on the spot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ll keep the number I\u0027ve got,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suit yourself. Uh-huh. You\u0027ve got pretty basic service, haven\u0027t you? No Call Forwarding, no Call Waiting. You\u0027re at a hotel, you\u0027ve got the switchboard backing you up, so maybe you don\u0027t need Call Waiting, but you ought to have Call Forwarding anyhow. Suppose you stay over at somebody\u0027s house? You could get your calls routed there automatically.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d use it enough to make it worthwhile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t cost anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought there was a monthly charge for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned and his fingers were busy on the keypad. \"No charge for you,\" he said, \"because you have influential friends. As of this moment you\u0027ve got Call Forwarding, compliments of the Kongs. We\u0027re in COSMOS now, that\u0027s the particular system we invaded, so that\u0027s where I\u0027m entering changes in your account. The system that figures your billing won\u0027t know about the change, so it won\u0027t cost you anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you use AT\u0026amp;T for your long-distance calls. You didn\u0027t select Sprint or MCI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t figure I would save that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m giving you Sprint,\" he said. \"It\u0027s going to save you a fortune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh, because NYNEX is going to route your long-distance calls to Sprint, but Sprint\u0027s not going to know about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you won\u0027t get billed,\" David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t doubt what you said. I just don\u0027t know how I feel about it. It\u0027s theft of services.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy looked at me. \"We\u0027re talking about the phone company,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think they\u0027re gonna miss it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt, when you make a call from a pay phone and the call goes through but the quarter comes back anyway, what do you do?
