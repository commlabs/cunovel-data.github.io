The Seminaries he had hitherto attended were respectable, but in the nature of things they could not afford the facilities which he now enjoyed. Despite his years of study and struggle there were many things in which he was wholly deficient. He had studied Latin, Greek, and mathematics, but of English literature he knew but little. He had never had time to read for recreation, or for that higher culture which is not to be learned in the class-room. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the library of Williams College he made his first acquaintance with Shakespeare, and we can understand what a revelation his works must have been to the aspiring youth. He had abstained from reading fiction, doubting whether it was profitable, since the early days when with a thrill of boyish excitement he read \"Sinbad the Sailor\" and Marryatt\u0027s novels. After a while his views as to the utility of fiction changed. He found that his mind was suffering from the solid food to which it was restricted, and he began to make incursions into the realm of poetry and fiction with excellent results. He usually limited this kind of reading, and did not neglect for the fascination of romance those more solid works which should form the staple of a young man\u0027s reading.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is well known that among poets Tennyson was his favorite, so that in after years, when at fifteen minutes\u0027 notice, on the first anniversary of Lincoln\u0027s assassination, he was called upon to move an adjournment of the House, as a mark of respect to the martyred President, he was able from memory to quote in his brief speech, as applicable to Lincoln, the poet\u0027s description of some\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Divinely gifted man,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whose life in low estate began,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And on a simple village green,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who breaks his birth\u0027s invidious bars,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And grasped the skirts of happy chance,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And breasts the blows of circumstance,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And grapples with his evil stars;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who makes by force his merit known,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And lives to clutch the golden keys\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To mould a mighty state\u0027s decrees,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And shape the whisper of the throne;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And moving up from high to higher,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Becomes on Fortune\u0027s crowning slope\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The pillar of a people\u0027s hope,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The center of a world\u0027s desire.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I am only repeating the remark made by many when I call attention to the fitness of this description to Garfield himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Our young student was fortunate in possessing a most retentive memory. What he liked, especially in the works of his favorite poet, was so impressed upon his memory that he could recite extracts by the hour. This will enable the reader to understand how thoroughly he studied, and how readily he mastered, those branches of knowledge to which his attention was drawn. When in after years in Congress some great public question came up, which required hard study, it was the custom of his party friends to leave Garfield to study it, with the knowledge that in due time he would be ready with a luminous exposition which would supply to them the place of individual study.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Young Garfield was anxious to learn the language of Goethe and Schiller, and embraced the opportunity afforded at college to enter upon the study of German.

Should he leave college to earn more? Fortunately, this was not necessary. Thomas Garfield, always unselfishly devoted to the family, hoped to supply his younger brother with the necessary sum, in installments; but proving unable, his old friend, Dr. Robinson, came to his assistance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can pay me when you are able, James,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If I live I will pay you, doctor.

The strong, vigorous young man had no difficulty in securing a policy from a reputable company, and went back to college at the commencement of the Senior year.
