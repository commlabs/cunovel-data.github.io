Or use your hands, at least.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Thanks, Crump, but I ain’t that desperate yet.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a comfortable life, all things considered. True,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalaz City was hardly a jewel of the empire, but at least it wasn’t likely to fall apart and sink in a storm. And he’d had no real complaints about the company he kept. Coop’s had its assortment of fools, enough to make Withal feel as if he belonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBraven Tooth. Temper. Banaschar-and at least Banaschar was here, the one familiar face beyond a trio of Nachts and, of course, his wife. Of course. Her. And though an Elder God had told him to wait, the Meckros blacksmith would have been content to see that waiting last for ever. Damn the gods, anyway, with their constant meddling, they way they just use us. As they like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after what had to be a year spent on the same ship as the Adjunct, Withal could not claim to know her. True, there had been that prolonged period of grief-Tavore’s lover had been killed in Malaz City, he’d been told-and the Adjunct had seemed, for a time, like a woman more dead than alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she was now back to herself, then, well, her self wasn’t much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gods didn’t care. They’d decided to use her as much as they had used him. He could see it, that bleak awareness in her unremarkable eyes. And if she had decided to stand against them, then she stood alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would never have the courage for that. Not even close. But maybe, to do what she’s doing, she has to make herself less than human. More than human? Choosing to be less to be more, perhaps. So many here might see her as surrounded by allies. Allies such as Withal himself, Banaschar, Sandalath, Sinn and Keneb. But he knew better. We all watch. Waiting. Wondering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUndecided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs this what you wanted, Mael? To deliver me to her? Yes, she was who I was waiting for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading, inevitably, to that most perplexing question: But why me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue, he could tell her of the sword. His sword. The tool he had hammered and pounded into life for the Crippled God. But there was no answering that weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet the Adjunct was undeterred. Choosing a war not even her soldiers wanted. With the aim of bringing down an empire. And the Emperor who held that sword in his hands. An Emperor driven mad by his own power. Another tool of the gods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to feel easy about all this. Hard to find any confidence in the Adjunct’s bold decision. The marines had been flung onto the Letherii shore, not a single landing en masse, in strength, but one scattered, clandestine, at night. Then, as if to defy the tactic, the transports had been set aflame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn announcement to be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are here. Find us, if you dare. But be assured, in time we will find you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile most of another legion remained in ships well off the Letherii coast. And the Adjunct alone knew where the Khundryl had gone. And most of the Perish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have taken to brooding, husband.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal slowly lifted his head and regarded the onyx-skinned woman sitting opposite him in the cabin. ‘I am a man of deep thoughts,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re a lazy toad trapped in a pit of self-obsession.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That, too.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We will soon be ashore. I would have thought you’d be eager at the gunnel, given all your groaning and moaning. Mother Dark knows, I would never have known you for a Meckros with your abiding hatred of the sea.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Abiding hatred, is it? No, more like… frustration.’ He lifted his huge hands. ‘Repairing ships is a speciality. But it’s not mine. I need to be back doing what I do best, wife.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Horseshoes?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Precisely.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Shield-rims? Dagger-hilts? Swords?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If need be.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Armies always drag smiths with them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not my speciality.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Rubbish. You can fold iron into a blade as well as any weaponsmith.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Seen plenty of ‘em, have you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘With a life as long as mine has been, I’ve seen too much of everything. Now, our young miserable charges are probably down in the hold again. Will you get them or will I?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is it truly time to leave?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think the Adjunct is already off.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You go. They still make my skin crawl.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose. ‘You lack sympathy, which is characteristic of self-obsession. These Tiste Andii are young, Withal. Abandoned first by Anomander Rake. Then by Andarist. Brothers and sisters fallen in pointless battle. Too many losses-they are caught in the fragility of the world, in the despair it delivers to their souls.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-205.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
