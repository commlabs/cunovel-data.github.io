My days of chili dogs are over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee buys Mackenzie a polar bear balloon and they have a long discussion about how many balloons she would need to be able to fly, like in the movie Up. Dee—because she knows about gases like helium—was actually able to figure out how many on her calculator. Mackenzie was totally impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just hope she doesn’t get any ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, we’re eating popcorn and watching the penguins. And Mackenzie asks no one in particular, “Did you know the girl penguins got the boy penguins by the balls?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee chokes on a kernel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackenzie doesn’t notice. “Uncle Drew say the girl gets ta pick any boy penguin she wants—they has ta dance for them. Then, the boy penguin has ta carry the egg on his feet for a long time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those girl penguins are some pretty smart cookies,” Delores comments. And Mackenzie nods vigorously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext we move on to the monkeys. I’m not sure of their breed, but they’re small, white little puff balls that can only seem to sit still if they’re trying to mount each other. Delores snorts and Mackenzie says, “They wrestle a lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle. And talk low in Dee’s ear. “These horny little guys are giving me ideas. We should go before I embarrass myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackenzie—because she obviously has dog hearing—asks, “Uncle Matthew, whas ‘horny’ mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m quick with the save. “Excited.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods . . . and files it away in her adorable, unpredictable mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us climb out of the cab back at Alexandra and Steven’s. I hold Mackenzie on my shoulder—she’s half asleep. Dee carries Mackenzie’s balloon and her bag and about a dozen small gift shop items I couldn’t not buy her. Alexandra lets us in, and Mackenzie perks up, trying to rub the weariness from her eyes. I set her on her feet, and she hugs us both, thanking us without being told.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra tells her, “There’s a package on your bed—it came while you were out. I think it’s the Elizabeth American Girl doll Grandma bought for your birthday, the one that was back-ordered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackenzie’s mouth forms a precious O, and she practically vibrates with excitement. “I been waiting for dat! I’m sooo horny!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she scampers out of the foyer to her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra turns stormy eyes on Dee and me. “Care to explain that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rub the back of my neck . . . and then completely throw Steven under the bus. “You should really talk to your husband. He needs to watch his language around Mackenzie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll make it up to him, I swear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee joins in. “Yeah. Kids are like sponges. They just suck up everything around them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the look on Lexi’s face, she’s not buying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should go,” Delores tells me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, we should.” I yawn. “The amphibians really wore me out. Bye, Lexi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bye, Alexandra,” Dee says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, I blow off clubbing with the guys. Dee and I order Chinese takeout and spend the evening fantastically f**king in every room of my apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll never look at my pool table the same way again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pass out in my bed, and I sleep the sleep of the exhausted damned . . . until the rustling of clothing and footsteps wakes me up in the middle of the night. I crack my eyes open to find Dee not next to me in the bed but bustling around the room, searching for her clothes and pulling them on hurriedly when she finds them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dee? Are you all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice is wide awake and tense. “Yeah, I’m fine. Go back to sleep, Matthew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBleary-eyed, I glance at the clock: 3 a.m. “What are you doin’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force myself to sit up, shaking the fog from my head. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because that’s where I live, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what bug crawled up her ass while I was sleeping, but I’m really too tired to argue with her. I throw the blankets off. “Okay. Jus’ give me a minute and I’ll drive you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes scan the floor, spotting her purse in the corner. “Don’t bother. I’ll take a cab.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensing my time is short, I pull on a pair of sweatpants and grab a T-shirt that landed on the nightstand after it was ripped off of me earlier. “Then I’ll take the cab ride with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores stops and pins me with a sharp frown. “It may come as a shock, but I am capable of getting myself home, thank you very much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s three o’clock in the goddamn morning, Delores.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. “It’s not like you live in a bad neighborhood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Manhattan—any neighborhood could be a bad neighborhood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t respond. And she doesn’t wait for me. I clutch my sneakers in my hand and barely remember to take my keys as I jog to keep up with her. Wide awake now, I slip into my shoes on the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, are you pissed off at me about something specific, or is this a more general ‘all men suck’ kind of thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe folds her arms. “I’m not pissed off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTranslation? You’re an ass**le, but you have to figure out why on your own, ’cause I’m not telling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk out of the lobby. I wave the doorman off and hail a cab myself. The ride to Dee’s place is strained and silent. I sneak sideways glances at her—because the quickest way to get your throat ripped out is staring a skittish dog in the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sits stiffly—not exactly angry looking, but anxious—like a cornered animal waiting for the chance to bolt. When we pull up to her building, Dee is out of the cab before the driver comes to a complete stop. I ask him to wait for me, then I hop out after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she slides her key into the locked outer door, I put my hand over hers. “Could you, please, give me a hint about what’s going on in your head right now? ’Cause I’m . . . kinda lost here, Dee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares hard at our hands, then she faces me with a sigh. “This is just . . . you’re moving way too fast for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean my shoulder against her building. “If you wanted me to go slow, all you had to do was say so. Hard, easy, fast, slow—I always aim to please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be cute, Matthew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan’t help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiggles her hands, fanning herself—like she’s on the edge of a panic attack. “I woke up in your bed and . . . it’s just too much. I feel like I’m suffocating. I need . . . space.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tamed-tangled-3/page-25.html","bookId":1811,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:04 PM"}
