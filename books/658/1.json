Now, go on.\u0026nbsp; Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the country?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; My dear Algy, I don’t know whether you will be able to understand my real motives.\u0026nbsp; You are hardly serious enough.\u0026nbsp; When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects.\u0026nbsp; It’s one’s duty to do so.\u0026nbsp; And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either one’s health or one’s happiness, in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes.\u0026nbsp; That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; The truth is rarely pure and never simple.\u0026nbsp; Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; That wouldn’t be at all a bad thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.\u0026nbsp; Don’t try it.\u0026nbsp; You should leave that to people who haven’t been at a University.\u0026nbsp; They do it so well in the daily papers.\u0026nbsp; What you really are is a Bunburyist.\u0026nbsp; I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist.\u0026nbsp; You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; What on earth do you mean?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.\u0026nbsp; I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.\u0026nbsp; Bunbury is perfectly invaluable.\u0026nbsp; If it wasn’t for Bunbury’s extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldn’t be able to dine with you at Willis’s to-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I haven’t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; I know.\u0026nbsp; You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations.\u0026nbsp; It is very foolish of you.\u0026nbsp; Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; I haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind.\u0026nbsp; To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one’s own relations.\u0026nbsp; In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with either no woman at all, or two.\u0026nbsp; In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night.\u0026nbsp; She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.\u0026nbsp; That is not very pleasant.\u0026nbsp; Indeed, it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.\u0026nbsp; The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous.\u0026nbsp; It looks so bad.\u0026nbsp; It is simply washing one’s clean linen in public.\u0026nbsp; Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.\u0026nbsp; I want to tell you the rules.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I’m not a Bunburyist at all.\u0026nbsp; If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed I think I’ll kill him in any case.\u0026nbsp; Cecily is a little too much interested in him.\u0026nbsp; It is rather a bore.\u0026nbsp; So I am going to get rid of Ernest.\u0026nbsp; And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr. . . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury.\u0026nbsp; A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; That is nonsense.\u0026nbsp; If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly won’t want to know Bunbury.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Then your wife will.\u0026nbsp; You don’t seem to realise, that in married life three is company and two is none.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [Sententiously.]\u0026nbsp; That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; For heaven’s sake, don’t try to be cynical.\u0026nbsp; It’s perfectly easy to be cynical.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; My dear fellow, it isn’t easy to be anything nowadays.\u0026nbsp; There’s such a lot of beastly competition about.\u0026nbsp; [The sound of an electric bell is heard.]\u0026nbsp; Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta.\u0026nbsp; Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.\u0026nbsp; Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to Gwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis’s?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I suppose so, if you want to.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Yes, but you must be serious about it.\u0026nbsp; I hate people who are not serious about meals.\u0026nbsp; It is so shallow of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Enter Lane.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lane.\u0026nbsp; Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Algernon goes forward to meet them.\u0026nbsp; Enter Lady Bracknell and Gwendolen.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; I’m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; That’s not quite the same thing.\u0026nbsp; In fact the two things rarely go together.\u0026nbsp; [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; [To Gwendolen.]\u0026nbsp; Dear me, you are smart!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; I am always smart!\u0026nbsp; Am I not, Mr. Worthing?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; You’re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Oh! I hope I am not that.\u0026nbsp; It would leave no room for developments, and I intend to develop in many directions.\u0026nbsp; [Gwendolen and Jack sit down together in the corner.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; I’m sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury.\u0026nbsp; I hadn’t been there since her poor husband’s death.\u0026nbsp; I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.\u0026nbsp; And now I’ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Certainly, Aunt Augusta.\u0026nbsp; [Goes over to tea-table.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Won’t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Thanks, mamma, I’m quite comfortable where I am.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; [Picking up empty plate in horror.]\u0026nbsp; Good heavens!\u0026nbsp; Lane!\u0026nbsp; Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?\u0026nbsp; I ordered them specially.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lane.\u0026nbsp; [Gravely.]\u0026nbsp; There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.\u0026nbsp; I went down twice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; No cucumbers!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lane.\u0026nbsp; No, sir.\u0026nbsp; Not even for ready money.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; That will do, Lane, thank you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lane.\u0026nbsp; Thank you, sir.\u0026nbsp; [Goes out.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; It really makes no matter, Algernon.\u0026nbsp; I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; It certainly has changed its colour.\u0026nbsp; From what cause I, of course, cannot say.\u0026nbsp; [Algernon crosses and hands tea.]\u0026nbsp; Thank you.\u0026nbsp; I’ve quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon.\u0026nbsp; I am going to send you down with Mary Farquhar.\u0026nbsp; She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.\u0026nbsp; It’s delightful to watch them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; [Frowning.]\u0026nbsp; I hope not, Algernon.\u0026nbsp; It would put my table completely out.\u0026nbsp; Your uncle would have to dine upstairs.\u0026nbsp; Fortunately he is accustomed to that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.\u0026nbsp; [Exchanges glances with Jack.]\u0026nbsp; They seem to think I should be with him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; It is very strange.\u0026nbsp; This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.\u0026nbsp; This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.\u0026nbsp; Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.\u0026nbsp; I consider it morbid.\u0026nbsp; Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.\u0026nbsp; Health is the primary duty of life.\u0026nbsp; I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment goes.\u0026nbsp; I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.\u0026nbsp; It is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Algernon.\u0026nbsp; I’ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I think I can promise you he’ll be all right by Saturday.\u0026nbsp; Of course the music is a great difficulty.\u0026nbsp; You see, if one plays good music, people don’t listen, and if one plays bad music people don’t talk.\u0026nbsp; But I’ll run over the programme I’ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Thank you, Algernon.\u0026nbsp; It is very thoughtful of you.\u0026nbsp; [Rising, and following Algernon.]\u0026nbsp; I’m sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations.\u0026nbsp; French songs I cannot possibly allow.\u0026nbsp; People always seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.\u0026nbsp; But German sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so.\u0026nbsp; Gwendolen, you will accompany me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Certainly, mamma.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains behind.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Pray don’t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing.\u0026nbsp; Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean something else.\u0026nbsp; And that makes me so nervous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I do mean something else.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; I thought so.\u0026nbsp; In fact, I am never wrong.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell’s temporary absence . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; I would certainly advise you to do so.\u0026nbsp; Mamma has a way of coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [Nervously.]\u0026nbsp; Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more than any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.\u0026nbsp; And I often wish that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.\u0026nbsp; For me you have always had an irresistible fascination.\u0026nbsp; Even before I met you I was far from indifferent to you.\u0026nbsp; [Jack looks at her in amazement.]\u0026nbsp; We live, as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals.\u0026nbsp; The fact is constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has reached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been to love some one of the name of Ernest.\u0026nbsp; There is something in that name that inspires absolute confidence.\u0026nbsp; The moment Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; You really love me, Gwendolen?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Passionately!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Darling!\u0026nbsp; You don’t know how happy you’ve made me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; My own Ernest!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; But you don’t really mean to say that you couldn’t love me if my name wasn’t Ernest?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; But your name is Ernest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Yes, I know it is.\u0026nbsp; But supposing it was something else?\u0026nbsp; Do you mean to say you couldn’t love me then?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; [Glibly.]\u0026nbsp; Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the actual facts of real life, as we know them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don’t much care about the name of Ernest . . . I don’t think the name suits me at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; It suits you perfectly.\u0026nbsp; It is a divine name.\u0026nbsp; It has a music of its own.\u0026nbsp; It produces vibrations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of other much nicer names.\u0026nbsp; I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at all, indeed.\u0026nbsp; It does not thrill.\u0026nbsp; It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain.\u0026nbsp; Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John!\u0026nbsp; And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John.\u0026nbsp; She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment’s solitude.\u0026nbsp; The only really safe name is Ernest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Gwendolen, I must get christened at once—I mean we must get married at once.\u0026nbsp; There is no time to be lost.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Married, Mr. Worthing?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [Astounded.]\u0026nbsp; Well . . . surely.\u0026nbsp; You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; I adore you.\u0026nbsp; But you haven’t proposed to me yet.\u0026nbsp; Nothing has been said at all about marriage.\u0026nbsp; The subject has not even been touched on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Well . . . may I propose to you now?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; I think it would be an admirable opportunity.\u0026nbsp; And to spare you any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you quite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Gwendolen!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; You know what I have got to say to you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Yes, but you don’t say it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Gwendolen, will you marry me?\u0026nbsp; [Goes on his knees.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Of course I will, darling.\u0026nbsp; How long you have been about it!\u0026nbsp; I am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Yes, but men often propose for practice.\u0026nbsp; I know my brother Gerald does.\u0026nbsp; All my girl-friends tell me so.\u0026nbsp; What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest!\u0026nbsp; They are quite, quite, blue.\u0026nbsp; I hope you will always look at me just like that, especially when there are other people present.\u0026nbsp; [Enter Lady Bracknell.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Mr. Worthing!\u0026nbsp; Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture.\u0026nbsp; It is most indecorous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; Mamma!\u0026nbsp; [He tries to rise; she restrains him.]\u0026nbsp; I must beg you to retire.\u0026nbsp; This is no place for you.\u0026nbsp; Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished yet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Finished what, may I ask?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp; I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.\u0026nbsp; [They rise together.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.\u0026nbsp; When you do become engaged to some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will inform you of the fact.\u0026nbsp; An engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.\u0026nbsp; It is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing.\u0026nbsp; While I am making these inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the carriage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gwendolen.\u0026nbsp;

Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; [Pencil and note-book in hand.]\u0026nbsp; I feel bound to tell you that you are not down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.\u0026nbsp; We work together, in fact.\u0026nbsp; However, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be what a really affectionate mother requires.\u0026nbsp; Do you smoke?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; I am glad to hear it.\u0026nbsp; A man should always have an occupation of some kind.\u0026nbsp; There are far too many idle men in London as it is.\u0026nbsp; How old are you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Twenty-nine.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; A very good age to be married at.\u0026nbsp; I have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing.\u0026nbsp; Which do you know?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; [After some hesitation.]\u0026nbsp; I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; I am pleased to hear it.\u0026nbsp; I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance.\u0026nbsp; Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.\u0026nbsp; The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound.\u0026nbsp; Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever.\u0026nbsp; If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.\u0026nbsp; What is your income?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; Between seven and eight thousand a year.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; [Makes a note in her book.]\u0026nbsp; In land, or in investments?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; In investments, chiefly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Bracknell.\u0026nbsp; That is satisfactory.\u0026nbsp; What between the duties expected of one during one’s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one’s death, land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.\u0026nbsp; It gives one position, and prevents one from keeping it up.\u0026nbsp; That’s all that can be said about land.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack.\u0026nbsp; I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about fifteen hundred acres, I believe;
