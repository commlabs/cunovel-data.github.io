She wasn\u0027t powerful enough to destroy the vampire or his witch wife, but destroying their daughter would hurt them far worse than any physical pain she could inflict, and they deserved to be destroyed. They had killed Anthony Loken, the only man she had ever loved, and Myra had been killed that same night. Serafina didn\u0027t know how Myra had died, or who had killed her, but she was certain that, one way or another, Roshan DeLongpre had been responsible for her death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerafina smiled. She wasn\u0027t sorry that Myra was gone. She had always been jealous of Myra, jealous of her power, jealous of her association with Anthony. With Myra\u0027s death, the Wiccan Way Coffee Shop and Book Store had closed and the coven had been without a leader, but not for long. When no one else seemed inclined to take over, Serafina had stepped in and taken charge. She had opened a new bookstore on the other side of town and offered it to the coven for a place to meet. Now, twenty years later, she was the undisputed head of the coven and The Wiccan Heart was thriving. When Anton grew old enough to work, she had made him her partner in the bookstore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that night, alone in her room, Serafina spoke to her beloved\u0027s photo. \"Soon, Anthony, soon your death will be avenged and you\u0027ll be able to rest in peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed his picture to her breast. She had fallen in love with Anthony Loken the first moment she had seen him, so tall and blond, like one of Satan\u0027s angels. She would never forget the day Myra had introduced her to Anthony. He had smiled at Serafina, and she had known that he loved her in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night, during a spring ritual shortly before his death, she had offered herself to him. Anton was the result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony had never known of her love for him or about the child she had conceived. By the time she knew she was pregnant, he was gone. She had raised her son alone, teaching him everything she knew about Magick and witchcraft, whispering to him late at night that he would be the instrument that would bring down the people responsible for his father\u0027s death. And always, in the back of her mind, she clung to the sure knowledge that Anthony had loved her, assured herself every day that if he had lived, he would have married her and claimed Anton as his son. She believed it with every fiber of her being, her surety growing more unshakeable with every passing year, until she had convinced herself that Anthony had not only loved her, but married her before he died. If DeLongpre and his witch wife hadn\u0027t destroyed her beloved, Anthony would have been hers for all eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though her beloved was gone, Serafina refused to let him go. His clothing filled her closet. His books and journals were in a trunk in her basement. Each Beltane, she made a list of seven reasons why she loved Anthony Loken. When her list was complete, she drew a circle of power on the floor of her bedroom. She sat on one side of the circle and on the other she placed a life-sized rag doll that she had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edressed in Anthony\u0027s clothes. Sitting in the circle, she read her list. The reasons were different each year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finished reading her list, she took her make-believe Anthony\u0027s hand in hers and said, \"I will love you forever because you\u0027re you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed his image, then placed the photograph on her dresser. Soon his death would be avenged and when the deed was done, she would join him in the After World where they would finally be together forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that thought in mind, Serafina crawled into bed, one of Anthony\u0027s handkerchiefs clutched to her breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would dream of him again tonight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-3.html","bookId":2300,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM"}
