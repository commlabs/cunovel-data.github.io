Yards and yards of wet sand. The sea rests behind them. White sunlight, purple at the edges, hangs above the couple. Because of their hair you can tell it\u0027s windy. He\u0027s sipping a drink from a coconut shell. She\u0027s smelling a purple lei hanging from her neck. In another photo she\u0027s (improbably) petting a swan. Bobby Hughes stands behind her, smiling (also improbably) in a kind way. In the last photo Bobby Hughes is kneeling behind the girl, helping her pick a tulip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl in all three photos is Lauren Hynde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start weeping again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s...

I don\u0027t know what it means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon takes it from me. \"Thank you, Victor,\" he says genuinely, slipping it into his folder without even looking at it. \"Victor, I want you to calm down. We will be in touch. It might even be tomorrow-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But since I last saw you, Palakon, they blew up a f**king hotel,\" I shout. \"They killed the French premier\u0027s son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ward,\" Palakon says gently, \"other factions have already taken blame for the bombing at the Ritz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What other factions?\" I\u0027m shouting. \"They did it.
