I didn\u0027t know it, but I was just sickening for tonsillitis\n\u003cbr\u003e and grippe and lots of things mixed. I\u0027m in the infirmary now,\n\u003cbr\u003e and have been here for six days; this is the first time they would let\n\u003cbr\u003e me sit up and have a pen and paper. The head nurse is very bossy. \n\u003cbr\u003e But I\u0027ve been thinking about it all the time and I shan\u0027t get well\n\u003cbr\u003e until you forgive me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here is a picture of the way I look, with a bandage tied around\n\u003cbr\u003e my head in rabbit\u0027s ears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Doesn\u0027t that arouse your sympathy? I am having sublingual\n\u003cbr\u003e gland swelling. And I\u0027ve been studying physiology all the year without\n\u003cbr\u003e ever hearing of sublingual glands. How futile a thing is education!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I can\u0027t write any more; I get rather shaky when I sit up too long. \n\u003cbr\u003e Please forgive me for being impertinent and ungrateful. I was badly\n\u003cbr\u003e brought up.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours with love,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy Abbott\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59738.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
