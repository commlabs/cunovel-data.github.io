My husband, Seth, and I lost our business, The Lighthouse restaurant --- to arson. The investigation continues. The prime suspect is a young ex-employee named Anson Butler, who disappeared right after the fire. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eSo Seth and I are trying to sort out our lives. (And let me tell you, this kind of crisis is not good for a marriage.) In the meantime, life goes on for everyone else in Cedar Cove --- with marriages, births, reunions and even the occasional scandal. One of the most interesting pieces of news is that Cal, who works on Cliff Harding\u0027s ranch, is now rescuing wild mustangs from Wyoming. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eI have to run --- I\u0027m meeting an old friend, Warren Saget, for lunch.
