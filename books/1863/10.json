Her mind was clicking through strategies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo exits-but to go out the window meant a three-story drop, and she probably wouldn\u0027t survive that in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher condition. Although, of course, she couldn\u0027t leave anyway without doing something to silence\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead-and she wouldn\u0027t survive a fight, either....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suppressed any feeling, returned Morgead\u0027s gaze, and said calmly, \"And why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriumph flashed in his eyes. \"Jez Redfern.

She didn\u0027t let it show. \"You idiot! Of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecourse not. I don\u0027t run errands for the Council.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead\u0027s lip lifted. \"I didn\u0027t say the Council. I said Hunter Redfern.

I told the Council my terms.

But she could see from his eyes that she had him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away sharply and went to glower out the window. Jez could practically see the wheels turning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein his head. Finally he looked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said coldly. \"Ill join Hunter\u0027s team-but only on my terms. After the millennium-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After the millennium you\u0027ll get what you deserve.\" Jez couldn\u0027t help glaring back at him. Morgead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebrought out all her worst traits, all the things she tried to control in herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll get a position,\" she amended, spinning the story she knew he wanted to hear. She was winging it,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut she had no choice. \"Hunter wants people loyal to him in the new order. And if you can prove you\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evaluable, he\u0027ll want you. But first you have to prove it. Okay? Deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I can trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can trust each other because we have to. We both want the same thing.

It was as if the blood sharing had never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappened. They were back to their old roles- maybe a little more hostile, but the same old Jez and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead, enjoying being adversaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it\u0027ll be easy from now on, Jez thought. As long as Hunter doesn\u0027t show up to blow my story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she grinned inwardly. It would never happen. Hunter Redfern hadn\u0027t visited the West Coast for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efifty years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Business,\" she said crisply, out loud. \"Where\u0027s the Wild Power, Morgead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ill show you.\" He walked over to the futon and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez stayed where she was. \"You\u0027ll show me what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show you the Wild Power.\" There was a TV with a VCR at the foot of the bed, sitting on the bare\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efloor. Morgead was putting a tape in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez settled on the far end of the futon, glad for the chance to sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got the Wild Power on tape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw her an icy glance over his shoulder. \"Yeah, on America\u0027s Funniest Home Videos. Just shut up,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez, and watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez narrowed her eyes and watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she was looking at was a TV movie about a doomsday asteroid. A movie she\u0027d seen-it had been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eawful. Suddenly the action was interrupted by the logo of a local news station. A blond anchorwoman\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecame on screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breaking news in San Francisco this hour. We have live pictures from the Marina district where a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efive-alarm fire is raging through a government housing project. We go now to Linda Chin, who\u0027s on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003escene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene switched to a dark-haired reporter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Regina, I\u0027m here at Taylor Street, where firefighters are trying to prevent this spectacular blaze from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espreading-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez looked from the TV to Morgead. \"What\u0027s this got to do with the Wild Power? I saw it live. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappened a couple weeks ago. I was watching that stupid movie-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke off, shocked at herself. She\u0027d actually been about to say \"I was watching that stupid movie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith Claire and Aunt Nan.\" Just like that, to blurt out the names of the humans she lived with. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclenched her teeth, furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d already let Morgead know one thing: that a couple of weeks ago she\u0027d been in this area, where a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elocal news station could break in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was wrong with her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead tilted a sardonic glance at her, just to show her that he hadn\u0027t missed her slip. But all he said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas \"Keep watching. You\u0027ll see what it\u0027s got to do with the Wild Power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn screen the flames were brilliant orange, dazzling against the background of darkness. So bright that if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez hadn\u0027t known that area of the Marina district well, she wouldn\u0027t have been able to tell much about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of the building firefighters in yellow were carrying hoses. Smoke flooded out suddenly as one of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe hoses sprayed a straight line of water into the flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their greatest fear is that there may be a little girl still inside this complex-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. That was what Jez remembered about this fire. There had been a kid....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look here,\" Morgead said, pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera was zooming in on something, bringing the flames in close. A window in the pinky-brown\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econcrete of the building. High up, on the third floor. Flames were pouring up from the walkway below it,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emaking the whole area look too dangerous to approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter was still talking, but Jez had tuned her out. She leaned closer, eyes fixed on that window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike all the other windows, it was half covered with a wrought-iron screen in a diamond pattern. Unlike\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe others, it had something else: On the sill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere were a couple of plastic buckets with dirt and scraggly plants. A window box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a face looking out between the plants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA child\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" Morgead said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter was speaking. \"Regina, the firefighters say there is definitely someone on the third floor of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis building. They are looking for a way to approach the person-the little girl-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh-powered searchlights had been turned on the flames. That was the only reason the girl was visible\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat all. Even so, Jez couldn\u0027t distinguish any features. The girl was a small blurry blob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirefighters were trying to maneuver some kind of ladder toward the building. People were running,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eappearing and disappearing in the swirling smoke. The scene was eerie, otherworldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez remembered this, remembered listening to the barely suppressed horror in the reporter\u0027s voice,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremembered Claire beside her hissing in a sharp breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a kid,\" Claire had said, grabbing Jez\u0027s arm and digging her nails in, momentarily forgetting how much\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe disliked Jez. \"Oh, God, a kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I said something like, \"It\u0027ll be okay,\" Jez remembered. But I knew it wouldn\u0027t be. There was too\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emuch fire. There wasn\u0027t a chance....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter was saying, \"The entire building is involved....\" And the camera was going in for a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclose-up again, and Jez remembered realizing that they were actually going to show this girl burning alive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plastic buckets were melting. The firemen were trying to do something with the ladder. And then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere was a sudden huge burst of orange, an explosion, as the flames below the window poofed and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebegan pouring themselves upward with frantic energy. They were so bright they seemed to suck all the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elight out of their surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey engulfed the girl\u0027s window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter\u0027s voice broke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez remembered Claire gasping, \"No...\" and her nails drawing blood. She remembered wanting to shut\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher own eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, suddenly, the TV screen flickered and a huge wall of smoke billowed out from the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack smoke, then gray, then a light gray that looked almost white. Everything was lost in the smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it finally cleared a little, the reporter was staring up at the building in open amazement, forgetting to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturn toward the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is astonishing....

It was still difficult to make out features, but Jez could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esee coffee-colored skin and what seemed to be a calm expression. Then a hand reached out to gently\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epick up one of the melted plastic buckets and take it inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture froze. Morgead had hit Pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They never did figure out what stopped the fire.

And it moved. It started out small, a circular spot right at the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewindow. In the next frame it was much bigger, spreading out in all directions, fingers reaching into the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflames. In the next frame it covered the entire TV screen, seeming to engulf the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next frame it was gone and the fire was gone with it. White smoke began to creep out of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez was riveted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddess,\" she whispered. \"Blue fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead ran the tape back to play the scene again. \" \u0027In blue fire, the final darkness is banished; In\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblood, the final price is paid.\u0027 If that girl isn\u0027t a Wild Power, Jez ... then what is she?

She saw the blue fire in front of Coit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTower or something. And everybody knows that the four Wild Powers are supposed to start manifesting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethemselves around now. I think that girl did it for the first time when she realized she was going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got that desperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez could picture that kind of desperation; she\u0027d pictured it the first time, when she\u0027d been watching the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efire live. How it must feel... being trapped like that. Knowing that there was no earthly help for you, that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou were about to experience the most terrible pain imaginable. Knowing that you were going to feel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour body char and your hair burn like a torch and that it would take two or three endless minutes before\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou died and the horror was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, you would be desperate, all right. Knowing all that might drag a new power out of you, a frantic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eburst of strength, like an unconscious scream pulled from the depths of yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut one thing bothered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If this kid is the Wild Power, why didn\u0027t her Circle notice what happened? Why didn\u0027t she tell them,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hey, guys, look; I can put out fires now?\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead looked annoyed. \"What do you mean, her Circle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she\u0027s a witch, right? You\u0027re not telling me vampires or shapeshifters are developing new powers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who said anything about witches or vampires or shapeshifters? The kid\u0027s human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd blinked again, trying to conceal the extent of her astonishment. For a moment she thought Morgead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas putting her on, but his green eyes were simply exasperated, not sly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Wild Powers... can be human?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead smiled suddenly-a smirk. \"You really didn\u0027t know. You haven\u0027t heard all the prophecies, have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou?\" He struck a mocking oratorical pose. \"There\u0027s supposed to be:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne from the land of kings long forgotten; One from the hearth which still holds the spark; One from the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay World where two eyes are\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewatching; One from the twilight to be one with the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Day World, Jez thought. Not the Night World, the human world. At least one of the Wild Powers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad to be human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbelievable... but why not? Wild Powers were supposed to be weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she thought of something and her stomach sank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No wonder you\u0027re so eager to turn her in,\" she said softly. \"Not just to get a reward-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But because the little scum deserves to die-or whatever it is Hunter has in mind for her.\" Morgead\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evoice was matter-of-fact. \"Yeah, vermin have no right developing Night World powers. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course right,\" Jez said without emotion. I\u0027m going to have to watch this kid every minute, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought. He\u0027s got no pity at all for her-Goddess knows what he might do before letting me have her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez.\" Morgead\u0027s voice was soft, almost pleasant, but it caught Jez\u0027s full attention. \"Why didn\u0027t Hunter tell\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou that prophecy? The Council dug it up last week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at him and felt an inner shiver. Suspicion was cold in the depths of his green eyes. When\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead was yelling and furious he was dangerous enough, but when he was quiet like this, he was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea,\" she said flatly, tossing the problem back at him. \"Maybe because I was already out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehere in California when they figured it out. But why don\u0027t you call him and ask yourself? I\u0027m sure he\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elove to hear from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. Then Morgead gave her a look of disgust and turned away. A good bluff is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epriceless, Jez thought. It was safe now to move on. She said, \"So what do the \u0027two eyes watching\u0027 mean\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the prophecy?\" He rolled his own eyes. \"How should I know? You figure it out. You\u0027ve always been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe smart one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the heavy sarcasm, Jez felt a different kind of shiver, one of surprise. He really believed that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead was so smart himself-he\u0027d seen that flicker on the TV screen and realized what it was, when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eapparently none of the adults in the Bay Area had-but he thought she was smarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you seem to be doing all right yourself,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been looking steadily at him, to show him no weakness, and she saw his expression change. His\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egreen eyes softened slightly, and the sarcastic quirk of his lip straightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah, I\u0027m just blundering along,\" he muttered, his gaze shifting. Then he glanced back up and somehow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey were caught in a moment when they were just looking at each other in silence. Neither of them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned away, and Jez\u0027s heart gave a strange thump. The moment stretched. Idiot! This is ridiculous. A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eminute ago you were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003escared of him-not to mention sickened by his attitude toward humans. You can\u0027t just suddenly switch to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was no good. Even the realization that she was in danger of her life didn\u0027t help. Jez couldn\u0027t think\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof a thing to say to break the tension, and she couldn\u0027t seem to look away from Morgead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez, look-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward and put a hand on her forearm. He didn\u0027t even seem to know he was doing it. His\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexpression was abstracted now, and his eyes were fixed on hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand was warm. Tingles spread from the place where it touched Jez\u0027s skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez... about before ... I didn\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Jez\u0027s heart was beating far too quickly. I have to say something, she thought, fighting to keep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher face impassive. But her throat was dry and her mind a humming blank. All she could feel clearly was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe place where she and Morgead touched. All she could see clearly was his eyes. Cat\u0027s eyes, deepest\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eemerald, with shifting green lights in them....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez,\" he said a third time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jez realized all at once that the silver thread between them hadn\u0027t been broken. That it might be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estretched almost into invisibility, but it was still there, still pulling, trying to make her body go weak and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher vision blur. Trying to make her fall toward Morgead even as he was falling toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then came the sound of someone kicking in the front door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-10.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
