There was a jolt when the coffin hit bottom, then the rainlike sound of the first hand-fuls of soil being tossed upon the lid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence after that, until the grave diggers began shoveling the earth back into the grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first few shovelfuls fell like bricks. The heavy dull thuds shook the coffin. As the grave filled and earth piled up between me and the topside world, the sounds of the living grew softer, until finally they were only faraway muffles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end there were faint pounding noises, as they patted the mound of earth flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then complete silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay in the quiet darkness, listening to the earth settle, imagining the sound of worms crawling toward me through the dirt. I\u0027d thought it would be scary but it was actually quite peaceful. I felt safe down here, protected from the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent the time thinking about the last few weeks, the flyer for the freak show, the strange force that had made me close my eyes and reach blindly for the ticket, my first glimpse of the dark theater, the cool balcony where I had watched Steve talking with Mr. Crepsley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were so many important moments. If I\u0027d missed the ticket, I wouldn\u0027t be here. If I hadn\u0027t gone to the show, I wouldn\u0027t be here. If I hadn\u0027t stuck around to see what Steve was up to, I wouldn\u0027t be here. If I hadn\u0027t stolen Madam Octa, I wouldn\u0027t be here. If I\u0027d said no to Mr. Crepsley\u0027s offer, I wouldn\u0027t be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA world of \"ifs,\" but it made no difference. What was done was done. If I could go back in time...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t. The past was behind me. The best thing now would be to stop looking over my shoulder. It was time to forget the past and look to the present and future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the hours passed, movement returned. It came to my fingers first, which curled into fists, then slipped from my chest, where they had been crossed by the undertaker. I flexed them several times, slowly, working the itches out of my palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes opened next but that wasn\u0027t much good. Open or closed, it was all the same down here: perfect darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feelings brought pain. My back ached from where I\u0027d fallen out of the window. My lungs, and heart having been out of the habit of beating hurt. My legs were cramped, my neck was stiff. The only part of me that escaped the pain was my right big toe!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was when I started breathing that I began to worry about the air in the coffin. Mr. Crepsley had said I could survive for up to a week in my coma-like state. I didn\u0027t need to eat or use the toilet or breathe. But now that my breath was back, I became aware of the small amount of air and how quickly I was using it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t panic. Panic would make me gasp and use more air. I remained calm and breathed softly. Lay as still as I could: movement makes you breathe more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no way of knowing the time. I tried counting inside my head but kept losing track of the numbers and having to go back and start over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sang silent songs to myself and told stories beneath my breath. I wished they\u0027d buried me with a TV or a radio, but I guess there\u0027s not much call for such items among the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, after what seemed like several centuries stacked one on top of the other, the sounds of digging reached my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dug quicker than any human, so fast it seemed he wasn\u0027t digging at all, but rather sucking the soil out. He reached me in what must have been record time, less than fifteen minutes. As far as I was concerned, it wasn\u0027t a moment too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knocked three times on the coffin lid, then started unscrewing it. It took a couple of minutes, then he threw the lid wide open and I found myself staring up at the most beautiful night sky I had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and sat up, coughing. It was a fairly dark night but after spending so much time underground it seemed bright as day to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel dead tired.\" I grinned weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at the joke. \"Stand up so I can examine you,\" he said. I winced as I stood: I had pins and needles all over. He ran his fingers lightly up my back, then over my front. \"You were lucky,\" he said. \"No broken bones. Just a bit of bruising, which will die down after a couple of days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled himself up out of the grave, then reached down and gave me a hand up. I was still pretty stiff and sore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel like a pincushion that\u0027s been squashed,\" I complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will take a few days for the aftereffects to pass,\" he said. \"But do not worry: you are in good shape. We are lucky they buried you today. If they had waited another day to put you under, you would be feeling much worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hopped back into the grave and closed the coffin lid. When he emerged, he picked up his shovel and began tossing the earth back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to help?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"You would slow me down. Go for a stroll and walk some of the stiffness out of your bones. I will call when I am ready to move on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you bring my bag?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded at a nearby headstone, from which the bag was hanging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got the bag and checked to see if he\u0027d searched it. There was no sign of his having invaded my privacy, but I couldn\u0027t tell for sure. I\u0027d just have to take him at his word. Anyway, it didn\u0027t matter much: there was nothing in my diary he didn\u0027t already know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went for a walk among the graves, testing my limbs, shaking my legs and arms, enjoying it. Any feeling, even pins and needles, was better than none at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes were stronger than ever before. I was able to read names and dates on headstones from several yards away. It was the vampire blood in me. After all, didn\u0027t vampires spend their whole lives in the dark? I knew I was only a half-vampire, but all the suddenly, as I was thinking about my new powers, a hand reached out from behind one of the graves, wrapped itself around my mouth, then dragged me down to the ground and out of sight of Mr. Crepsley!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and opened my mouth to scream, but then saw something that stopped me dead in my tracks. My attacker, whoever he was, had a hammer and a large wooden stake, the tip of which was pointing directly at my heart! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cirque-du-freak-the-saga-of-darren-shan-1/page-32.html","bookId":1570,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:55 PM"}
