She had a job. It just didn\u0027t seem worth it anymore. I was bored of it by then anyway, and Taylor wasn\u0027t doing it anymore either. Also, I hated the way I looked in my leotard. I got boobs before the whole rest of the class, and in our class picture I looked like I could be the teacher. It was embarrassing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer his question. Instead I said, \"I was really good! I could have been dancing in a company by now!\" I couldn\u0027t have. I wasn\u0027t that good, not by any stretch of the imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" he said mockingly. He looked so smug sitting there on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least I can dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I can dance,\" he protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed my arms. \"Prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have to prove it. I taught you some moves, remember? How quickly we forget.\" Conrad jumped up off the bed and grabbed my hand and twirled me around. \"See? We\u0027re dancing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arm was slung around my waist, and he laughed before he let me go. \"I\u0027m a better dancer than you, Belly,\" he said, collapsing onto his bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. I didn\u0027t get him at all. One minute he was broody and withdrawn, and the next he was laughing and twirling me around the room. \"I don\u0027t consider that dancing,\" I said. I backed out of the room. \"And can you keep your music down? You already woke up the whole house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. Conrad had a way of looking at me, at you, at anybody, that made everything unravel and want to fall at his feet. He said, \"Sure. Good night, Bells.\" Bells, my nickname from a thousand years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made it so hard not to love him. When he was sweet like this, I remembered why I did. Used to love him, I mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter thirty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAGE II\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe summer house had a stack of CDs that we listened to, and that was pretty much it. We spent the whole summer listening to the same CDs. There was the Police, which Susannah put on in the morning; there was Bob Dylan, which she put on in the afternoon; and there was Billie Holiday, which she put on at dinner. The nights were a free-for-all. It was the funniest thing. Jeremiah would put on his Chronic CD, and my mother would be doing laundry, humming along. Even though she hated gangster rap. And then my mother might put on her Aretha Franklin CD, and Jeremiah would sing all the words, because we all knew them by that time, we\u0027d heard it so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy favorite music was the Motown and the beach music. I would listen to it on Susannah\u0027s old Walkman when I tanned. That night I put the Boogie Beach Shag CD on the big stereo in the living room, and Susannah grabbed Jeremiah and started to dance. He\u0027d been playing poker with Steven and Conrad and my mother, who was very, very good at poker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first Jeremiah protested, but then he was dancing too. It was called the shag, and it was a 1960s kind of beach dance. I watched them, Susannah throwing her head back and laughing, and Jeremiah twirling her around, and I wanted to dance too. My feet positively itched to dance. I did dance ballet and modern, after all. I could show off how good I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stevie, dance with me,\" I demanded, poking him with my big toe. I was lying down on the floor, on my stomach, looking up at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right,\" he said. Not that he even knew how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Connie, dance with Belly,\" Susannah urged, her face flushed as Jeremiah twirled her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t dare look at Conrad. I was afraid my love for him and my need for him to say yes would be written on my face like a poem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad sighed. He was still big on doing the right thing then. So he gave me his hand and pulled me up. I got to my feet shakily. He didn\u0027t let go of my hand. \"This is how you shag,\" he said, shuffling his feet from side to side. \"One-two-three, one-two-three, rock step.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a few tries to get it. It was harder than it looked, and I was nervous. \"Get on the beat,\" Steven said from the sidelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look so uptight, Belly. It\u0027s a relaxed kind of dance,\" my mother said from the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to ignore them and look only at Conrad. \"How did you learn this?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom taught both of us,\" Conrad said simply. Then he brought me in close and positioned my arms around his so we stepped together, side by side. \"This is called the cuddle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cuddle was my favorite part. It was the closest I had ever been to him. \"Let\u0027s do it again,\" I said, pretending to be confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe showed me again, putting his arm over mine. \"See? You\u0027re getting it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun me around, and I felt dizzy. With pure, absolute joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter thirty - one\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent the whole next day in the ocean with Cam. We packed a picnic. Cam made avocado and sprout sandwiches with Susannah\u0027s homemade mayonnaise and whole wheat bread. They were good, too. We stayed in the ocean for what felt like hours at a time. Every time a wave began to crest, one of us would start to laugh, and then we\u0027d get overtaken by the wave and water. My eyes burned from the salty seawater, and my skin felt raw from scraping against the sand so many times, like I\u0027d scrubbed my whole body with my mother\u0027s St. Ives Apricot Scrub. It was pretty great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter, we stumbled back to our towels. I loved getting cold and wet in the ocean and then running back to the towels and letting the sun bake the sand off. I could do it all day--ocean, sand, ocean, sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d packed strawberry Fruit Roll-Ups, and we ate them so quick my teeth hurt. \"I love Fruit Roll-Ups,\" I said, reaching for the last one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snatched it away. \"So do I, and you already had three and I only had two,\" he said, peeling away the plastic sheet. He grinned and dangled it above my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have three seconds to hand it over,\" I warned. \"I don\u0027t care if you had two Fruit Roll-Ups and I had twenty. It\u0027s my house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam laughed and popped the whole thing into his mouth. Chewing loudly, he said, \"It\u0027s not your house. It\u0027s Susannah\u0027s house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shows how much you know. It\u0027s all of our house,\" I said, falling back on my towel. I was suddenly really thirsty. Fruit Roll-Ups will do that. Especially when you have three in about three minutes. Squinting up at him, I said, \"Will you go back to our house and get some Kool-Aid? Pretty please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know anyone who consumes more sugar than you do in one day,\" Cam said, shaking his head at me sadly. \"White sugar is evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Says the guy who just ate the last Fruit Roll-Up,\" I countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waste not, want not,\" he said. He stood up and brushed the sand off his shorts. \"I\u0027ll bring you water, not Kool-Aid.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-33.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
