I mean, friends fight. It happens. Look at me and Reeve. Things have been weird with us ever since . . . ever since Christmas.” Alex colors, and I can feel myself blush too. “But I know we’ll hash it out at some point. The same way I know that if Ren hadn’t had that accident, you guys would have too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, we wouldn’t have. Rennie would never have forgiven me for taking Reeve away from her, not in a million years. Alex doesn’t know her like I do. I mean he didn’t, he didn’t know her like I did. But it’s nice of him to say, and it’s so Lindy of him to say it. I offer him a smile and say, “Maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe can tell I don’t mean it. He says, “Listen to what I’m telling you, Lil. Rennie loved you. And you loved her. It would have worked out. When people love each other as much as you did, the love doesn’t just go away. No matter what.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears spring to my eyes. Alex sounds so sure, it gives me hope, even when I have no right to hope for anything. If I’d had the chance to explain, to try to make Ren understand, could we have gotten past it? We were best friends. More than best friends. We were like sisters. That has to count for something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alex . . . thank you for saying that.” I really, truly mean it. He reaches over and gives my hand a squeeze, and the tightness inside me feels a little bit loosened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re still talking when Reeve arrives. I don’t look at him, but I can feel his eyes on me. He strips down and lowers himself into the water and sits at the corner opposite Alex and me. “What are you guys talking about?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” I say, staring down at the foamy water. It gurgles and bubbles like soup that’s about to boil over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“New bikini?” he asks me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a funny look. “It’s Ash’s. She gave it to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is he doing? Especially in front of Alex, of all people. Alex is watching Reeve with narrowed eyes now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh and Derek come out of the house with the wine and beach towels. When they climb into the hot tub, Alex scoots closer to me to make room, and our shoulders touch. Alex bumps my shoulder again, this time on purpose, and he smiles at me, and I smile back. A true smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have any beer, Ash?” Reeve asks suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, there should be some in the fridge,” Ash says, stretching out her arms. “Just make sure you replace them with the beers in the pantry, or my dad will notice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get me a beer too,” Derek says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve gets up. “Cho, come help me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t look at him as I say, “I’m not getting out of the water. It’s too cold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve frowns at me, which I pretend not to see. Then he steps out of the hot tub and stalks off to the house. He can be mad all he wants, but if he thinks I’m going to sneak away with him with our friends right outside, he’s crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Alex I say, “Your skin’s getting red.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex groans. “The plight of the fair-skinned Irish. That’s why I have to marry you, Lil, so I can stop this vicious cycle. Our kids would be so good-looking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncomfortably, I giggle. “As long as they get my fashion sense,” I say, stretching out my legs so my toes float above the water. “And my dance skills. You have no rhythm whatsoever, Lindy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when we’re all out of the hot tub and it’s time to go home, Alex offers to drive me to school for my car. Reeve’s putting his sweater back on, but I know he’s listening to every word. I say, “No, that’s okay. Ash and I have more work to get done tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex looks disappointed, but he leaves, and so do Reeve and Derek. Reeve doesn’t even look at me when he goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstairs in Ash’s room, I go over to her bed to open up my computer, and I look out her window. Reeve’s truck is still here. He’s waiting for me. Reeve needs to understand that he and I aren’t happening, not ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly I look down at my phone and say, “Uh-oh, my mom’s texting me. She wants me home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlin looks up from her computer. She’s in the process of buying a new cashmere sweater. “Just give me two secs, and I’ll drive you back to your car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, that’s okay. The guys haven’t left yet. I’ll get one of them to take me.” I grab my bag and my computer and give Ash a hug, and then I’m running down the stairs and out the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb into Reeve’s truck, and for a moment we’re both silent. He has a scowl on his face. “What’s the matter with you tonight?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fumes. “I wanted to see you, I wanted to have fun, and I walk in on you and Alex cozy in the hot tub, and you won’t even tell me what you were talking about.” He makes an annoyed face, which gets me so mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were talking about Rennie!” I burst out. “And, Reeve, you never want to talk about her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve turns white. “What good does it do to bring up the past? She’s dead. Talking about it isn’t going to bring her back. This thing between you and me is separate from that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it isn’t. We’re the reason Rennie died, and it’s eating me up inside. She never would have been driving around that night if it weren’t for us. She’d have been at her party, where she belonged—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop!” Reeve shouts. I jump. He’s breathing hard. “I don’t want to do this right now, okay? I can’t. So just—stop. Don’t say anything else. Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” He’s shaking. I smooth my hand over his back until his breathing slows down. “It’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can say another word, he’s got me pushed up against the window and he’s kissing me. And I’m kissing him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp; *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we get to the school parking lot an hour later, I pull down the visor mirror and try to fix my hair. It’s a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching me, he says, “You’re the only thing that’s keeping me going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand stills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t not see you,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t look at him, I can’t. “If we’re going to do this, no one can know. It can’t be like what happened tonight. We need to be careful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly he says, “Okay. I’ll do whatever you want. However you want to do it. I feel like I can’t breathe when I’m not with you, Cho.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ashes-to-ashes-burn-for-burn-3/page-15.html","bookId":2728,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM"}
