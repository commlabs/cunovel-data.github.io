No doubt, it is not granted to every one to die, like Cardinal de Berulle, while saying the holy mass, and to breathe forth their souls to God, while pronouncing these words: Hanc igitur oblationem. But without attaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion\u0027s death was very precious. She retained her consciousness to the very last moment. She spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her last commands. If you had a little more faith, and if you could have been in her cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it. She smiled. We felt that she was regaining her life in God. There was something of paradise in that death.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Amen,\" said he.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Father Fauvent, what the dead wish must be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe prioress took off several beads of her chaplet. Fauchelevent held his peace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe went on:--\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our Lord, who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, and who bear wonderful fruit.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Reverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, she is more than a dead woman, she is a saint.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Like yourself, reverend Mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"She slept in her coffin for twenty years, by express permission of our Holy Father, Pius VII.--\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The one who crowned the Emp--Buonaparte.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor a clever man like Fauchelevent, this allusion was an awkward one. Fortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, did not hear it. She continued:--\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Father Fauvent?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Reverend Mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Saint Didorus, Archbishop of Cappadocia, desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb: Acarus, which signifies, a worm of the earth; this was done.

This was done. The dead must be obeyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"So be it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The body of Bernard Guidonis, born in France near Roche-Abeille, was, as he had ordered, and in spite of the king of Castile, borne to the church of the Dominicans in Limoges, although Bernard Guidonis was Bishop of Tuy under of the Saintete Claustrale, he was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty popes, two hundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, four thousand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty-six kings, forty-one queens, three thousand six hundred canonized saints, and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years. On one side Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department! On one side Saint Benoit, on the other the inspector of public ways! The state, the road commissioners, the public undertaker, regulations, the administration, what do we know of all that? There is not a chance passer-by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated. We have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ!

The vocal mothers, whom I have just consulted again, and who are now deliberating, have decided that Mother Crucifixion shall be buried, according to her wish, in her own coffin, under our altar. Think, Father Fauvent, if she were to work miracles here! What a glory of God for the community! And miracles issue from tombs.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But, reverend Mother, if the agent of the sanitary commission--\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Saint Benoit II., in the matter of sepulture, resisted Constantine Pogonatus.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But the commissary of police--\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Chonodemaire, one of the seven German kings who entered among the Gauls under the Empire of Constantius, expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion, that is to say, beneath the altar.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But the inspector from the Prefecture--\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The world is nothing in the presence of the cross. Martin, the eleventh general of the Carthusians, gave to his order this device: Stat crux dum volvitur orbis.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Amen,\" said Fauchelevent, who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma, whenever he heard Latin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAny audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long. On the day when the rhetorician Gymnastoras left his prison, bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in, he halted in front of the first tree which he came to, harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it. The prioress, who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence, and whose reservoir was overfull, rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away:--\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I have on my right Benoit and on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard? The first abbot of Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth. His father was named Tecelin, and his mother Alethe. He began at Citeaux, to end in Clairvaux; he was ordained abbot by the bishop of Chalon-sur-Saone, Guillaume de Champeaux; he had seven hundred novices, and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries; he overthrew Abeilard at the council of Sens in 1140, and Pierre de Bruys and Henry his disciple, and another sort of erring spirits who were called the Apostolics; he confounded Arnauld de Brescia, darted lightning at the monk Raoul, the murderer of the Jews, dominated the council of Reims in 1148, caused the condemnation of Gilbert de Porea, Bishop of Poitiers, caused the condemnation of Eon de l\u0027Etoile, arranged the disputes of princes, enlightened King Louis the Young, advised Pope Eugene III., regulated the Temple, preached the crusade, performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime, and as many as thirty-nine in one day. Who was Benoit? He was the patriarch of Mont-Cassin; he was the second founder of the Saintete Claustrale, he was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty popes, two hundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, four thousand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty-six kings, forty-one queens, three thousand six hundred canonized saints, and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years. On one side Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department! On one side Saint Benoit, on the other the inspector of public ways! The state, the road commissioners, the public undertaker, regulations, the administration, what do we know of all that? There is not a chance passer-by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated. We have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ! Your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention. God subordinated to the commissary of police; such is the age. Silence, Fauvent!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath. The prioress continued:--\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanatics and those in error deny it. We live in times of terrible confusion. We do not know that which it is necessary to know, and we know that which we should ignore. We are ignorant and impious. In this age there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great Saint Bernard and the Saint Bernard denominated of the poor Catholics, a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. Others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross of Jesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merely a king. Let us beware of God! There is no longer just nor unjust. The name of Voltaire is known, but not the name of Cesar de Bus. Nevertheless, Cesar de Bus is a man of blessed memory, and Voltaire one of unblessed memory. The last arch-bishop, the Cardinal de Perigord, did not even know that Charles de Gondren succeeded to Berulle, and Francois Bourgoin to Gondren, and Jean-Francois Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Sainte-Marthe to Jean-Francois Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, but because he furnished Henri IV., the Huguenot king, with the material for an oath. That which pleases people of the world in Saint Francois de Sales, is that he cheated at play. And then, religion is attacked. Why? Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of Gap, was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of them followed Mommol. What has that to do with the question? Does that prevent Martin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his cloak to a beggar? They persecute the saints. They shut their eyes to the truth. Darkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind. No one thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked people are! By order of the king signifies to-day, by order of the revolution. One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead. A holy death is prohibited. Burial is a civil matter. This is horrible. Saint Leo II. wrote two special letters, one to Pierre Notaire, the other to the king of the Visigoths, for the purpose of combating and rejecting, in questions touching the dead, the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of Chalons, held his own in this matter against Otho, Duke of Burgundy. The ancient magistracy agreed with him. In former times we had voices in the chapter, even on matters of the day. The Abbot of Citeaux, the general of the order, was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of Burgundy. We do what we please with our dead. Is not the body of Saint Benoit himself in France, in the abbey of Fleury, called Saint Benoit-sur-Loire, although he died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, on Saturday, the 21st of the month of March, of the year 543? All this is incontestable. I abhor psalm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate heretics, but I should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary. One has only to read Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, and Dom Luc d\u0027Achery.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe prioress took breath, then turned to Fauchelevent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it settled, Father Fauvent?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It is settled, reverend Mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"We may depend on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I will obey.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That is well.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I am entirely devoted to the convent.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That is understood.
