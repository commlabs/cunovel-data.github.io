I won’t let you use a stupid argument like this one to force me to terminate the contract.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. Then you’ll follow orders.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesma tried again, saying mildly, “Why did you come looking for us in the first place, Severance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared at Desma and then at Cidra as they arrived at the Kadys’ octagonal home. Cidra thought he hesitated for an instant before dropping his bombshell. “ExcellEx has moved its main operations to a field camp upriver. They want the sensors delivered there. I’ve made the arrangements. We’re leaving the day after tomorrow. I’ve contracted with a guide who’s taking some other supplies to the camp.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCidra blinked, realizing what that meant. “But my research! I haven’t even started. Severance, I’m not ready to leave Try Again yet. I have so much to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you shouldn’t have wasted an entire evening in a place like the Bloodsucker, should you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesma moved toward the door. “If you’ll excuse me,” she said dryly, “I’m going inside. I’ve got a squeamish stomach.” The deflectors hissed behind her, leaving Severance and Cidra alone on the membrane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Severance, is this really necessary, or are you concocting some excuse to leave town because that man Racer is here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Racer is strictly second-class postage. I wouldn’t let him affect anything I do. We’re leaving at dawn the day after tomorrow because I’m running a business. I’ve contracted to deliver the sensors, and that’s what I’m going to do. As long as you choose to work for me you stay with me. Understood?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, you’re doing an excellent job of making yourself clear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes in brief disgust. “I’m sorry, Cidra. This can’t be helped. The potential of more work for ExcellEx is too good to pass up. There’ll be other opportunities here for you to search the Try Again files.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe considered the matter. “You could leave me behind while you make the run to the field camp.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverance’s eyes were very steady. “Not a chance. I’m not leaving you alone here. As long as you work for me I’m responsible for you. I want you where I can keep an eye on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is Racer, isn’t it? You don’t want me left here near him. Why do you hate him so much, Severance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That subject isn’t open to discussion. Good night, Cidra.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good night, Severance.” She turned stiffly, the hem of her gown swirling around her. “I hope you enjoy what’s left of the night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her arm, spinning her around to face him. She sucked in her breath as she saw the glittering intensity in his eyes. Before she could say anything, he was kissing her, his mouth hard and possessive on hers. She shivered in his grasp, a soft moan echoing far back in her throat. When he lifted his head, Cidra had to put out a hand to steady herself. Wide-eyed, she stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t, you know,” Severance said too calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“W-won’t what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enjoy what’s left of the night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the matter?” she flung back. “Didn’t your arrangements for a little special handling work out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Fred doesn’t take to strangers on board.” He released her and pushed her gently toward the door panels. “Go inside, Cidra. I’ll see you in the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCidra was safely through the panels when she realized with a secret satisfaction that Fred had never seriously objected to her presence on board Severance Pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muted but nerve-rasping whistle woke Cidra several hours later. The sound seemed to pierce right through her mind, bringing her to a sitting position in bed with a pounding heart. She was gazing at the door to her room, trying to remember where she was when it opened. Desma Kady stood there, struggling into a white lab suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry, Cidra. It’s just an equipment alarm from the lab. Probably means the air filtration system has gone down again. I didn’t see any lights when I looked out the window, so it could be that the lighting timer has failed too. Damn. If it isn’t one thing, it’s another. You have no idea how hard it is to keep machinery in good repair here on Renaissance. The last time this happened we found several kilos of swarming doomlizards tangled in the filtration fans. I’ll be back in a few minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I help?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry. This will only take a little while, I’m sure. Stay where you are and get some sleep.” She waved absently and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWide-awake now, Cidra went over to the diazite window and watched Desma hurry toward the long lab building. Nights on Renaissance were a couple of hours longer than on Lovelady. She estimated it must be about three hours from dawn. Through the gloom Cidra saw Desma disappear into the lab. She leaned on the windowsill and waited. The thought of going into that long, dark building full of bugs was not a pleasant one, but she supposed Desma was accustomed to her “pets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCidra didn’t know when or exactly why she began to worry. When the low level illumination she had noticed earlier that evening in the lab didn’t come back on soon after Desma disappeared inside, she began to get nervous. Desma had seemed to think the problem was a minor one that could be easily solved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes ticked past and there was still no sign of her hostess returning from the lab. Perhaps she could use some assistance after all. Cidra put on her delicate emerald-floss slippers and walked down the hall and out into the night. Her black-and-silver gown made her almost invisible in the shadows. The company that had the current contract for street lighting here in Try Again didn’t believe in importing top much heavy, expensive fluoroquartz. Most of the buildings on the street were shrouded in darkness, including the lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisions of a long barn full of horrific insectoid creatures were very bright in Cidra’s mind when she tentatively opened the door Desma had already unlocked. The fetid smell from the interior assailed her as soon as she stepped inside. It seemed somehow worse in the oppressive darkness. The small, scurrying, screeching, and clacking noises were at full volume as the creatures in the cages went about their shadowy night business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Desma? ‘\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no response. Cidra took another step inside. Tiny pinpoints of light darted about in the cage to her left. Up ahead she could see another faint, phosphorescent flicker. The natural luminescence of some of the inhabitants wasn’t nearly enough to light the aisles in front of the cages. Cidra took another cautious step, letting her eyes adjust to the deep shadows. She could barely make out the entrance to the first aisle. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sweet-starfire-lost-colony-1/page-39.html","bookId":1802,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:11 PM"}
