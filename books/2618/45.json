I pulled out Grandfather and set him in the hallway. “Watch Minnie, okay? If I’m not back soon, get someone’s attention, so she won’t starve.” He made what I took to be a noise of assent. Then I stood and straightened out my shirt, looking between Dren and Ti. “We’ve got to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDren twirled his sickle up into a saluting motion, then reholstered it, and waved me forward with his hand. “Of course, my dear. It doesn’t do to make vampires wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, we all went outside into the darkest night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER FIFTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d have never told you about Anna if I’d thought it’d inspire this,” Ti muttered, walking beside me in the open night. The Hound shuffled along behind me, waddling its bulk, nostrils flaring, breathing me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop apologizing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked side by side in the cold, and I wanted to hold Ti’s hand. His scarf was pulled high again. My gloved hand reached for his, and too late I remembered I was on his left side, and the hand that I held was most likely not his either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor most of a mile, silence ruled. Some few people were out on the streets. Whenever they saw Dren, they seemed to veer away, sometimes at right angles to their current path. They never made eye contact with the Hound, as if the Hound were too horrible to exist at all. I could hear it behind us, nails clicking on the sidewalk, preventing any escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat entire time I held Ti’s hand I tried not to think about where it’d come from. I felt like I was the star of some cheap horror film, where the call was coming from inside the house—only in my case, it was coming from inside my boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the train station we took the stairs down, and the Hound followed us awkwardly, leaping past us to land on the platform below. We took the next train, even though there were people in it. At Dren’s entrance, all of those sitting stood, and all of them now standing turned to look away, showing us only their backs. The doors closed, and the train rattled along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then that I turned to face Ti. I opened my mouth to ask how. But then I realized the better question was: “Who?” I shook the hand that I held, so he’d know what I was talking about, and wondered how loudly I’d scream if it up and fell off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a friend who is a cop. I help him take care of problems, sometimes,” Ti said, deliberately slow, his S sounds sibilant. He, or what remained of him, looked down at his still left hand that I held. “Nerves take the longest to regrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You … just killed someone. Today. For me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t kill him. I just took his face and broke off his arm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. “Is that supposed to make me feel better?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was alive when I left.” Ti shrugged, then continued, “It’ll be hard for him to make meth anymore, missing an arm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he thought Anna was atrocious! He gets to rip off someone’s face, just because they run a meth lab? “You’re the monster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTi’s bearing stiffened at this, and he turned away to look resolutely out a nearby window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else was there to say? Nothing. I couldn’t go back in time and undo what he’d done, or change what I’d done to set him in motion before that. I thought about all the things I should have done differently, when I’d had the chance—but I realized that this conversation here, now, had been deliberate. I’d known things were wrong for almost a mile. But I’d waited to have this conversation until we were stuck in the train together, when he couldn’t leave me, even if I wanted him to. Because deep down, I didn’t want him to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is s-s-someone having a lovers-s-s’ s-spat?” Dren asked. I glared at him, and saw his lips curve into a vicious grin. The lights in the tunnel passing outside glinted off his fangs and his hand stroked the holster of his sickle in a suggestive manner. I could see the Hound out of the corner of my eye, its clawlike hands fluttering together over its bloated torso. I swallowed, and looked back to Ti, who was still staring away from me, chin high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a thing for monsters, remember?” I said quietly. He turned to look down at me again. I pulled his scarf down and leaned up. I kissed him full on his strange new lips, which parted as he drew me near. His tongue was cool like I remembered, and I tasted metal. I pressed into him before we parted. “You’re my monster, all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded into my hair. “All right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the monster you knew was always better than all the ones you didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER FIFTY-TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train made three stops, during none of which any passengers got onto or off the train. I knew it had to be someone’s stop, but they were all frozen by Dren’s look-away/stay-away. I held on to Ti’s good hand, wrapped around me, and stayed quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour stops past that, Dren snapped his fingers, and the Hound began bringing up the rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uptown?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s unsettling how well you know the trains of this, your own fine city,” Dren said, rolling his eyes. He made a gesture toward the open doors for both of us to pass. “Shamble on, sir,” he said as Ti walked by. Ti growled in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis platform was empty. The train behind us closed its doors. I turned and watched it go with longing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDren moved around us and began mounting the stairs two at a time. The Hound managed them awkwardly, sidestepping itself up. We emerged into the station, and up from there onto the surface again, and Dren began leading us deeper into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure you don’t want to run?” Dren asked as he walked ahead. He’d pulled his sickle out of its holster again, and was twirling it from hand to hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” I continued to walk along the path he’d taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDren turned around. “Both of you could, you know. I would give you a head start. Cross my heart.” He ran the tip of his sickle in an X over his own chest. “I’ll count to a hundred. You and your zombie lover. Take off now, go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To a hundred and three,” Dren said, matching pace with me. The Hound waddled alongside of him, gnashing its teeth. “Oh, fine, a hundred and twelve, then, will you take that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTi put his hand out to stop me. “What’s your angle?” he asked Dren, sounding like he had a mouth full of marbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Souls are sweeter than bloodrights. You should know that, zombie. And bloodrights are all I’m getting paid for this mess.” He pointed his sickle at me. “But fair’s fair, I’d give you both a fighting chance. No fun in chasing after you if I didn’t get to stretch my legs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I repeated, walking along. Our surroundings were getting noticeably more familiar. The lighting was improved, and the litter on the streets was lessening. We were near my old hospital, the one I’d worked at oh-so-briefly what felt like a lifetime ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to know what the difference is between a reaper and a husker?” Dren asked. “A reaper—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy nerves snapped. “Can you just tell us where we’re going? And then after that, shut up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDren squinted at me. “Someplace where you should feel right at home.” He ran ahead twenty steps, then clapped his sickle against the Providence General sign behind him. “And look, we’re not alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTi and I turned toward the hospital. The lawn in front of Providence General looked like a triage zone, with clusters of people standing around. I covered one eye, and saw that most of them glowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the—” I began to ask, as a car turned beside us and pulled in. More vampires disembarked, chatting with one another. They were all dressed glamorously, in long velvet dresses, like they were attending a show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Zverskiye sent out invitations to all the players. Of course their entourages came, and with the entourages, the merely curious. Vampires hate to be left out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTi made another growling noise from beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Invitations to what, precisely?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you don’t know, then how should I?” Dren looked back at me, eyes glittering. “But it’s all very exciting, isn’t it?” He trotted down the hillside, and more reluctantly, Ti and I followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe automatic doors of Providence’s well-appointed lobby opened up for us, and it looked like a freak circus had been set up inside. Regal-looking ladies sat across the backs of sturdy leashed men, hobbled into kneeling positions with chains, occupying open spaces where the lobby had run out of seats. Vampires who looked like British mods lounged on the coffee cart in tight leather pants, sifting their hands through open bags of beans. Others fit right into their surroundings, wearing normal clothing, leafing through the available magazines and looking like bored soccer moms detoured by skinned knees on their way home from the park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong all these, health care workers wandered through on nightly duties, studiously ignoring any of their activities, oblivious even to the sound of coffee beans plinking onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had no idea there were so many vampires in the city,” I whispered. Ti took my hand and rubbed it against his coat. I could feel the heel of something metal in his pocket. I nodded to him, as if to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t often see them all in one place. This is big.” Dren directed us through the emergency medical service’s doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProvidence was a private hospital now. It was older, but with privatization had come the funds to refurbish their facilities, one overpriced MRI at a time. I knew from prior personal experience that there wasn’t too much action here. Any real traumas they sent off to trauma centers—especially any real traumas without adequate health insurance. But you wouldn’t have known how boring it was from watching the vampires. The first cubicle had a businessman with a GI bleed set to suction—I could tell by the tube going into his nose, and the coffee-colored residue that’d been sucked into the suction canister on the wall. Vampires sat on the countertops and empty beds in the room, watching him like bored cats eyeing an errant bird. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nightshifted-edie-spence-1/page-45.html","bookId":2618,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:34 PM"}
