We will hold off as long as we can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The children…” Savina said, knowing her plan was crumbling around her. She could not let anyone else steal what she had started. “Shoot them all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man’s eyes grew large, but he was a soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavina retreated down the stairs. She could not watch. Her legs stumbled under her as she reached the bottom of the stairs. The door to the room was four-inch steel. Barricaded inside, she would wait out the war above. Ahead, she noted the flicker of the screens beyond the doorway. In the center screen, water flooded poison into the earth. As she holed up here, she would take solace as she watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunfire erupted overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCringing, she headed for the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a shape stepped into view in the open doorway, blocking her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyotr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyotr stood in the doorway and stared up at the woman. She was darkness and shadow in the gloom of the stairwell. He did not truly see her, but he knew her. He focused on the flame of her heart, aglow at the foot of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pyotr,” she called to him, with a shining note of hope in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she stepped toward him, he lifted his arms and reached out—not with flesh but with his fiery spirit. He cupped the flame of her heart between his open palms, holding it like a frightened bird. Then he gently squeezed, smothering her flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman dropped to her knees with a cry, a fist clutched to her heart. “Pyotr, what are you—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope turned to terror as she screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another facet to Pyotr’s talent of empathy. He could certainly sense others’ emotions, but with the force of a hundred behind him, he could do more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a hundred eyes stared out of his, he drew from the other children: all the agony of the scalpel, the ache of loneliness, the coldness of neglect, the pain of secret abuse at night. He reached farther back, to a blue-eyed child in a dark church, watching a woman and a man approach. He stole all that fear out of the past and thrust it like a dagger into her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman shrieked, arched back, racked and locked in a pain without end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, likewise, as the dark emotions ran through Pyotr, the same fire grazed him. Hot tears flowed for all the lost innocence, including his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe barely registered the pistol as it lifted toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman sought to blindly kill what tortured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he did the same to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pistol blast shattered the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyotr fell back when the woman’s flame suddenly snuffed out between his palms. As he stumbled back, she fell to the floor, half her face gone. He stared up and saw Monk rushing down the stairs from above, his pistol smoking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man leaped over the woman and scooped him in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pyotr!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk lifted the stiff boy. He ran his hand over his small frame. He seemed uninjured, though his skin burned to the touch. He hugged Pyotr to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others ran down the stairs behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brief firefight had eliminated the defenders above. It had looked like the Russians had been about to fire upon a group of unconscious children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they’d been a half minute later…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gypsies remained above to secure the area and watch over the children. They were safe here for the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this the place?” Gray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the boy in his arms, Monk crossed with the others into the bunker. The control board smoked from deep gashes into the smoldering circuitry. Keyboards lay cracked. Glass crunched underfoot. Everything was shattered, except for a row of wall monitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk pointed to the center screen, recognizing the room. It was the heart of Operation Saturn. Only now, black water poured like a river out of a hole in the roof and swirled down a shaft in the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s already under way,” he said hollowly. “We’re too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a neighboring screen, Monk spotted the mining chamber where he’d left Konstantin and the others. The kids were sprawled in tangled piles. The view was too grainy to tell if they were still alive. Had the radiation somehow reached them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA well of despair swept through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Gray fished out a sat-phone, Monk stared at the others: Kowalski and Rosauro. Monk sought any glimmer of recognition. There was none. Who were these people? If they were friends, shouldn’t they jar some reaction from him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he studied the others, Pyotr reached a hand toward the center screen and placed his palm on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s he doing?” Gray asked with the phone at his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk turned his attention. “Pyotr?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy stared deeply at the image on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski spoke to the left. “Hey! The train’s moving over here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk glanced over. The train slowly shifted down the tracks, sparking with electricity. The tunnel must still have power, not that they had any control over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is the kid doing that?” Kowalski asked. “Moving it with his mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk held his breath, then let it out slowly. “No,” he said and stared at the receding train, suddenly remembering. “There’s someone else out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?” Gray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Pyotr’s hand touched the screen, he cast his senses out into the tunnel, stretching to his limits. Fired by stolen talents, steel and concrete could not stop his reach. As voices faded behind him, he dove into the dark tunnel and swept toward the one flaming star that remained inside, a great heart, one he had loved all his young life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyotr found her cowering in the train, rocking. She had hid out of sight of the cameras because he had asked it of her. She was part of the pattern. But for the moment, nothing mattered. He hurt, deeper than he’d ever been hurt. He simply needed her. Reaching her old heart, he cupped the flame gently and sent her all his love and his need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew he was there and hooted gently, reaching to the empty air. In the dark tunnel, they wrapped around each other, sharing emotions at a level deeper than anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of their secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had known the truth the moment they’d first touched hands. Pyotr knew the reason so many children loved Marta, came to her for comfort, to cry in her arms or to simply be held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a talent, unknown to her keepers, a strong gift of empathy, like Pyotr. Two kindred spirits. So he kept her secret, and she kept his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn’t their only secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a darker one, wrapped in terror, revealed in a way neither understood but both knew to be true. From the moment they first saw each other, they knew they would die together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray watched the train accelerate down the tunnel toward the site of Operation Saturn. Monk had given him a thumbnail version of the purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But who’s in the train?” he asked. “Can we communicate with them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk held the boy as his small fingers were splayed on the screen. “I think Pyotr is already there. The boy knows how to operate the train.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But who’s on the train?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the screen displaying the heart of Operation Saturn, the train pulled into view at the edge and braked. A dark shape hopped out of the front car and loped into the chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that a monkey?” Kowalski asked, stepping back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ape,” Rosauro corrected with a sigh, as if she was tired of correcting the man. “A chimpanzee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Marta,” Monk said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray heard the pain in his voice. A storm of radiation had to be surging through there. The figure moved slowly, slipping, knuckling awkwardly, already sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s she trying to do?” Gray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trying to save us all,” Monk answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyotr stayed with Marta. He pulled her flame close to his, not enough to be consumed, but so he could feed her his strength, let her know what she had to do, that she wasn’t alone. Likewise, he caught glimpses through her eyes, through her sharper senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the column of roaring water. He felt a heat weakening and burning Marta. The air smelled like rotting fish and frightened both of them, a flow of dark water, from their shared nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeadlier than any river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they faced it together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarta skirted around the gaping hole that swallowed the water so thirstily. It had to be stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyotr knew and told Marta. Konstantin had explained in detail how all the equipment worked: about the explosive charges, about the radio transmitters, about the giant silo doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had also told Pyotr about the lever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarta needed no help. She spotted the rod of steel behind a piece of equipment. It could close the silo doors and stop the flow into the heart of the world. Pyotr felt the soft hoots of fear coming from her. He felt them under his own ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can do it, Marta…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggled, her skin burned, her fur fell like pine needles, her knuckles blistered in contact with the spray of water on the rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyotr held her flame and willed her strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached the lever. It was tilted close to the floor. It needed to be raised straight up. She hunched a shoulder under it, gripped the length with both hands, and heaved with her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe steel would not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs death flowed behind her in a burning current, Pyotr felt the strain in her back, in her legs, in her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer flame flickered in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarta…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the lever would not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk watched Marta struggle with the lever. She was too weak. It would not budge. Pyotr began breathing hard, sharing the old chimpanzee’s fear and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why won’t it move?” Gray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C’mon, you damn monkey!” Kowalski yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk leaned closer, placing his own palm on the screen. He tried to remember the brief glimpse into the room as he had hurried past. As he strained, a sharp jab of electric pain shot through his head. Images from another time and place flashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…a man covered in coal soot…a plunging ride in an ore car…a white grin against dusty skin…that’s a boy!…just like, Daddy… \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-oracle-sigma-force-5/page-70.html","bookId":1528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:07 PM"}
