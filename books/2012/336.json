Her hands snapped out, one plunging into the undead warrior’s chest amidst shattering ribs, the other lashing at her face – catching the lower jaw and tearing it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twisted past, evading the downward swing of the male’s weapon, and with one hand now gripping the spine, she spun the female round, lifting her off her feet and flinging her into the male’s path. Even as he stumbled, he swung the mace in a diagonal slash. The Forkrul Assail stepped inside the attack, blocking the bone shaft with her wrists, turned to face him and thrust upward with the heels of her hands, catching each side of the warrior’s lower jaw. The strength of the blow exploded the vertebrae of his neck, launching the skull into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the huge, headless warrior toppled, Calm closed once more on the female, who was feebly trying to regain her feet. Grasping her right arm, the Forkrul Assail tore it from the shoulder socket. Using the arm as a weapon, she swung it hard into the side of the female’s head. The ball of the humerus punched a hole in the warrior’s temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe T’lan Imass staggered to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalm struck again. Plates of the skull splintered, broke away. A third blow crushed the woman’s face. She fell. The Forkrul Assail stepped forward and with one booted foot rolled the T’lan Imass on to her back. Then she swung the arm down repeatedly on what was left of the face and skull. The ninth blow split the arm bone. Calm flung it away in disgust and used the heel of her boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong after the wretched spirit of the female warrior had left the remains on the ground, Calm continued battering at that hated face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome time later, she resumed her journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a glorious world it will be .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilmandaros fled. She could not even remember when she had begun running, or when she had breached her way into the first of innumerable warrens. The landscape she now crossed was bleak, colourless, the ground underfoot hard uneven clay that had been chopped up by thousands of hoofs. Two small moons tracked the night sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf a league ahead, she saw hills of red sand, rippling as they climbed to the horizon. No places in which to hide – no caves, no forests – she would have to leave this realm soon. And yet – Kilmandaros glanced back over one shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA storm of darkness, boiling to consume half the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose! Close! Her breath tore at her throat. Her hearts pounded like the thunder of clashing stormclouds. She stumbled on torn, bloodied feet, her muscles burning like acid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere? Where to hide?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’ve done a terrible thing. And now I will pay – it was all Errastas! All his fault, not mine! I did not want her freed – I swear it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slope of the nearest hill loomed before her, a sweep of red sand – how she hated this place!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A terrible thing. A terrible thing! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness foamed up on either side. Crying out, Kilmandaros staggered to a halt, wheeled round, lifting her hands—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struck from the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWings like flames of night. The blaze of argent reptilian eyes. Talons lunging down, impaling her shoulders, snatching her from the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilmandaros shrieked, fists closing to smash upward into the dragon’s ridged chest. The sound the impacts made was thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, trailing ropes of blood, she was falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shadow passed over her, a wheeling, plummeting presence, looming huge – jaws snapping out from a head above a lashing neck. Fangs sank into one thigh and she was thrown upward once more. Spinning, she saw gleaming bone where the muscles of her left thigh had been – saw blood spraying out from her leg. Howling, she fell earthward once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, he left her to strike the ground. She landed on her feet with the sound of exploding trees. Bones snapped, splinters driving up into her pelvis and torso. The impact threw her forward. On to her chest, and then over. Lying stunned, helpless, Kilmandaros stared upward to see Draconus descending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot fair .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft hand settled against her cheek. Blinking, she found herself looking up into her son’s face. ‘No! Leave here! Beloved son – flee! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he straightened, drawing a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilmandaros heard Draconus speak from only a few paces distant. ‘Where is Errastas, Sechul?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gone,’ her son replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t know. Into hiding, of course. You won’t find him, not any time soon. Shall I caution you against uttering any vows, Draconus, or would the sting of that prove too much?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You always were chained to his ankle, Sechul Lath, but if you are determined to oppose me here, I will kill you.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-336.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
