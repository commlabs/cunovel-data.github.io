And we spend a lot of time in kelp, right Nakano?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNakano grunted, then said: \"We should\u0027ve let the kelp finish us. We -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGallow silenced him with a flicking gesture. \"We secured our outpost with one sub and a handful of men. It\u0027d be a pity to waste such talent in the kelp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett saw that Gallow was one of those types who love to hear themselves talk - more, he was one of those who loved to brag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With one little sub and this foil,\" Gallow said with a sweep of his hand, \"we can make sure there\u0027s never any more land than we can control. You don\u0027t have to be in charge to run the show. Just ruin it for those who do. People will have to come swimming up to me soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi took a deep, relaxing breath. \"Is Kareen one of you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGallow\u0027s eyes shifted and almost met Scudi\u0027s. \"She\u0027s ... insurance ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Safe deposit box,\" Nakano blurted, and both men laughed in that loud way men have when they crack a crude or cruel joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett realized from Scudi\u0027s deep sigh that she was relieved at Gallow\u0027s bragging. Were her doubts about her father\u0027s involvement with Gallow finally laid to rest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the doctor?\" Nakano asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness had settled over the ocean and the cockpit was illuminated only by the red telltales and instrument lights on the console. A macabre red glow filled the space around the two Mermen. They stood near the control seats, put their heads close together and whispered while Scudi and Brett fidgeted. Brett kept eyeing the hatchway where the Mermen had entered. Was there a chance to escape down there to the main hatch? But Guemes had been destroyed by a sub. These Mermen had not swum here from the Launch Base. Their sub lay nearby, probably directly beneath the foil\u0027s hull. And they needed a doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you need us,\" Brett said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think?\" Gallow asked with a patronizing lift of his eyebrows. \"Mutes don\u0027t think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have an injury, somebody needs a doctor,\" Brett said. \"How do you intend to get help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s quick for a Mute,\" Gallow said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re not strong enough to go in and take a doctor from Launch Base,\" Brett said. \"But you could trade us for a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ryan Wang\u0027s daughter could be traded,\" Gallow said. \"You\u0027re fishbait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you hurt Brett, I won\u0027t cooperate,\" Scudi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cooperate?\" Gallow snorted. \"Who needs cooperation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do,\" Brett said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nakano will break you two into small pieces if I give the order,\" Gallow said. \"That\u0027s cooperation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett went silent, studying the two men in that blood-red light. Why were they delaying? They said they needed a doctor. Twisp had always said you had to look beyond words when dealing with people who postured and bragged. Gallow certainly fitted that description. Nakano seemed to be something else - a dangerous unknown. Twisp liked to probe such people with outrageous questions or statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need just any doctor,\" Brett said. \"You want a particular doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Mermen focused startled glances on Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have we here?\" Gallow muttered. The smile he flashed across the dark cabin did not disarm Brett in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNervous, Brett thought. Keep looking. He knew the Merman fear that Islanders had mutated into telepathy, and played on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNakano said, \"Do you think -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Gallow warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett caught a bare flicker of hesitation in Gallow\u0027s face, which did not show in the voice. The man had superb control of his voice. It was his tool for manipulation, along with his ready smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That other foil should be along soon,\" Nakano said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA particular foil with a particular doctor and a particular cargo, Brett thought. He glanced at Scudi. Her tired face was clear to him in the dim lights of the cockpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need us as a trade, you need us as a diversion,\" Brett said. He held his fingertips to his temples, repressing an excited smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Gallow\u0027s eyebrows lifted, a dark ripple in the smeared green of the camouflage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like this,\" Nakano said. There was fear in the big man\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s thought something out,\" Gallow said. \"That\u0027s all. Look at him. Almost normal. Maybe he has a brain after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s hit on -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop it, Nakano!\" Gallow kept his attention on Brett. \"Why would we need you as a diversion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett dropped his hands and allowed the smile. \"It\u0027s pretty simple. You didn\u0027t know we were the ones on this boat. It\u0027s dark out there and all you saw was a foil. Period.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty good for a Mute,\" Gallow said. \"Maybe there\u0027s hope for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had to go forward and look at the identification plate on the control console before you realized this was the foil on watch-alert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGallow nodded. \"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hoped it was another foil, a particular one,\" Brett said. \"The other one will have a Security force aboard. You came in armed and ready for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNakano relaxed, visibly relieved. Obviously, this reasoning had eliminated his fear of telepathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting,\" Gallow said. \"Is there more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now we\u0027re waiting for the other foil,\" Brett said. \"Why else waste time with us? If the Security force jumps aboard to capture Scudi and me, that\u0027s your opportunity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Opportunity for what?\" Gallow\u0027s tone said he was enjoying this. Nakano returned to his fidgeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want someone in particular on that other foil,\" Brett said. \"A doctor. And you want the cargo. Now, you see the opportunity to get not only that but two foils intact. And you would\u0027ve had to wreck the other foil to stop it because all you have is a sub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I might be able to use you,\" Gallow said. \"You want to join up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett spoke without thinking. \"I\u0027d sooner swim in shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGallow\u0027s face tightened, his body went rigid. Nakano snickered. Slowly, Gallow\u0027s face returned to its political best. But there was a mad light in his eyes, a red reflection that made Brett sorry he\u0027d spoken at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi edged away from Brett toward the command seats, moving as though she feared the consequences of his comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNakano moved closer to Gallow and bent to whisper something into the Merman\u0027s ear. Even as he whispered, Nakano shot a kick at Scudi\u0027s hand, which had moved toward the eject lever between the command seats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi leaped back with a cry of pain, holding her wrist tight to her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett started to step toward Nakano, but the big Merman put up a warning hand. \"Easy, kid,\" he said. \"I just stung her. Nothing\u0027s broken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was going for the eject lever,\" Gallow said. There was genuine surprise in his voice. He glared at Scudi. Both men stood on a light seam that divided the forward part of the cabin from the rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would\u0027ve cut us to pieces when it blew,\" Nakano said. \"Not nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s Ryan Wang\u0027s daughter, all right,\" Gallow said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you see why you need our cooperation,\" Brett said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need you tied up and gagged,\" Gallow snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what happens when that other foil pulls alongside for a look?\" Brett asked. \"They\u0027ll be very cautious if they don\u0027t see us in here. One or two of their Security will come aboard while the others wait in their own boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you proposing a deal, Mute?\" Gallow asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scudi and I stay inside in plain sight. We act like our foil\u0027s disabled. That way, they won\u0027t suspect anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And afterward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You deliver us to an outpost where we can get back to our people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sound reasonable, Nakano?\" Gallow asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNakano grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a deal, Mute,\" Gallow said. \"You amuse me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett wondered at the insincerity in the man\u0027s voice. Didn\u0027t he realize his intentions were that transparent? A greased smile couldn\u0027t hide a lie forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGallow turned to Nakano. \"Go take a look outside. See if everything\u0027s secure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNakano strode through the rear hatchway and was gone for several minutes while Gallow hummed to himself, nodding. His expression was filled with self-satisfaction. Scudi moved close to Brett, still clutching her wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Brett asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just bruised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nakano\u0027s getting soft,\" Gallow said. \"He pulled that kick. He can crush your throat, just like that!\" Gallow snapped his fingers to illustrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNakano returned, dripping more water. \"We\u0027re in kelp and it\u0027s holding us pretty steady. The sub\u0027s stabilized directly under us and the foil\u0027s shadow should hide it until it\u0027s too late for them to do anything about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Gallow said. \"Now, where do we keep these two until it\u0027s time for their performance?\" He thought for a moment, then: \"We turn the cabin lights on and put them in the open hatchway. They\u0027ll be seen right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we wait beside the hatch,\" Nakano said. \"You kids understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Brett did not respond, Scudi said, \"We understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll run forward and turn out the lights,\" Brett said. \"That\u0027ll make sure the Security people have to come aboard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good!\" Gallow said. \"Very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sure likes the sound of his own voice, Brett thought. He took Scudi\u0027s arm, careful of her wrist. \"Let\u0027s get those lights on and go back to the main hatch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nakano, escort our guests back and see that they\u0027re in plain sight,\" Gallow said. He moved to the command console and flipped a series of switches. Lights blazed all over the foil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett suddenly hesitated. Open hatch? \"Dashers,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi tugged him along toward the corridor into the rear of the foil. \"Our chances are just as good with the black variety,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurvival is staying alive one breath at a time, Brett thought. That was another of Twisp\u0027s sayings. And Brett thought if he and Scudi survived this, Twisp would have to learn how his teaching had helped. It was a way of studying things and reacting truly - something that could not be taught, but could be learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry it up, you two!\" Nakano ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed him down the long passage to the open hatch, its lip washed in a blaze of light. Brett stared out at a dark flow of kelp-littered waves slapping against the hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNakano said, \"You two wait right here. And you better be standing in plain sight when I come back.\" He sped up the passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that guy doing up there in the cockpit?\" Brett asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably disabling the starting system,\" Scudi said. \"They don\u0027t intend to let us go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced behind her at the storage locker where Brett had found the survival kits. \"If it weren\u0027t for the sub under us, I\u0027d take off right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nobody in the sub,\" Brett said. \"There\u0027s just these two ... and maybe one who needs the doctor. That one won\u0027t be able to do anything about us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was obvious from what they said and the way they\u0027re acting. And remember what Bushka said? Three of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027re we waiting for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For them to disable the starting mechanism,\" he said. \"We can\u0027t have them dashing around in this thing looking for us.\" He moved to the storage locker and lifted out two more packs, tossing one to Scudi. \"Have they had enough time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi slipped a length of line from an outside pocket on her kit and fixed one end to Brett\u0027s belt, the other to her own waist. \"We stay together,\" she said. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar up the corridor, Gallow\u0027s voice suddenly bellowed, \"Hey! You two! What\u0027re you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going swimming,\" Brett shouted. Holding hands, they leaped off into the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout the conscious acknowledgment and acceptance of our kinship with those around us there can be no synthesis of personality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- C. G. Jung, Shiprecords\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glut of kelp rasped the coracle\u0027s bow in time with the waves. A touch of reality, Twisp thought. The otherwise silent blackness yawned before the first hint of dawn. Twisp heard Bushka twisting uncomfortably near the bow cuddy. In the long night since leaving Brett and Scudi, Bushka had not slept well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater\u0027s very flat tonight, Twisp thought. Only the faintest of breezes cooled his left cheek as the coracles drifted slowly in the encumbering kelp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp tipped his head to look up at a spattering of cloud-framed stars, picking out the familiar arrowhead shape of the Pointers before the frame shifted to a new section of sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill on course, current favorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was always good to check the compass against the stars. The course angled toward an unmarked place on the sea where they could turn and make a swift run to Vashon. The RDF-RDC announcement of the Island\u0027s distant locator-beep had been silenced for the night but a red light blinked near his knee in time with Vashon\u0027s signal. His receiver was working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn would find them still hull-down out of sight of the launch tower but not out of range of the kid and the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I do the right thing? Twisp asked himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a question he had repeated many times, aloud to Bushka and silently to himself. At the moment of decision, it had felt right. But here in the night ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMomentous changes gathered force on their world. And who were they, pitted against the evils he could sense in that change? One overage fisherman with arms too long for anything but hauling nets. One whining intellectual ashamed of his Islander ancestry, maybe capable of wholesale murder. One kid out to make himself a man, a kid who could see in the dark. And a Merman girl who was heir to the entire food monopoly of Pandora. The consequences of Ryan Wang\u0027s death had a bad feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe squawks began to stir in their cage near Twisp\u0027s feet. Faintly at first, then louder, somewhere off to the right in the thicker kelp, Twisp heard a dasher purring. Putting a finger on the stunshield switch, he waited, straining to see something, anything, in the blackness where that ominous purr stroked the still air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA purring dasher could mean many things: it might be asleep, or well-fed, or responding to the smell of rich food ... or just generally contented with its life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp slipped a leg over the tiller, prepared to start the motor and steer away from that perilous noise. With his free hand he groped for and found the lasgun in its hiding place behind his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka began to snore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dasher\u0027s purr stopped, then began once more on a lower note. Had it heard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka snorted, rolled over and resumed his snoring. The dasher continued to purr, but the sound began to fade, moving farther to the right and behind the drifting coracles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsleep, Twisp hoped. Trust my squawks. The birds had not stirred again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dasher\u0027s contentment faded away in the distance. Twisp listened for movement there, straining to hear over the sound of Bushka\u0027s fatigue. Slowly, Twisp forced himself to relax, realizing that he had been holding his breath. He exhaled, then inhaled a deep breath of the sweet night air. A dry swallow rasped the back of his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he could not hear the dasher, tension still rode him. Abruptly, the squawks came full awake and began living up to their name. Twisp flipped the stunshield switch. There came the unmistakable splash of something stiffening in the water close behind, then the frenzied whines and chuckles of dashers feeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilthy cannibals, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whuzzat?\" Bushka demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coracle shifted as Bushka sat up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dashers,\" Twisp said. He aimed the lasgun toward the feeding sounds and fired six quick bursts. The buzzing vibration of the weapon was hard against his sweaty hand. The thin purple beams lanced into the night. At the second shot, the dashers erupted in a frantic cacophony of yelps and screeches. The sounds receded rapidly. Dashers had learned to turn tail at the buzzing, purple shaft of a lasgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp turned off the stunshield and reached for his handlight as another sound far off to his left caught his attention: the hiss-hiss-hiss of paddles cutting through wet kelp. He aimed the handlight toward the sound but the night sucked it dry without sending anything back but the sea\u0027s pulse in dark strands of kelp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice called from the distance: \"Coracle! Do you have a load?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp felt his heart triple-time against his rib cage. That was Brett\u0027s voice!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Riding too high!\" he shouted, waving the handlight as a locator. \"Careful, there\u0027s dashers about!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We saw your lasgun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisp could make them out then, an amoebalike blot undulating toward him on the low seas. Two paddles flashed bits of his light back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka leaned against the thwart, tipping it precariously near the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trim the boat!\" Twisp called. \"You, Bushka!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka jerked back but kept his attention on the approaching shape. The paddles struck the water with splashes that burst like blossoms against the black hull of an inflatable raft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s them,\" Bushka said. \"They\u0027ve blown it, just like I warned you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" Twisp growled. \"At least they\u0027re alive.\" He took a deep breath of thanksgiving. The kid had become family and the family was whole again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother, I\u0027m home!\" the kid called, as though reading his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, Brett was sufficiently lighthearted that he could joke. Things could not be too bad, then. Twisp listened for dashers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBushka laughed at the quip, a laugh with a dry, cracked edge that set Twisp\u0027s anger near the boiling point. The raft was in easy talking distance now. Twisp kept the handlight pointed toward the approaching figures and away from his own face, where tears of fatigue and relief wet his cheeks. At a low word from Brett, both he and Scudi stopped paddling. Brett threw a line to the coracle. Twisp caught it and hauled in the raft like a net of muree, snugging it against the coracle. One long arm snaked out and grabbed Brett. The kid\u0027s dive suit was soaked and inflated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe squawks took that moment to set up a warning commotion, but it subsided immediately. Dashers patrolled just out of sight, wary of the lasgun. A sizable hunt of them, Twisp thought. Hunger drove them in and fear kept them away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi said, \"Should we come aboard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Twisp said, and heaved Brett aboard, then helped Scudi gently over the gunwale and onto the seat-slat in front of him. He secured the line to keep the raft tight against the boat, then stowed the handlight under his seat. Twisp put a hand on Brett\u0027s arm, keeping it there, unwilling to break off the reassuring touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wouldn\u0027t listen to you, would they?\" Bushka demanded. \"You had to run for it again. What happened to your foil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we run for Vashon?\" Twisp asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett held both hands up to slow them down. \"I think we\u0027d better discuss it,\" he said. He recounted the story of Gallow and Nakano as briefly as he could. It was a bare-bones account, which Twisp heard with a growing admiration for Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good head there, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Brett had finished, Bushka said, \"Let\u0027s get away from here! Those are devils, not men. They probably followed you and when they come -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shut up!\" Twisp snapped. \"If you don\u0027t, I\u0027ll shut you up.\" He turned to Brett and asked, in a calmer voice, \"What do you think? They have two foils now and could hunt us down with -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not going to hunt for us, not yet,\" Brett said. \"They have other fish to fry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a fool!\" Bushka blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear him out,\" Scudi said. Her voice was as flat and solid as plasteel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They said they were waiting to capture a doctor,\" Brett continued, \"probably true, from the way they acted. It looked like they tried something and failed. They were shook up and trying to hide it from us. A lot of bragging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Gallow,\" Bushka muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what were they doing besides waiting to get a doctor?\" Twisp asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were near the Launch Base,\" Brett said. \"With Gallow, I suspect nothing is coincidence. My guess is they want those hyb tanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course they do,\" Bushka said. \"I told you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants them real bad,\" Brett said. He nodded to himself. The hyb tanks circling up there in space were the single most speculative subject on Pandora. Guessing the manifests of the hyb tanks ranked right up there with the weather as a conversational staple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about this threat that he\u0027ll prevent the Mermen from reclaiming more open land?\" Twisp asked. \"Could he do that with one sub and a couple of foils?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Vashon\u0027s in danger,\" Brett said. \"Guemes was much smaller, but still ... sinking Islands is just too simple a diversion for somebody like Gallow to resist. About the time those tanks come down, he\u0027ll try to sink Vashon. I\u0027m sure of it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-19.html","bookId":2171,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:13 PM"}
