He had never seen Dors look so, her face twisted, her body canted, staggering as though she were drunk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Dors! What happened! What\u0027s wrong!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He ran to her and grasped her around the waist, even as her body gave way and collapsed in his arms. He lifted her (she weighed more than :m ordinary woman her size would have, but Seldon was unaware of that ;it the moment) and placed her on the couch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"What happened?\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; She told him, gasping, her voice breaking now and then, while he cradled her head and tried to force himself to believe what was happening.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Elar is dead,\" she said. \"I finally killed a human being. -First time.

Elar turned on his device-full-when I rushed him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"You can be readjusted.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"How? There\u0027s no one-on Trantor-who knows how. I need I Daneel.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Daneel. Demerzel. Somehow, deep inside, Hari had always known. His friend-a robot-had provided him with a protector-a robot-to ensure that psychohistory and the seeds of the Foundations were given a chance to take root. The only problem was, Hari had fallen in love with his protector-a robot. It all made sense now. All the nagging doubts and the questions could be answered. And somehow, it didn\u0027t matter one bit.\u0026nbsp; All that mattered was Dors.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"We can\u0027t let this happen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"It must.\" Dors\u0027s eyes fluttered open and looked at Seldon. \"Must.\u0026nbsp; Tried to save you, but missed-vital point-who will protect you now?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon couldn\u0027t see her clearly. There was something wrong with his eyes. \"Don\u0027t worry about me, Dors. It\u0027s you- It\u0027s you-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No. You, Hari. Tell Manella-Manella-I forgive her now. She did better than I. Explain to Wanda. You and Raych-take care of each other.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No no no,\" said Seldon, rocking back and forth. \"You can\u0027t do this. Hang on, Dors. Please. Please, my love.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Dors\u0027s head shook feebly and she smiled even more feebly. \"Goodbye, Hari, my love.
