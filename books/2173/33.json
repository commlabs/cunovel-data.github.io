jumpdoors for the Dosadi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie nodded.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"The Calebans are aware of their obligation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Jedrik has been busy instructing her compatriots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think to loose the Dosadi upon the ConSentiency and hunt down my High Command?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Have a care, McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I warn you not to abandon your duties as a Legum, or to turn your back on Aritch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie continued silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make that error, McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aritch is your client.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Through him you represent all Gowachin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Legum requires a responsible client,\" McKie said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Not a proxy, but a client whose acts are brought into question by the case being tried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrreg revealed Gowachin signs of deep concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear me, McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I haven\u0027t much time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a sudden rush of apprehension, McKie focused on the attendant with the blade who stood there partly obscuring the seated Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Mrreg spoke in a swift spill of words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By our standards, McKie, you are not yet very well educated in Gowachin necessities.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That was our error.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And now your . . . impetuosity has put you into a position which is about to become untenable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attendant shifted slightly, arms moving up.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie glimpsed the blade tip at the attendant\u0027s right shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gowachin don\u0027t have families as do Humans or even Wreaves,\" Mrreg said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"We have graduated advancement into groups which hold more and more responsibility for those beneath them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This was the pattern adopted by our High Command.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What you see as a Gowachin family is only a breeding group with its own limited rules.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;With each step up in responsibility goes a requirement that we pay an increasing price for failure.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You ask if I know the price?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ahhh, McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The breeding male Gowachin makes sure that only the swiftest, most alert of his tads survive.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A Magister upholds the forms of the Law.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The High Command answers to a . . . Mrreg.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You see?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And a Mrreg must make only the best decisions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No failures.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Thus . . . Laupuk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke the final word, the blade in the attendant\u0027s hands flashed out and around in a shimmering arc.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It caught the seated Gowachin at the neck.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Mrreg\u0027s head, neatly severed, was caught in the loop at the blade\u0027s tip, lifted high, then lowered onto the white apron which now was splashed with green gore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene blanked out, was replaced by the Gowachin who had connected McKie with Mrreg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aritch wishes to consult his Legum,\" the Gowachin said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dosadi-experiment-consentiency-universe-2/page-33.html","bookId":2173,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:40:19 PM"}
