{"id":62593,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eIN A SMALL private lounge which was sometimes used for VIPs, the young girl in the uniform of a Trans America ticket agent was sobbing hysterically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya Livingston steered her to a chair. \"Make yourself comfortable,\" Tanya said practically, \"and take your time. You\u0027ll feel better afterward, and when you\u0027re ready we can talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya sat down herself, smoothing her trim, tight uniform skirt. There was no one else in the room, and the only sound---apart from the crying---was the faint hum of air-conditioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was fifteen years or so difference in age between the two women. The girl was not much more than twenty, Tanya in her late thirties. Watching, Tanya felt the gap to be greater than it was. It came, she supposed, from having been exposed to marriage, even though briefly and a long time ago---or so it seemed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought: it was the second time she had been conscious of her age today. The first was while combing her hair this morning; she had seen telltale strands of gray among the short-cropped, flamboyant red. There was more of the gray than last time she had checked a month or so ago, and both occasions were reminders that her forties---by which time a woman ought to know where she was going and why---were closer than she liked to think about. She had another thought: in fifteen years from now, her own daughter would be the same age as the girl who was crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl, whose name was Patsy Smith, wiped reddened eyes with a large linen handkerchief which Tanya had given her. She spoke with difficulty, choking back more tears. \"They wouldn\u0027t talk that way... so mean, rudely... at home... not to their wives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean passengers wouldn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some would,\" Tanya said. \"When you\u0027re married, Patsy, you may find out, though I hope not. But if you\u0027re telling me that men behave like adolescent boors when their travel plans get crossed up, I\u0027ll agree with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was doing my best... We all were... All day today; and yesterday... the day before... But the way people talk to you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean they act as if you started the storm yourself. Especially to inconvenience them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes... And then that last man... Until him, I was all right...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened exactly? They called me when it was all over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girt was beginning to regain control of herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... he had a ticket on Flight 72, and that was canceled because of weather. We got him a seat on 114, and he missed it. He said he was in the dining room and didn\u0027t hear the flight called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flight announcements aren\u0027t made in the dining room,\" Tanya said. \"There\u0027s a big notice saying so, and it\u0027s on all the menus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I explained that, Mrs. Livingston, when he came back from the departure gate. But he was still nasty. He was going on as if it were my fault he\u0027d missed the flight, not his. He said we were all inefficient and half asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you call your supervisor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to, but he was busy. We all were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got the passenger a seat---on the extra section, 2122.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wanted to know what movie was showing on the flight. I found that out, and he said he\u0027d seen it. He got nasty again. The movie he\u0027d wanted to see was on the first flight which was canceled. He said, could I get him another flight which was showing the same movie as the first one? All the time, there were other passengers; they were pressing up against the counter. Some were making remarks out loud about how slow I was. Well, when he said that about the movie, that was when I...\" The girl hesitated. \"I guess something snapped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya prompted, \"That was when you threw the timetable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatsy Smith nodded miserably. She looked as if she were going to cry again. \"Yes. I don\u0027t know what got into me, Mrs. Livingston... I threw it right over the counter. I told him he could fix his own flight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I can say,\" Tanya said, \"is that I hope you hit him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl looked up. In place of tears, there was the beginning of a smile. \"Oh, yes; I did.\" She thought, then giggled. \"You should have seen his face. He was so surprised.\" Her expression became serious. \"Then, after that...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what happened after that. You broke down, which was a perfectly natural thing to do. You were sent in here to finish your cry, and now you have, you\u0027re going home in a taxi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl looked bemused. \"You mean... that\u0027s all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly it\u0027s all. Did you expect us to fire you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I wasn\u0027t sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We might have to,\" Tanya said, \"much as we\u0027d dislike it, Patsy, if you did the same thing again. But you won\u0027t, will you? Not ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl shook her head firmly. \"No, I won\u0027t. I can\u0027t explain, but having done it just once is enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the end of it, then. Except that you might like to hear what happened after you left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A man came forward. He was one of those in the line-up, and he said he heard, and saw, the whole thing. He also said he had a daughter the same age as you, and if the first man had talked to his daughter the same way he talked to you, he would personally have punched him in the nose. Then the second man---the one from the line-up---left his name and address, and said if the man you had been talking to ever made any kind of complaint, to let him know and he would report what really happened.\" Tanya smiled. \"So, you see---there are nice people, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" the girl said. \"There aren\u0027t many, but when you do get one like that, who\u0027s nice to you, and cheerful, you feel you want to hug him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately we can\u0027t do that, any more than we should throw timetables. Our job is to treat everyone alike, and be courteous, even when passengers are not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mrs. Livingston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatsy Smith would be all right, Tanya decided. Apparently, she hadn\u0027t thought of quitting, as some airls did who suffered similar experiences. In fact, now that she was over her emotion, Patsy seemed to have the kind of resilience which would be helpful to her in future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod knows, Tanya thought, you needed resilience---and some toughness---in dealing with the traveling public, whatever job you held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake Reservations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDowntown in reservation departments, she was aware, personal pressures would be even greater than at the airport. Since the storm began, reservation clerks would have made thousands of calls advising passengers of delays and rearrangements. It was a job the clerks all hated because people whom they called were invariably bad-tempered and frequently abusive. Airline delays seemed to arouse a latent savagery in those affected by them. Men talked insultingly to women telephonists, and even people who at other times were courteous and mild-mannered, turned snarly and disagreeable. New York-bound flights were worst of all. Reservation clerks had been known to refuse the assignment of telephoning news of delay or cancellation to a flight load of passengers destined for New York, preferring to risk their jobs rather than face the torrent of invective they knew awaited them. Tanya had often speculated on what it was about New York which infected those headed there with a kind of medicine-dance fervor to arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, for whatever reasons, she knew there would be resignations among airline staffs---in Reservations and elsewhere---when the present emergency was over. There always were. A few nervous breakdowns could be counted on, too, usually among the younger girls, more sensitive to passengers\u0027 rudeness and ill humor. Constant politeness, even when you were trained for it, was a strain which took a heavy toll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was glad, though, that Patsy Smith would not be among the casualties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knock at the outer door. It opened, and Mel Bakersfeld leaned in. He was wearing fleece-lined boots and carrying a heavy topcoat. \"I was coming by,\" he told Tanya. \"I can drop back later, if you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please stay.\" She smiled a welcome. \"We\u0027ve almost finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him as he walked to a chair across the room. He looked tired, Tanya thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe switched her attention back, filled in a voucher, and handed it to the girl. \"Give this to the taxi dispatcher, Patsy, and he\u0027ll send you home. Have a good night\u0027s rest, and we\u0027ll expect you back tomorrow, bright and breezy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the girl bad gone, Tanya swung her chair around to face Mel\u0027s. She said brightly, \"Hullo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put down a newspaper he had been glancing at, and grinned. \"Hi!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got my note?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to thank you for it. Though I might have made it here without.\" Gesturing to the door through which the girl had gone, he asked, \"What was all that about? Battle fatigue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She told him what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel laughed. \"I\u0027m tired, too. How about sending me off in a taxi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya looked at him, inquiringly. Her eyes---a bright, clear blue---had a quality of directness. Her head was tilted, and an overhead light reflected red highlights from her hair. A slim figure, yet with a fullness which the trim airline uniform heightened... Mel was conscious, as at other times, of her desirability and warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might consider it,\" she said. \"If the taxi goes to my place, and you let me cook you dinner. Say, a Lamb Casserole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, weighing conflicting claims, then reluctantly shook his head. \"I wish I could. But we\u0027ve some trouble here, and afterward I have to be downtown.\" He got up. \"Let\u0027s have coffee, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel held the door open, and they went out into the bustling, noisy main concourse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a press of people around the Trans America counter, even greater than when Mel had arrived. \"I mustn\u0027t take long,\" Tanya said. \"I\u0027ve still two hours more on duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they threaded their way through the crowds and increasing piles of luggage, she moderated her normally brisk pace to Mel\u0027s slower one. He was limping rather more than usual, she noticed. She found herself wanting to take his arm and help him, but supposed she had better not. She was still in Trans America uniform. Gossip spread fast enough without helping it actively. The two of them had been seen a good deal lately in each other\u0027s company, and Tanya was sure that the airport rumor machine---which operated like a jungle telegraph with IBM speed---had already taken note. Probably it was assumed that she and Mel were bedding down together, though, as it happened, that much was untrue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were headed for the Cloud Captain\u0027s Coffee Shop in the central lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About that Lamb Casserole,\" Mel said. \"Could we make it another night? Say, the day after tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden invitation from Tanya had surprised him. Although they had had several dates together---for drinks or dinner---until now she had not suggested visiting her apartment. Of course, going there could be for dinner only. Still... there was always the possibility that it might not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately, Mel had sensed that if their meetings away from the airport continued, there could be a natural and obvious progression. But he had moved cautiously, instinct warning him that an affair with Tanya would be no casual romance but a deeply emotional involvement for them both. A consideration, also, was his own problems with Cindy. Those were going to take a lot of working out, if they could be worked out at all, and there was a limit to the number of complications a man could handle at one time. It was a strange commentary, he thought, that when a marriage was secure it seemed easier to manage an affair than when the same marriage was shaky. Just the same, Tanya\u0027s invitation seemed too enticing to pass up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The day after tomorrow is Sunday,\" she pointed out. \"But I\u0027ll be off duty, and if you can manage it, I\u0027ll have more time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel grinned. \"Candies and wine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had forgotten it would be Sunday. But he would have to come to the airport anyway because, even if the storm moved on, there would be aftereffects. As to Cindy, there had been several Sundays when she had been out, herself, without an announced reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMomentarily, Mel and Tanya separated as she dodged a hurrying, florid-faced man, followed by a redcap with a loaded luggage cart, topped by golf clubs and tennis rackets. Wherever that load was going, Tanya thought enviously, it was a long way south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said when they rejoined. \"Candles and wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they entered the coffee shop, a pert hostess recognized Mel and ushered him, ahead of others, to a small table at the rear, marked RESERVED, which airport officials often used. About to sit down, he stumbled slightly and grasped Tanya\u0027s arm. The observant hostess flicked her eyes over them both with a half-smfle. Rumor machine, stand by for a bulletin, Tanya thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAloud, she said, \"Did you ever see such crowds? This has been the wildest three days I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel glanced around the packed coffee shop, its bedlam of voices punctuated by the clatter of dishes. He nodded toward the outer door through which they could both see a moving, surging swarm of people. \"If you think this is a big horde tonight, wait until the civil version of the C-5A goes into service.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know---we can barely cope with the 747s; but a thousand passengers arriving all at once at a check-in counter... God help us!\" Tanya shuddered. \"Can you imagine what it\u0027ll be like when they collect their baggage? I don\u0027t even want to think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor do a good many other people---who ought to be thinking about it, right now.\" He was amused to find that their conversation had already drifted into aviation. Airplanes and airlines held a fascination for Tanya, and she liked talking about them. So did Mel, which was one of the reasons he enjoyed her company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which people aren\u0027t thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those who control policy on the ground---airport and air traffic. Most are acting as if today\u0027s jets will fly forever. They seem to believe that if everybody keeps quiet and still, the new, big airplanes will go away and not bother us. That way we needn\u0027t have ground facilities to match them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya said thoughtfully, \"But there\u0027s a lot of building at airports. Wherever you go, you see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel offered her a cigarette and she shook her head negatively. He lit one for himself before answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mostly the building going on is patchwork---changes and additions to airports built in the 1950s or early \u002760s. There\u0027s little that\u0027s farseeing. There are exceptions---Los Angeles is one; Tampa, Florida, and Dallas---Fort Worth are others; they\u0027ll be the first few airports in the world ready for the new mammoth jets and supersonics. Kansas City, Houston, and Toronto look good; San Francisco has a plan, though it may get sunk politicatly. In North America there\u0027s not much else that\u0027s impressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about Europe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Europe is routine,\" Mel said, \"except for Paris---the new Nord airport to replace Le Bourget will be among the finest yet. London is the kind of inefficient mess which only the English can create.\" He paused, considering. \"We shouldn\u0027t knock other countries, though; back home is bad enough. New York is frightening, even with changes being made at Kennedy; there simply isn\u0027t enough airspace above New York---I\u0027m thinking of traveling there by train in future. Washington, D.C., is floundering---Washington National\u0027s a Black Hole of Calcutta; Dulles was a giant step sideways. And Chicago will wake up one day to find it let itself get twenty years behind.\" He stopped, considering. \"You remember a few years ago, when the jets first started flying---what conditions were like at airports which had been designed for DC-4s and Constellations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember,\" Tanya said. \"I worked at one. On normal days you couldn\u0027t move for the crowds; on busy days you couldn\u0027t breathe. We used to say it was like holding the World Series in a sand lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s coming in the 1970s,\" Mel predicted, \"is going to be worse, far worse. And not just people congestion. We\u0027ll be choking on other things, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Airways and traffic control for one, but that\u0027s another whole story. The really big thing, which most airport planning hasn\u0027t caught on to yet is that we\u0027re moving toward the day---fast---when air freight business will be bigger than passenger traffic. The same thing\u0027s been true with every form of transportation, starting with the birchbark canoe. To begin with, people are carried, plus a little freight; but before long, there\u0027s more freight than people. In airline business we\u0027re already closer to that than is generally known. When freight does get to be top dog---as will happen in the next ten years or so---a lot of our present airport ideas will be obsolete. If you want a sign of the way things are moving, watch some of the young men who are going into airline management now. Not long ago, hardly anybody wanted to work in air freight departments; it was backroorn stuff; passenger business had the glamour. Not any more! Now the bright boys are heading for air freight. They know that\u0027s where the future and the big promotions lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya laughed. \"I\u0027ll be old-fashioned and stick with people. Somehow freight...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA waitress came to their table. \"The special\u0027s off, and if we get many more people in here tonight, there won\u0027t be much else either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ordered coffee, Tanya cinnamon toast, and Mel a fried egg sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the waitress had gone, Mel grinned. \"I guess I started to make a speech. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you need the practice.\" She regarded him curiously. \"You haven\u0027t made many lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not president of the Airport Operators Council any more. I don\u0027t get to Washington as much, or other places either.\" But it was not the whole reason for not making speeches and being less in the public eye. He suspected Tanya knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriously, it was a speech of Mel\u0027s which had brought them together to begin with. At one of the rare interline meetings which airlines held, he had talked about coming developments in aviation, and the lag in ground organization compared with progress in the air. He had used the occasion as a dry run for a speech he intended to deliver at a national forum a week or so later. Tanya had been among the Trans America contingent, and next day had sent him one of her lower case notes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emr. b\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espch great. all\u0027v us earthside slaves cheering u 4 admitting airport policy- makers asleep at drawing boards. somebody needed 2 say it. mind suggestion? wd all be more alive if fewer fax, more abt people.... passenger, once inside belly (air plane or whale, remember jonah?) thinks only of self, not system much. i\u0027ll bet orville/wilbur felt same way once off ground. wright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as amusing him, the note had caused him to think. It was true, he realized---he had concentrated on facts and systems to the exclusion of people as individuals. He revised his speech notes, shifting the emphasis as Tanya suggested. The result was the most successful presentation he had ever made. It gained him an ovation and was widely reported internationally. Afterward he had telephoned Tanya to thank her. That was when they had started seeing each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of Tanya\u0027s first message was a reminder of the note she had sent this evening. \"I appreciate that tip about the snow committee report, though I\u0027m curious how you managed to see it before I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No mystery. It was typed in the Trans America office. I saw our Captain Demerest checking it, and chortling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vernon showed it to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but he had it spread out, and I\u0027m adept to reading upside down. Which reminds me, you didn\u0027t answer my question: Why does your brother-in-law dislike you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel grimaced. \"I guess he knows I\u0027m not overly keen on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you wanted to,\" Tanya said, \"you could tell him now. There\u0027s the great man himself.\" She nodded toward the cashier\u0027s desk, and Mel turned his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Vernon Dernerest of Trans America was counting out change as he paid a bill. A tall, broad-shouldered, striking figure, he towered above others around him. He was dressed informally in a Harris tweed jacket and impeccably creased slacks, yet managed to convey an impression of authority---like a Regular Army General, Mel thought, temporarily in civilian clothes. Demerest\u0027s strong, aristocratic features were unsmiling as he addressed a four-striper Trans America captain---in uniform---who was with him. It appeared that Demerest was giving instructions; the other nodded. Captain Dermerest glanced briefly around the coffee shop and, observing Mel and Tanya, gave a curt, cool nod. Then, checking his watch, and with a final word to the other captain, he strode out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He appeared in a hurry,\" Tanya said. \"Though wherever he\u0027s going, it won\u0027t be for long. Captain D. is taking Flight Two to Rome tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel smiled. \"The Golden Argosy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No less. I see, sir, you read our advertising.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard not to.\" Mel was aware, as were millions of others who admired the four-color double-page spreads in Life, Look, the Post, and other national magazines, that Trans America Fight Two---The Golden Argosy---was the airline\u0027s crack, prestige flight. He also knew that only the line\u0027s most senior captains ever commanded it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems to be agreed,\" Mel said, \"that Vernon is one of the finest pilots extant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes, indeed. Extant and arrogant.\" Tanya hesitated, then confided, \"If you\u0027re in a mood for gossip, you aren\u0027t alone in not caring for your brother-in-law. I heard one of our mechanics say not long ago, he was sorry there weren\u0027t propellers any more because he\u0027d always hoped Captain Demerest would walk into one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel said sharply, \"That\u0027s a pretty savage thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree. Personally, I prefer what Mr. Youngquist, our president, is supposed to have said. I understand his instructions about Captain Demerest are: \u0027Keep that bumptious bastard out of my hair, but book me on his flights.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel chuckled. Knowing both men, he felt sure the sally was true. He should not have let himself be drawn into a discussion about Vernon Demerest, he realized, but news of the adverse snow report and the nuisance effect it would have, still rankled. He wondered idly where his brother-in-law was going at the moment, and if it involved one of his amorous adventures, of which---reportedly---there were a good many. Looking toward the central lobby, Mel saw that Captain Demerest had already been swallowed up in the crowds outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the table, Tanya smoothed her skirt with a swift stroking gesture which Mel had noticed before and liked. It was a feminine habit and a reminder that few women looked as good in uniform, which often seemed to have a de-sexing effect, but with Tanya worked the opposite way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome airlines, Mel knew, let their senior passenger agents out of uniform, but Trans America liked the authority which its jaunty blue and gold commanded. Two gold rings edged with white, on Tanya\u0027s cuffs, proclaimed her Job and seniority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if surmising his thoughts, she volunteered, \"I may be out of uniform soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our District Transportation Manager is being transferred to New York. The Assistant D.T.M. is moving up, and I\u0027ve applied for his job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe regarded her with a mixture of admiration and curiosity. \"I believe you\u0027ll get it. And that won\u0027t be the end, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyebrows went up. \"You think I might make vice-president?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe you could. That is, if it\u0027s the kind of thing you want. To be the lady executive; all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya said softly, \"I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s what I want, or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress brought their order. When they were alone again, Tanya said, \"Sometimes us working girls don\u0027t get a lot of choice. If you\u0027re not satisfied to stay in the job you have through pension time---and lots of us aren\u0027t---the only way out is up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re excluding marriage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe selected a piece of cinnamon toast. \"I\u0027m not excluding it. But it didn\u0027t work for me once, and it may not again. Besides which, there aren\u0027t many takers---eligible ones---for used bride with baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might find an exception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might win the Irish Sweep. Speaking from experience, Mel dear, I can tell you that men like their women unencumbered. Ask my ex-husband. If you can find him, that is; I never could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He left you after your baby was born?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodness, no! That way Roy would have had six months of responsibility. I think it was on a Thursday I told him I was pregnant; I couldn\u0027t have kept it to myself much longer. On Friday when I came home from work, Roy\u0027s clothes were gone. So was Roy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t seen him since?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"In the end, it made the divorce much simpler---desertion; no complications like another woman. I have to be fair, though. Roy wasn\u0027t all bad. He didn\u0027t empty our joint checking account, though he could have. I must admit I\u0027ve sometimes wondered if it was kindness, or if he just forgot. Anyway, I had all that eighty dollars to myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel said, \"You\u0027ve never mentioned that before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For sympathy, maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"If you understood me better, you\u0027d know the reason I\u0027m telling you now is because I don\u0027t need sympathy. Everything has worked out fine.\" Tanya smiled. \"I may even get to be an airline vice-president. You just said so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt an adjoining table, a woman said loudly, \"Geez! Lookit the time!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinctively, Mel did. It was three quarters of an hour since he had left Danny Farrow at the Snow Control Desk. Getting up from the table, he told Tanya, \"Don\u0027t go away. I have to make a call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a telephone at the cashier\u0027s counter, and Mel dialed one of the Snow Desk unlisted numbers. Danny Farrow\u0027s voice said, \"Hold it,\" then, a few moments later, returned on the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to call you,\" Danny said. \"I just had a report on that stuck 707 of Aereo-Mexican.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew Mexican had asked TWA for help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they\u0027ve got trucks, cranes, God knows what out there now. The runway and taxiway are blocked off completely, but they still haven\u0027t shifted the damn airplane. The latest word is that TWA has sent for Joe Patroni.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel acknowledged, \"I\u0027m glad to hear it, though I wish they\u0027d done it sooner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Patroni was airport maintenance chief for TWA, and a born troubleshooter. He was also a down-to-earth, dynamic character and a close crony of Mel\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently they tried to get Patroni right away,\" Danny said. \"But he was at home and the people here had trouble reaching him. Seems there\u0027s a lot of phone lines down from the storm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he knows now. You\u0027re sure of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"TWA\u0027s sure. They say he\u0027s on his way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel calculated. He knew that Joe Patroni lived at Glen Ellyn, some twenty-five miles from the airport, and even with ideal driving conditions the journey took forty minutes. Tonight, with snowbound roads and crawling traffic, the airline maintenance chief would be lucky to make it in twice that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If anyone can get that airplane moved tonight,\" Mel conceded, \"it\u0027ll be Joe. But meanwhile I don\u0027t want anybody sitting on his hands until he gets here. Make it clear to everyone that we need runway three zero usable, and urgently.\" As well as the operational need, he remembered unhappily that flights must still be taking off over Meadowood. He wondered if the community meeting, which the tower chief had told him about, was yet in session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been telling \u0027em,\" Danny confirmed. \"I\u0027ll do it some more. Oh, a bit of good news---we found that United food truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The driver okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was unconscious under the snow. Motor still running, and there was carbon monoxide, the way we figured. But they got an inhalator on him, and he\u0027ll be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good! I\u0027m going out on the field now to do some checking for myself. I\u0027ll radio you from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrap up well,\" Danny said. \"I hear it\u0027s a lousy night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya was still at the table when Mel returned, though preparing to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\" he said, \"I\u0027m coming, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe motioned to his untouched sandwich. \"How about dinner? If that\u0027s what it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This will do for now.\" He bolted a mouthful, washed it down hastily with coffee, and picked up his topcoat. \"Anyway, I\u0027m having dinner downtown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Mel paid their check, two Trans America ticket agents entered the coffee shop. One was the supervising agent whom Mel had spoken to earlier. Observing Tanya, he came across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me, Mr. Bakersfeld... Mrs. Livingston, the D.T.M.\u0027s looking for you. He has another problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel pocketed his change from the cashier. \"Let me guess. Somebody else threw a timetable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir.\" The agent grinned. \"I reckon if there\u0027s another thrown this evening it\u0027ll be by me. This one\u0027s a stowaway---on Flight 80 from Los Angeles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all?\" Tanya appeared surprised. Aerial stowaways---though all airlines had them---were seldom a cause of great concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way I hear it,\" the agent said, \"this one\u0027s a dilly. There\u0027s been a radio message from the captain, and a security guard has gone to the gate to meet the flight. Anyway, Mrs. Livingston, whatever the trouble is, they\u0027re calling for you.\" With a friendly nod, he went off to rejoin his companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel walked with Tanya from the coffee shop into the central lobby. They stopped at the elevator which would take Mel to the basement garage where his car was parked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drive carefully out there,\" she cautioned. \"Don\u0027t get in the way of any airplanes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I do, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll hear about it.\" He shrugged into the heavy topcoat. \"Your stowaway sounds interesting. I\u0027ll try to drop by before I leave, to find out what it\u0027s all about.\" He hesitated, then added, \"It\u0027ll give me a reason to see you again tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were close together. As one, each reached out and their hands touched. Tanya said softly, \"Who needs a reason?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the elevator, going down, he could still feel the warm smoothness of her flesh, and hear her voice. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airport/page-3.html","bookId":1522,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:45:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:45:00 AM"}
