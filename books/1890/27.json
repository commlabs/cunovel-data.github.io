I hugged him hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s it hanging, J.D.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA laugh slipped from my lips, \"You fucker. You set me up so bad. You and Brandi are dead meat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"I figured as much. Poor Tex has no clue what he\u0027s getting himself into.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi shrugged, \"Whatever, not our problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance snorted, \"Least I dodged that bullet.\" He slapped Will on the arm, \"You knew what to send to make me change my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill squeezed me again, \"She is your kryptonite my friend. If anyone could make you see, it was J.D.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, \"Good to know you are comfortable with the fact you used me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance snatched me from Will’s arm, \"It worked. ‘Course then she snuck out of the hotel, and the next thing I know, I get a postcard from some vineyard in Greece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gushed, \"It was so nice. I stayed for three weeks and helped with the winter cleanup. I got paid in wine. Best week I ever spent, anywhere. The Mediterranean and wine and the food. Oh God. The lamb was so tender, I almost married the cook but she wasn’t my type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No playoffs beard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudged Mike, \"No, she had that. She was missing the shitty attitude and penchant for Doritos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and carried my bag inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the arch and artwork, \"Oh my God, France. Look at this place. It\u0027s stunning. The artwork is incredible. Imagine if this were your house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Jack, it\u0027s a castle. Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him pull me past the stunning marble foyer and arched hallways to the lady who was planning the wedding. I was running my hand along the marble and woodwork when she passed me a champagne flute and a room key. Will and Brandi stayed outside talking, it looked heated. I looked back, \"Are they screwing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suspect they might be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"She\u0027s pregnant. That’s disgusting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long did she and Shawn try to get pregnant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my fingers along the hallway, \"Look at the art. This is like a museum.\" It took a second to hit me. I grimaced, \"Oh God. It\u0027s not Will\u0027s kid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, \"She comes to every game, they talk all the time, and a few times I saw her walking away crying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did they even meet? I thought she was pregnant when they met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, \"I don’t know or care.\" He opened my door to my room for me. He leaned against the door, \"So, did it work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, \"Did what work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, \"Did I ruin you for every other man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"Not telling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned in, brushing his lips against mine softly. Almost four months had past since we had last seen each other and my feelings had not changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was unsure of everything about myself, and therefore, unable to really commit to feelings for him. The intensity with which I had always loved him scared me into wanting to feel nothing. I stopped him, \"I don’t want this to change the rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, \"You suck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on this trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room had a melon-green bed with matching chairs and drapes. It looked dated, and yet pristine, if that were possible. \"God, I love it here. If I ever get married, I want it to be somewhere like this. A castle with arches and history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were burning, \"Marry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, \"We agreed to wait to start our relationship. I need this time, France. I\u0027m having fun, probably for the first time in a decade. Apart from the times you and I had fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m scared I\u0027ll lose you in all this freedom and fancy-free traveling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"Then you never had me from the start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled his eyes, \"Baby, I had you. That’s what I\u0027m talking about. I want you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my hands against his chest as he got close. I realized what was happening, \"Oh my God, are you horny from lack of sex?\" I cupped my hand on his massive erection and smiled wide, \"Dirty bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moaned, \"Just let me put the tip in. Please. I\u0027m going insane without sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed harder and shoved him back, \"No. The tip counts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe adjusted himself, \"I\u0027m going to die from this, Jack. Die. Will you be comfortable with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded my arms, \"If I\u0027m your beneficiary then… maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed me over his shoulder and threw me onto the bed. He dove on top of me, squishing me the way I liked. He rubbed himself against me, \"Just one quick little check to see if we still like seeing each other naked.\" I wrapped my legs around him, aware of the fact my underwear was pressed on his zipper. He moaned, \"You\u0027re enjoying this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brushed his beard against my neck, lightly kissing and sucking. He slowly lowered himself to my chest. He dragged his lips over where my nipple was. I moaned, \"France, no. Not here. The wedding is in two hours. Your ex-fiancé’s wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were weak so I got up and left the room, before I made a huge mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday evening - The Wedding\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wedding wasn’t huge, maybe a hundred people. The foreigners from the Italian team were all there except Luce. I had wanted to see him badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance didn’t say anything to me after I had left him there hard and annoyed. He was one of the groomsmen, which was weird. At least, I thought it was. He and the groomsmen were all up at the front of the chapel talking with the priest. Tex had crazy, obviously Texan relatives, who were loud and funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saved my sister a seat when I went down to the long, arched corridor where the service was going to be. I hadn’t seen Daniela or Tex. I felt awkward being there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was staring at the paintings on the ceiling when I heard a voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was commissioned by a cardinal. He was a patron of the arts. Most of the house was built in the 1600s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back, smiling wide, \"You came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. He looked the same, but maybe better. His accent was less maybe, or he looked more American. Something about him was different. Maybe it was the way he looked at me. He held his hand out to me, \"You have to see something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed my hand in his and let him lead me through the massive hallways and small clusters of wedding guests. We entered a room with high, arched ceilings. Instantly, both our faces went to the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s called the ancient library.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ceiling was covered in stunning paintings that all came together with a Pegasus in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Imagine if this was just one room in your home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled when he spoke, I could hear it, \"Have you seen the spiral staircase yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the Pannini gallery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him \"The wedding starts in like ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a face, \"We better hurry.\" He walked from the room, \"How is the traveling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Great. I don’t even know who I was four months ago. I feel so liberated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a look, \"How so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"Your eyes are clearer and your sadness is gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked that answer. I smiled and followed him into the chapel. We sat next to each other. I still didn’t see Brandi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce leaned into me, \"How are things with Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"Complicated as per the usual.\" I looked at him, \"We are still not seeing anyone, including each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flinched. He nodded, \"Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, \"What do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"No way. He can tell you himself. I\u0027m not having any part of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sick, and yet, at the same time I completely expected it. Him being a slutty hockey player was not something that was new. I sighed and leaned into Luce, \"How\u0027s Boston?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, \"Cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"Yes, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sister and Will came in and sat together. She glanced back around at me and waved. I cocked an eyebrow but she turned away. The music started as the seats were filled and the wedding began. The bridesmaids came down the red carpet first, looking gorgeous. Of course, they were probably all models as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce whispered, \"Were you surprised Tex and Daniela decided to tie the knot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I was.\" I glanced into his dark-green eyes, \"Were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"They were having an affair for months. Will, Mike\u0027s friend there, came to visit him in August. He caught them in a compromising position. He told me when we were drinking in Boston one night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he tell Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head \"No. The dynamics of the team were already a bit tight. Mike came and some of the other guys were threatened by him. Who leaves the NHL to come and play for Italy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"He was running away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"I know, but a lot of guys said he was being a diva. They said he couldn’t get a contract so he said screw it and came to Italy to prove a point. His New York teammates were pretty angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"That was entirely my fault.\" I looked down the aisle to where Mike stood next to Arthur and the rest of the groomsmen. His dark eyes were burning, watching me and Luce talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music changed and we all stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela looked stunning. Her dress was, by far, the most beautiful wedding dress I had ever seen. Against her olive skin and dark hair, the cream was the perfect contrast. She looked warm and glowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at her as she walked past. She winked at me. I felt the blush creeping up my cheeks. I hadn’t seen her since the wine tasting. She looked happy, oddly enough, considering I had broken up her last relationship. Not to mention, Tex was a big lug and she was a delicate flower. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-27.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
