She seemed to recall her father telling her that one of the New Orleans vamps had recently taken up residence in this part of the city. If anyone would know, it was her dad. He had been a vampire hunter most of his adult life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy had only gone a couple of blocks when the needle on her compass changed colors. Muttering, \"thanks, Dad,\" Daisy made a quick left turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lair was located in a run-down motel that, by the looks of it, had gone out of business quite some time ago. The windows were boarded up. The grass was dead. The pool was empty. Several sun-faded signs warned against trespassing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy parked out of sight behind the motel. After spraying herself with Scent-B-Gone, she grabbed the tools of her trade and followed the compass. It led her into the motel office. Following the now bright-red needle, she went through the office door and down a narrow hallway that led into a small room that held nothing but an old-fashioned, beat-up, boxlike freezer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Daisy stared at the needle and then at the freezer. She tapped the compass lightly, but the needle continued to point at the freezer. Daisy grunted softly. The vampires on the popular TV show Moonlight had slept in freezers. She had never heard of real-life vampires doing such a thing and thought it rather odd, but, hey, the whole vampire thing was odd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging, she reached for the lid, only it wouldn\u0027t open. Locked from the inside, perhaps. Time for the crowbar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took several tries, but she finally managed to pry the lid open. A shiny black coffin rested inside the freezer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shake of her head, Daisy put the crowbar aside and lifted the lid of the coffin. The vampire inside wore a flamboyant red dressing gown embroidered with silver dragons and green pagodas. His bright red hair made a sharp contrast to the white satin lining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy was reaching for her syringe when the vampire\u0027s eyelids flew open. His eyes, a pale brown, quickly turned a hellish red as his hand--his cold, dead hand--snaked out and grabbed her by the wrist. His grip was like iron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a taut moment, they stared at each other. Then, with a shriek, Daisy yanked a wooden stake from her jacket pocket, only then realizing that, with only one free hand, she couldn\u0027t hold the stake and use the mallet at the same time. In a panic, she raised the stake and drove it into the vampire\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never staked a vampire before and she was surprised at how easily the wood pierced its flesh, and how quickly the body turned to ash, until all that remained was the gaudy dressing gown looking like a splash of fresh blood on the white satin, and her stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy pressed a hand to her chest as her legs went out from under her and she slid down to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had destroyed a vampire, killed something that had once been human. The idea filled her with horror and revulsion. She had taken a life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning her head to the side, she was quietly sick to her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik drummed his fingers on the bar top. Either Daisy was late, or she wasn\u0027t coming. Was this her way of getting back at him for standing her up the other night? Or had something happened to her? Perhaps she was sick, or injured. Humans were such fragile creatures. The thought of her in pain distressed him more than it should have. He hardly knew the woman, although that was something he hoped to remedy as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy ten thirty, he accepted the fact that she wasn\u0027t going to show. He couldn\u0027t remember the last time he had felt such keen disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to leave the club when Rhys appeared at his side. Vampires were notorious for keeping their emotions well hidden, but one look at Rhys\u0027s face and Erik knew something was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Saul.\" Costain\u0027s words, though quietly spoken, were edged with steel. \"He\u0027s been destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter taking a long, hot bubble bath, Daisy put on her favorite pj\u0027s and her fluffy white robe and curled up in a corner of the sofa. She couldn\u0027t stop shaking, couldn\u0027t get the image of the vampire\u0027s hell-red eyes out of her head. She hadn\u0027t wanted to destroy him. All she had wanted was a little of his blood. Was that so bad? Strange that there had been no blood when she drove the stake into his heart. Maybe he wasn\u0027t really dead. Maybe he had just disappeared. Worked a little vampire voodoo and vanished. Wishful thinking, that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told herself it had been self-defense. She had seen her death in the vampire\u0027s hellish gaze and her instinct for self-preservation had kicked in. She\u0027d had no choice. It had been him or her. And he was already dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing her robe tighter around her, she went into the kitchen for a cup of hot tea heavily laced with honey, hoping it would calm her nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t. Maybe she should have added a shot of brandy, only she didn\u0027t keep anything stronger than root beer in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing she was never going to be able to sleep, she turned on the TV and skipped through the channels until she found an old comedy she hadn\u0027t seen in a while. But even Gene Wilder couldn\u0027t chase the memory of what she had done from her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the clock, hit Mute on the remote, then picked up the phone. She knew her dad was in bed at this time of the night, but she needed someone to talk to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of his sleepy hello made her feel a hundred percent better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy?\" His voice sharpened. \"Is something wrong, honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...I destroyed a vampire tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" he asked, his voice sharp with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Did you hear what I said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard. What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told him, as quickly and succinctly as she could, what she had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was you or him, honey, you did the right thing. I\u0027m just glad you\u0027re okay. Do you need us to come out there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Now that she was feeling a little better, she was ashamed of herself for calling home. But then, it had been calling home that made her feel better. As far back as she could remember, her father had been her bulwark. He had never made light of her fears, never chided her for being afraid. Instead, he had helped her face her fears, whether it was her dislike of spiders, or her irrational fear of the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know which vamp you destroyed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I think he must have been an old one, otherwise he wouldn\u0027t have turned to ash. I don\u0027t know if it was the one you told me about or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An older-looking vamp with gray hair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, this one had red hair. Bright red.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Saul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saul.\" Knowing his name made it worse somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daisy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all right, Dad. Sorry I woke you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem, honey. Mom wants to say hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy assured her mother she was fine, then spent the next ten minutes listening while Irene O\u0027Donnell extolled Kevin O\u0027Reilly\u0027s many virtues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mom, I\u0027m sure he\u0027s wonderful,\" Daisy said, hoping to cut the conversation short by agreeing with her mother. \"He sounds like a cross between Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp. Yes, Mom, I love you, too. Good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing the cell phone on the table, Daisy grabbed one of the sofa pillows and clutched it to her chest as images of a vampire moved across the silent TV screen. With an aggrieved sigh, she switched off the set, only then remembering that she had missed her first real date with Erik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrene O\u0027Donnell sat up, a worried expression on her face. \"You should have told Daisy to come home,\" she said, folding her arms over her chest. \"She would have listened to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a big girl,\" Noah O\u0027Donnell replied. \"Sure and she\u0027ll be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrene shook her head. \"Dealing in vampire blood is no fit occupation for a young woman. It\u0027s bad enough that our sons followed in your footsteps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darlin\u0027,\" Noah said patiently, \"we\u0027ve been through this before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we\u0027re going through it again. Daisy is a beautiful girl. She should be out looking for a husband, not vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lord, don\u0027t start with Kevin O\u0027Reilly again,\" Noah said, groaning. \"The man\u0027s a first-class idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is not!\" Irene said hotly. \"He\u0027s a perfectly fine young man with a wonderful future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s an insurance salesman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s wrong with that? It\u0027s a nice, safe line of work. Steady income. Fixed hours. Good retirement. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Safe!\" Noah scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with safe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s boring. Daisy would never be happy with him in a million years. Our girl needs a man who\u0027s strong enough to stand beside her and hold his own, not some namby-pamby insurance salesman who\u0027d run for cover at the first sign of danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you, you...\" She slapped one hand on the mattress in frustration. \"You are the most infuriating man I\u0027ve ever known!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That may be, but at least you\u0027re never bored when I\u0027m around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at him. Damn and blast, he was the most handsome, annoying man she had ever met, and she loved him more than life itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah laughed softly. \"Irene, would you be happy married to Kevin O\u0027Reilly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, Irene scooted closer to her husband. \"No,\" she admitted. \"Not in a million years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about our Daisy,\" Noah said as he turned off the light and drew his sweet wife into his arms. \"The right man will come along soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vampire Council met in the wee small hours of the morning. Anger and a need to avenge one of their own filled the air like thick smoke as each vampire spoke in turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik stood against the wall, his arms folded over his chest. He didn\u0027t know who the Blood Thief was, but the man\u0027s fate had been sealed when he destroyed Saul. All that remained now was to find the thief, and execute him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasier said than done, Erik thought. Whoever the man was, he was smart enough to eradicate any trace of his presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps we could set a trap,\" Mariah suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys nodded. \"Perhaps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A couple of us could set up new lairs,\" Damon said. \"Make them easier to find, easier to breach.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-5.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
