It was not only that--her brother was becoming bolder and bolder in his pursuit of the half-blood. He hardly ever tried to disguise the fact that he lingered in hall- ways outside Schuyler\u0027s classroom, or had taken to hanging out in the library at school or the Repository to catch a glimpse of her. Mimi had even caught the two of them shamelessly flirting in public! The other day a friend told her she had seen Jack actually walk out of the school with Schuyler in his arms! Not that Mimi even believed that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi drew the pentagram as the book had instructed, with a small white chalk on the pale blond hardwood floor. Then she placed the necessary ingredients together in a small steel bowl on her dressing-room table: verbena leaves, bay leaves, a cluster of tiger lilies, marjoram, a toad heart, and a bat wing. The array looked out of place among the many crystal bottles of perfume and expensive French lotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lit a candle and drew a flame from it with a stick of rosemary. She blew out the candle as directed and threw the burning herb into the bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall, violet flame erupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi glanced at herself in the mirror and was surprised to find that the room, which only moments before had been filled with afternoon sunlight, was now pitch black, save for the light shooting up from the bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands trembled slightly as she opened a small, glassine envelope that contained Schuyler Van Alen\u0027s hair. She shook out the contents and held it in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book instructed her to throw the hair into the flame, while saying the words that would vanquish her enemy. Mimi closed her eyes and tossed it into the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I, Azrael, command the spirits. Annul the power of my rival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I, Azrael, command the spirits. Annul the power of my rival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I, Azrael, command the spirits. Annul the power of my rival.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MIMI!\" The door flew open. Charles Force stood at the entryway. With a wave of his hand, he extinguished the bright violet flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi opened her eyes and gasped. She tried vainly to wipe off the traces of the pentagram with her foot. \"I was just curious,\" she explained. \"The Committee never lets us do anything....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked over to her side and poked a finger into the burning embers. \"It is understandable. We are made from dark magic--we who are condemned to walk the earth for- ever. But these incantations are very strong. If you do not know how to control them, they can control you. That is why it is forbidden to the young until you are ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles picked up the book on her desk. \"Where did you get this? I know, The Repository. But this is kept under lock and key. It is a dangerous book for those who are not yet of age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tucked the book under his arm. \"Darling, why don\u0027t you find something else to do with your time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her father left, Mimi picked up her white princess phone and dialed a familiar number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kingsley,\" Mimi asked. \"Can I talk to you for a minute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, baby, what\u0027s on your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know that thing you said? About calling up a Silver Blood from the Dark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it would work?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-33.html","bookId":2120,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM"}
