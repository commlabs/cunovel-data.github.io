Even Chen Manyao seemed very curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongsun Wan’er was the only one with a slight smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, up at the front of the ship, Bai Xiaochun was only just now recovering from his shock. It was with a very odd expression that he looked at Zhao Tianjiao, pondering how this was the 1st place Eldest Brother from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars, a person with a profound cultivation base, who could cut down Nascent Soul experts....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hm, this is the kind of guy I should probably make friends with,” he thought. “That way, if someone picks on me in the Wildlands, I’ll have someone to help me out. Things will probably go much more smoothly with a friend like him.” With these thoughts on his mind, Bai Xiaochun smiled and patted Zhao Tianjiao’s shoulder like he would a close companion. Voice as casual as a spring breeze, he said, “Eldest Brother....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Tianjiao wasn’t used to people touching him, and was about to back away, when he heard Bai Xiaochun’s tone of voice, and could tell that he was speaking with heartfelt sincerity. Therefore, he allowed Bai Xiaochun to continue to clasp his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to trust me on this one, Eldest Brother. Those two girls you saw me with, there are only two of them, right? Well, back in the River-Defying Sect, I got love letters from tens of thousands of girls!” Bai Xiaochun sighed and tried not to look proud of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssuming that Bai Xiaochun must be exaggerating, Zhao Tianjiao frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the expressions playing out on their faces fueled more discussions among the onlookers. That was especially true when Bai Xiaochun clasped Zhao Tianjiao’s shoulder, and Zhao Tianjiao didn’t back away. Shocked expressions appeared on the faces of everyone present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo these people, Zhao Tianjiao occupied the highest of high positions, and was a completely proud and aloof figure. He was the type of cold person that no one could ever get close to. Therefore, to see this sudden change in behavior was quite shocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the prow of the ship, Zhao Tianjiao was frowning in disappointment at Bai Xiaochun. In fact, he was actually planning to simply turn and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey! You still don\u0027t believe me? Alright, look at this!” Bai Xiaochun hated when people didn’t trust what he said, so he quickly patted his bag of holding, causing a rustling sound to fill the air as vast quantities of love letters began to spill out like rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were so many of them that they quickly formed a tiny mountain right there on the deck. Zhao Tianjiao gasped, his eyes going wide with shock and disbelief. He even picked up a few of the letters and read them, whereupon an expression of even greater astonishment appeared. It quickly became obvious that all of the love letters were written by different people, and were not fake. There were even some jade slips in the pile, within which could be seen the beautiful faces of the girls who had delivered them....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Th-this... this....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Tianjiao was starting to pant, and his heart trembled fiercely as it was battered by waves of shock. He looked up slowly at Bai Xiaochun, the same expression in his eyes that he would have if he was facing a deva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwishing his sleeve proudly, Bai Xiaochun stuck his chin up and said, “See? Now do you believe me? And this is only some of my collection. I have more in my bag of holding. With the snap of a finger, I, Bai Xiaochun, won over the hearts of countless female cultivators in the River-Defying Sect!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strange scene which was now playing out caused the hearts and minds of the onlookers to be filled with both shock and speculation. No one could hear the words being spoken, and divine sense was useless, so all they could do was watch what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen people saw the huge pile of letters pouring out of Bai Xiaochun’s bag of holding, they gaped in shock. At first, many people didn’t take the letters to be anything special, but soon people realized that many of them were folded up into the shape of hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are those things? Heavens! Eldest Brother is actually going through and reading some of them! Why do I get the feeling that those are love letters?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah. No way! Have you ever seen anyone with \u003cem\u003ethat\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003emany love letters? There must be more than 10,000 of them! They’re obviously not love letters! Besides, look at the expression on Eldest Brother’s face. He’s clearly privy to some mysterious secret, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How come this Bai Xiaochun only proves to be more and more enigmatic?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, when Chen Manyao recognized the love letters, she made a ‘pshaw’ sound, seemingly unsure of whether to laugh or cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore people could look at the scene too closely to analyze what was happening, Zhao Tianjiao took a deep breath and waved his hand, causing the sound barrier to suddenly blur, making it impossible for anyone to even see the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpression extremely somber and profoundly sincere, Zhao Tianjiao clasped hands and bowed deeply to Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Junior Brother Bai, I almost can’t believe that someone as young as you has such uncanny skill. I wonder if you might be willing to deign to teach me a thing or two?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was yet again taken aback by the strange sight of Zhao Tianjiao looking so serious and yet uttering such words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to learn that kind of stuff?” Bai Xiaochun asked quizzically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes shining with solemnity, Zhao Tianjiao took a deep breath and yet again bowed deeply. “Junior Brother Bai, please teach me. I want to be happy in life, and if you can bless me with such kindness, I’ll never forget it for as long as I live!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun blinked a couple times as he finally came to realize what was going on. Zhao Tianjiao was clearly the type of person who seemed cold and distant on the outside, but was secretly very passionate and romantic. After a moment, Bai Xiaochun laughed heartily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, we’re brothers, right? What do you mean teach you a thing or two? Let’s schedule some time and I’ll teach you everything I know. Just tell me which girl it is that you like. There’s no challenge that Love Saint Bai Xiaochun can’t handle!” He even slapped his chest confidently to emphasize his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Tianjiao heaved a long sigh of relief. They immediately set a time to meet and discuss the matter further, after which Zhao Tianjiao bowed deeply, then dispelled the sealing shield and walked away somberly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun put all of the love letters away, and then strutted proudly back to his Dao protectors. Master God-Diviner seemed very curious, and although Song Que was feigning complete disinterest, it was obvious that he was paying close attention to Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, Master God-Diviner couldn’t hold back from asking, “Junior Patriarch, what were you talking about over there with Zhao Tianjiao?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t say,” Bai Xiaochun said, shaking his head in very enigmatic fashion. “It’s a matter which touches on the most important thing in Elder Brother Zhao’s life. How could I possibly reveal that information so casually?” Clasping his hands behind his back, he pompously strolled off toward his cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, his secrecy only caused Master God-Diviner and the others to grow more curious, and it was the same with everyone else who had been present to witness the scene. In fact, many people began making discreet inquiries to try to dig up information, although none of that produced any results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days passed, during which time Bai Xiaochun never left his cabin. Instead, he waited patiently for Zhao Tianjiao to come consult with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing this, Master God-Diviner couldn’t help but ask about the situation a few more times, but each time, his inquiries were rebuffed. Finally, though, Bai Xiaochun sighed and said, “I’m waiting for someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zhao Tianjiao?” Master God-Diviner replied, shocked. Even Song Que’s ears perked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right,” Bai Xiaochun replied calmly. “The truth is that the only person on this entire battleship who can help him is me, Bai Xiaochun.” With that, he closed his eyes and continued to meditate, looking prouder of himself than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster God-Diviner and Song Que exchanged a quizzical glance. However, no amount of speculation on their part could provide any insight. Finally, when evening was falling on the third day, Zhao Tianjiao’s voice could be heard outside the cabin door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Junior Brother Bai in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster God-Diviner and Song Que looked over at Bai Xiaochun, who slowly opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Que’er, hurry up and get the door. Manyao, please give us some privacy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Manyao gave a light harrumph. She had her own speculations about what was going on, but had no choice but to glide over to her room and close the door. As for Song Que, his eyes widened to a glare, but he knew that he was a guest under someone else’s roof, so therefore he simply gritted his teeth and went to open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the door opened, Zhao Tianjiao appeared, solemn as ever as he walked in with two followers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two followers had anxious expressions on their faces; they happened to be two of the chosen from the Hall of Devil Slayers that Bai Xiaochun had visited to ask for help buying medicinal ingredients. Back then, both of them had intentionally made things difficult for Bai Xiaochun. One of them had quoted an astronomical price, and the other had pretended to be in secluded meditation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could they ever have imagined that Bai Xiaochun would suddenly rise to the top in spectacular fashion, reaching the violet portion of the rainbow and shaking the entire sect? Of course, even after all of that, they had still felt confident that Bai Xiaochun wouldn’t come looking for revenge, not considering that they were followers of Zhao Tianjiao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, it was to their complete disbelief that they learned that Zhao Tianjiao and Bai Xiaochun were somehow very close to each other. What was even more shocking was that Zhao Tianjiao had a very serious expression on his face, and was being very polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them couldn’t help but be quite shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon entering, Zhao Tianjiao took a deep breath and, completely ignoring the fact that Master God-Diviner and Song Que were still present, clasped hands and bowed deeply. “Junior Brother Bai, I hope you won’t laugh at me when I tell you that I’ve always been in love with Junior Sister Yueshan. I just don’t know how to win her over. In terms of compensation, I’ll give you anything you ask for, as long as it’s in my power. Even a deva beast soul!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-448\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-450\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-449","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM"}
