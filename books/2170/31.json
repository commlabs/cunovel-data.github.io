And the Lord said unto Cain, \"Where is Abel, thy brother?\" and he said, \"I know not: am I my brother\u0027s keeper?\" and He said, \"What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother\u0027s blood cries unto Me from the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Christian Book of the Dead, Shiprecords\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ANYTHING GOES here?\" Legata asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied Sy Murdoch carefully as he thought about the question. He was taking too long to answer. She did not like this man, the pale eyes which defied everything around them. He kept the lab too bright, especially this late in the dayside. The young E-clones huddled against a far wall were obviously terrified of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That takes a little thought,\" Murdoch said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegata pursed her lips. This was her second visit to Lab One in three diurns. She did not believe the reasons for this one. Oakes had pretended anger that she had not penetrated every element of the lab, but she had sensed the flaws in his performance. He was lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy had Oakes sent her back here? Lewis was no longer out of contact. What did those two know that they had not shared with her? Legata felt anger at the frustrating unknowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurdoch moved cautiously. Oakes had ordered Legata sent through the Scream Room, an \"exploratory,\" but had warned: \"She is frighteningly strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow strong? Stronger than me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not see how she could be. Such a bouncy little thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked you a simple question,\" Legata said, not bothering to conceal her anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting question, but not simple. Why do you ask it that way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027ve seen the lab reports to Morgan. You\u0027re doing some strange things here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wel.... I would say that there are few limits here, but isn\u0027t that the basis for discovery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe replied with a cold stare, and he went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are few limits here, so long as Doctor Oakes has a complete holorecord of what we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has us on holo right now,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he said that made Legata\u0027s skin crawl. Murdoch carried his powerful body like a dancer. He lifted his chin and she saw a scar beneath his jaw that she had not noticed before. It mingled with creases as he lowered his chin. There was no telling his age. Given the possibility that he might be a clone, there was no telling his chronological age either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave to look into him, she noted to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe things Lewis was having done her....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced around the room once more. Something was not right. She saw the usual holo, com-console, sensors, but the place offended her directly, she was one who appreciated beauty. Not decoration, but beauty. The two huge flowers flanking the hatchwa.... she\u0027d noticed them before. They were pink as tongues and their petals convoluted into one another like a line of mirrors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange, she thought, they smell like sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get on with it,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, a formality requested by Doctor Oakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurdoch swung a sensorscribe from a panel beside the lock. It appeared to be the standard identification reader of her shipside experience. She placed her hand on the flat plate to allow it to read her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid formality, everyone knew who she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden tingling sensation shot up her arm from her palm and she realized that Murdoch had said something to her. What did he say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorr.... what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt weak and disoriented. Something....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw that the hatch was open and she had no memory of him opening it. What had he done to her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurdoch\u0027s hand was on her shoulder propelling her into the lock. As she passed through the hatchway she imagined that she heard a tiny voice pleading from the heart of one of the flowers: Feed me, feed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the hatch seal behind her and realized that she was alone and the inner door was swinging ope.... slowl.... ponderous. What was all the red light? And those dim shapes movin.... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked toward the opening hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo strange that Murdoch had not accompanied her. She peered at the shapes awash in the red glow beyond the inner hatch. Oh, yes - the new E-clones. Some of them she recognized from the lab reports. They were designed to match the synapse-quick demons of Pandora. There was a problem with breeding for speed, something she\u0027d intended to investigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it she wanted to watch for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice whispered in her ear: \"I am Jessup. Come to me when you are through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did I get inside here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was wrong with her time sense. She swallowed hard and felt the thickness of her dry tongue rasp against the roof of her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good and evil hang their uniforms at the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid somebody say that or did I think it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes had said, \"Anything goes on Pandora. Our every fancy is possible there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s why I asked Murdoc.... where is Murdoch? The gargoyle clones were all around her now and she tried to focus on them. Her eyes were not tracking. Someone grabbed her left arm. Painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go of me, yo....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rippled her arm and heard the grunts of surprise. Peculiar things were happening to her sense of time and the awareness of her own flesh. Blood welled up on her arms and she had no memory of how it got there. And her body - it was naked. Her muscles corded reflexively and she crouched in defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is happening to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore hands - rough hands. She responded in a slow-motion flex of power. And she distinctly heard someone screaming. How odd that no one responded to those screams! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-31.html","bookId":2170,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM"}
