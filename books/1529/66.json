More of the pack had been lying in wait. Rakao read the fury in the flickers. They swirled like a luminous whirlpool around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething bumped his leg. Teeth clamped to his ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRakao knew it was the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis men would never reach him in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRakao stared across the waters at the fleeing boat. He dropped his spear and clutched to a holster at his shoulder. He kept it with him at all times. It held no gun. Only insurance. He twisted the T-handle that protruded from the leather holster and pulled the plunger out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tentacle wrapped around his waist, ripping with teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he couldn\u0027t escape, no one would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRakao shoved the plunger as a tangle of tentacles lashed out of the water like flailing whips. From all directions, they fell upon him, ripping cloth and flesh, taking his legs out from under him. He felt his right ear torn away as he was dragged beneath the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he heard the explosions, thunder from above, pounding through the water, reaching him as the monsters dragged him deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom, boom, boom . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:57 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa watched the fiery explosions lighting up the island\u0027s highlands. At first, she thought it was lightning strikes—but they exploded sequentially, rimming around the top of the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell?\" Ryder called from the pilot\u0027s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSections of the island\u0027s canopy began to fall in fiery ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe yelled. \"Someone\u0027s blowing up the net! It\u0027s all coming down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder cursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplosions continued. Fires lit the skies, speeding around the island\u0027s heights. Unless they fled faster, reached the lagoon\u0027s exit, they\u0027d be smothered under the net when it all came down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to get airborne!\" Ryder called back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:57 a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcussive blasts lit up the rim of the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe net. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sea Dart suddenly sped faster, trying to outrun the explosions. The boat lifted out of the water a few inches as it surpassed takeoff speeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Monk\u0027s swinging weight unbalanced the boat, tilting it. His toes skimmed the waters. Ryder corrected, slowing the speed. They struck the water, bounced, then settled again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain shot up Monk\u0027s broken leg. Still he hung clamped to the strut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if he had wanted to, he could not detach. His tussle with Rakao\u0027s spear had fried the electronics of his prosthetic hand. It had shut down after clamping to the wing strut. He was hooked like a slab of beef in a butcher\u0027s shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twisted around, watching the explosions continue around the island. The entire back half of the net drifted down, raining fire amid the storm\u0027s downpour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd more of the sky fell with each explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk stared back toward the exit to the lagoon, the narrow crack in the volcanic caldera. The Sea Dart had to reach it before the explosions completed their circuit around the volcanic rim and dropped the net over lake. Monk calculated their odds. Not good. And they\u0027d never make it—not while dragging a side of beef from one wingtip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you retract the wings?\" Lisa called to Ryder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe they could pull Monk in close, get him inside, then extend the wings out again. All without slowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder dashed this thin hope. \"Once extended, the wings are locked out! A built-in safety feature!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa understood. It would not be good to have the wings retract while in midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa watched Monk struggling. He was digging at his prosthetic wrist with his good hand. What was he doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it dawned on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk must have realized the threat he posed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" she called to him. \"Monk! No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know if he heard her past the explosions and wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he did twist his head and faced her. He pointed toward the lagoon\u0027s distant beach. He yelled something, but one of the thunderous blasts battered away his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to his efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk. . . please, no . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it all . . . why can\u0027t I let go . . . ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers dug at the plastic wrist. The toggle that manually released his hand from its wrist attachment had melted. His fingernails tore into the bubbled synthetics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the toggle snapped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God. ..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached a finger inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monk!\" Lisa called to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelenting, he pointed again to the beach. He would make for shore. They had to go on without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa knelt in the opening, wind whipping her hair. He read the defeat there, too. There was no alternative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk reached through the open toggle and pressed the release button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrist detached from hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fell, tumbling to the water, skipping along, like a skimmed stone. Then he sank into the depths. He kicked his good leg to reach the surface; his other leg felt like someone had jabbed a burning poker through his calf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTreading water, he watched the Sea Dart speed across the lagoon, heading for the crack in the caldera that led out to the open sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder didn\u0027t hesitate. He understood the sacrifice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the last explosions ripped along the rim of the island, Monk stared up. The netting swamped down toward him. He glanced back. Across the lagoon, the canopy fell like a fiery shroud over the Mistress of the Seas, starting it the stern and working toward the bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn seconds the cruise ship was swamped under it, caught like a dolphin in a tuna net. And the collapse continued, sweeping toward Monk. He had no hope of reaching any beach. The closest lay five hundred yards away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the other direction, he watched the Sea Dart escape into the air, pulling up, lifting off the lake, and racing toward the opening in the caldera wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis thought helped settle his heart as the net fell atop him, heavy with cabling and sodden rope. It dragged him down, down, down . ..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk struggled for a way through it, to reach the surface again. But his broken leg confounded him. And the net had folded a bit on itself. He could find no way through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared up at the lights of the cruise ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith only one regret... a broken promise .. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d sworn to Kat that he would return from this mission, and he had kissed Penelope with the same silent promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached one arm up, praying for some rescue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand found a hole in the tangled net. He used the stump of his other arm to force it wider. He kicked both legs, ignoring the pain from his right calf. He struggled to worm through the opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something snagged his broken leg, latching to his ankle, and tugged hard. Bone ground against bone. Agony lanced from leg to spine. Monk gasped out his last breath and stared down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLights in the water streaked up toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArms climbed his body, wrapped around his waist, over his chest. A rubbery limb clamped across his face, across the same lips that had once made a promise, once kissed a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLights flashed around him as Monk was dragged down, down, down . . . Still, he searched up one last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the glow of the cruise ship faded and darkness closed over him, he sent his heart out to the two women who gave his life any meaning. Kat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope. I love you, love you, love you . ..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:05 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa sat in the backseat of the Sea Dart, bent over her knees, sobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan sat next to her, resting a hand on her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder fought the winds as he flew the Sea Dart across the open water. The island of Pusat faded behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storm blew them like a leaf in a gale. There was no use fighting it. They simply fled with the wind, skimming north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had no radio. A stray round had punched through the unit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sun\u0027s rising,\" Susan mumbled, staring out the window, ignoring the navigation map on her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words broke some barrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder spoke from the pilot\u0027s seat. \"Maybe he made it to shore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa sat back. She knew Monk had not. Still, she wiped her eyes. Monk had sacrificed himself so they might escape. So that those left behind aboard the Mistress of the Seas had some chance of rescue, that the world had some hope of a cure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Lisa only felt numb and dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sun .. .\" Susan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder banked east, skirting around another island peak. Off near the horizon, there was some sign of an end to the night\u0027s storm. The black clouds split enough to allow sunlight to stream toward them. The first edge of the day\u0027s sun peeked above the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the windshield, light flooded the cabin with brilliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa stared toward it, seeking some absolution, to bask in the brightness, to let it inside her, to chase away the darkness there, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it seemed to work—until Susan let out a terrifying scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa jumped and turned. Susan sat bolt upright in her seat, staring wide-eyed toward the sun. But something in her eyes shone even brighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaw fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman continued to stare. Her mouth moved, breathless. Lisa had to read her lips. \"They must not go there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who? Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan didn\u0027t answer. Without looking down, she took a finger and placed it on the navigation map in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa read the name under her finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angkor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBayon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 7, 6:35 a.m. Angkor Thorn, Cambodia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray marched with the others toward the massive gates of the walled temple complex of Angkor Thom. The morning sun, low on the horizon, cast long shadows across the south causeway. Cicadas buzzed, along with the morning chorus of frogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for a handful of tourists and a pair of saffron-robed monks, they had the bridge to themselves at this early hour. The causeway stretched a full football field in length, framed along the edges by rows of statues: fifty-four gods on one side and fifty-four demons on the other. They overlooked a moat, mostly dry now, where once crocodiles swam, protecting the great city and the royal palace inside. The deep moat, bordered by earthen embankments, now languished in emerald expanses of algae-covered pools and swaths of grass and weeds. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-66.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
