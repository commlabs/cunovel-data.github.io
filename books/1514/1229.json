Then, he was silent for a moment before he said, “I acted behind your backs this time around, and it was indeed a shameful deed and perhaps even a little unfair to you and… Ying Huanhuan. Hence, it is only natural for you to be upset.

Moreover, there were a few powerful Yimo that were able to match up to us, and force us into a situation whereby we would both be injured. In fact, even though the Yimo were ultimately forced to retreat, we were also forced to enter a slumber or to enter Reincarnation.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Currently, teacher is no longer around.

Following which, he took a mouthful of that pungent and intense wine. Then, he shook his wine jar and said, “You people have noble intentions. In this regard, I am indeed lacking compared to you. However, this is not a competition that I wish to be a part of. I have fought my way and slowly climbed up from a small place, and I have also been through a lot. The reason why I am training and working hard is simple. I only want to protect those whom I wish to protect.

Therefore, should we lose the war, there is no way that I will be able to protect those that I care about. That is indeed true. Therefore, in order to protect them, I will not hesitate even if I have to fight to the death with the Yimo. Honestly speaking, I have been fighting with the Yimo through various means over the years.

Is it because of what the Symbol Ancestor once said?” Lin Dong smiled. Under the illumination of the sunlight, he looked exceptionally determined.

Meanwhile, his expression suddenly became a little complicated as he looked at Lin Dong and said, “Although in my opinion, I feel that your mindset is a little naive, I admire your courage. Once upon a time, I had the same mindset as well. After all, I fancied her and also wanted to help her to shoulder that responsibility.

He softly said, “Ultimately, I chose to give up in the face of such responsibility. This was because I felt that I did not possess the ability to shoulder it. Haha, frankly, it is because I lack the courage. Everything else is merely an excuse. At times, I do admire your perseverance.

Then, he glanced at Lin Dong and said, “Ultimately, our desires will not change the situation. However, since you are so confident in yourself, you should use your own abilities to prove it. We only have one opportunity and it will be reserved for little junior sister. As of now, you are not qualified to compete with her.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong held onto his jar of wine. He knew that it was currently impossible for him to convince the Flame Master. After all, the two of them had completely opposite standpoints. He wanted to protect Ying Huanhuan, while the Flame Master wanted to awaken the Ice Master. However, the both of them could not coexist.

Then, he stood up and looked at the back mountain, which was now permeated by cold aura.

He did not alert anyone. However, by the time he arrived at the entrance of Dao Sect, there was already a lovely figure wearing a white dress quietly standing there.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You are early.” Lin Dong smiled towards Ling Qingzhu and said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It is going to be a long journey to the Northern Xuan Region. The sooner we leave, the sooner we can come back.” Ling Qingzhu was still holding a longsword in her hand.

After which, he turned around and glanced at Dao Sect, before he sighed. After which, without hesitation, he waved his hand and turned around in a free and easy manner. Finally, his body moved before he transformed into a ray of light and shot across the sky.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen she saw this, Ling Qingzhu also transformed into a ray of light and quickly followed behind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs the two of them left, there seemed to be a figure looking at them from afar at the back mountain of Dao Sect, which was now permeated by cold aura.
