She rolled over, wanting to cling to sleep until Lucilla\u0027s maid brought the morning chocolate. She\u0027d had the most awful dream about some gray-eyed man carrying her off to a hot, desolate place. He\u0027d been handsome, the way men in dreams were supposed to be, but in a rugged, almost uncivilized way. His skin had been like bronze, taut over his face. He\u0027d had high, almost exotic cheekbones, and the dark shadow of a beard. His hair had been untidy and as black as coal-but thick, quite thick, as it had swept down past his collar. She\u0027d wondered, even in the dream, what it would be like to run her hands through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been something familiar about him, almost as if she\u0027d known him. In fact, when he\u0027d forced her to kiss him, a name had run through her mind. Then he hadn\u0027t had to force her any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrowsy, Sarah smiled. She would have to tell Lucilla about the dream. They would both laugh about it before they dressed for the day. Lazily she opened her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t the rose-and-white room she used whenever she visited Lucilla and her family. Nor was it the familiar bedroom she had had for years at school. Her father\u0027s house, she thought, as everything came back to her. This was her father\u0027s house, but her father was dead. She was alone. With an effort, she resisted the urge to bury her face in the pillow and weep again. She had to decide what to do, and in order to decide she had to think clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some time last night she\u0027d been certain the best thing would be for her to return to town and use the money she had found to book passage east again. At best, Lucilla\u0027s family would welcome her. At worst, she could return to the convent. But that had been before she\u0027d begun reading her father\u0027s journal. It had taken only the first two pages, the only two she\u0027d allowed herself, to make her doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d begun the journal on the day he\u0027d left her to come west. The love and the hope he\u0027d felt had been in every word. And the sadness. He\u0027d still been raw with grief over the death of Sarah\u0027s mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time she fully understood how devastated he had been by the loss of the woman they\u0027d both shared so briefly. And how inadequate he\u0027d felt at finding himself alone with a little girl. He\u0027d made a promise to his wife on her deathbed that he would see that their daughter was well cared for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered the words her father had written on the yellowed paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was leaving me. There was nothing I could do to stop it. Toward the end there was so much pain I prayed for God to take her quickly. My Ellen, my tiny, delicate Ellen. Her thoughts were all for me, and our sweet Sarah. I promised her. The only comfort I could give was my promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur daughter would have everything Ellen wanted for her. Proper schooling and church on Sunday. She would be raised the way my Ellen would have raised her. Like a lady. One day she\u0027d have a fine house and a father she could be proud of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d come here to try, Sarah thought as she tossed back the thin blanket. And she supposed he\u0027d done as well as he could. Now she had to figure what was best. And if she was going to think, first she needed to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she\u0027d dressed in her oldest skirt and blouse, she took stock of the-cupboard again. She could not, under any circumstances, face another meal of cold beans. Perhaps he had a storage cellar somewhere, a smokehouse, anything. Sarah pushed open the door and blinked in the blinding sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first she thought it was a mirage. But mirages didn\u0027t carry a scent, did they? This one smelled of meat roasting and coffee brewing. And what she saw was Jake Redman sitting cross-legged by a fire ringed with stones. Gathering up her skirt, she forgot her hunger long enough to stride over to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up and gave her the briefest of nods. He poured coffee from a small pot into a dented tin cup. \"Having breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You rode all the way out here to have breakfast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what it was he was turning on the spit, but her stomach was ready for just about anything. \"Nope.\" He tested the meat and judged it done. \"Never left.\" He jerked his head in the direction of the rocks. \"Bedded down over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There?\" Sarah eyed the rocks with some amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up again. The look in his eyes made her hands flutter nervously. It made her feel, though it was foolish, that he knew how she looked stripped down to her chemise, \"Let\u0027s say it was a long ride back to town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hardly expect you to watch over me, Mr. Redman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI explained that I could take... What is that?\" Jake was eating with his fingers and with obvious enjoyment. \"Rabbit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rabbit?\" Sarah wrinkled her nose at the idea, but her stomach betrayed her. \"I suppose you trapped it on my property.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it was her property already. \"Might\u0027ve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s the case, the least you could do is offer to share.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake obligingly pulled off a hunk of meat. \"Help yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have any... Never mind.\" When in Rome, Sarah decided. Taking the meat and the coffee he offered, she sat down on a rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get yourself some supper last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thank you.\" Never, never in her life, had she tasted anything better than this roast rabbit in the already-sweltering morning. \"You\u0027re an excellent cook, Mr. Redman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get by.\" He offered her another hunk. This time she didn\u0027t hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really.\" She caught herself talking with her mouth full, and she didn\u0027t care. \"This is delightful.\" Because she doubted that his saddlebags held any linens, she licked her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better than a can of cold beans, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced up sharply, but he wasn\u0027t even looking at her. \"I suppose.\" She\u0027d never had breakfast with a man before, and she decided it would be proper to engage in light conversation. \"Tell me, Mr. Redman, what is your profession?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never gave it much thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But surely you must have some line of work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\" He leaned back against a rock and, taking out his pouch of tobacco, proceeded to roll a cigarette. She looked as fresh and neat as a daisy, he thought. You\u0027d have thought she\u0027d spent the night in some high-priced hotel instead of a mud hut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently making conversation over a breakfast of roasted rabbit took some skill. Patiently she smoothed her skirts and tried again. \"Have you lived in Arizona long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-\" The cool, flat look he sent her had her fumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Simple curiosity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know about back in Philadelphia.\" Jake took out a match, scraped it on the rock and twisted the end of his cigarette, studying her while \"But around here people don\u0027t take kindly to questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" Her back had stiffened. She\u0027d never encountered anyone to whom rudeness came so easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a civilized society, a casual question is merely a way to begin a conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Around here it\u0027s a way to start a fight.\" He drew on the cigarette. \"You want to fight with me, Duchess?\" \"I\u0027ll thank you to stop referring to me by that name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at her again, but lazily, the brim of his hat shadowing his eyes. \"You look like one, especially when you\u0027re riled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer chin came up. She couldn\u0027t help it. But she answered him in calm, even tones. \"I assure you, I\u0027m not at all riled. Although you have, on several occasions already, been rude and difficult and annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere I come from, Mr. Redman, a woman is entitled to a bit more charm and gallantry from a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That so?\" Her mouth dropped open when he slowly drew out his gun. \"Don\u0027t move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMove? She couldn\u0027t even breathe. She\u0027d only called him rude and, sweet Mary, he was going to shoot her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Redman, I don\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bullet exploded against the rock a few inches away from her. With a shriek, she tumbled into the dirt. When she found the courage to look up, Jake was standing and lifting something dead and hideous from the rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rattler,\" he said easily. When she moaned and started to cover her eyes, he reached down and hauled her to her feet \"I\u0027d take a good look,\" he suggested, still holding the snake in front of her. \"If you stay around here, you\u0027re going to see plenty more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the disdain in his voice that had her fighting off the swoon. With what little voice she had left, she asked, \"Would you kindly dispose of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a muttered curse, he tossed it aside, then began to smother the fire. Sarah felt her breakfast rising uneasily and waited for it to settle. \"It appears you saved my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, don\u0027t let it get around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t, I assure you.\" She drew herself up straight, hiding her trembling hands in the folds of her skirts. \"I appreciate the meal, Mr. Redman. Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me, I have a number of things to do.\" \"You can start by getting yourself into the wagon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll drive you back to town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate the offer. As a matter of fact, I would be grateful. I need some supplies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, there\u0027s got to be enough sense in that head of yours for you to see you don\u0027t belong out here. It\u0027s a two-hour drive into town. There\u0027s nothing out here but rattlers and coyotes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was afraid he was right. The night she\u0027d spent in the cabin had been the loneliest and most miserable of her life. But somewhere between the rabbit and the snake she\u0027d made up her mind. Matt Conway\u0027s daughter wasn\u0027t going to let all his efforts and his dreams turn to dust. She was staying, Lord help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father lived here. This place was obviously important to him. I intend to stay.\" She doubted Jake Redman had enough heart to understand her \"Now, if you\u0027d be good enough to hitch up the wagon, I\u0027ll go change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Change what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, my dress, of course. I can hardly go into town like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cast a glance over her. She already looked dolled-up enough for a church social in her crisp white blouse and gingham skirt. He\u0027d never known gingham to look quite so good on a woman before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lone Bluff ain\u0027t Philadelphia. It ain\u0027t anyplace. You want the wagon hitched, I\u0027ll oblige you, but you\u0027d better watch how it\u0027s done, because there\u0027s not going to be anyone around to do it for you next time.\" With that, he slung his saddlebags over his shoulder and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery well, she thought after one last deep breath. He was quite right. It was time she learned how to do things for herself. The sooner she learned, the sooner she\u0027d have no more need of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her head held high, she followed him. She watched him guide the team out. It seemed easy enough. You simply hooked this and tied that and the deed was done. Men, she thought with a little smile. They always exaggerated the most basic chores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mr. Redman. If you\u0027ll wait just a moment, I\u0027ll be ready to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidn\u0027t the woman know anything? Jake tipped his hat forward. He\u0027d driven her out of town yesterday. If he drove her back this morning her reputation would be ruined. Even Lone Bluff had its standards. Since she\u0027d decided to stay, at least temporarily, she\u0027d need all the support she could get from the town women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got business of my own, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\" He was already moving off to saddle his own horse. Setting her teeth, Sarah stamped inside. She added another twenty dollars to what she carried in her reticule. As an afterthought she took down the rifle her father had left on the wall. She hadn\u0027t the least idea how to use it, was certain she wouldn\u0027t be able to in even the most dire circumstances, but she felt better having it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake was mounted and waiting when she came out. \"The road will lead you straight into town,\" he told her as she fastened her bonnet. \"If you give Lucius a dollar he\u0027ll drive back out with you, then take the wagon and team back to the livery. Matt\u0027s got two horses of his own in the stables. Someone from town\u0027s been keeping an eye on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dollar.\" As if it were spun glass, she set the rifle in the wagon. \"You charged me five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at her. \"I\u0027m not Lucius.\" With a tip of his hat, he rode off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t take her long to climb up into the wagon. But she had to gather her courage before she touched the reins. Though she considered herself an excellent horsewoman, she\u0027d never driven a team before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve ridden behind them, she reminded herself as she picked up the reins. How difficult can it be? She took the horses-or they took her-in a circle three times before she managed to head them toward the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake sat on his horse and watched her from a ridge. It was the best laugh he\u0027d had in months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she reached Lone Bluff, Sarah was sweating profusely, her hands felt raw and cramped and her lower back was on fire. In front of the dry goods store she climbed down on legs that felt like water. After smoothing her skirts and patting her forehead dry, she spotted a young boy whittling a stick. \"Young man, do you know a man named Lucius?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody knows old Lucius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatisfied, Sarah drew a coin out of her bag. \"If you can find Lucius and tell him Miss Sarah Conway wishes to see him, you can have this penny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy eyed it, thinking of peppermint sticks. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" He was off at a run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least children seemed about the same, east or west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah entered the store. There were several customers milling around, looking over the stock and gossiping. They all stopped to stare at Sarah before going back to their business. The young woman behind the counter came around to greet her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning. May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m Sarah Conway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" When the pretty brunette smiled, dimples flashed in her cheeks. She was already envying Sarah her bonnet. \"You arrived on the stage yesterday. I\u0027m very sorry about your father. Everyone liked Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Sarah found herself smiling back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to need a number of supplies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really going to stay out there, at Matt\u0027s place? Alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. At least for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be scared to death.\" The brunette gave her an appraising look, then offered a hand. \"I\u0027m Liza Cody. No relation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Buffalo Bill. Most people ask. Welcome to Lone Bluff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Liza\u0027s help. Sarah began to gather supplies and introductions. Within twenty minutes she\u0027d nodded to half the women in Lone Bluff, been given a recipe for biscuits and been asked her opinion of the calico fabric just arrived from St. Joe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer spirits rose dramatically. Perhaps the women dressed less fashionably than then-counterparts in the East, but they made her feel welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah turned to see Lucius, hat in hand. Beside him, the young boy was nearly dancing in anticipation of the penny. The moment it was in his hand, he raced to the jars of hard candy and began to negotiate. \"Mr...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just Lucius, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucius, I was told you might be willing to drive my supplies back for me, then return the wagon and team to the livery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed his chaw into his cheek and considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now, maybe I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be willing to give you a dollar for your trouble.\" He grinned, showing a few yellowed-and several missing-teeth. \"Glad to help, Miss Conway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you\u0027d begin by loading my supplies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving him to it, Sarah turned back to Liza. \"Miss Cody.\" \"Liza, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liza, I wonder if you might have any tea, and I would dearly love some fresh eggs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get much call for tea, but we\u0027ve got some in the back.\" Liza opened the door to the rear storeroom. Three fat-bellied puppies ran out. \"John Cody, you little monster. I told you to keep these pups outside.\" Laughing, Sarah crouched down to greet them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they\u0027re adorable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One\u0027s adorable, maybe,\" Liza muttered. As usual, her young brother was nowhere in sight when she needed him. \"Three\u0027s unmanageable. Just last night they chewed through a sack of meal. Pop finds out, he\u0027ll take a strap to Johnny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brown mutt with a black circle around his left eye jumped into Sarah\u0027s lap. And captured her heart. \"You\u0027re a charmer, aren\u0027t you?\" She laughed as he bathed her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nuisance is more like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you sell one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sell?\" Liza stretched to reach the tea on a high shelf. \"My pop\u0027d pay you to take one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" With the brown pup cradled in her arms, Sarah stood again. \"I\u0027d love to have one. I could use the company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiza added the tea and eggs to Sarah\u0027s total. \"You want that one, you take it right along.\" She grinned when the pup licked Sarah\u0027s face again. \"He certainly seems taken with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take very good care of him.\" Balancing the dog, she took out the money to pay her bill. \"Thank you for everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiza counted out the coins before she placed them in the cash drawer and took out Sarah\u0027s change. Pop would be pleased, she thought. Not only because of the pup, but because Miss Conway was a cash customer. Liza was pleased because Sarah was young and pretty and would surely know everything there was to know about the latest fashions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been nice meeting you, Miss Conway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiza smiled again and walked with Sarah to the door. \"Maybe I\u0027ll ride out and see you, if you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love it. Any time at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly Liza lifted a hand to pat her hair. \"Good morning, Mr. Carlson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liza, you\u0027re looking pretty as ever.\" She blushed and fluttered, though Carlson\u0027s eyes were on Sarah. \"Samuel Carlson, this is Sarah Conway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delighted.\" Carlson\u0027s smile made his pale, handsome face even more attractive. It deepened the already-brilliant blue of his eyes. When he lifted Sarah\u0027s hand to his lips in a smooth, cavalier gesture, she was doubly glad she\u0027d come into town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently Lone Bluff had some gentlemen after all. Samuel Carlson was slim and well dressed in a beautiful black riding coat and a spotless white shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis trim mustache was the same rich brown as his well-groomed hair. He had, as a gentleman swept off his hat at the introduction. It was a truly fine hat, Sarah thought, black like his coat, with a silver chain for a band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My deepest sympathies for your loss, Miss Conway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour father was a fine man and a good friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. It\u0027s been comforting for me to learn he was well thought of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe daughter was certainly a pretty addition to a dust hole like Lone Bluff, he thought. \"Word around town is that you\u0027ll be staying with us for a while.\" He reached over to scratch the puppy\u0027s ears and was rewarded with a low growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush, now.\" Sarah smiled an apology. \"Yes, I\u0027ve decided to stay. At least for the time being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you\u0027ll let me know if there\u0027s anything I can do to help.\" He smiled again. \"Undoubtedly life here isn\u0027t what you\u0027re used to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he said it made it clear that it was a compliment. Mr. Carlson was obviously a man of the world, and of some means. \"Thank you.\" She handed the puppy to Lucius and was gratified when Carlson assisted her into the wagon. \"It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Carlson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pleasure was mine, Miss Conway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodbye, Liza. I hope you\u0027ll come and visit soon.\" Sarah settled the puppy on her lap. She considered it just her bad luck that she glanced across the street at that moment. Jake was there, one hand hooked in his pocket, leaning against a post, watching. With an icy nod, she acknowledged him, then stared straight ahead as Lucius clucked to the horses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the wagon pulled away, the men studied each other. There was no nod of acknowledgment. They simply watched, cool and cautious, across the dusty road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah felt positively triumphant. As she stored her supplies, the puppy circled her legs, apparently every bit as pleased as she with the arrangement. Her nights wouldn\u0027t be nearly so lonely now, with the dog for company. She\u0027d met people, was perhaps even on the way to making friends. Her cupboard was full, and Lucius had been kind enough to show her how to fire up the old cookstove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, after supper, she was going to write to Lucilla and Mother Superior. She would read another page or two from her father\u0027s journal before she curled up under the freshly aired blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake Redman be damned, she thought as she bent to tickle the pup\u0027s belly. She was making it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a glass of whiskey at his fingertips, Jake watched Carlotta work the room. She sure was something. Her hair was the color of gold nuggets plucked from a riverbed, and her lips were as red as the velvet drapes that hung in her private room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing red tonight, something tight that glittered as it covered her long, curvy body and clung to her smooth white breasts. Her shoulders were bare. Jake had always thought that a woman\u0027s shoulders were enough to drive a man to distraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of Sarah, standing ankle-deep in a stream with water glistening on her skin. He took another gulp of whiskey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlotta\u0027s girls were dressed to kill, as well. The men in the Silver Star were getting their money\u0027s worth. The piano rang out, and the whiskey and the laughter poured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he figured it, Carlotta ran one of the best houses in Arizona. Maybe one of the best west of the Mississippi. The whiskey wasn\u0027t watered much, and the girls weren\u0027t bad. A man could almost believe they enjoyed their work. As for Carlotta, Jake figured she enjoyed it just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoney came first with her. He knew, because she\u0027d once had enough to drink to tell him that she took a healthy cut of all her girls\u0027 pay. If the man one of her girls was with decided to slip her a little extra, that was just fine with Carlotta. She took a cut of that, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had dreams of moving her business to San Francisco and buying a place with crystal chandeliers, gilt mirrors and red carpets. Carlotta favored red. But for now, like the rest of them, Carlotta was stuck in Lone Bluff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTipping back more whiskey, Jake watched her. She moved like a queen, her full red lips always smiling, her cool blue eyes always watching. She was making sure her girls were persuading the men to buy them plenty of drinks. What the bartender served the working girls was hardly more than colored water, but the men paid, and paid happily, before they moved along to one of the narrow rooms upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell of a business, Jake thought as he helped himself to one of the cigars Carlotta provided for her paying customers. She had them shipped all the way from Cuba, and they had a fine, rich taste. Jake had no doubt she added to the price of her whiskey and her girls to pay for them. Business was business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the girls sidled over to light the cigar for him. He just shook his head at the invitation. She was warm and ripe and smelled like a bouquet of roses. For the life of him he couldn\u0027t figure out why he wasn\u0027t interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to hurt the girls\u0027 feelings.\" Perfume trailing behind her, Carlotta joined Jake at the table. \"Don\u0027t you see anything you like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tipped his chair back against the wall. \"See plenty I like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and lifted a hand in a subtle signal. \"You going to buy me a drink, Jake?\" Before he could answer, one of the girls was bringing over a new bottle and a glass. No watered-down liquor for Carlotta. \"Haven\u0027t seen you around in a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t been around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlotta took a drink and let it sweep through her system. She\u0027d take liquor over a man any day. \"Going to stay around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heard there was a little trouble on the stage yesterday. It\u0027s not like you to do good deeds, Jake.\" She drank again and smiled at him. In a movement as smooth as the liquor she drank, she dropped a hand to his thigh. \"That\u0027s what I like about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just happened to be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also heard Matt Conway\u0027s daughter\u0027s in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, she took the cigar from him and took a puff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You working for her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Word around is that you drove her on out to his place.\" She slowly blew out a stream of smoke from between her painted lips. \"Can\u0027t see you digging in rock for gold, Jake, when it\u0027s easier just to take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Far as I remember, there was never enough gold in that rock to dig for.\" He took the cigar back and clamped it between his teeth. \"You know different?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only know what I hear, and I don\u0027t hear much about Conway.\" She poured a second drink and downed it. She didn\u0027t want to talk about Matt Conway\u0027s mine or about what she knew. Something in the air tonight, she decided. Made her restless. Maybe she needed more than whiskey after all. \"Glad you\u0027re back, Jake. Things have been too quiet around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo men hankering after the same girl started to scuffle. Carlotta\u0027s tall black servant tossed them both out. She just smiled and poured a third drink. \"If you\u0027re not interested in any of my girls, we could make other arrangements.\" She lifted the small glass in a salute before she knocked it back. \"For old times\u0027 sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake looked at her. Her eyes glittered against her white skin. Her lips were parted. Above the flaming red of her dress, her breasts rose and fell invitingly. He knew what she could do to a man, with a man, when the mood was on her. It baffled and infuriated him that she didn\u0027t stir him in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe some other time.\" He rose and, after dropping a few coins on the table, strolled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlotta\u0027s eyes hardened as she watched him. She only offered herself to a privileged few. And she didn\u0027t like to be rejected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the puppy snoozing at her feet, Sarah closed her father\u0027s journal. He\u0027d written about an Indian attack on the wagon train and his own narrow escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn simple, often stark terms, he\u0027d written of the slaughter, the terror and the waste. Yet even after that he\u0027d gone on, because he\u0027d wanted to make something of himself. For her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShivering a bit despite her shawl, she rose to replace the book beneath the stone. If she had read those words while still in Philadelphia, she would have thought them an exaggeration. She was coming to know better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a half sigh, she looked down at her hands. They were smooth and well tended. They were, she was afraid, woefully inadequate to the task of carving out a life here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only the night that made her feel that way, Sarah told herself as she moved to check the bolt on the door. She\u0027d done all she could that day, and it had been enough. She\u0027d driven to town alone, stocked the cabin and replanted the vegetable garden. Her back ached enough to tell her she\u0027d put in a full day. Tomorrow she\u0027d start again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lonely howl of a coyote made her heart thud. Gathering the puppy to her breast, she climbed up for bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in her night shift when the dog started to bark and growl. Exasperated, she managed to grab him before he could leap from the loft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll break your neck.\" When he strained against her hold and continued to yelp, she took him in her arms. \"All right, all right. If you have to go out, I\u0027ll let you out, but you might have let me know before I went to bed.\" Nuzzling him, she climbed down from the loft again. She saw the fire through the window and ran to the door. \"Oh, my God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment she yanked it open the puppy ran out, barking furiously. With her hands to her cheeks, Sarah watched the fire rise up and eat at the old, dry wood of the shed. A scream, eerily like a woman\u0027s, pierced the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father\u0027s horses. Following instinct alone, she ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horses were already wild-eyed, stamping and screaming in their stalls. Muttering a prayer, Sarah dragged the first one out and slapped its flank. The fire was moving fast, racing up the walls and onto the roof. The hay had already caught and was burning wildly. Eyes stinging from the smoke, she groped her way to the second stall. Coughing, swearing, she fought the terrified horse as it reared and shoved against her. Then she screamed herself when a flaming plank fell behind her. Fire licked closer and closer to the hem of her shift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhipping off her shawl, she tossed it over the horse\u0027s eyes and dragged them both out of the shed. Blinded by smoke, she crawled to safety. Behind her she could hear the walls collapse, could hear the roar of flames consuming wood. Gone. It was gone. She wanted to beat her fists in the dirt and weep. It could spread. The terror of that had her pushing up onto her hands and knees. Somehow she had to prevent the fire from spreading. She caught the sound of a horse running hard and had nearly gained her feet when something slammed into her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lawless/page-3.html","bookId":2686,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:09 AM"}
