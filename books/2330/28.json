Now, two nights later, the saloon was almost empty, with three old men sitting in silence at the bar and two others sharing a table. Burke, behind the bar, told me out of the side of his thin-lipped mouth that the big fellow wasn\u0027t expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed long enough to drink a Coke and watch a little of the game on ESPN, the Brewers playing the White Sox, with a lot of players on both teams hitting the ball into the seats. But I wasn\u0027t paying any real attention, and when my glass was empty I went home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWally Donn called first thing in the morning. \"I could use you a couple or three days this week,\" he said. \"You up for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in the middle of something,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keeping you busy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t, not really. There wasn\u0027t much I could do until we had our big meeting at Gruliow\u0027s Tuesday afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Suppose I call you Wednesday morning? Or late tomorrow afternoon, if I get the chance. By then I\u0027ll have a better idea of how I stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really need you today,\" he said. \"You call me Wednesday, I might not have anything for you. But call and we\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have gone in that day, for all the work I wound up doing. I made my usual call to Forest Hills and was not all that surprised when nobody answered. I had already decided that Mrs. Watson was out of town, and was beginning to wonder what I could possibly ask her if she ever turned up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime after lunch I went over to Elaine\u0027s shop, intending to spell her, but she wasn\u0027t there; TJ, cool and professional in his preppy outfit, was minding the shop for her. I sat around talking with him for half an hour, during which time he sold a pair of bronze bookends to a stoop-shouldered man in a Grateful Dead T-shirt. The man offered thirty dollars, then forty, then said he\u0027d pay the full fifty-dollar sticker price if TJ would forgo the sales tax. TJ stood firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re tough,\" the man said, admiringly. \"Well, I\u0027m probably paying too much, but so what? Ten years from now when I look at them on the shelf, will I even remember what I paid?\" He handed over a credit card, and TJ wrote up the sale and did what you have to do with the card as if he\u0027d been doing this sort of thing for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re really nice,\" he said at last, handing over the wrapped bookends. \"All said, I think you got yourself a bargain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so, too,\" the man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver dinner I gave Elaine a play-by-play description of the transaction. \" \u0027All said, I think you got yourself a bargain.\u0027 Where do you suppose he learned to talk like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No idea,\" she said. \"How come he got full price? I told him he can cut any price ten percent to make a sale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he knew the customer would pay the full fifty if he just held firm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plus the tax?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plus the tax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess shilling for the three-card monte dealers teaches you something. I guess if you can buy and sell on Forty-second Street you can buy and sell anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evidently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it still amazes me when he turns the language on and off. Is it possible he\u0027s actually a middle-class kid and all the street jive\u0027s an act?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I figured. But you never know, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes you know,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim Shorter hadn\u0027t called. I tried him after dinner and got no answer. I went over to St. Paul\u0027s. The woman who spoke had very strong opinions on everything. I left on the break and went over to my hotel room and sat there looking out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d taken off Call Forwarding as soon as I came in. I was trying to make this automatic, and to put it on again automatically when I left. I picked up a book and read for a while, then put it down and looked out the window some more. And the phone rang, and it was Shorter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" he said. \"How\u0027s it going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just fine,\" I said. \"How about yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I didn\u0027t drink yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I was at a meeting,\" he said, and told me where he\u0027d gone and more of the speaker\u0027s story than I needed to know. We talked AA for a few minutes, and then he said, \"And what about your investigation? How\u0027s that going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s sort of stalled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow\u0027s the big day, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The big day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, when you get together with everybody and find out where you go from here. Do you suppose the killer\u0027ll be there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a thought. I don\u0027t know for sure that there is a killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Matt, I discovered Watson\u0027s body, remember? Somebody sure as hell killed him. I mean, he didn\u0027t do that to himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A single killer,\" I said. \"As I said, I don\u0027t know for sure that there is one, and if there is I have no reason to believe he\u0027s a member of the group.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else would it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what I think- but where do I get off having an opinion? Forget it, you don\u0027t want to hear this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I do, Jim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure? Well, I bet it\u0027s one of the members. Some guy whose life looks picture-perfect on the surface, but underneath it\u0027s a mess. You know what I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are all of them coming tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most of them. A few can\u0027t make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you were the killer,\" he said, \"and if somebody called a meeting like this, would you go? Or would you say you couldn\u0027t make it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d go. How could you stay away? You\u0027d want to hear what they were saying, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better get a good night\u0027s sleep,\" he said. \"Tomorrow you\u0027re going to be in the room with the killer. Do you think you\u0027ll be able to sense anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"You were a cop a long time. You\u0027ve got the instincts. That might keep him away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My instincts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing that you\u0027re going to be there. Unless, you know, he wants to be face-to-face with his adversary. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ve been watching too much TV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"You know what? I think you\u0027re right. Where\u0027s this going to happen tomorrow? Somebody\u0027s office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really can\u0027t say, Jim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s in Manhattan, right? Sorry, I\u0027m sticking my nose in, and I don\u0027t mean to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s in the Village, but I don\u0027t want to say any more than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not important. Speaking of the Village, I was thinking I might go to that midnight meeting on Houston Street. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027re up for that tonight, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you got a busy day tomorrow. I don\u0027t know if I want a late night myself. One o\u0027clock by the time the meeting lets out, and then I\u0027ve got to get all the way uptown. And it might rain. It\u0027s threatening. You know what? I think I\u0027ll stay home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t blame you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"It\u0027s good talking to you, Matt. Believe me, it helps. Before I called you I was thinking, why the hell can\u0027t I have one glass of beer? I mean, who would even feel the effects of one glass of beer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" he said. \"I\u0027m not gonna have it. I don\u0027t even want it now. Have a good day tomorrow, huh? And give me a call afterward if you get a chance, will you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must have been waiting for his call. Once I\u0027d finished talking to him, I put on Call Forwarding and went home. Ray Gruliow had called in my absence. I called him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Three-thirty tomorrow. That work for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told the others three o\u0027clock. That\u0027ll give us a chance to bring everybody up to speed before you join us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be eight of them, he said, nine if Bill Ludgate could clear his calendar. And it would be strange seeing them again so soon, not quite two months after the last dinner. Strange to see them away from the usual venue, in a private living room instead of a restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Incidentally,\" he said, \"I enjoyed our conversation the other night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So did I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to do it again sometime,\" he said. \"After this nonsense is all taken care of. Deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deal,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up and poured myself a cup of coffee. I went and watched television with Elaine, but I couldn\u0027t keep my mind on the program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDepending on Bill Ludgate\u0027s ability to cancel his appointments, we\u0027d have eight or nine members at Gruliow\u0027s house, five or six absentees. Would the killer be present or absent? Would curiosity draw him? Would fear keep him away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was his house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidiculous to think it could be Gruliow. Hard-Way Ray as diabolical murderer? God knows he was bright enough to work out the details, and resolute enough to carry it out. And there were people who would say he was ruthless enough, and even crazy enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t see it. But I couldn\u0027t see it for any of them, and nobody else had a motive. Forget motive- no one else even knew the club existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould I rule out anyone? Hildebrand, I thought. The one thing the killer wouldn\u0027t do was bring in a private detective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it was crazy, but why expect sane behavior from someone who was systematically wiping out his lifelong friends? Maybe bringing in a detective would add a little excitement to the game. Maybe it was getting dull, knocking off somebody every year or so. Maybe it was infuriating the way the rest of them refused to realize what was going on. So maybe Lew Hildebrand had decided to even the odds a little by bringing in a detective. But, because he didn\u0027t want to make things too hard for himself, he\u0027d had the good sense to hire a detective who wasn\u0027t all that bright…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet a good night\u0027s sleep, Jim Shorter had urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFat chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey assembled, nine of fourteen of thirty-one, at three o\u0027clock on the last Tuesday in June, a hot and hazy day with the burnt reek of ozone soiling the dense air. No one was anxiously early or fashionably late. The first to arrive were Gerard Billings and Kendall McGarry, who came in separate taxis that discharged their passengers simultaneously. The two men rang Gruliow\u0027s bell at five minutes before the hour. They had no sooner taken seats than the bell rang again. When Bob Berk arrived at 3:02, apologizing for being late, he was the ninth man. It was five minutes after three when Ray Gruliow got to his feet to open the meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had done this once before. With Frank DiGiulio\u0027s death the previous September, he had become the club\u0027s senior member, and had accordingly presided at the annual meeting in May. This was only the second time the gavel had passed in thirty-two years- from Homer Champney to Frank DiGiulio, and now to Gruliow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he had not done before, what no one had done, was open a meeting at other than the traditional time and place. He had given some thought to the form this meeting ought to take, and had consulted several of the others on the matter. His conclusion was that it ought to vary as little as possible from the usual form, and he began accordingly by intoning the names of deceased members in the order of their passing, beginning with Philip Michael Kalish and James Severance and Homer Gray Champney, concluding in due course with Francis DiGiulio and Alan Walter Watson. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-28.html","bookId":2330,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:24 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:24 AM"}
