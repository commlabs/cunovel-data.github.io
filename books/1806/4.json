Send word to Marie Raffin’s residence if you need me,” Cinderella said, snatching up a basket and frayed cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Mademoiselle,” Vitore said, bobbing another curtsey as the activity resumed in the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella left the market and its produce and goods behind for the big buyers and sellers—the government-approved merchants. Instead of setting up their goods in open air markets and stands, the merchants owned brick and mortar shops. A few were forced out of business after Erlauf’s takeover, and a few more left when faced with Erlauf’s strict taxes, but many of the merchant families were still around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella stopped outside a shop that had a sign emblazoned with a bear walking across a fallen tree trunk. A bell rang when Cinderella entered the store, getting the attention of the shopkeeper. “She is out back, Mademoiselle,” the shopkeeper said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” Cinderella said, ducking into a back room. She skirted through a hall stuffed with shipping crates and goods and darted past a tiny office crowded with papers and books. “Marie?” Cinderella said, poking her head outside the back end of the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small patch of grass where two horses were hitched. A young lady dressed in a comfortable but expensive dress stood in front of the horses, hand-feeding them green tendrils. “Cinderella! What in the name of Trieux have you done to your hair?” the woman said, dropping the grass to embrace Cinderella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I chopped it off. A wigmaker gave me a good price for it,” Cinderella said, brushing the slanted fringe of her bangs out of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It looks dreadful,” Marie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella rolled her eyes. “I am ever so glad I can count on you to hearten me, Marie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, but it’s just…it’s so short,” Marie said, tilting Cinderella’s head to get a better look at it. “Did you really have to chop it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see. Well, the color is still pretty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. As much as I loathe Erlauf fashion trends, I am beginning to think I should follow their example and cover my head with a scarf or some such thing,” Cinderella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why? You look pitiable to be certain, but you are by no means the only girl who has sold her hair in the past few months,” Marie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but just before I left the market, a flock of Erlauf soldiers gawked at me,” Cinderella said, running her hand through her short locks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie clicked her tongue. “Ruffians,” she said. “A gentleman would behave better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is business?” Cinderella asked, leaning against the hitching post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well enough, I think. Armel has managed to come home at a decent hour these past few days, and he hasn’t mentioned moving to Loire for the past month,” Marie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad to hear that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And how does your Aveyron fair?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella shrugged. “We scrape by. All the farming changes have made it more profitable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what drove you to beggar your hair?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Taxes, again,” Cinderella said, offering her palm to one of the horses. “With their cost, I can barely afford to pay Aveyron’s upkeep. I swear each month the tax burden grows heavier and heavier. If they don’t increase the tax on every servant per household, Queen Freja places a tax on every acre of farmable land or imposes a tax on glass windows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you won’t let any of your servants go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella shook her head. “No,” she said, her determination weighing the word down like steel and iron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie sighed and dusted off her hands. “You have a hero complex, my darling Cinderella. Life would be so much easier for you if you were even a little bit selfish, like me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You cannot fool me,” Cinderella said. “I recognize your shopkeeper. She was your nurse until you turned thirteen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie sniffed. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. With business improving, Armel hired more help, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” Cinderella said. She slid her hand down the horse’s glossy neck before stepping back. “I need to get going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not going to stay for tea?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella held up her basket. “I have work. I only stopped by to say hello and to check on my sign. Have there been any inquires?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A few. I left the names with my nurse; ask her for the list on your way out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cannot thank you enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is the least I can do for you. It was good to see you, and your lack-luster haircut.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take care, Marie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cinderella?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella stopped at the doorframe and turned to face her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I, I would help you more, if I could.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella smiled. “I know. Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie mutely nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will drop by again later this week. Until then,” Cinderella called as she disappeared inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day, the Erlauf army officer showed up again at the chateau’s market stall shortly after Cinderella and Vitore finished unpacking the day’s produce. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cinderella-and-the-colonel-timeless-fairy-tales-3/page-4.html","bookId":1806,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:18 PM"}
