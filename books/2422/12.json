Alex lets me keep it the way I like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mixed tequila and lime juice and triple sec over ice in a carafe, stirred it and poured. “Margarita of the gods. No salt. Cuervo white. Mexican triple sec. My brother disagrees with me about every ingredient. Thinks I’m a damn cretin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sound proud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of pissing off my brother? Hell, yes. Salud!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warmth of the alcohol knit into Lane’s limbs. She sat in a wicker chair, facing Garrett. She listened to the Caribbean music and the rain outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Earlier you were talking like you admire your brother,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett sipped his drink. A droplet of margarita gleamed in his beard. “Sure, I admire him. I still like to irritate him. You got siblings?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLane shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you wouldn’t understand, but that’s cool. I want you to take a vacation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Garrett—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up a finger. “No problems. No hang-ups. Imagine those windows are open. You’re looking out at clear blue sky and a calm sea. Listen to the music. Drink your drink and relax.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLane tried. She liked the feeling of Garrett sitting near her, confident and calm. Then she remembered the night in the woods, her right eye swollen shut where Bobby had hit her. Her whole body ached. They dragged their burden into the woods wrapped in stained blue sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re crying,” Garrett said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett’s eyebrows furrowed. “What did that bastard husband do to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could answer, she heard voices in the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—can’t believe you did that,” Markie was complaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t have a choice,” Chase protested. “I’m telling you, Navarre forced me. He’s a damn—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” Markie hissed as they passed the room, probably noticing that the door was open. The sound of their footsteps faded down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett drained his margarita. “My brother must be back. I’d better check on him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” Suddenly Lane didn’t want to leave the room. She didn’t want to go out there and face the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tres is always where the trouble is,” Garrett said. “And I want to find out what’s happening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put down his glass and held out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTentatively, she took it. He gave her fingers a squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll continue the vacation later,” he promised. “For now, let’s go see what crap my little brother has gotten himself into.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was standing at Chris Stowall’s dresser, going through his underwear drawer, when Garrett and Lane Sanford came in. I was about halfway through searching. So far I’d come up with nothing except underwear, and I was kind of wishing I’d worn latex gloves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I told Garrett what had happened at the boathouse, he arched his eyebrows. “You did what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I scuttled the boat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold up, hold up.” Garrett looked at Lane for moral support, then back at me. “You sank Alex’s fishing boat. Forty thousand dollars’ worth of fishing boat. And you just—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Opened the bilge valve and sank it,” I agreed. “Now, are you going to help me search or not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett shoved the underwear drawer closed so fast I almost lost my fingers. “ARE YOU NUTS?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI counted to ten, trying to contain the impulse to tip him out of his wheelchair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise, Lane interceded. “Garrett, Tres is right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett scowled at her. “Say what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hand on his shoulder. “We can’t let the killer off the island. He’ll hurt more people. Right now he’s trapped here. We have to keep it that way until we can contact the police.” She glanced up at me. “That is why you did it…yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I said. I decided it was time to revise my estimation of Lane Sanford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever, little bro,” Garrett grumbled. “You’re gonna be in deep crap with Alex.” He nodded grudgingly toward the dresser. “What the hell are you looking for, anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” I admitted. “Something to explain the cash in the duffel bag.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What cash?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him about the twenty grand, which was now locked in the hotel’s office, thanks to Jose and Imelda. I couldn’t tell whether the news surprised Lane or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn,” Garrett said. “Find one more bag like that, and you can pay Alex back for his boat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to ignore him. Being his brother, I’d had lots of practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lane,” I said, “is there anything you can tell me about Chris? Anything that would help?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve known Chris since high school. He’s a good person. He’s not a killer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twisted the silver ring on her finger. “It isn’t like him to disappear like this. He wouldn’t do that. Something is wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He invited you here for the weekend, to get away from—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Her tone was clear: now was not the time to bring up her ex-husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chris didn’t mention Marshal Longoria?” I asked. “Didn’t make any comment to you about why he was here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, but she was holding back. I could feel it as clearly as the storm outside. I glanced at Garrett, hoping he would help me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand protectively. “Come on, Lane. It’s getting late. And, little bro, if you find anything else valuable—like more money or the keys to a Porsche or something—you might want to give me dibs on it before you destroy it, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned Chris’s room inside out. I didn’t learn much. His stuff smelled of salt water and suntan lotion. He wore size 32 jeans. He liked extra-large cotton T-shirts. He had a picture of Waikiki Beach taped on his dresser mirror. There was a surfboard behind his closet door. Next to his bed was a guitar case—nothing inside but a Yamaha acoustic and the lyrics to an old Nirvana song on a piece of crumpled notebook paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo weapons. No duffel bags full of money. I found no evidence that he’d been packing. The closet was full of clothes. His toiletries were all there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all, it seemed to be the room of a fairly simple guy who liked to surf and had taken a job that allowed him the time to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo simple. Almost always, there was something interesting to be found in anyone’s personal space…I called it the jalapeño factor. You had to have that little slice of spice on the nacho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on Chris’s bed and pondered that. Outside, the storm intensified. Wind battered the walls. The plywood on the window bowed in and out with a hollow popping noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I checked the bed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt down and I slipped my hand between the mattress and the box springs. My fingers brushed against a book, and I brought out Chris Stowall’s diary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about midway through reading it—far enough to realize I had trouble on my hands—when the college guys burst into the bedroom, Ty followed by Chase and Markie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good news was that Ty had found his gun. The bad news was he was pointing it at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bastard,” he said. “You wrecked the boat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ty, put the gun down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that his friends had caught up with him, they didn’t seem to know what to do. They had their hands out, crouching like they were about to catch a ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude,” Chase said, “I tried to explain—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up!” Ty said. “You helped him. You told me I could leave in fifteen minutes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ty, listen to the storm,” I said. “You couldn’t have gone anywhere. The wind’s already too strong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t try to stand. I didn’t look at the gun. I kept my eyes on Ty’s, because I knew that was the best way to keep him from firing at me. Not a great way, mind you, but the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sank the boat.” Ty’s voice trembled. “You trapped me in this place with…with a goddamn killer. I’m gonna—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when Markie hit him on the back of the head. Ty crumpled and Chase tried to catch him without much luck. Ty landed facedown on the carpet between the dresser and the bed. Markie pounced on the pistol. I checked Ty’s head. He’d been hit in just the right spot to knock him out—directly behind the ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at Markie. “Sap your friends often?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his fist and showed it to me. “Sorry, dude. No choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You always carry a roll of quarters?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty much,” he said. “You never know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTy moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Find him a place to lie down,” I told them. “Not in here. And get him some ice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guess I messed up,” Chase murmured, “telling him about the boat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkie snorted. “You guys are whacked, wrecking the only way off the island.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The killer may have been planning to use the boat,” I said. “I don’t want him to have options.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkie studied me. “Dude, you ever hear about cornering wild animals?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the guys had dragged Ty away, I finished reading Chris Stowall’s journal. He wasn’t a prolific diarist. The entries were sometimes six months apart. Then he would write daily for a week. Then he’d lose interest again. He wrote about wave conditions. He made plans to move to Hawaii, where he’d apparently been once before on spring break. He had dreams of taking some girl named Amy there. They’d start a surf shop. At the bottom of the entry, he wrote: I wish it was Lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made some vague references to a brother, whom he affectionately called “the psycho.” He drew pictures of seagulls and guitars. He wrote lines that might’ve been song lyrics. They were pretty bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also talked a lot about Alex Huff, and how much they hated each other. According to Chris, Alex went on drinking binges about once a month. If there were guests on the island, Chris would have to scramble to keep Alex out of sight. Sometimes Alex left the island for days at a time and wouldn’t tell anyone where he was going. When he was drunk, he’d get paranoid. He’d accuse Chris of snooping around his room, embezzling the hotel’s money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d quit, Chris wrote, except I owe the bastard. I’m scared what he might do if I left. Maybe one more time, and I’ll have enough to get out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read that last line several times. I didn’t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final entry seemed to contradict the earlier one. It was dated last April. It read: He wants to sell the hotel. He thinks he can just walk away. He can’t do this to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of the diary, stuck between two pages, was a folded printout of an email. The date was May 5, exactly one month ago. The sender was a U.S. Marshal named Berry. I knew him vaguely. He was a higher-up in the West Texas District, based in San Antonio. Roughly speaking, he was Jesse Longoria’s boss. The only time I’d met Berry, we’d discussed a deal to get a client of mine into the witness protection program. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rebel-island-tres-navarre-7/page-12.html","bookId":2422,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:57 PM"}
