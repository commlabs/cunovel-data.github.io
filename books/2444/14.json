You can\u0027t know how she\u0027ll act or what... she\u0027ll do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care,\" I said stubbornly. \"The vampaneze aren\u0027t toying with us any longer. They know we know about them. They went to kill Debbie. When they couldn\u0027t find her, they slaughtered the people living next door. The stakes have risen. We\u0027re in deep now. Debbie has to be told how serious this is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if she betrays us to the police?\" Steve asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a risk we have to take,\" I sniffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A risk you have to take,\" Steve said pointedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we were in this together,\" I sighed. \"If I was wrong, leave. I won\u0027t stop you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve fidgeted in his chair and traced the cross on his bare left palm with the gloved fingers of his right hand. He did that often, like Mr. Crepsley stroking his scar when he was thinking. \"There\u0027s no need to snap,\" Steve said sullenly. \"I\u0027m with you to the end, like I vowed. But you\u0027re making a decision that affects all of us. That isn\u0027t right. We should vote on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"No votes. I can\u0027t sacrifice Debbie, any more than you could let Hooky kill me in the alley. I know I\u0027m putting Debbie before our mission, but I can\u0027t help that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel that strongly about her?\" Steve asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I won\u0027t argue any more. Tell her the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" I looked to Harkat for his approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Little Person dropped his gaze. \"This is wrong. I can\u0027t stop you, so I won\u0027t try, but... I don\u0027t approve. The group should always come before the... individual.\" Pulling his mask - the one he needed to filter out the air, which was poisonous to him - up around his mouth, he turned his back on us and brooded in sullen silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie turned up shortly before seven. She\u0027d showered and changed clothes - the police had fetched some of her personal items from her apartment - but still looked terrible. \"There\u0027s a police officer in the lobby,\" she said as she entered. \"They asked if I wanted a personal guard and I said I did. He thinks I came up here to tutor you. I gave him your name. If you object to that - tough!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to see you too,\" I smiled, holding out my hands to take her coat. She ignored me and walked into the apartment, stopping short when she caught sight of Steve and Harkat (who was facing away from her).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t say we\u0027d have company,\" she said stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have to be here,\" I replied. \"They\u0027re part of what I have to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are they?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Steve Leopard.\" Steve took a quick bow. \"And that\u0027s Harkat Mulds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment I didn\u0027t think Harkat was going to face her. Then he slowly turned around. \"Oh, my lord!\" Debbie gasped, shocked by his grey, scarred, unnatural features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess you don\u0027t get many like... me in school,\" Harkat smiled nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is...\" Debbie licked her lips. \"Is he from that institute you told me about? Where you and Evra Von lived?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no institute. That was a lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyed me coldly. \"What else have you lied about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything, more or less,\" I grinned guiltily. \"But the lies stop here. Tonight I\u0027ll tell you the truth. By the end you\u0027ll either think I\u0027m crazy or wish I\u0027d never told you, but you have to hear me out - your life depends on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it a long story?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the longest you\u0027ll ever hear,\" Steve answered with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027d better take a pew,\" she said. She chose a chair, shrugged off her coat, laid it across her lap, and nodded curtly to let me know I could begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started with the Cirque Du Freak and Madam Octa, and took it from there. I quickly covered my years as Mr. Crepsley\u0027s assistant and my time in Vampire Mountain. I told her about Harkat and the Lord of the Vampaneze. Then I explained why we\u0027d come here, how fake forms had been submitted to Mahler\u0027s, how I\u0027d run into Steve and what role he played in this. I finished with the events of the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s insane,\" Debbie finally said. \"You can\u0027t be serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is,\" Steve chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires... ghosts... vampaneze... It\u0027s ludicrous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" I said softly. \"I can prove it.\" I raised my fingers to show her the scars on my fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scars don\u0027t prove anything,\" she sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked to the window. \"Go to the door and face me,\" I said. Debbie didn\u0027t respond. I could see the doubt in her eyes. \"Go on,\" I said. \"I won\u0027t hurt you.\" Holding her coat in front of her, she went to the door and stood opposite me. \"Keep your eyes open,\" I said. \"Don\u0027t even blink if you can help it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll see - or, rather, you won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was watching carefully, I tensed the muscles in my legs, then dashed forward, drawing up just in front of her. I moved as quickly as I could, quicker than a human eye could follow. To Debbie it must have seemed that I simply disappeared and reappeared before her. Her eyes shot wide and she leant against the door. Turning, I darted back, again faster than she could follow, stopping by the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ta-da!\" Steve said, clapping dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you do that?\" Debbie asked, voice trembling. \"You just... you were there... then you were here... then...\" \"I can move at tremendously fast speeds. I\u0027m strong, too - I could put a fist through any of these walls and not tear the skin on my knuckles. I can leap higher and further than any human. Hold my breath for longer. Live for centuries.\" I shrugged. \"I\u0027m a half-vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it isn\u0027t possible! Vampires don\u0027t...\" Debbie took a few steps towards me, then stopped. She was torn between wanting to disbelieve me and knowing in her heart that I was telling the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can spend all night proving it to you,\" I said. \"And you can spend all night pretending there\u0027s some other logical explanation. The truth\u0027s the truth, Debbie. Accept it or don\u0027t - it\u0027s your call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t... I can\u0027t...\" She studied my eyes for a long, searching moment. Then she nodded and sank back into her chair. \"I believe you,\" she moaned. \"Yesterday I wouldn\u0027t have, but I saw photos of the Andrews and Mr. Hugon after they\u0027d been killed. I don\u0027t think anyone human could have done that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see now why I had to tell you?\" I asked. \"We don\u0027t know why the vampaneze lured us here or why they\u0027re playing with us, but their plan is surely to kill us. The attack on your neighbours was only the start of the bloodshed. They won\u0027t stop with that. You\u0027ll be next if they find you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" she asked weakly. \"If it\u0027s you and this Mr. Crepsley they want, why come after me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. It doesn\u0027t make sense. That\u0027s what\u0027s so frightening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing to stop them?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tracking them by day. Hopefully we\u0027ll find them. If we do, we\u0027ll fight. With luck, we\u0027ll win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to tell the police,\" she insisted. \"And the army. They can-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said firmly. \"The vampaneze are our concern. We\u0027ll deal with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you say that when it\u0027s humans they\u0027re killing?\" She was angry now. \"The police have struggled to find the killers because they don\u0027t know anything about them. If you\u0027d told them what they should be looking for they might have put an end to these creatures months ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t work that way,\" I said. \"It can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can!\" she snapped. \"And it will! I\u0027m going to tell the officer in the lobby about this. We\u0027ll see what-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How will you convince him?\" Steve interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll...\" She drew up short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wouldn\u0027t believe you,\" Steve pressed. \"He\u0027d think you were mad. He\u0027d call a doctor and they\u0027d take you away to-\" he grinned \" - cure you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could take Darren with me,\" she said unconvincingly. He-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"- would smile sweetly and ask the kind policeman why his teacher was acting so strangely,\" Steve chortled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong,\" Debbie said shakily. \"I could convince people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then go ahead,\" Steve smirked. \"You know where the door is. Best of luck. Send us a postcard to let us know how you got on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like you,\" Debbie snarled. \"You\u0027re cocky and arrogant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to like me,\" Steve retorted. \"This isn\u0027t a popularity contest. It\u0027s a matter of life and death. I\u0027ve studied the vampaneze and killed six of them. Darren and Harkat have fought and killed them too. We know what we have to do to put a stop to them. Do you honestly think you have the right to stand there and tell us our business? You hadn\u0027t even heard of the vampaneze until a few hours ago!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie opened her mouth to argue, then closed it. \"You\u0027re right,\" she admitted sullenly. \"You\u0027ve risked your lives for the sake of others, and you know more about this than me. I shouldn\u0027t be lecturing you. I guess it\u0027s the teacher in me.\" She managed a very feeble smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you trust us to deal with it?\" I asked. \"You\u0027ll find a new apartment, maybe move out of the city for a few weeks, until it\u0027s over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I trust you,\" she said, \"but if you think I\u0027m running away, you\u0027re deluding yourself. I\u0027m staying to fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" I frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll help you find and kill the vampaneze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her, astonished by the simple way she\u0027d put it, as though we were in search of a lost puppy. \"Debbie!\" I gasped. \"Haven\u0027t you been listening? These are creatures that can move at super-fast speeds and flick you into the middle of next week with a snap of a finger. What can you - an ordinary human - hope to accomplish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can explore the tunnels with you,\" she said, \"provide an extra pair of legs, eyes, ears. With me we can split into pairs and cover twice the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t keep up.\" I protested. \"We move too fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Through dark tunnels, with the threat of the vampaneze ever present?\" She smiled. \"I doubt it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" I agreed, \"you could probably match us for pace, but not endurance. We go all day, hour after hour, without pause. You\u0027d tire and fall behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steve keeps up,\" she noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steve\u0027s trained himself to track them. Besides,\" I added, \"Steve doesn\u0027t have to report to school every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither do I,\" she said. \"I\u0027m on compassionate leave. They don\u0027t expect me back\u0027 until the start of next week at the earliest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Debbie... you... it\u0027s...\" I sputtered, then turned appealingly to Steve. \"Tell her she\u0027s out of her mind,\" I pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I think it\u0027s a good idea,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could do with another pair of legs down there. If she has the guts for it, I say we give her a go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if we run into the vampaneze?\" I challenged him. \"Do you see Debbie going face to face with Hooky or his pals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, as a matter of fact,\" he smiled. \"From what I\u0027ve seen, she\u0027s got a spine of steel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Debbie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t mention it,\" he laughed, then grew serious. \"I can kit her out with an arrow gun. In a scrape we might be glad of an extra body. At least she\u0027d give the vampaneze another target to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t stand for it,\" I growled. \"Harkat - tell them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Little Persons green eyes were thoughtful. \"Tell them what, Darren?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That it\u0027s madness! Lunacy! Stupidity!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it?\" he asked quietly. \"If Debbie was any other person, would you be so... quick to turn down her offer? The odds are against us. We need allies if we are to triumph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got her into this,\" Harkat interrupted. \"I told you not to. You ignored me. You can\u0027t control people once... you involve them. She knows the danger and she... accepts it. What excuse have you to reject her offer... other than you\u0027re fond of her and... don\u0027t want to see her harmed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePut like that, there was nothing I could say. \"Very well,\" I sighed. \"I don\u0027t like this, but if you want to pitch in, I guess we have to let you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s so gallant, isn\u0027t he?\" Steve observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He certainly knows how to make a girl feel welcome,\" Debbie grinned, then dropped her coat and leant forward. \"Now,\" she said, \"let\u0027s quit with the time-wasting and get down to business. I want to know everything there is to know about these monsters. What do they look like? Describe their smell. What sort of tracks do they leave? Where do-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet!\" I snapped, cutting her short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me, offended. \"What did I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush,\" I said, quieter this time, laying a finger to my lips. I advanced to the door and pressed my ear against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trouble?\" Harkat asked, stepping up beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard soft footsteps in the hallway a minute ago - but no door has opened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe retreated, communicating with our eyes. Harkat found his axe, then went to check on the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening?\" Debbie asked. I could hear the fast, hard beat of her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe nothing - maybe an attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampaneze?\" Steve asked grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. It could just be an inquisitive maid. But somebody\u0027s out there. Maybe they\u0027ve been eavesdropping, maybe they haven\u0027t. Best not to take chances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve swung his arrow gun around and slid an arrow into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone outside?\" I asked Harkat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I think the way\u0027s clear if we have to make a... break for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drew my sword and tested the blade while considering our next move. If we left now, it would be safer - especially for Debbie - but once you start running, it\u0027s hard to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up for a scrap?\" I asked Steve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out an uneven breath. \"I\u0027ve never fought a vampaneze on its feet,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve always struck by day, while they were sleeping. I don\u0027t know how much use I\u0027d be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harkat?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you and I should go see... what\u0027s going on,\" he said. \"Steve and Debbie can wait by the window. If they hear sounds of fighting, they... should leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" I asked. \"There\u0027s no fire escape and they can\u0027t scale walls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" Steve said. Reaching inside his jacket, he unwrapped a thin rope from around his waist. \"I always come prepared,\" he winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will that hold two of you?\" Harkat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve nodded and tied one end of the rope to a radiator. Going to the window, he swung it open and threw the other end of the rope down. \"Over here,\" he said to Debbie, and she went to him without objecting. He got her to climb on to the window sill and back out over it, holding on to the rope, so she was ready to descend in a hurry. \"You two do what you have to,\" Steve said, covering the door with his arrow gun. \"We\u0027ll get out if things look bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked with Harkat, then tiptoed to the door and took hold of the handle. \"I\u0027ll go first,\" I said, \"and drop low. You come straight after me. If you see anyone who looks like they don\u0027t belong - scalp them. We\u0027ll stop to ask for their credentials later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the door and dived into the hall, not bothering with a count. Harkat stepped out after me, arrow gun raised. Nobody to my left. I spun right - no one there either. I paused, ears cocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong, tense moments passed. We didn\u0027t move. The silence gnawed at our nerves but we ignored it and concentrated - when you\u0027re fighting vampaneze, a second of distraction is all they need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen someone coughed overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropping to the floor, I twisted on to my back and brought my sword upright, while Harkat swung his arrow gun up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure clinging to the ceiling dropped before Harkat could fire, knocked him across the hallway, then kicked my sword from my hands. I scrambled after it, then stopped at a familiar chuckle. \"Game, set and match to me, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, I was greeted with the sight of a chunky man dressed in purple animal skins, with bare feet and dyed green hair. It was my fellow Vampire Prince - Vancha March!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vancha!\" I gasped, as he grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and helped me to my feet. Harkat had risen by himself and was rubbing the back of his head, where Vancha had struck him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren,\" Vancha said. \"Harkat.\" He wagged a finger at us. \"You should always check the shadows overhead when scanning for danger. If I\u0027d meant to harm you, the two of you would be dead now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you get back?\" I cried excitedly. \"Why did you sneak up on us? Where\u0027s Mr. Crepsley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Larten\u0027s on the roof. We got back about fifteen minutes ago. We heard unfamiliar voices in the room, which is why we moved cautiously. Who\u0027s in there with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in and I\u0027ll introduce you,\" I grinned, then led him into the room. I told Steve and Debbie that we were safe, and went to the window to call down a wary, wind-bitten, very welcome Mr. Crepsley. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/allies-of-the-night-the-saga-of-darren-shan-8/page-14.html","bookId":2444,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:09 PM"}
