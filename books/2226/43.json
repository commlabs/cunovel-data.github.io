She had thought Strathmore would be off the phone by now and return to speak to her, but he was nowhere to be seen. Susan tried to keep calm. She gazed at her computer screen.

He strode quickly across the room and beat her to the door. He folded his arms and blocked her exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what\u0027s going on,\" he demanded. \"There\u0027s something going on here today.

You know damn well what\u0027s going on! \"Back off, Greg,\" she demanded. \"I need to use the bathroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHale smirked.
