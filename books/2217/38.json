Before you walk into the shack, undo a couple of buttons on your sweater.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I most certainly will not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just a thought.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped out of the Taurus and walked casually down the county road. Josie drove her car out of the roadhouse parking lot to the nearest intersection, flipped a U-turn, and came back, pulling up in front of the shack. As soon as she disappeared inside, I jogged across the blacktop and followed the short driveway to the gate. The padlock was made by Abus, a company I had never heard of. I took photos of each side, plus the top and the bottom. Less than a minute later, I was back on the blacktop and walking away from the terminal. Six minutes after that, the Taurus pulled up, and I jumped into the passenger seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What took you so long?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The attendant wanted to chitchat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Josie’s chest. She had undone the top three buttons of her sweater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t blame him,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie knew exactly what I was talking about. She tried to rebutton her sweater with one hand while driving with the other. The car swerved over the centerline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want me to do that?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate you, Dyson. Honest to God I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrand Rapids was a real city with a population of about eleven thousand built on the Mississippi River where it was still narrow enough that you could pass a football from one side to the other. That put it in the heart of Minnesota’s northern resort and recreation area, making it a prime retail center. The stores there sold everything I needed, including an Abus Solid Steel Chrome Plated 83/80 RK padlock. It had taken me about five minutes using Josie’s office computer to identify it from the photographs and another three to locate the nearest store that sold it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie was skeptical when I announced we were taking a road trip. “G. R. is in Itasca County,” she reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Itasca County Sheriff’s Department—you escaped from them the day before yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t you worried that they’re looking for you, that they might find you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFamous last words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took us nearly ninety minutes to get there with Josie driving. Along the way I kept fiddling with the buttons, searching the available radio stations for something worth listening to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you looking for?” Josie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jazz.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie slapped my hand and punched the button for KGPZ, the FM station out of Coleraine. The announcer referred to it as a “real country” station and proceeded to play Taylor Swift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where I come from, the person driving the car gets to pick the radio station,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Country-western, though?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the voice of the people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s pop music. It stopped being the voice of the people when Johnny Cash died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take that back.” Josie’s jaw was set, and her hands clenched the steering wheel with anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs she really going to fight over this? my inner voice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean it,” she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, she is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I apologize,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie knew I was less than sincere, yet she said, “That’s better,” just the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re nuts,” I told her. “You know that, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to drive, Dyson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Yes, I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only knew Grand Rapids well enough to drive through it, so it took a while before we found the locksmith that stocked the Abus padlock. I matched it against the photos I took on Josie’s cell phone and paid the man in cash. He asked if I needed a receipt. When I answered no, he put the bills in his pocket instead of the cash register and thanked me for my business. I found myself nodding as I left the store. Even when I wasn’t pretending to be a hardened criminal, I appreciated any effort that kept taxable income out of the hands of the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, we headed for an electronics megastore off of Highway 169 where a fetching young lass with eyes that matched the color of her shirt gave me a quick tutorial on the pros and cons of a variety of GPS transmitters. We settled on a passive GPS logger that recorded locations, speed, and time and, when plugged into a computer’s USB port, displayed the data it collected on an interface powered by Google Maps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It has a motion sensor,” the tech told me with a pretty smile. “When the vehicle isn’t moving, the device will go into sleep mode to conserve battery power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bought three, plus magnetic boxes to put them in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should be ashamed of yourself,” Josie told me when we entered the checkout line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now what did I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Flirting with that salesgirl. She’s young enough to be your daughter.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-kind-word-mac-mckenzie-10/page-38.html","bookId":2217,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:15 PM"}
