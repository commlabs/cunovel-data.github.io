{"id":63782,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eMasha, the poor old thing, did not know how to comfort me. I went to the washstand and dried my face. There was nothing left for me to do but dig back into my research. I spent the rest of the day finishing my studies of the respiratory system. Badmaev was pleased with my progress. He assigned me readings on the endocrine system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rode the tram home, not bothering to get off at the stop before the Field of Mars. Let my parents see me mingling with the commoners. Let them learn why I threw away the chance to become a grand duchess. I did not care anymore. It would not be long before the whole of St. Petersburg\u0027s aristocracy knew what a fool I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaman met me on the stairs. \"Katiya, where on earth have you been? Don\u0027t try to tell me you\u0027ve been with Dariya, because I refuse to believe it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no point in deceiving her any longer. I took off my hat and gloves as I climbed the stairs to my room. \"I\u0027ve been at the Tibetan doctor\u0027s clinic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A doctor? Are you sick?\" She followed me into my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it matter?\" My heart was broken. I felt wretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it does. We\u0027re to attend the ballet this evening. And you still have not told me what the tsar wanted to speak to you about last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank down onto my bed and realized right then I wanted nothing more than my mother to comfort me. \"George asked me to marry him, and the tsar has given us permission,\" I told her, \"but he said I will have to abandon my dreams of becoming a doctor. So I had to turn the grand duke down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaman stared at me, speechless for several seconds. There. My last secret was out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"George?\" she whispered. \"George Alexandrovich?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad she truly not noticed the way we gravitated toward each other? Whenever I was in trouble, it seemed the tsar\u0027s son was always there to scowl at me. Or to rescue me. I began to tear up again. I was so sick of crying over him. And I missed him so much it hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaman moved toward me and wrapped me in her arms. \"My sweet Katiya. My dearest. I don\u0027t pretend to understand why you have made such a decision, but if it\u0027s making you unhappy, why not change it? I\u0027m sure the young grand duke is not happy right now either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you can\u0027t understand, Maman,\" I said, closing my eyes until the tears were all squeezed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smoothed my hair and rocked me as if I were a baby. \"Perhaps this is a spiritual test of some sort. Should we consult the tarot cards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Maman. I think I\u0027ve already failed this test. But I am not going to give up my studies now. It\u0027s too late to change my decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you and George argue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed bitterly. \"A terrible argument.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will forgive you, I\u0027m sure of it,\" she said, patting my hand kindly. \"The ballet will cheer you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, no, Maman,\" I begged. \"I can\u0027t face anyone tonight. Especially if he is there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" Maman said. \"The tsar\u0027s sons never attend the ballet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was untrue. \"I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll be there if Mathilde Kschessinska is dancing,\" I grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, she\u0027s not scheduled to perform, dear,\" Maman said. \"Though I can see why every young man is fascinated with her. Such a bewitching little beauty! And the way she danced that pas de deux at her graduation! I hear she wants Petipa to revive The Pharoah\u0027s Daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maman!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have nothing to worry about, dearest.\" She peered into my face critically. \"Wear your pale blue silk gown; it will bring out the blue in your eyes. Rest now for a few hours and the puffiness will go away. I\u0027ll have Anya bring up a cucumber compress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. Maman was sure that as long as I looked presentable, everything would be back to rights. \"Yes, Maman.\" Perhaps a nap was what I needed. And perhaps I could still convince her to let me stay home. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3/page-9.html","bookId":2655,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:15 AM"}
