I swore and thought seriously of cursing her - just a little one - but in the end Raphael and Roxy ignored my sobs and pleas and threats and drove us to Christian\u0027s home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Sebastian thought, I had no idea. He didn\u0027t look very lucid, and to tell the shameful truth, at that moment I didn\u0027t care what he thought, In fact, I would have been more than willing to trade him for Christian\u0027s safe return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening, Mrs. Turner,\" I told Christian\u0027s housekeeper as we stood on his doorstep. \"You remember Raphael and Roxy from earlier today, of course. This is a friend of Christian\u0027s.\" I waved toward Sebastian, apparently lying dead in Raphael\u0027s arms. \"He\u0027s... um... he\u0027s not feeling very well at the moment, and Christian asked if we\u0027d get him settled in one of the bedrooms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvidently Mrs. Turner\u0027s impression of Christian\u0027s eccentricities covered two near strangers appearing at the door with her employer\u0027s girlfriend and a nearly dead man, because she didn\u0027t even bat an eye as she stepped back and allowed us in. Oh, she blinked a bit once she got a good look at my eyes, but she didn\u0027t faint or run screaming from the room, so I figured we were well ahead of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will Mr. Dante be along shortly? There is a young lady waiting to speak with him,\" she said as we started up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped on the first stair. \"Oh, really? What sort of a young lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a good thing you\u0027re not denying your fate any longer,\" Roxy called from the top of the stairs. \" \u0027Cause that\u0027s the most jealous \u0027What sort of a young ladyI I\u0027ve ever heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christian has been\" - torn from my side... held prisoner... forced to endure who knows how many torments - \"detained. Is this something I can help with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Turner looked doubtful. \"The young lady said Mr. Dante had asked her to repair some damage done to a floor in the wine cellar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Guardian! I\u0027d forgotten all about her. Drat, what a time for her to come and put a cork in the conduit to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it will make you feel better, I\u0027ll have a talk with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Turner didn\u0027t look as if she\u0027d feel a whole lot better, but I guess she figured I was the lesser of two evils, because she nodded and bustled off to dust something. I limped as quickly as I could up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is all I need, a Guardian hanging around just when I need to focus on saving Christian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know that anything happened to Christian,\" Raphael pointed out as he carried Sebastian into Christian\u0027s bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trailed behind, wringing my hands and wishing I could scream and yell out my frustration and worry. \"Oh, sure, he\u0027s in a house filled with ghost and vampire hunters, not to mention at least one demon and a triumvirate capable of destroying any of us without breaking a sweat, and I have nothing to worry about? Cow cookies! Christian sacrificed himself for Sebastian; I just know he did. And now he\u0027s in trouble and I have to go save him. So if you don\u0027t mind setting Sebastian down on the bed, I\u0027ll get him tucked in and then be on my way to rescue the man I love.\" I headed for the door as the last word left my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about him? You can\u0027t just leave him like this. Even I can tell he\u0027s not going to last much longer,\" Raphael said as he set Sebastian down. The Dark One lay limp and exhausted on the bed, too weak to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped at the doorway. Blast. I knew he was going to call me on that. \"He needs blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy and Raphael looked at Sebastian doubtfully. I waved my hand toward him. \"It\u0027s obvious; I can feel his hunger from here. One of you is going to have to allow him to feed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feed?\" Roxy yelped. \"You mean... feed?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tsked. \"It\u0027s just a little blood. Think of it as a donation to a worthy cause. Look, I don\u0027t have time to stand around explaining it to you. I have Christian to go save.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And just how do you plan to do that?\" Raphael asked as Roxy stared at Sebastian in horror. The latter moved in feeble protest under her gaze. \"You barely made it out of there on your own; how do you expect to find Christian and free him - that\u0027s assuming he isn\u0027t staying there of his own free choice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was across the room and in front of Raphael even before I could draw breath. \"Christian is strong. He would never yield to the triumvirate. Never!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not them,\" Sebastian whispered, his voice a frail reed of sound. I glanced down at him, the tatters of his shirt making it possible to see his ribs clearly outlined beneath the tautly stretched skin of his chest. His breathing was labored and slow, much slower than it should be. His sunken, hopeless eyes begged me for a release to his nightmare. I was torn between the need to rush out and save Christian, and helping the friend I knew meant a lot to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood next to the bed, hesitating, knowing that if I didn\u0027t do something, Sebastian would slip away. He needed help, and I couldn\u0027t turn to either Roxy or Raphael for that help. They simply did not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope you\u0027re all right, Christian. I hope you understand that I have to do this first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian moaned a wordless protest as I sat on the bed next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need blood,\" I told him quietly, rolling up my sleeve. Roxy moved away from the bed, giving us room as I offered my wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian closed his eyes, his lips thinned into a tight line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" I said, shaking my wrist beneath his nose. \"I\u0027m offering this to you of my own free will. Please take it. Christian would want you to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath hissed through his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his face away from my wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squished his lips apart and shoved the delicate flesh of my inner wrist up against his teeth. \"For God\u0027s sake, I\u0027ve never had to beg anyone to drink my blood. Now will you just take it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands fluttered against the bed. \"Not you,\" he mumbled against my wrist. \"Beloved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for heaven\u0027s sake...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" Roxy asked as I straightened up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t feed off me. I think it\u0027s something to do with the fact that I\u0027m Christian\u0027s Beloved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to know you\u0027ve finally seen the light,\" Roxy said, then tapped her chin as she thought. \"You know, I think he\u0027s right. You haven\u0027t Joined with Christian, have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued chin tapping. \"That makes sense. Once a Beloved is claimed, you go into kind of a holding zone, a limbo as far as other Dark Ones are concerned. You\u0027re not Joined, so you\u0027re not a Moravian, and yet you\u0027re not quite human because you\u0027ve completed all but a few steps of Joining.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s just the last one remaining,\" I admitted. \"Wait a minute - what do you mean I\u0027m not quite human?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to what Christian wrote in one of his books - you really need to read them; you\u0027re sadly ignorant of even the most basic Dark One lore, and that\u0027s bound to be a handicap when you\u0027re married to one - your blood is actually like poison to any other Dark Ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped at her. \"Of all the ridiculous things I\u0027ve ever heard! My blood is not poisonous!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to Christian, no, but just you dribble a bit on poor Sebastian\u0027s lips and he\u0027ll be stiffer than a three-day-dead dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all looked at Sebastian. He lay so still, so lifeless he almost looked as if he were already dead. I couldn\u0027t leave him like that, I just couldn\u0027t. Not only would Christian not want his friend to suffer; I couldn\u0027t allow it. Not when there was a way to help him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what will you do?\" Raphael asked. I turned toward him and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was out even before he saw the punch coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think you\u0027re doing?\" Roxy gasped as Raphael hit the floor. She looked from his massive body to my small fist. \"And more important, how did you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed one of his arms and nodded toward the other one. \"Come on, help me - he won\u0027t be out for long. I used a spell to add some wallop to my punch, but it doesn\u0027t last long. I\u0027m not very good at casting spells.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy grunted as we heaved Raphael\u0027s torso up onto the bed, his head lolling next to Sebastian\u0027s thigh. I rolled up his sleeve and dragged his arm up over his head. \"Dinner\u0027s served,\" I told Sebastian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked from the wrist in front of his mouth down to the unconscious man lying half-on, half-off the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have any other choice,\" I told him. \"I realize you feel weird about dining off of someone who helped save you, but I won\u0027t force Roxy, and you turned me down. It\u0027s Raphael or nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian nodded, his reluctance evident even as his lips parted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raphael is going to be so pissed at you,\" Roxy said, her eyes wide as she watched Sebastian\u0027s fangs sink into Raphael\u0027s wrist. \"I mean, majorly pissed. We\u0027re talking world-class pissed here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him he has to take a number,\" I said, pulling the rag doll keeper from beneath my sweater and setting it carefully on the floor. \"There are a lot of other people who were angry with me first. I might as well do this while Sebastian is filling up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what? What\u0027s that doll?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI explained about the ghost Guarda had Summoned as I chalked out a circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a second, if she Summoned the ghost and bound it to a keeper, how can you do anything for her? I thought there was some rule that said first come, first served.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s another rule that I like better,\" I said as I pulled out a small pair of scissors, a length of ribbon, and the bottle of holy water. \"Finders keepers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy hesitated for a moment, then came around to where I had drawn a circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Raphael going to be all right with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over to the bed. \"Sebastian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark One\u0027s eyes opened, and I was startled to see they were a clear, true blue rather than the grayish black they had first appeared. His lips caressed Raphael\u0027s wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t take too much; he\u0027s one of the good guys. All right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe managed a small nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down before the circle and snipped a long strand of my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mean to be rude, but do you... er... trust him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" I glanced up at her. \"I thought you were an expert on the Dark Ones. You of all people should know that Sebastian feels a sense of obligation to Raphael. He would never harm him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. I guess you\u0027re right. It\u0027s just that Raphael\u0027s a friend, and I don\u0027t want to see him... er... drained dry, for lack of better word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"He won\u0027t be. Sebastian will take care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can feel that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"I can feel it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" With one last glance at them, Roxy sat down beside me. \"So how do you \u0027finders keepers\u0027 this ghost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the keeper in the circle, my strand of hair laid across the doll\u0027s neck. \"I\u0027ve never actually done this, so I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027ll work or not. Theoretically it should, but who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ribbon was used to bind the doll\u0027s hands behind its back. I dug into my bag until I found a length of plum-colored cloth wrapped around a long silver object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s gorgeous. What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held it up so Roxy could see the figures of two lovers entwined on the top. \"It\u0027s a hatpin, really, one of the old-fashioned kind. A wizard friend of mine made it for me. I use it for spells, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool. Does he take orders?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, glanced over to make sure Sebastian and Raphael were all right, then sketched a binding ward and closed the circle, the keeper and my hands within it. Using the hatpin, I pricked the doll\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This pin pierces your heart, I see, so let it now be bound only to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, magic,\" Roxy said, her eyes huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snipped the ribbon binding the keeper\u0027s arms, signifying the spirit\u0027s bindings to Guarda being destroyed. \"Threads your body first entwined, now find you are bound to mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do spells always have to rhyme? I mean, it makes for some fairly bad poetry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It gets worse, I\u0027m afraid,\" I told her as I wove the strand of my hair into the ragged, twisted cloth that made up the doll\u0027s hair. \"As I am now part of thee, so you will answer only to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I don\u0027t think I could survive much more. You really need to take a couple of poetry classes before you do this again. I\u0027m thinking something along the lines of an ode would help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used the hatpin to prick my finger, pressing the drop of blood into two marks on either side of the circle. \"With my blood I do command you to heed my call and stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that was so lame - Hey! It\u0027s working!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my hands from the circle as the air within turned opaque, first light gray, then darker, until the image of a small girl in Victorian dress shimmered in the air:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grounded the spirit. \"What is your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honoria Entemann.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy blew out a low whistle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honoria Entemann, do you wish to be Released?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swore tears glittered in her ghostly eyes. She hugged the ghostly image of the rag doll to her chest and nodded. \"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up, traced the ward of protection, and sprinkled ginseng all around the spirit, focusing my mind and speaking the words of Release. With my eyes closed, I summoned every last ounce of will to urge the spirit to move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was interesting. Is it actually supposed to do something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes. The teary-eyed ghost still stood before me. I swore under my breath and carefully stoppered the ginseng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it\u0027s supposed to do something, but I don\u0027t have time to figure out what went wrong. Esme, I Summon you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme materialized before us. \"Oh, my, you\u0027ve sneezed up another one! What an adorable, sweet child! Where did you come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonoria threw herself at Esme and sobbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI limped over to the bed. \"I didn\u0027t Summon her; I cut her loose from Guarda. Are Joy and the others all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme stroked Honoria\u0027s head. \"Yes, she\u0027s fine. She beat Antonio three hands in a row at strip poker, but I don\u0027t think he minded much. Jem decided to pierce his tongue, but something went wrong and now it\u0027s gone missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"The piercing stud?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, his tongue. He\u0027s most vexed about it, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and pushed from my mind the thought of a disattached ghostly tongue. \"I tried to Release Honoria but didn\u0027t have any luck, and I have to go save Christian just as soon as I talk to Sebastian and figure out what\u0027s holding Christian there, so if you could just take care of her for a bit...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be delighted to. Come, little one. I have the most amazing thing to show you. It\u0027s called a television, and if we\u0027re lucky, Buffy the Vampire Slayer will be on BBC 2...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir forms evaporated as I gently touched Sebastian\u0027s head. \"I think that\u0027s probably enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly he pulled his mouth from Raphael\u0027s wrist, his tongue giving it a final flick as he gently released the arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" Roxy breathed, looking at the faint twin puncture marks on Raphael\u0027s wrist. The marks dissolved into nothing as we watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eyed Sebastian. He still looked awful, but at least his skin had lost the grayish cast. \"Rest for a minute; then I need to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes drifted shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy and I managed to get Raphael onto the armchair next to the bed. I covered him up with a blanket, and quickly ran downstairs while Roxy stayed behind to watch over Raphael and Sebastian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up as I set a plate of pound cake and a glass of apple juice next to Raphael for when he woke up. \"You know, I used to think this whole Dark One world was so fascinating, but I have to admit, it\u0027s a bit freaky seeing a vampire drinking your friend\u0027s blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand on Raphael\u0027s forehead and opened my mind up to him. I\u0027m not very good at sensing people\u0027s emotions, but he didn\u0027t seem to be in any distress. \"I think he\u0027s okay; Sebastian was careful. Raphael probably won\u0027t even know what happened unless you tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked faintly sick. \"Think I\u0027ll pass on that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Sebastian. He was watching us now, his eyes the clear blue of a summer sky, a faint flush of color on his cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis throat worked as he nodded. \"A bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had an accent, but one that sounded slightly different from Christian\u0027s. More French, perhaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy winced at his words. \"Ow. Sounds like you\u0027re gargling glass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agreed, but felt little remorse in questioning him. I had done what I could to tide him over until he could be helped properly; now it was his turn to help me. \"Did you see what happened to Christian when he went in to rescue you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, lifting one fragile hand to touch his eye. \"Couldn\u0027t see. Blind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m sorry. But you can see now, yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do know that Christian saved you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips stretched into what must have been a smile, but just looked terrible with him so emaciated. \"Yes. Knew he would. Brothers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared. Christian had never mentioned a brother, other than having lost one when he was young. \"Christian is your brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, his long fingers fumbling with the cloth until he found the area over his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I see, he\u0027s the brother of your heart. Well, good, then you understand why I\u0027m so concerned about him. Is someone holding him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain filled Sebastian\u0027s blue eyes. \"Didn\u0027t know. Hadn\u0027t thought he\u0027d come back so soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who? The person who captured you? Is that who has Christian?\" The air in my lungs seemed to thicken until I couldn\u0027t draw a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian\u0027s throat worked as if he had a hard time saying the word. \"Asmodeus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy blood froze solid. Now I was not only not breathing; my heart had stopped as well. It was amazing I could still think. Then again, perhaps I was delusional. Perhaps I had just imagined that Sebastian had named the demon lord, the being who had once been a man and now ruled a dark army of such power that even wizards and mages feared to meet with them. Yes, I\u0027m sure that was all it was - a mistake. Sebastian hadn\u0027t just spoken the name of one of the most frightening beings in all of existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A demon lord.\" I exhaled, air suddenly finding its way into my lungs again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooh, I\u0027ve read about them in Christian\u0027s books. They\u0027re bad news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knowledge of what Christian must be going through was dark in Sebastian\u0027s eyes, bringing tears to my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not going to leave him there to suffer as you have suffered,\" I vowed, closing my hand around his fingers. His hands were weak, but I could feel the strength that they once held. \"You have to help me, Sebastian. You have to tell me everything you know about Asmodeus, and how he came to be in cahoots with Eduardo and Guarda.\" I grabbed the tattered remains of his shirt and shook it to drive home just how serious I was. \"You must tell me exactly what happened to you, how they caught you, how they kept you so weak you were unable to escape or even answer Christian\u0027s call, and most important, you have to tell me everything you can remember about Christian saving you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allie, honey, I think you\u0027re choking him. I know you\u0027re deafening me, and if you don\u0027t want Christian\u0027s housekeeper to come running to see what all the yelling is about, I\u0027d suggest you lower your voice as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at Sebastian and realized I had gripped the cloth in such a way that he was strangling. He made no protest, though, just watched me as if I had a right to throttle him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, releasing his shirt and smoothing it down. \"I didn\u0027t mean to yell at you. You don\u0027t have to look at me like that; I\u0027m not blaming you for what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wouldn\u0027t have been there but for me,\" Sebastian replied, his voice a raw croak. I couldn\u0027t tell if it was with the pain of knowing Christian had felt him worthy of a sacrifice, or if I had damaged his throat while I was shouting at him, but either way, I couldn\u0027t let him suffer needlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy hurried over to Raphael when he moaned in his sleep. \"I think he\u0027s about to wake up. He looks pissed even sleeping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded to let her know I heard her, then turned back to Sebastian. \"Christian isn\u0027t the type of person to stand in the shadows and not right a wrong,\" I said slowly, smoothing the blanket over his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rozzy?\" Raphael tried to sit up, rubbing his face. \"What happe\u0027d?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told Allie you were going to be mad. Are you okay? You look a bit blurry-eyed to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian\u0027s fingers picked fretfully on the blanket. I patted his hand. \"Especially when someone he cares for is in trouble. Christian has so few friends, I know they mean everything to him; he would move heaven and earth to help those he loves...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially someone like a woman who could redeem his soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feel blurry-eyed. What hit me?\" Raphael was sitting up straight now, shaking his head and feeling his jaw gingerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the pain in Sebastian\u0027s eyes and was filled with shame at my own selfish desire that kept me from Joining with Christian, as I should have. He had said all along that once we were Joined, we would be more powerful together than we were separately, and yet he\u0027d never pushed me to take the last step, never once made me feel pressured into doing it. He seemed happy with me just as I was, and yet I knew that it was my fault that he was trapped in that house, and I was sitting here safe and sound with Sebastian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, that would be Allie. But she had a really good reason for decking you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I swore, my fist tightening around a handful of blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t have a really good reason?\" Roxy asked. She peeked at Raphael out of the corner of her eye. He was trying to stand, and after three tries he at last made it to his feet. \"Er... I thought we were ixnay on the ampirevay eedingfay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are. I had a very good reason for striking Raphael. I\u0027m saying no, I will not let Christian suffer because of my stupidity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you punch Christian like you did me, you have a hell of a nerve saying you won\u0027t let him suffer,\" Raphael complained, wiggling his jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She put a spell on you to make her punch more powerful,\" Roxy said helpfully. I glared at her. \"What? I didn\u0027t want Raphael to think he can be bested by just anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s reassuring to know. Now, if one of you would care to tell me why it was necessary to knock me out, I\u0027d be grateful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I needed to feed,\" Sebastian said simply. \"You saved me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael\u0027s yellow eyes darkened as he stared at Sebastian. \"I what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See? I told you he was going to be pissed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held up my hand to stop Raphael. He had a bit of a \"wild bull about to charge\" look in his eyes. \"Raphael, I\u0027ll explain it all to you later. Christian is my number one priority now. All right, Sebastian. I want everything, every last thing you can remember. Start at the beginning, when you were captured, and don\u0027t leave out a single, solitary - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the bedroom burst open in a huge blast of wind. I stiffened as the wind swirled around us, bringing with it a familiar scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fed my blood to a vampire? You knocked me out and fed my blood to him? Without even bothering to ask me how I felt about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Allie, child, we have trouble,\" Esme said as she spun through the door, caught in the spectral wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stood by and let her knock me out and feed me to the vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, honestly, Raphael, what was I supposed to do? She\u0027s bigger than me, and she knows all sorts of cool spells. And besides, it\u0027s not like you need all that blood. Didn\u0027t your mother ever teach you to share?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonoria clung to Esme, her ghostly gray eyes huge with terror. I looked from her to Esme\u0027s pale face and worried eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my blood! I don\u0027t think it\u0027s asking too much to have a say in how it\u0027s dispensed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trouble?\" I asked, the word weak on my lips. I didn\u0027t want to know. I just didn\u0027t want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ll have that explanation right now, Allie,\" Raphael growled, stalking toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had as much on my plate as I could deal with. One more thing...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, dear, but it seems the demon is back. The lower part of the house is filled with demon smoke. And I think the basement has been sucked into H-E-double-toothpicks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... would break me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sex-and-the-single-vampire-dark-ones-2/page-16.html","bookId":2203,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:00 PM"}
