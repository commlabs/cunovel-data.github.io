I ignore him and concentrate on steadying my heartbeat. I tighten my gloves and pull a deep breath as Rory leads Star toward me. All I have to do is take Star through two warm-up laps and one at a full breeze. I can do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suck in long breaths, working to rid my body of tension. If Star thinks I’m nervous, he’s gonna be scared, and I’ve gotta show him that I’m in charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRory stops about ten feet from me and attempts to hold Star still, but he’s prancing and acting skittish. I charge toward Star with confidence and purpose. I rub his face and he whinnies for a sec, and then he sighs and lips my hair. I straighten his front leg so he will be easier to mount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got this?” Rory asks, mimicking my dad’s expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got this,” I say, moving to the near side to mount. Rory hands me the reins, I get a leg up from him, grab the horse’s mane, throw my other leg over his back, and slip my feet into the stirrups. Star prances in a circle and jerks away from Rory, and I might go flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa!” I say, and Star snorts. “Whoa.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cluck my tongue and trot onto the practice track. Out of the corner of my eye, I watch as Dad joins Jack, Mr. Goodwin, and Gael in the clocker’s tower. Jack waves and whistles, and suddenly I’m not so nervous. We circle the track twice at an easy speed and then it’s time for the real show. I push the horse to a full gallop. Wind rushes against my face. We must be going forty-five miles an hour. That’s well past the speed limit on the four-lane back in Franklin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go,” I shout to Star, gripping the reins tight. We fly around the track. I’m standing hunched over as I make the far turn, urging the horse faster. My guess is that Star starts slow but makes up his speed later, and now’s when it counts. “Go, Star! You got this!” Ten seconds later we cross the finish line, and I bring the colt to a jog, patting his neck and smiling my brains out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack is clapping and beaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time?” I call out to Gael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGael rubs his chin. “1:40. It’s not completely terrible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pump my fist. To hear him say it wasn’t complete shit must mean the horse did pretty well. I steer Star over to the hot-walkers ring, dismount, and hand him off to Dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he runs like this later today, he’ll win for sure,” Dad says, stroking the colt’s mane, trying to get him to calm down. Star’s ears twitch and point forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get up on tiptoes to kiss my father’s cheek, making him smile. “Do you think I’ll get the job?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d wait until after the race to bring it up to Jack. He seems nervous out of his mind right now. But yeah, I’d say you’ve got the job if you want it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss Dad’s cheek again then make my way toward the barns, my red braid bouncing against my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m super excited about Star’s prospects for today but tired as hell. I shouldn’t have stayed out past midnight when I had to get up at 5:00 a.m. for the four-hour drive. I spend the next couple of hours helping Dad and Rory in the barns, feeding the six horses and lead ponies we brought with us, keeping them calm. Exercise riders typically don’t help in the barns, but I don’t mind. I love being around horses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it’s time for Minerva’s race, I go with Rory to the paddock to help put her saddle on. When she’s ready, Rory goes back to the barn and I start walking Minerva in a circle. Not only does this calm her down, it’s a chance for spectators watching the race to check out the horses. They get to see which horses are looking good, which ones are moody, which ones have too many bandages on their front legs, and which ones are clearly injured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorses die every week at racetracks all over the country, and when I hear about it, I want to punch something. That’s the one thing about this sport that really pisses me off—seeing abused racehorses. Some owners drug horses to make them stronger, which is totally illegal. I’ve heard of people who try to drug the horses’ water, but they won’t drink it. So to make them thirsty, they gave horses a salt lick, so that they have no choice but to drink the drugged water. It’s so sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep moving Minerva around in circles. I use a rag to clean out the mare’s mouth. “Good girl,” I say with a yawn, not bothering to cover my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when Jack enters the paddock, wearing that sleek gray suit, a cowboy hat, and black cowboy boots. My heart starts pounding and my mouth goes dry as he adjusts his cufflinks. I glance down at my frayed T-shirt. It has a hole in it. And is that a mustard stain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did well this morning.” Jack pats Minerva’s side and walks beside me, but doesn’t say if I got the job or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. Star is super, super fast. I don’t see how he could lose today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, that means a lot. How’s Minerva looking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack!” a girl yells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up into the grandstands to see a brunette waving a large hat at him. How ridiculous. Women hardly ever wear hats unless it’s the Derby or one of the other big races.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack ducks out of the girl’s line of sight. “Oh shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus,” I say. “That hat is huge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do girls think giant hats look good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack!” the girl yells again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is that?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack looks physically sick. “Abby Winchester. I gotta escape!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s Abby Winchester?” I ask, squinting. “Why is she wearing that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No idea,” Jack says, removing his hat and dragging a hand through his mop of hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, I bet you could yell ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your giant hat’ and climb up to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack laughs at my joke then groans when Abby yells his name again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your girlfriend’s gonna freak out the horses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me a look. “She’s not my girlfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what is she?” And why does he want to escape her so bad? “Does she know you were with Kelsey last night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stares at me for a long moment. Fear rushes through me. Why the hell did I ask that? Who am I to question my boss? We might attend the same parties, but he’s the owner’s son and I’m cleaning out his horse’s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” I say quickly. “I shouldn’t have said anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack keeps looking at me. “Kelsey and I just hang out sometimes…it’s nothing serious. I’m going to check on Star.” He disappears from the paddock in the direction of the barns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinerva nudges my face with her nose, whinnying like she’s worried about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m okay,” I tell her, exhaling deeply. “I’m okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe announcer announces that it’s ten minutes to post time. Bryant Townsend mounts Minerva, and I head over to the fence so I can collect her after she finishes the race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRory joins me at the edge of the track to watch. “$100,000 guaranteed purse on this one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” I reply, grasping the white fence, white-knuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Minerva wins today, Mr. Goodwin will be $100,000 richer, and Rory says he tends to give good bonuses to the grooms, exercise boys, and trainers who work with his horses. Mr. Cates never did things like that. One point for Mr. Goodwin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could sure use the money for college applications,” Rory says. “They’re expensive. Like, some of them are thirty-five bucks apiece.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn. I didn’t know that. Do you know where you’re applying yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRory lifts a shoulder, staring out at the track. “I’m thinking UTK. They have a good theater program. But I doubt I’ll get any big scholarships like my brother Will did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t totally relate, considering I’m not going to college, but I hurt for my friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night during the grand tour of Franklin, Rory confessed that most of the Whitfields’ money goes toward taking care of his autistic nine-year-old brother. Special schooling doesn’t come cheap, especially when farms are declining all over the country. Rory’s older brother gave up attending a fancy college so they could afford special schooling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happens if you can’t afford college?” I ask. “Are you just gonna keep working on your screenplays or take over Whitfield Farms like Jack is gonna take over Cedar Hill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t do it,” Rory says quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t end up like my parents. You know, struggling with our farm. We haven’t broken even in two years. I don’t ever want to go through this when I’m older and have kids or whatever…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But who’s gonna run the farm? Your brother, Will?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Frankly I don’t care who runs it. It’s a black hole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But the farm’s been in your family since the Civil War!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that, but I’ve gotta do what’s best for me. Some things aren’t meant to last.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But your family—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you drop it?” he hisses. He clutches the fence and I suck in a deep breath, staring at the scoreboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” Rory says after a moment, giving me a quick, sad smile. “Just ignore your dick friend over here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay,” I say quietly, resting a hand on his arm. “I understand.” But I don’t. So his family has had a few bad seasons. So what? I’m sure it’ll pick up. Family’s too important to give up on them. Even if I’m annoyed that Dad got his girlfriend pregnant, I can’t imagine leaving them high and dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinerva wins her race against other fillies and mares, which means that Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin, Jack, Shelby, Bryant, and Gael go to the winner’s circle and have their picture made with the horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bryant dismounts, Jack hands Minerva off to Rory so he can hot-walk her and lead her back to her stall. “I want you to watch Star’s race with me,” Jack says. “For good luck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. Mrs. Goodwin and Shelby disappear back to their box, but Mr. Goodwin stays put against the fence, thumbing through the race program. He says, “Thank God, they’re gone. I need a hot dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack whispers to me, “Mom won’t let him eat hot dogs, so he has to sneak them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want one?” Mr. Goodwin asks Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the stupidest question I’ve ever heard.” Jack adjusts his suit jacket. “Of course I want a hot dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Goodwin gently taps Jack’s cheek. “How about you, Savannah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.” I reach into my back pocket to give him cash, but Mr. Goodwin waves me off. “Wait here so I can find you,” Mr. Goodwin says, then goes over to the concession stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad refuses to get a cell phone,” Jack says. “That’s why we have to stand here so he can find us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why doesn’t he have a cell phone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he insists on living in the prehistoric era. I read this story about how apes in zoos use iPads and I showed the article to Dad, hoping it would make him want to start using a computer or a cell, but you know what he said?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/racing-savannah-hundred-oaks-4/page-7.html","bookId":1969,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:04 AM"}
