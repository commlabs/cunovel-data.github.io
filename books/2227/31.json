The mug of potent Brazilian coffee in his hand had granted him a hazy reprieve from his mounting exhaustion, and yet he sensed the reprieve would be fleeting. The fatigue in his body went to the core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You slipped out quietly,\" a voice behind him said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned. Sophie\u0027s grandmother emerged, her silver hair shimmering in the night. Her name, for the last twenty-eight years at least, was Marie Chauvel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon gave a tired smile. \"I thought I\u0027d give your family some time together.\" Through the window, he could see Sophie talking with her brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie came over and stood beside him. \"Mr. Langdon, when I first heard of Jacques\u0027s murder, I was terrified for Sophie\u0027s safety. Seeing her standing in my doorway tonight was the greatest relief of my life. I cannot thank you enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had no idea how to respond. Although he had offered to give Sophie and her grandmother time to talk in private, Marie had asked him to stay and listen. My husband obviously trusted you, Mr.Langdon, so I do as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so Langdon had remained, standing beside Sophie and listening in mute astonishment while Marie told the story of Sophie\u0027s late parents. Incredibly, both had been from Merovingian families - direct descendants of Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ. Sophie\u0027s parents and ancestors, for protection, had changed their family names of Plantard and Saint-Clair. Their children represented the most direct surviving royal bloodline and therefore were carefully guarded by the Priory. When Sophie\u0027s parents were killed in a car accident whose cause could not be determined, the Priory feared the identity of the royal line had been discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your grandfather and I,\" Marie had explained in a voice choked with pain, \"had to make a grave decision the instant we received the phone call. Your parents\u0027 car had just been found in the river.\" She dabbed at the tears in her eyes. \"All six of us - including you two grandchildren - were supposed to be traveling together in that car that very night. Fortunately we changed our plans at the last moment, and your parents were alone. Hearing of the accident, Jacques and I had no way to know what had really happened... or if this was truly an accident.\" Marie looked at Sophie. \"We knew we had to protect our grandchildren, and we did what we thought was best. Jacques reported to the police that your brother and I had been in the car... our two bodies apparently washed off in the current. Then your brother and I went underground with the Priory. Jacques, being a man of prominence, did not have the luxury of disappearing. It only made sense that Sophie, being the eldest, would stay in Paris to be taught and raised by Jacques, close to the heart and protection of the Priory.\" Her voice fell to a whisper. \"Separating the family was the hardest thing we ever had to do. Jacques and I saw each other only very infrequently, and always in the most secret of settings... under the protection of the Priory. There are certain ceremonies to which the brotherhood always stays faithful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had sensed the story went far deeper, but he also sensed it was not for him to hear. So he had stepped outside. Now, gazing up at the spires of Rosslyn, Langdon could not escape the hollow gnaw of Rosslyn\u0027s unsolved mystery. Is the Grail really here at Rosslyn? And if so, where are theblade and chalice that Sauniere mentioned in his poem?\" I\u0027ll take that,\" Marie said, motioning to Langdon\u0027s hand. \"Oh, thank you.\" Langdon held out his empty coffee cup. She stared at him. \"I was referring to your other hand, Mr. Langdon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon looked down and realized he was holding Sauniere\u0027s papyrus. He had taken it from the cryptex once again in hopes of seeing something he had missed earlier. \"Of course, I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie looked amused as she took the paper. \"I know of a man at a bank in Paris who is probably very eager to see the return of this rosewood box. Andre Vernet was a dear friend of Jacques, and Jacques trusted him explicitly. Andre would have done anything to honor Jacques\u0027s requests for the care of this box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncluding shooting me, Langdon recalled, deciding not to mention that he had probably broken the poor man\u0027s nose. Thinking of Paris, Langdon flashed on the three senechaux who had been killed the night before. \"And the Priory? What happens now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wheels are already in motion, Mr. Langdon. The brotherhood has endured for centuries, and it will endure this. There are always those waiting to move up and rebuild.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll evening Langdon had suspected that Sophie\u0027s grandmother was closely tied to the operations of the Priory. After all, the Priory had always had women members. Four Grand Masters had been women. The senechaux were traditionally men - the guardians - and yet women held far more honored status within the Priory and could ascend to the highest post from virtually any rank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon thought of Leigh Teabing and Westminster Abbey. It seemed a lifetime ago. \"Was the Church pressuring your husband not to release the Sangreal documents at the End of Days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heavens no. The End of Days is a legend of paranoid minds. There is nothing in the Priory doctrine that identifies a date at which the Grail should be unveiled. In fact the Priory has always maintained that the Grail should never be unveiled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never?\" Langdon was stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the mystery and wonderment that serve our souls, not the Grail itself. The beauty of the Grail lies in her ethereal nature.\" Marie Chauvel gazed up at Rosslyn now. \"For some, the Grail is a chalice that will bring them everlasting life. For others, it is the quest for lost documents and secret history. And for most, I suspect the Holy Grail is simply a grand idea... a glorious unattainable treasure that somehow, even in today\u0027s world of chaos, inspires us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if the Sangreal documents remain hidden, the story of Mary Magdalene will be lost forever,\" Langdon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will it? Look around you. Her story is being told in art, music, and books. More so every day. The pendulum is swinging. We are starting to sense the dangers of our history... and of our destructive paths. We are beginning to sense the need to restore the sacred feminine.\" She paused. \"You mentioned you are writing a manuscript about the symbols of the sacred feminine, are you not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\" She smiled. \"Finish it, Mr. Langdon. Sing her song. The world needs modern troubadours.\" Langdon fell silent, feeling the weight of her message upon him. Across the open spaces, a new moon was rising above the tree line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning his eyes toward Rosslyn, Langdon felt a boyish craving to know her secrets. Don\u0027t ask, he told himself. This is not the moment.He glanced at the papyrus in Marie\u0027s hand, and then back at Rosslyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask the question, Mr. Langdon,\" Marie said, looking amused. \"You have earned the right.\" Langdon felt himself flush.\" You want to know if the Grail is here at Rosslyn.\" \"Can you tell me?\" She sighed in mock exasperation. \"Why is it that men simply cannot let the Grail rest?\" She laughed, obviously enjoying herself. \"Why do you think it\u0027s here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon motioned to the papyrus in her hand. \"Your husband\u0027s poem speaks specifically of Rosslyn, except it also mentions a blade and chalice watching over the Grail. I didn\u0027t see any symbols of the blade and chalice up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blade and chalice?\" Marie asked. \"What exactly do they look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon sensed she was toying with him, but he played along, quickly describing the symbols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of vague recollection crossed her face. \"Ah, yes, of course. The blade represents all that is masculine. I believe it is drawn like this, no?\" Using her index finger, she traced a shape on herpalm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Langdon said. Marie had drawn the less common\" closed\" form of the blade, although Langdon had seen the symbol portrayed both ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the inverse,\" she said, drawing again on her palm,\" is the chalice, which represents the feminine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct,\" Langdon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you are saying that in all the hundreds of symbols we have here in Rosslyn Chapel, these two shapes appear nowhere?\" \"I didn\u0027t see them.\" \"And if I show them to you, will you get some sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Langdon could answer, Marie Chauvel had stepped off the porch and was heading toward the chapel. Langdon hurried after her. Entering the ancient building, Marie turned on the lights and pointed to the center of the sanctuary floor. \"There you are, Mr. Langdon. The blade and chalice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon stared at the scuffed stone floor. It was blank. \"There\u0027s nothing here... .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie sighed and began to walk along the famous path worn into the chapel floor, the same path Langdon had seen the visitors walking earlier this evening. As his eyes adjusted to see the giant symbol, he still felt lost. \"But that\u0027s the Star of Dav - \" Langdon stopped short, mute with amazement as it dawned on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blade and chalice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFused as one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Star of David... the perfect union of male and female... Solomon\u0027s Seal... marking the Holy of Holies, where the male and female deities - Yahweh and Shekinah - were thought to dwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon needed a minute to find his words. \"The verse does point here to Rosslyn. Completely. Perfectly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie smiled. \"Apparently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe implications chilled him. \"So the Holy Grail is in the vault beneath us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Only in spirit. One of the Priory\u0027s most ancient charges was one day to return the Grail to her homeland of France where she could rest for eternity. For centuries, she was dragged across the countryside to keep her safe. Most undignified. Jacques\u0027s charge when he became Grand Master was to restore her honor by returning her to France and building her a resting place fit for a queen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he succeeded?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow her face grew serious. \"Mr. Langdon, considering what you\u0027ve done for me tonight, and as curator of the Rosslyn Trust, I can tell you for certain that the Grail is no longer here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon decided to press. \"But the keystone is supposed to point to the place where the Holy Grail is hidden now.Why does it point to Rosslyn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027re misreading its meaning. Remember, the Grail can be deceptive. As could my late husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how much clearer could he be?\" he asked. \"We are standing over an underground vault marked by the blade and chalice, underneath a ceiling of stars, surrounded by the art of Master Masons. Everything speaks of Rosslyn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, let me see this mysterious verse.\" She unrolled the papyrus and read the poem aloud in a deliberate tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Holy Grail \u0027neath ancient Roslin waits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blade and chalice guarding o\u0027er Her gates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdorned in masters\u0027 loving art, She lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rests at last beneath the starry skies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finished, she was still for several seconds, until a knowing smile crossed her lips. \"Aah, Jacques.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon watched her expectantly. \"You understand this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you have witnessed on the chapel floor, Mr. Langdon, there are many ways to see simple things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon strained to understand. Everything about Jacques Sauniere seemed to have double meanings, and yet Langdon could see no further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie gave a tired yawn. \"Mr. Langdon, I will make a confession to you. I have never officially been privy to the present location of the Grail. But, of course, I was married to a person of enormous influence... and my women\u0027s intuition is strong.\" Langdon started to speak but Marie continued. \"I am sorry that after all your hard work, you will be leaving Rosslyn without any real answers. And yet, something tells me you will eventually find what you seek. One day it will dawn on you.\" She smiled. \"And when it does, I trust that you, of all people, can keep a secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sound of someone arriving in the doorway. \"Both of you disappeared,\" Sophie said, entering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just leaving,\" her grandmother replied, walking over to Sophie at the door. \"Good night, princess.\" She kissed Sophie\u0027s forehead. \"Don\u0027t keep Mr. Langdon out too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon and Sophie watched her grandmother walk back toward the fieldstone house. When Sophie turned to him, her eyes were awash in deep emotion. \"Not exactly the ending I expected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat makes two of us, he thought. Langdon could see she was overwhelmed. The news she had received tonight had changed everything in her life. \"Are you okay? It\u0027s a lot to take in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled quietly. \"I have a family. That\u0027s where I\u0027m going to start. Who we are and where we came from will take some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beyond tonight, will you stay with us?\" Sophie asked. \"At least for a few days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon sighed, wanting nothing more. \"You need some time here with your family, Sophie. I\u0027m going back to Paris in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked disappointed but seemed to know it was the right thing to do. Neither of them spoke for a long time. Finally Sophie reached over and, taking his hand, led him out of the chapel. They walked to a small rise on the bluff. From here, the Scottish countryside spread out before them, suffused in a pale moonlight that sifted through the departing clouds. They stood in silence, holding hands, both of them fighting the descending shroud of exhaustion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stars were just now appearing, but to the east, a single point of light glowed brighter than any other. Langdon smiled when he saw it. It was Venus. The ancient Goddess shining down with her steady and patient light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night was growing cooler, a crisp breeze rolling up from the lowlands. After a while, Langdon looked over at Sophie. Her eyes were closed, her lips relaxed in a contented smile. Langdon could feel his own eyes growing heavy. Reluctantly, he squeezed her hand. \"Sophie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she opened her eyes and turned to him. Her face was beautiful in the moonlight. She gave him a sleepy smile. \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt an unexpected sadness to realize he would be returning to Paris without her. \"I maybe gone before you wake up.\" He paused, a knot growing in his throat. \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m not very good at - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie reached out and placed her soft hand on the side of his face. Then, leaning forward, she kissed him tenderly on the cheek. \"When can I see you again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon reeled momentarily, lost in her eyes. \"When?\" He paused, curious if she had any idea how much he had been wondering the same thing. \"Well, actually, next month I\u0027m lecturing at a conference in Florence. I\u0027ll be there a week without much to do.\" \"Is that an invitation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d be living in luxury. They\u0027re giving me a room at the Brunelleschi.\" Sophie smiled playfully. \"You presume a lot, Mr. Langdon.\" He cringed at how it had sounded. \"What I meant - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would love nothing more than to meet you in Florence, Robert. But on one condition.\" Her tone turned serious. \"No museums, no churches, no tombs, no art, no relics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Florence? For a week? There\u0027s nothing else to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie leaned forward and kissed him again, now on the lips. Their bodies came together, softly at first, and then completely. When she pulled away, her eyes were full of promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Langdon managed. \"It\u0027s a date.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-da-vinci-code-robert-langdon-2/page-31.html","bookId":2227,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:49 PM"}
