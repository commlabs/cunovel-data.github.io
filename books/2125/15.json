It was the first thing she could think of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can stay, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Without going in the house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Mereniang could answer, Rob spoke. \"Look, nobody\u0027s deciding to stay right now. This is something we\u0027ve got to think over - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only place you\u0027ll be safe,\" Mereniang said. \"We\u0027ve had a lot of visitors over the years, but we\u0027ve asked very few to stay with us. We do it when they have no choice - no other safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are there any here now?\" Kait asked, looking at the Fellowship behind Mereniang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last died a long time ago. But he lived longer than he would have in the outside world - and so will you. You are part of our race, and the crystal will help sustain you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis was twisting his baseball cap. \"What do you mean, \u0027part of your race\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimon spread his hands. \"All psychics are descendants of the old race. Somewhere among your ancestors was one of the people of the crystal. The old blood has awakened in you.\" He looked at each of them earnestly. \"My children, you belong here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait didn\u0027t know what to say. She\u0027d never felt so confused and disoriented in her life. The Fellowship was nothing that she had expected, and the discovery left her numb, in shock. Meanwhile, the web was a jumble of conflicting emotions that made it impossible for her to tell what any particular one of the others was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Rob who saved them, speaking steadily. \"We\u0027re proud that you think we\u0027re good enough to join you, sir,\" he said to Timon. He\u0027d regained his natural courtesy. \"And we\u0027d like to thank you. But this is something we\u0027re going to have to talk over a bit. You understand that.\" It was a statement, but Rob scanned the faces of the Fellowship questioningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMereniang looked vaguely annoyed, but Timon said, \"Of course. Of course. You\u0027re all tired, and you\u0027ll find it easier to think tomorrow. There\u0027s no hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn still felt like arguing with somebody - but Timon was right. She was swaying on her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow they\u0027d all be fresh, and less emotional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll talk to them again about Mr. Zetes then,\" Rob whispered to her under cover of the meeting breaking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn nodded and glanced around for Gabriel. He was talking to Lydia, but he stopped when he saw her looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to be all right?\" she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were opaque - as if they\u0027d filmed over with gray spiderweb. \"Sure,\" he said. \"They\u0027ve got a little cot for me in the toolshed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Gabriel... Maybe we should all stay there with you. Do you want me to ask Meren - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" No,\" Gabriel said vehemently. Then he added more smoothly, \"Don\u0027t worry about me. I\u0027ll be fine. Get your sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalls, walls, walls. Kaitlyn sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, oddly, he said: \"Good night, Kait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn blinked. Had he ever said good night to her before? \"I - good night, Gabriel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Mereniang gathered them up and took them into the house, leaving Gabriel with a couple of the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as they were entering the house that Kaitlyn remembered a question she\u0027d forgotten to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meren, do you know about the inuk shuk on Whiffen Spit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Timon knows the most about them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I was just wondering why they were there. And if they meant anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimon was smiling reminiscently. \"Ancient peoples started the tradition. They came down as traders from the north and left some of their stone language here. They called this a place of good magic, and they built their friendship signs on the spit that points to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimon was still smiling, lost in thought. \"That was a very long time ago,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve watched the world change all around us - but we have remained unchanged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a note of pride in his voice, and a tinge of arrogance in Mereniang\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait looked at Timon. \"Don\u0027t you think change is sometimes good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimon came out of his reverie, looking startled. But no one answered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn\u0027s bedroom was very plain, with a bed built into the wall, a chair, and a washbasin under a mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time she\u0027d slept alone - without the others - in a week. She didn\u0027t like it, but she was so tired she fell asleep quickly anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone in the tool shed, Gabriel was awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Mereniang had \"looked into their hearts,\" had she? He smiled wryly. What the Fellowship didn\u0027t seem to realize was that hearts could change. He had changed since he\u0027d come here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a change that had started last night. Last night on the wharf when he\u0027d discovered his feelings for Kaitlyn - and Kaitlyn had made her choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t her fault. Strangely enough, it wasn\u0027t Kessler\u0027s, either. They belonged together, both honest, both good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that didn\u0027t mean Gabriel had to stick around and watch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, tonight, his last hope had disappeared. The people of the crystal couldn\u0027t free him. They didn\u0027t even want to. And he\u0027d seen the disgust and condemnation in their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLive here? In their outbuildings? Face that condemnation every day? And watch Kessler and Kait romancing each other?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel\u0027s lips drew back from his teeth in a fierce smile. He didn\u0027t think so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be grateful to the Fellowship, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027ve shown me what I really am, simply in contrast to what they are. Back in the old days I\u0027d have joined the Dark Lodge and hunted these gutless wimps out of existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a fairly simple equation. He didn\u0027t belong with the good guys, the white hats. Therefore, he must belong with the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a new revelation, but a rediscovery. Kait had almost made him forget what he really was. She\u0027d almost convinced him that he could live on the light side, that he wasn\u0027t a killer by nature. Well, tomorrow she\u0027d see how wrong she\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel stepped back a little to look at the body on the toolshed floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s name had been Theo. The Fellowship had sent him to spend the night out here - whether as companion or guard Gabriel didn\u0027t know. Now he was in a coma. Not quite dead, but getting there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel had mind-linked with him to take knowledge from his brain. Including the knowledge of a secret trail through the otherwise impassable forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe extra energy had been nice, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the only thing Gabriel was waiting for was Lydia. He\u0027d whispered a few words to her in the rose garden, asking her to come tonight and meet him. He was fairly certain she\u0027d show up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Gabriel would ask her if she really wanted to spend the next seventy years with a commune of doddering old hippies. Or if life might not be better back in sunny California, where Gabriel had the feeling that Mr. Zetes was setting up a little Dark Lodge of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia was weak. He thought he could persuade her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if he couldn\u0027t - well, she could join Theo on the floor. Lewis would be unhappy, but what did Lewis matter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor just an instant an image flashed through his mind of what would happen if he could persuade her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would happen here, to the Fellowship, once he gave Mr. Zetes the information needed to home in on the white house. It wouldn\u0027t be a pretty picture. And Kait would be in the middle of it...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel shook the thought off and bared his teeth again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to at least have the courage of his convictions. If he was going to be evil, he\u0027d be evil, all the way. From now on there were no half measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd besides, Kessler would be here. He\u0027d just have to take care of Kaitlyn himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA footstep sounded outside the shed. Gabriel turned to meet Lydia, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn could hear it even in her sleep, as she slowly drifted toward consciousness. By the time she was fully awake, it was more than one person, and the web was singing with alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran out, pulling on her clothes. Broadcasting What\u0027s happening? to anyone that could hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know, Rob sent back. Everyone\u0027s upset. Something\u0027s happened...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople were running in the hallways of the white house. Kaitlyn spotted Tamsin and swooped on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your friends,\" Tamsin said. She had olive-dark eyes, contrasting strangely with her golden hair. \"The boy outside and the small girl...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel and Lydia? What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re gone,\" Mereniang said, appearing from a recessed room. \"And the man we had guarding Gabriel is nearly dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn\u0027s heart plummeted. Endlessly, it seemed. She couldn\u0027t move or breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn\u0027t be true. It couldn\u0027t. Gabriel wouldn\u0027t have done a thing like that...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then she remembered how he\u0027d looked last night. His gray eyes so opaque, his walls so high. As if he\u0027d lost all hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she certainly couldn\u0027t sense him anywhere in the web. She could feel only Rob and Lewis and Anna, who were coming to join her now in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob put an arm around her to support her. Kaitlyn needed it; she thought her knees might give out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis was looking wretched and unbelieving. \"Lydia went, too?\" he asked pathetically. Mereniang just nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they can\u0027t have gone far,\" Kait whispered, finding her voice. \"They can\u0027t get through the forest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guard knew a path. Gabriel entered his mind. He knows what the guard knew.\" Mereniang spoke with very little emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must have been Lydia,\" Rob exploded. \"Gabriel wouldn\u0027t have done it on his own. Lydia must have talked him into it, somehow.\" Kaitlyn could feel his pain and Lewis\u0027s fighting each other, building exponentially, magnifying her own distress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMereniang shook her head once, decisively. \"If anything, it was the other way around. I realized last night that Gabriel was dangerous; that was why I sent Theo to watch him. But I underestimated how dangerous he was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn felt a wave of sickness. \"I still can\u0027t believe it. It couldn\u0027t have been his fault - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I still don\u0027t think it was Lydia\u0027s fault,\" Lewis began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter whose fault it is,\" Mereniang said sharply, interrupting both of them. \"And there\u0027s no time to argue. We have to prepare for an attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis looked confused and horrified. \"You\u0027re going to attack - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! We\u0027re going to be attacked. As soon as those two communicate with your Mr. Zetes. They must have run away to join him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the wave of sickness almost drowned Kaitlyn. She heard Anna whisper, \"Oh, no...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she tried to convince herself that Gabriel wouldn\u0027t tell Mr. Zetes, that he\u0027d just run away. But the violent beating of her own heart contradicted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mereniang! We need you in the garden!\" The voice came from a doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMereniang turned. \"I\u0027m coming!\" She looked back at Kaitlyn\u0027s group. \"Stay inside. The worst of it will be out there.\" And then she was running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn held on to Rob, her only anchor in a spinning world. Do you think he\u0027ll do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob\u0027s arms tightened around her. I don\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob, is it our fault?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hardest question, the one she knew would haunt her dreams if she lived through today. She could feel Lewis\u0027s hurt despair. Before Rob could answer, the attack began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold wind blew down the corridor. Not just cold air, a gale. It whipped Kaitlyn\u0027s hair against her cheeks and tore loose strands from Anna\u0027s braid. It cut through their clothing like a newly sharpened knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with it came a rattling. The wooden bench against the wall began to tremble, at first with a fine vibration, then more and more violently. Kaitlyn could hear the banging of doors swinging on their hinges, and the crash of things falling off shelves and walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so sudden that for a moment all she could do was stand and cling to Rob. Her temperature seemed to have dropped by degrees. A violent shivering racked her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay together,\" Rob shouted, reaching out for Anna and Lewis. They grabbed hold, all four of them clutching each other. It was like trying to stand in a blizzard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a wild ringing in Kaitlyn\u0027s ears - like the sound she\u0027d heard once in the van. The sound of a crystal glass being stroked, only this went on and on, and it was pitched at a frequency that hurt. That pierced like needles, making it almost impossible to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the smell. The odor of rotting flesh, of raw sewage. The wind forced it into her nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they trying to do? Stink us all out?\" Lewis shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meren said it would be worse outside!\" Anna shouted back. It was no good using telepathy, the entire web was vibrating with that piercing note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they said she was needed in the garden!\" Rob shouted. \"The garden - where the crystal is. Come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on where?\" Lewis yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the rose garden! Maybe we can do something to help!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stumbled and staggered getting out of the house. Outside, the wind was worse, and the sky was black with clouds. It didn\u0027t seem to be morning at all, but an eerie and unnatural twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" Rob kept shouting, and somehow they made it to the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell was coming from here, and so was the ringing sound. The roses were tattered, their petals torn off by the wind. A few petals still whirled in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God - the crystal!\" Anna shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the Fellowship seemed to be gathered around it, and many of them, including Timon and Mereniang, had their hands on it. The crystal itself was pulsating wildly, but not with the gentle milky light Kait had seen before. Every color of the rainbow seemed to be fighting and flashing in its depths. It was dazzling, almost impossible to look at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn\u0027t what Anna had meant. It was something much worse. Superimposed on the rose garden crystal was another, a phantom crystal without any color. A monstrosity with growths sprouting from every facet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crystal from Mr. Z\u0027s basement, Kait thought dazedly. Or, rather, its astral image. And around that corrupted crystal were the astral images of the attackers, visible like ghosts among the bodies of the Fellowship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gray people, the ones she\u0027d seen in the van. She just hadn\u0027t seen the crystal then. They were leaning around it, touching it with their hands and foreheads. Using its power to do what? Kaitlyn thought suddenly. \"What are they trying to do?\" she shouted to Rob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re trying to destroy our crystal,\" one of the Fellowship answered. A sturdy woman who was in the outer circle around the fountain. \"They\u0027ve set up a vibration to shatter it. They won\u0027t be able to do it, though, not while all our power is protecting it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we help?\" Rob yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman just shook her head, looking back at the crystal. But Rob and Kaitlyn both moved past her, struck by a common impulse to get as close as possible to what was happening. They squeezed through the crowd and ended up behind Timon and Mereniang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimon\u0027s frail body was shaking so hard that Kaitlyn felt a stab of fear. She was shaking herself - not with cold, now, but with the vibrations of the crystal. The ground, the fountain, everything was trembling, as if resonating to a single, terrible note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So much - evil. So much - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a gasp, and Kaitlyn could barely hear it. But she saw Timon\u0027s lips moving and she caught the words. His lined face was white, his eyes wide and clouded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know,\" he gasped. \"I didn\u0027t realize - and to do such things to children...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn didn\u0027t understand. She looked at Mereniang and saw that the dark woman\u0027s face was also twisted with horror. Those blue eyes narrowed and streamed with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Kait looked at the gray people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were more defined than she\u0027d ever seen them before. It was almost as if they were actually materializing here, as if they might appear physically at any moment. She could see their bodies, their hands - and their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them was familiar. Kaitlyn had seen that face before - or at least a picture of it. On a folder labeled SABRINA JESSICA GALLO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mr. Zetes had told her they\u0027d all gone insane. Every one of his first students, everyone in the pilot study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he didn\u0027t mind them being insane. Maybe it was easier to control them that way...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn could feel tears on her own cheeks. Timon was right. Mr. Zetes was absolutely evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he seemed to be winning. The crystal in the fountain was vibrating ever more frenetically. The kaleidoscope of colors disappearing into the misty gray of the other crystal. She could actually see the corrupted crystal more clearly now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Timon, let go!\" Mereniang was calling. \"You\u0027re too old for this! The crystal should be sustaining you, not the other way around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Timon didn\u0027t seem to hear her. \"So evil,\" he said again and again. \"I didn\u0027t realize how evil...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rob, we\u0027ve got to do something!\" Kaitlyn shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was Timon who answered, in a telepathic voice that cut through the ringing in the web. A voice so strong that Kaitlyn whirled to stare at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! We must do something. We must let go of the crystal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMereniang was staring, too, her eyes and mouth open. \"Timon, if we release it - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo it! the telepathic voice roared back. Everyone, do it now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, Timon stepped away, taking his hands off the crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn\u0027s head was spinning. She watched as the other members of the Fellowship looked at each other wildly, in obvious distress. Then, suddenly, she saw another figure step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was LeShan, his lynx eyes flashing, holding his empty hands in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother one of the Fellowship stepped away, and another. Finally only Mereniang was holding on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet go! Timon shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crystal was trembling visibly. The piercing note rang higher and higher in Kaitlyn\u0027s ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go,\" Timon whispered, as if his strength had suddenly given out. \"Someone - make her... She\u0027ll be destroyed...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob surged forward. He grabbed Mereniang around the waist and pulled. Her palms came away from the crystal, and they both fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terrible ringing became a terrible crashing. The sound of a million goblets falling to the floor. A sound that deafened Kaitlyn, echoing in every nerve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe great crystal was shattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost like an explosion, although the only thing flying outward was light. A burst of radiance that left Kaitlyn blind as well as deaf. Imprinted on her eyelids she had a picture of thousands of shards hanging in air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell to her knees, arms wrapped around her head protectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she opened her eyes, the world had changed. The wind was gone. So was the smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo were the crystals - both of them. The gray crystal had simply vanished, along with the gray people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other one, the last perfect crystal in the world, was lying in splinters in the water of the fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDizzy and unbelieving, Kaitlyn looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimon was lying on the grass, one hand curled on his chest. His eyes were shut, his face waxen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob was picking himself up from under Mereniang, who was crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" the dark woman demanded. It was what Kait wanted to know herself. \"Why, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimon\u0027s eyelids fluttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a shard and give it to the children,\" he whispered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-possessed-dark-visions-2/page-15.html","bookId":2125,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:06 PM"}
