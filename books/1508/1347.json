Lin Ming was like a slippery little cockroach that he couldn’t grab. Not just that, but on the other side, the battle between the five Divine Lord masters and the primordial epoch spirit root had reached the white-hot stage. They had originally been able to cause great damage to the primordial epoch spirit root, but since they were missing the black-robed old man, they were far too overstretched and were beginning to gradually exhaust themselves!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNearly every time they fought they had to use up their life source and blood essence!
