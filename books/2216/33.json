Plenty of people go camping on their boats. Just remember to make sure you mount a white light that’s visible from any direction between sunset and sunrise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled up a map of Lake Minnetonka on my smartphone. It was so damn big with so many miles of unbroken shoreline and so many places for a man to conceal a boat, not to mention just anchoring in the middle of a bay or inlet somewhere, hiding in plain sight. I didn’t even know where to begin looking for Navarre, although I figured it might actually be easier to sneak up on him after dark when I could concentrate my search on any white lights I saw flickering across the water. That would require a boat, though, and a pilot who knew the lake, because if I could get lost just trying to drive around it …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e’Course, Navarre might also be moored in a slip at one of the many marinas, paying dockage fees for the day while he recharged his batteries and took on fresh water. It had been nearly a week since he took the So?adora out, and Jimmy McDonald said five days was the maximum. I could check on each and every marina in turn. Grunt work, I knew, but that’s what private investigators do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should apply for a license one of these days, my inner voice told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I’ll get right on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould Navarre have the balls to return to Irene Rogers’s dock? How ’bout Club Versailles? They would accommodate him if Mrs. R said so. Would she say so? Would they even bother to ask her? I called Mrs. Rogers. There was no answer, so I left a message. I called Sarah Neamy. She assured me that the So?adora was not currently tied up at one of the club’s slips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne Rehmann. Rehmann Lake Place Real Estate. Did she have a dock with fresh water and electrical hookups? It seemed unlikely a real estate agent could afford it, given the lake’s exorbitant property values, although—taking prospects out on the water, I could see how that might be a powerful sales tool. Except she had been looking for Navarre, too. When I met her at Mrs. R’s house …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait a minute. The first time I saw Anne, after she startled me, she asked what was I doing and I said I was looking for Juan Carlos and she said he wasn’t there. How could she have known that? She couldn’t have known that unless … Maybe Anne already knew where he was. Maybe Navarre was at her place. Maybe he sent her to get some of the clothes and toilet gear that he left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC’mon, McKenzie, my inner voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe, I told myself. Think about it. It was Anne’s idea that Navarre occupy Mrs. R’s house in the first place—isn’t that what Mrs. R said? It’s possible they have a relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd wouldn’t that make Riley happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called. Anne’s voice mail said she would be out of the office until early in the afternoon. However, my call was important to her, and if I left a message, she would return it as soon as possible. I hung up and found Anne’s address on my GPS. Her office was in Deephaven. I could be there in twenty-one minutes if I skipped lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI skipped lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRehmann Lake Place Real Estate did have a dock on Lake Minnetonka that it shared with a half-dozen other businesses. It was narrow, made of treated redwood planks, and could accommodate three boats on either side. Only one boat was tied up there, though, an 18-foot speedboat with a 75-horsepower Mercury engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, well, I told myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office was located at one of the few spots on the lake where the road actually hugged the shoreline. The dock was on one side of the road, and a modest office park was on the other. I waited for traffic to clear and pulled into the parking lot. There were three two-story buildings arranged in a semicircle, all of them designed to resemble a Cape Cod cottage. Anne’s office was located on the top floor of the far-left cottage; there was an insurance office on the bottom. All of the cottages were painted white. It occurred to me that most of the structures I had seen on Lake Minnetonka were white, and I wondered if there was a lake association that dictated the color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if you wanted mauve? my inner voice asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-may-care-mac-mckenzie-11/page-33.html","bookId":2216,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:49 PM"}
