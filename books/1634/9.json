Could he have gotten in a lucky shot?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard a cough, and saw Sergeant Parker struggling to his feet, a smoking M6D pistol in his hand. Blood flowed from the gashes in his side, and he was unsteady on his feet, but he found the strength to spit on the Hunter’s fallen corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief took a covering position near the wounded sergeant. He gave him a brisk nod. “Not bad for a Marine. Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant grabbed a fallen assault rifle, slammed a fresh magazine into place, and grinned. “Any time, swabbie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis motion sensor showed more contacts inbound, but they were keeping their distance. Their failed assault on the bay must have left them disorganized. Good, he thought. We need all the time we can get. “Cortana,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe said, “how much longer before you get a door open?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it!” Cortana proclaimed exultantly. One of the heavy doors hissed open. “Everyone should move through the door now. I can’t guarantee that it won’t lock when it closes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Follow me!” he barked, then led the surviving Marines out of the shuttle bay and into the comparative safety of a corridor beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next fifteen minutes were like a slow-motion nightmare as the rescuers fought their way through a maze of corridors, up a series of narrow ramps, and onto the launch bay’s upper level. With Cortana’s guidance, they plunged back into the ship’s oppressive passageways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they proceeded through the bowels of the large warship, Cortana finally gave them good news: “The Captain’s signal is strong. He must be close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief frowned. This was taking too long. Every passing second made it that much less likely that any of the rescue party would be able to get off the Truth and Reconciliation alive, let alone with Captain Keyes. The ODSTs were good fighters, but they were slowing him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Sergeant Parker and said, “Hold your men here. I’ll be back soon—with the Captain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to protest, then nodded. “Just don’t tell Silva,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief ran from door to door until one of them opened to reveal a rectangular room lined with cells. It appeared that the translucent force fields served in place of bars. He dashed inside and called the Captain’s name, but received no answer. A quick check confirmed that, with the exception of one dead Marine, the detention center was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustrated, yet reassured by Cortana’s insistence that the CNI signal remained strong, the Spartan exited the room, entered the hall, and literally went door to door, searching for the correct hatch. Once he located it, the Master Chief almost wished he hadn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe portal slid open, a Grunt yelled something the Master Chief couldn’t understand, and a plasma beam lashed past the human’s helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief opened fire, heard a Marine yell from within one of the cells, “Good to see you, Chief!” and knew he was in the right place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA plasma beam appeared out of nowhere, hit the Spartan in the chest, and triggered the armor’s audible alarm. He ducked behind a support column, just in time to see an energy beam slice through the spot he had just vacated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scanned the room, looking for his assailant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis motion sensor showed faint trace movements, but he couldn’t spot their source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed, and he noticed a slight shimmer in the air, directly in front of him. He fired a sustained burst through the middle of it, and was rewarded with a loud howl. The Elite seemed to materialize out of thin air, made a grab for his own entrails, and managed to catch them before he died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strode to the access controls and, with Cortana’s help, killed the force fields. Captain Keyes stepped out of his cell, paused to scoop a Needler off the floor, and met the Chief’s eyes. “Coming here was reckless,” he said, his voice harsh. The Chief was about to explain his orders when Keyes’ expression warmed, and the Autumn ’s CO smiled. “Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartan nodded. “Any time, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you find your way out?” Keyes inquired doubtfully. “The corridors of this ship are like a maze.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It shouldn’t be too difficult,” the Master Chief replied. “All we have to do is follow the bodies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant “Cookie” Peterson put Echo 136 down a full klick from the Pillar of Autumn , looked out through the rain-spattered windscreen, and saw Echo 206 settle in approximately fifty meters away. It had been an uneventful flight, thanks in part to the weather, and the fact that the assault on the Truth and Reconciliation had probably served to distract the Covenant from what was going on elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeterson felt the ship shudder as the ramp hit the ground, waited for the Crew Chief to call “Clear!”, and fired the Pelican’s thrusters. The ship was extremely vulnerable while on the ground—and he was eager to return to the relative safety of Alpha Base. Then, assuming the Helljumpers got the job done, he and his crew would be back to transport some of the survivors and their loot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at Alpha Base, McKay watched Echo 136 wobble as a gust of wind hit the Pelican from the side, saw the ship gather speed, and start to climb out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcho 206 took off a few moments later and both ships were gone within a matter of seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer people knew what they were doing, so rather than make a pest of herself, McKay decided to wait and watch as the platoon leaders sorted things out. The officer felt the usual moments of fear, of self-doubt regarding her ability to accomplish the mission, but took comfort from something an instructor once told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take a look around,” the instructor had advised. “Ask yourself if there’s anyone else who is better qualified to do the job. Not in the entire galaxy, but right there, at that point in time. If the answer is ‘yes,’ ask them to accept command, and do everything you can to support them. If the answer is ‘no,’ which it will be ninety-nine percent of the time, then take your best shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s all any of us can do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was good advice, the kind that made a difference, and while it didn’t erase McKay’s fears, it certainly served to ease them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster Sergeant Lister and Second Lieutenant Oros seemed to materialize out of the darkness. Oros had a small, pixielike face which belied her innate toughness. If anything happened to McKay, Oros would take over, and if she bought the farm Lister would step in. The battalion had been short of officers before the shit hit the fan, and what with Lieutenant Dalu off playing Supply Officer, McKay was one Platoon Leader short of a full load. That’s why Lister had been called upon to fill the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Platoons one and two are ready to go,” Oros reported cheerfully. “Let us at ’em!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just want to raid the ship’s commissary,” McKay said, referring to the Platoon Leader’s well-known addiction to chocolate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, ma’am,” Oros replied innocently, “the Lieutenant lives only to serve the needs of humanity, the Marine Corps, and the Company Commander.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the normally stone-faced Lister had to laugh at that, and McKay felt her own spirits lift as well. “Okay, Lieutenant Oros, the human race would be grateful if you would put a couple of your best people on point and lead this outfit to the ship. I’ll ride your six with Sergeant Lister and the second platoon walking drag. Are you okay with that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Platoon Leaders nodded and melted into the night. McKay looked for the tail end of the first platoon, slid into line, and let her mind roam ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere, about one kilometer ahead, the Pillar of Autumn lay sprawled on the ground. The Covenant owned the ship for the moment—but McKay was determined to take her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to get off the Truth and Reconciliation . As Covenant troops ran hither and yon, the recently freed Marines armed themselves with alien weapons, then linked up with the rest of the rescue team. Keyes and Cortana convened a quick council of war. “While the Covenant had us locked up in here, I heard them talking about the ring world,” Keyes said, “and its destructive capabilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One moment, sir,” Cortana interrupted, “I’m accessing the Covenant battle net.” She paused, as her vastly powerful intrusion protocols sifted through the Covenant systems. Information systems seemed to be the one field where human technologies held their own against those of the Covenant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, she finished her sift of the alien data stream. “If I’m interpreting the data correctly, they believe Halo is some kind of weapon, one that possesses vast, unimaginable power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes nodded thoughtfully. “The aliens who interrogated me kept saying that ‘whoever controls Halo controls the fate of the universe.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now I see,” Cortana put in thoughtfully. “I intercepted a number of messages about a Covenant search team scouting for a control room. I thought they were looking for the bridge of the ship I damaged during the battle above the ring—but they must be looking for Halo’s control room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s bad news,” Keyes responded gravely. “If Halo is a weapon, and the Covenant gains control of it, they’ll use it against us. Who knows what power that would give them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chief, Cortana, I have a new mission for you. We need to beat the Covenant to Halo’s control room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No offense, sir,” the Master Chief replied, “but it might be best to finish this mission before we tackle another one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes offered a tired grin. “Good point, Chief. Marines! Let’s move!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should head back to the shuttle bay and call for evac,” Cortana said, “unless you’d like to walk home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No thanks,” Keyes said. “I’m Navy—we prefer to ride.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe journey out of the detention area and back to the launch bay was hairy but not quite as bad as the trip in. It wasn’t long before they all realized that they really could follow the trail of dead bodies back to the launch bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, some of the dead wore Marine green, which served to remind the Chief of how many humans the Covenant had murdered since the war had begun more than twenty-five years before. Somehow, in some way, the Covenant would be made to pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tactical situation was made even more risky by the Captain’s condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t complain, but the Spartan could tell that Keyes was sore and weak from the Covenant interrogation. It was a struggle for him to keep up with the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief signaled for the team to halt. Keyes—out of breath— favored him with a sour look, but seemed grateful for the breather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo minutes later, the Chief was about to signal the group to move forward when a trio of Grunts scuttled into view. Needler rounds bounced from the bulkhead and angled right for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shields took the brunt of it, and he returned fire, as did the rest of the group. Keyes blew one Grunt apart with a barrage of the explosive glassy needles. The rest were finished off by a combination of plasma rifle fire and the Chief’s assault rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s get moving,” the Spartan advised. He took point and moved down the corridor, bent low and ready for trouble. He’d barely gotten twenty meters down the passageway when more Covenant moved in—two Jackals and an Elite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enemy was getting closer, and more determined, the longer they remained. He finished off the Jackals with his last frag grenade, then pinned the Elite down with assault rifle fire. Keyes directed the Marines to fire on the alien’s flank, and he went down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to go , sir,” the Chief warned Keyes. “With respect, we’re moving too slowly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes nodded, and as a group they sprinted down the twisting passages, stealth abandoned. Finally, after numerous twists and turns, they reached the shuttle bay. The Spartan thought it was empty at first, until he noticed what appeared to be two light wands, floating in midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFresh from his encounter with the stealth Elite who had been stationed in the brig, the Master Chief knew better than to take chances. He drew his pistol, linked in the scope, and took careful aim. He squeezed the trigger several times and put half a clip into the area just to the right of the energy blade. A Covenant warrior faded into view and toppled off the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Marine yelled, “Watch it!” and “Cover the Captain!” as the second blade sliced the air into geometric shapes, and started to advance as if on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartan put three quick bursts into the second alien, hit his stealth generator, and the Elite was revealed. Fire poured in from all sides and the warrior went down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a blast of static as Cortana activated the MJOLNIR’s communication relays. “Cortana to Echo 419 . . . We have the Captain and need extraction on the double.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reply was nearly instantaneous. “Negative, Cortana! I have a flock of Banshees on my tail . . . and I can’t seem to shake them. You’ll be better off finding your own ride.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Acknowledged, Foehammer. Cortana out.” The radio clicked as Cortana switched from the suit’s radio to its external speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Air support is cut off, Captain. We’ll need to hold here until Foehammer can move in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Marine heard the interchange and, already traumatized by the time spent as a Covenant prisoner, began to lose it. “We’re trapped! We’re all gonna die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stow the bellyaching, soldier,” Keyes growled. “Cortana, if you and the Chief can get us into one of those Covenant dropships, I can fly us out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Captain,” the AI replied. “There’s a Covenant ship docked below.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief saw the nav indicator appear on his HUD, followed the arrow through a hatch, down a series of corridors, and out into the troopship bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the bay was well defended, and another firefight broke out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe situation was getting worse. The Chief slammed his last full clip into the MA5B and fired short, controlled bursts. Grunts and Jackals scattered and returned fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ammo counter dropped rapidly. A pair of Grunts fell under the Spartan’s hail of fire. Within seconds, the ammo counter readOO —empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed the rifle away and drew his pistol, and continued firing at the alien forces that had begun to regroup at the far side of the bay. “If we’re going,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe called out, “we need to go now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dropship was shaped like a giant U. It rode a grav field and bobbed slightly as some of the outside air swirled around it. As they approached it, Keyes said, “Everybody mount up! Let’s get on board!” and led the Marines through an open hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartan waited until everyone else had boarded and backed into the aircraft—just in time. He was down to a single round in his sidearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCortana said, “Give me a minute to interface with the ship’s controls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes shook his head. “No need. I’ll take this bird up myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain!” one of the Marines called. “Hunters!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief peered out through the nearest viewport and saw that the private was correct. Another pair of the massive aliens had arrived on the loading platform and were making for the ship. Their spines stood straight up, their fuel rod guns were swinging into position, and they were about to fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hang on!” Keyes said as he disengaged the ship’s gravity locks, brought the ship up over the edge of the platform, and pushed one of two joysticks forward. The twin hulls straddled a column, struck both Hunters with what appeared to be glancing blows, and withdrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven a glancing blow from a ship that weighs thousands of kilos proved to be a serious thing indeed. The dropship’s hull crushed the Hunters’ chest armor and forced it through their body cavities, killing both of them instantly. One corpse somehow managed to attach itself to one of the twin bows. It fell as the dropship cleared the Truth and Reconciliation ’s hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief leaned back against the metal wall. The Covenant craft’s troop bay was cramped, uncomfortable, and dimly lit—but it beat hell out of wandering through one of their cruisers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe braced himself as Keyes put the alien aircraft into a tight turn, and accelerated out into the surrounding darkness. He forced his shoulders to relax, and closed his eyes. The Captain had been rescued, and the Covenant had been put on notice: The humans were determined to be more than an annoyance—they were going to be a major pain in the ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn had just started to break when Zuka ’Zamamee and Yayap passed through the newly reinforced perimeter that surrounded the gravity lift, and were forced to wait while a crew of hardworking Grunts pulled a load of Covenant dead off the blood-splattered pad, before they could step onto the sticky surface and be pulled up into the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the Truth and Reconciliation ’s commanding officer believed that all of the surviving humans had left the ship, there was no way to be certain of that without a compartment-by-compartment check. The shipboard sensors read clear, but this raid had demonstrated beyond a doubt that the humans had learned how to trick Covenant detection gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitors could feel the tension as teams of grim-faced Elites, Jackals, and Grunts performed a deck-by-deck search of the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the pair made their way through the corridors to the lift that would carry them up to the command deck, ’Zamamee was shocked by the extent of the damage that he saw. Yes, there were long stretches of passageway that were completely untouched, but every now and then they would pass through a gore-streaked section of corridor, where bullet-pocked bulkheads, plasma- scorched decks, and half-slagged hatches told of a hard-fought running gun battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e’Zamamee stared in wonder as a grav cart loaded with mangled Jackals was towed past, blood dripping onto the deck behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, they made their way to the appropriate lift, and stepped out onto the command deck. The Elite expected the same level of security scrutiny as the last time he addressed the Prophet and the Council of Masters; no doubt he’d be dumped into the holding room for another interminable wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing could have been further from the truth. No sooner did ’Zamamee clear security than he and Yayap were whisked into the compartment where the Council of Masters had been convened during his last visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sign of the Prophet, or any of ’Zamamee’s immediate superiors—but the hardworking Soha ’Rolamee was there, along with a staff of lesser Elites. There was no mistaking the crisis atmosphere as reports flowed in, were evaluated, and used to create a variety of action plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e’Rolamee saw ’Zamamee and raised his hand by way of a greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome. Please sit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e’Zamamee complied. It didn’t occur to either one of the Elites to offer the same courtesy to Yayap, who continued to stand. The diminutive Grunt rocked back and forth, ill at ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” ’Rolamee inquired, “how much have you heard about the latest . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘incursion’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not much,” ’Zamamee was forced to admit. “The humans managed to board the ship via the gravity lift. That’s the extent of my knowledge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s correct in so far as it goes,” ’Rolamee agreed. “There is more. The ship’s security system recorded quite a bit of the action. Take a look at this .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elite touched a button and moving images popped into view and hovered in the air nearby. ’Zamamee found himself looking at two Grunts and a Jackal standing in a corridor. Suddenly, without warning, the same human he had encountered on the Pillar of Autumn —the large one with the unusual armor—stepped around the corner, spotted the Covenant troops, and opened fire on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grunts went down quickly, but the Jackal scored a hit, and ’Zamamee saw plasma splash the front of the human’s armor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, rather than fall as he should have, the apparition shot the Jackal in the head, stepped over one of the dead Grunts, and marched toward the camera. The image froze as ’Rolamee touched another control. ’Zamamee felt an almost unbelievable tightness in his chest. Would he have the courage to face the human again? He wasn’t sure—and that frightened him as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” ’Rolamee said, “there he is, the very human you warned us about. A dangerous individual who is largely responsible for the six-score casualties inflicted during this raid alone, not to mention the loss of a valuable prisoner, and six Shades which the enemy managed to steal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the humans?” ’Zamamee inquired. “How many of them were our warriors able to kill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The body count is incomplete,” the other Elite replied, “but the preliminary total is thirty-six.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e’Zamamee was shocked. The numbers should have been reversed. Would have been reversed had it not been for the alien in the special armor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will be pleased to learn that your original request has now been approved,” ’Rolamee continued. “We have preliminary reports from other strike groups that most of these unusual humans were killed in the last large engagement. This one is believed to be the last of his kind. Take whatever resources you need, find the human, and kill him. Do you have any questions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Excellency,” ’Zamamee said as he stood to leave. “None at all.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-flood-halo-2/page-9.html","bookId":1634,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:00 PM"}
