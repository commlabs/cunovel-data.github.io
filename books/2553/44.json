Romy was already there when Patrick arrived. With oversized sunglasses hiding her fading shiners, and a baseball cap covering her stitched-up scalp, she looked none the worse for wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick asked her how she was doing, and of course she told him fine. She was always \"fine.\" She said she\u0027d be even better when the stitches came out tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick rubbed his hands together. The old radiator running along the cinderblock wall only partially countered the afternoon chill. Neither Romy nor Zero seemed to feel it. Of course Zero, swathed head to toe as usual, would be the last to chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We heard from the Manassas attorneys,\" he told them. \"They want a meeting. Soon. I set it up for next Thursday, my office.\" He glanced at Romy. \"Can you make it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My only regret is that I couldn\u0027t add my own charges to the suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On what grounds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loss of services and consortium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" she said, pointing a finger at him, \"are incorrigible.\" She tried to look stern but he could see she was fighting a smile. She turned to Zero. \"Did you have any luck with my photo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite an interesting picture,\" Zero said, handing Romy an eight-by-ten color print.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dim light made it hard to see details. Patrick craned his head over Romy\u0027s shoulder for a better look, but found himself gazing at the nape of her neck instead, focusing on the gentle wisps of fine dark hair trailing along the curve. He leaned closer, drinking her scent, barely resisting the urge to press his lips against the soft white skin...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s him, all right,\" Romy said. \"Does he have a name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It took me a while to trace him but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ!\" Patrick said. He pointed to a spot at the rear end of the ceiling. \"Who\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d glanced up and caught a flicker of movement above and beyond Zero, at the point where a ladder embedded in the rear wall of the garage ran up to a square opening in the ceiling. He could swear he\u0027d seen a pair of eyes peering out at them from within that darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero didn\u0027t turn to look. \"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There! In that opening! I saw someone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opening was empty now, but he knew what he\u0027d seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you did,\" Zero told him. \"But it was no one you need concern yourself with at the moment. Now - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute, wait a minute,\" Patrick said, walking over to the ladder. \"If someone\u0027s up there listening, I want to know who it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone\u0027s up thereguarding ,\" Romy said. \"Please, Patrick. Let it go for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t like letting it go, but short of climbing up there and entering that patch of night - something he had no inclination to do - Patrick didn\u0027t see that he had much choice. He\u0027d come to trust Zero, and if he said someone was guarding them, then Patrick would buy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said, turning back. \"Where were we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero said, \"The man in the photo looked Japanese so I scanned him into a computer and had it comb the databases of the Japanese government and major Japanese corporations.\" He held up a printout of a full-face photo of someone who bore a passing resemblance to the man in Romy\u0027s shot. \"This came back with a sixty-three percent confidence match.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s him,\" Romy said without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure? The computer wasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t care. I saw him live and that\u0027s him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Patrick said. \"Now...who him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yoshi Hirai, Ph.D.,\" Zero said. \"Top recombinant man for Arata-jinruien Corporation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is...?\" Patrick had never heard of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A division of Kaze Group and one of SimGen\u0027s potential competitors. They want to raise their own sims but so far haven\u0027t met with any success. They even started a dummy corporation to pirate the sim genome but were caught. They\u0027ll do anything to cut into the sim market.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was a creep like that doing at the fire?\" Romy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what I\u0027d like to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick said, \"Could the SLA be Japanese? But why hijack sims when they can lease as many as they want? And why these globulin farm sims?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind why,\" Romy said. \"How about where? Where are those sims? That\u0027s my concern. I hope they don\u0027t end up like their farmers, or get spirited off to Japan. We\u0027ll never find them.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-44.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
