Elle I’m sorry, and I wish you would have told me about the cancer, but now is not the time to talk about this,” she said as she pushed my hair out of my face. “Get some sleep, I’m not going anywhere, and if you’re up to it, we’ll talk when you wake up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t say a word; I couldn’t. I just shook my head and drifted off into a deep sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up and looked around the room. I sat on the edge of the bed as Peyton walked in. “Finally, you’re awake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yawned and ran my hand through my hair, “How long have I been sleeping?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hands on her h*ps and twisted her face as if she didn’t want to tell me, “2 days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened, “What? 2 days? Peyton, why didn’t you wake me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came over and sat on the edge of the bed, “Sweetie you obviously needed it. When I found you on that bathroom floor, god Elle, I thought you...” She turned her head and looked at the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lightly took her hand, “I know Peyton and I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laid her head on my shoulder, “The only thing that matters is you didn’t. You’re awake now, and you need to eat. Henry made the most delicious chicken noodle soup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at her with a frown, “Who’s Henry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head and smiled, “Dr. Hottie, he’s been here helping me out while you’ve been sleeping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, “Seriously Peyton, you told him everything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah Elle, I did; we’re seeing each other now, and I needed someone to talk to, besides, he’s been the biggest help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and felt light-headed. Peyton grabbed my arm, “You need to eat Elle; it’s been 2 days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe helped me to the kitchen. All I could smell is the aroma of the chicken soup, and it was amazing. I didn’t feel like eating, but my body told me I had to. I sat at the table as Peyton set the bowl of soup in front of me, “Eat up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s my phone?” I asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s over on your desk, I charged it for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over and pulled it out of the charger and turned it on. I patiently waited for it to turn on so I could see if Connor texted me or called. There was nothing, not even a voicemail. I should have started crying, but there were no tears left in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton sat across from me as I slowly ate the soup Henry had made. “Ellery, why didn’t you tell me about your cancer coming back? I thought we were best friends?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t look at her because I was ashamed. I knew my secret would hurt the people close to me. I’ve already lived it, and I couldn’t go through it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peyton, I’m so sorry I didn’t tell you. I wanted to tell you, believe me, but I couldn’t bear to stand in front of you and see the look on your face after I told you. It was bad enough I had to tell Kyle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached over and touched my hand that was resting on the table. “Elle, I would have stood by you and supported you. I seriously cannot understand why you wouldn’t tell me. I get that you were scared, and you didn’t want me to worry, but what were you going to do? Just go off and die alone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up from the table and sat on the couch, hugging my knees to my chest and burying my head in my hands. “My life has been made up of hurting people Peyton. I need you to understand that. After my mother died, I was left as a reminder of her to my dad, and that hurt him so much, he had to drink himself to death just to cope. Then there was my suicide attempt and cancer.” I could feel the tears starting to spring back to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton sat down beside me and put her arm around me pulling me closer. “I do understand where you’re coming from Elle, but do you want to know what I think? I think you made the wrong decision not to tell anyone, especially Connor, and now you have to deal with the consequences. I’m sorry; I don’t mean to kick you while you’re down, but you not telling anyone has caused more pain than if you would have been honest from the beginning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned my head on her shoulder, “I’m sorry Peyton; I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can and have forgiven you Elle, but you have to promise me that you’ll call the doctor and start treatments right away because…” Peyton started to cry. “I can’t imagine my life without you in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned towards her and hugged her tight. “I’m sorry, and I promise to get help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton got up to clean up the kitchen as I went to take a shower. I got dressed and put on my coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, where do you think you’re going?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a couple of things I need to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think it’s a good idea that you go anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lightly laughed, “Are you my mother now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but I do worry about you and I want you to be safe, Oh god I sound like a mother,” she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t be gone long, I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked out the door and headed down the crowded streets. You would think that the coldness of the air would chill my bones, but every part of my existence was already numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over to the next block to a church I’ve admired since I moved to New York. I needed to seek solace in the house of God. I had unanswered questions and unfinished business. I reached the steps of the church and pulled open the heavy door that led inside. I have wanted to visit this church since I moved here, but Kyle wasn’t a church fan and wouldn’t go with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around at the beauty of the stained glass that overtook the windows and many rows of wooden pews that stood before me. I knelt at one of the pews and said hello to God before I sat down. I stared at the altar as memories of my childhood flashed before my eyes; memories of me sitting in a pew just like this one, in the front row, staring at the large wooden casket that held my mother. My father holding his face crying as strangers all around gave me their sympathetic looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single tear fell from my eye. As I wiped it away, a man in a white robe sat down next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good day my child, is there anything I can do for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello father, I’m just here because I have some unfinished business with god.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a surprised look, “Unfinished business, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down and laced my fingers together, “Yeah, I need some questions answered about my life, and I was hoping to get them here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest sat and listened to me as I told him about my life. I confided in him about my mother and father’s death, my past and recurrent battle with cancer and how I hid the truth from Connor. I didn’t tell him about my suicide attempt, but it wasn’t too hard to hide when I lifted my hand and pushed my hair behind my ear. The priest looked at me and lightly touched my wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a survivor and god gave you a second chance at life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “I know that father, but what good is that second chance if I’m not going to live a full long life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe patted my hand softly, “You don’t know you won’t live a full long life, and it doesn’t matter what you went through before; what matters is that you survived it. God won’t give you more than you can handle. He knows you’re strong enough to handle this again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down and bit my lip. My emotions were all over the place. “The chemo was awful,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chemo isn’t supposed to be fun, but you survived and it made you stronger. What you need to understand is that you refusing to get treatments are just another form of suicide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at his face; my eyes stinging with tears. He was right. I never thought that what I was doing was a form of suicide. He took my hand and patted it once more as he smiled and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was walking down the street, not knowing where exactly I was going, thinking about my conversation with the priest when I stopped in front of Pizzapopolous. My stomach tied itself in knots as I stared through the window remembering how I made Connor eat pizza with his hands. I lightly smiled as I stepped into the Starbucks that was next door. The aroma of coffee was making me salivate as I ordered a mocha latte. I took my latte and sat at a table towards the back. I looked at the time on my phone. It was already 2 pm. I dialed the phone number that kept consistently calling me for the past 4 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good afternoon, Dr. Taub’s office, how may I help you?” The perky voice on the other end spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi this is Ellery Lane; I need to make an appointment to see Dr. Taub”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh ok, well the first appointment I have is November 5th at 3 pm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, “Do you realize that it’s September 30th and November 5th is far away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, but that is his first available appointment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was now starting to get agitated, “May I please talk to Dr. Taub?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, but he’s with a patient right now; may I take a message for him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again I sighed, “Yes, tell him Ellery Lane called and I’m ready. He’ll know what I mean.” I hung up before she could say anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my phone on the table as I looked up and had a near heart attack when I saw Connor walk through the door. He looked rough, like he hadn’t slept in days. He wore dark jeans and my favorite grey t-shirt that defined his muscular chest. A few days’ worth of stubble sat upon his face. His hair was tousled in a different way, but he still looked perfect and hot as hell. I panicked, and I didn’t want him to see me, so I did the only thing I could; I hid under the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was packed with people conversing and studying, so the chances of anyone seeing me under the table were slim; with the exception of Dr. Hottie who knelt down and peered his head under the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ok down there, Ellery?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved my hand to shoo him out-of-the-way so I could see when Connor left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m hiding from him,” I mumbled pointing to the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got this,” he winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry stood up, walked over to Connor and shook his hand. He kept him talking until Connor got his coffee and then patted him on the shoulder as he walked out the door. I got up off the floor and sat back in my chair. Henry walked over and sat across from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, I owe you one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and took a sip of his coffee, “Nah, now we’re even.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cocked my head to the side and raised one eyebrow, “What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lightly laughed, “If you wouldn’t have needed stitches that day you came to the hospital, I never would have met Peyton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pursed my lips together, “You really like her don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grin on his face was priceless. “I do, and I know it’s soon, but I’m going to ask her to move in with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know she’s crazy about you; I’m glad my injury brought you two together,” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned over the table and brought his hand above my eye. “I must say I did an exceptional job with those stitches,” he smiled. “I have to go; I have rounds at the hospital. I’ll talk you soon Ellery.” I waved goodbye as he walked out the door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-black-forever-1/page-19.html","bookId":1821,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:13:11 PM"}
