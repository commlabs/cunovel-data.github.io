There was a clear Trials Division aura emanating from his body, as well as superbly concealed killing intent. His perception, hiding, and speed seemed to be equally matched with Su’s. Su didn’t dare loosen his targeting on him, as this type of fella was the most deadly in a dark night like this one. Even for someone like Su, the slightest carelessness could result in his own death under this man’s hands. Now that he already locked onto this person, how could he let his target escape so easily? He was the most dangerous one!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, only when he was about to chase into the prairie did an unsuppressable chilliness rise within Su’s heart! The other party’s goal was precisely to lead him away from the vehicle fleet! If he chased for another hour, then Su definitely had the confidence of killing this fella, but an hour’s worth of time was already enough for too, too many things to happen!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu immediately turned around, running back frantically at full speed!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThus, he encountered the scene from just now.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe bearded man’s luck really was quite bad. He could avoid an ordinary sniper rifle, but there was no way he could escape the electromagnetic rifle with three times the shooting speed of a sniper rifle. Moreover, with the existence of the panoramic view, even if Su was running at a crazy speed, his hit rate would still be shockingly high. For a static and large target like the bearded male, the hit rate was pretty much 100%.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSousa’s body leaned forward. His hands had unknowingly when held curved blades, and he thrusted them at Su’s flank with full force! From that shot alone, Sousa already realized that Su was definitely not the Perception Domain piece of trash he thought he was. Just from the crazy speed Su displayed alone, he could tell that Su was an extremely terrifying opponent!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThat was why Sousa already decided to use all of his strength!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe twin curved blades entered Su’s abdomen at the same time, and then the blades’ tips came out of Su’s back!

When it entered Sousa’s mouth, it immediately turned into several dozen blood stingers, and then they embedded themselves deep into the tissues of Sousa’s body! The blood at the very front moved down Sousa’s throat at an inconceivable speed. The very front formed several dozen sharp claws, and like strange blood bugs, they clawed and tore at the throat walls, forcefully tearing into the depths of Sousa’s body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu took a step back, removing himself from the curved blades.

His eyes revealed a look of perplexity. He slowly knelt down onto the ground, and then his body suddenly twitched! Inside his body, that blast of blood finally displayed its most sinister side, stabbing out hundreds to thousands of long blood stingers, instantly crushing his internal organs, bones, and brain into pieces. Then, they produced several tens of sharp fang-covered mouths before frantically devouring the surrounding ruined bloody paste!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHenry sent another hateful kick at Madeline.
