It was a modified warrior\u0027s crouch, one that let a Sangheili rest with his legs beneath him, but in a manner that allowed one to leap up and forward in the blink of an eye. He\u0027d spent long hours practicing with fellow students in the sandy training courtyards of the Vadam keep, learning the pose; now it came as second nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe short, shuffling Unggoy that guarded them carried a plasma rifle too large for its frame, and Thel caught the trace whiffs of methane that leaked from around the guard\u0027s mouthpiece. The Unggoy -- an annoying lesser being -- was careful to remain as close to the far wall and as far away from the bars as possible, rightly fearing the Sangheili\u0027s long limbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that didn\u0027t stop the Unggoy from taunting them and puffing itself up. \"Look, you mighty Sangheili. Look you not so mighty now, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel growled from somewhere deep in the back of his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ignore the Unggoy, yes. Throw us to die at your feet. Don\u0027t care when other races take advantage of poor Unggoy. No more. Wait until you are taken to Metisette, then see you our might.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel looked over at Zhar. \"Might?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unggoy might is a contradiction in terms,\" Zhar grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So think you,\" the Unggoy hissed. \"Just you wait. Just you wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this Metisette? That is the second time I have heard that word,\" Zhar observed. \"The Kig-Yar who locked us in here mentioned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel took a deep breath. \"It is the human name for a world around the great gas giant.\" His calves burned somewhat, now. But he waited still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust under his feet, hidden by his crouch, was the long spear of metal. Using the edge of the bedframe, and their own strength, Thel and Saal had taken turns sharpening it further. They\u0027d also cut rudimentary barbs into the spike by shaving out sections of the crude weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was a case of choosing the best moment. Thel didn\u0027t want to waste their one attempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis cell, they had determined, was in one of the far edges of what Zhar had heard the humans call \"the Rubble.\" Though the Kig-Yar and humans were working together, this was mainly a human creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Thel\u0027s thoughts meandered further, the walls shook and debris began breaking loose. The bars of metal holding them in started bowing and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003escreeching as they were tortured into slightly different shapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLights flickered, and Thel still remained absolutely still, like a helioskrill imitating a rock back on the home planet, just watching for a meal to unsuspectingly walk by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the cell plunged into darkness, Thel felt his weight lift off as the antigravity generators failed. He picked up the spear, the end of it tied off to several lengths of tightly braided sheet strips, and listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear the Unggoy\u0027s panicked breathing and the hiss of the methane tank as he struggled in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spear flew out from between the bars and made a wet, crunching sound as it struck the Unggoy. Thel gave the impromptu rope a quick yank, and the screaming Unggoy was pulled right into the bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhar and Saal waited there. Their long arms snapped the Unggoy\u0027s neck and quieted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaal retrieved the plasma rifle as Thel pulled the makeshift spear out of the Unggoy and shoved the body away. Bright blue blood hung in the space, expanding into large globules as the Unggoy slowly spun in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the lock,\" Thel ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter bracing himself against the far wall, Saal fired at the lock three times. Plasma blew the device away into a cloud of molten metal rivulets that flew across the room, sizzling against Unggoy skin and slapping into the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four Sangheili pushed the cell door open and floated out as the lights flickered back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hit the floor, along with dried metal beads and the Unggoy\u0027s limp body. Blood splattered the floor a split second later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhar lopked around the room, blinking as his eyes adapted to the overly bright human lights. \"They brought us in over there.\" He jutted his mouthpieces in the direction of a corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel moved with the spear, taking point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kig-Yar still here would deeply regret jailing him, he thought, as he turned a comer and spotted one of them standing by an airlock door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel sprinted the length of corridor, caring little for stealth. The Kig-Yar spun, a protective shield flaring up by his forearm, but Thel struck so hard the Kig-Yar\u0027s head smashed into the bulkhead behind him, and he drooped to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaal peered in through the window briefly, then pulled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More inside,\" Saal grunted. \"But they seem preoccupied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel looked at the door controls, regretting his impulse to kill the Kig-Yar guard so quickly. The collection of buttons that the humans used to control things stumped him. But he managed to tap a large green button that cycled the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kig-Yar all turned and found themselves facing Saal with the plasma rifle aimed right at their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember us?\" Saal said, and pulled the trigger. Long Kig-Yar faces exploded as Saal calmly shot all four in the head over their screeches of fear and rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that,\" Veer said, stepping over the bodies and closing the airlock door of the ship behind them, \"is why you never imprison Sangheili; you execute them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls and seats were splattered with bright purple blood. Thel looked around with satisfaction. \"That is a good start,\" he said, a pleased rumble in the back of his voice. \"Throw the bodies out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was time to find out what the Kig-Yar, humans, and Unggoy were up to.

Jai bolted for the cockpit, where Mike was already strapping in. In the far distance a bright flash receded, a glowing ball of excited trace gases in the vacuum of space that had been disturbed by an explosion\u0027s shock wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a Shiva,\" Mike said, reading off the monitors. \"Probably three, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nukes?

The AI smiled and shrugged. \"Call it a hunch,\" she told the team of Spartans.
