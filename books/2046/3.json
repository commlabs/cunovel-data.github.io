So be it. I understand that you\u0027ve put a lot into this agency. I can give you forty cents on the dollar, but you\u0027ll have to take a note. I\u0027m a little cash poor since Katie made me put that trophy room on the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam looked down from the deer head. \"Aaron, I didn\u0027t hire an Indian to attack Jim Cable. I still had half of the deal wrapped up with Cochran, which would have put me in the door at any time in the future to close Cable. I wouldn\u0027t have jeopardized that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAaron took two hand mirrors out of his desk drawer and began to juxtapose them to get a glimpse of the back of his head. Sam was used to this\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it was Aaron\u0027s hourly balding check. \"Cochran\u0027s secretary saw the Indian get out of your car,\" Aaron said matter-of-factly. Then, looking back to the mirrors, he said, \"I\u0027ve been mixing Minoxidil with a little Retin A and that stuff the Man from U.N.C.L.E. sells on TV. Do you think it\u0027s working?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam thought of the feather on the car seat. He was sure he\u0027d locked the car; there was no way the Indian could get in without setting off the alarm. \"I don\u0027t care what anyone saw, I didn\u0027t hire the fucking Indian to attack Cable and I can\u0027t believe you bought their story without asking me.\" The anger felt good. It cleared his head a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAaron put the mirrors down on the desk and smiled. \"I didn\u0027t buy it, Sam. But if it was true you can\u0027t blame me for taking a shot at your shares.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You greedy little fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam.\" Aaron lowered his voice and took his \u0026amp;laquo;fatherly\u0026amp;raquo; tone. \"Samuel.\" A little wink. \"Sammy, hasn\u0027t my greed always been in your best interest? I\u0027m just trying to keep you sharp, son. Would you have had any respect for me if I hadn\u0027t tried to make the best of a bad situation? That\u0027s the first thing I taught you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know any Indian. It didn\u0027t happen, Aaron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you say it didn\u0027t, it didn\u0027t. You\u0027ve always been straight with me. I don\u0027t even remember the time you cut all the cords off those smoke alarms we were selling because that lady wanted cordless models.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me to do that! I was only seventeen years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, well, how was I to know she smoked in bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Aaron, I\u0027ll find out what happened at Motion Marine and take care of it first thing in the morning. If they call back while I\u0027m out, try not to sign a confession for me, okay? I\u0027ve had an incredibly shitty day and I\u0027ve got to meet someone on upper State Street in a few minutes, so if that\u0027s all...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really like the new head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally Sam would have lied, but with so many questions filling his head his highly developed lying center seemed to have shut down. \"It sucks, Aaron. It sucks and I think you should sue the Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" He walked out as Aaron was snatching up his hand mirrors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriella was just hanging up the phone when Sam walked in. \"That was the security director from your condominium association, Mr. Hunter. He\u0027d like to talk to you right away. The association is holding an emergency meeting tonight to discuss what they are going to do about your dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have a dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was very upset. I have his number, but he insisted upon seeing you in person before the\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;she checked her notepad\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"\u0027lynch mob gets hold of you. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call him back and tell him that I don\u0027t have a dog. Dogs aren\u0027t allowed in the complex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He mentioned that, sir. That seems to be the problem. He said that your dog was on your back patio howling and refused to let anyone get near it and if you didn\u0027t get up there he would have to call the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Sam could think was Not today. He said, \"All right, call them and tell them I\u0027m on my way. And call the garage down the street and have them come up and fix the flat tire on that orange Datsun out front. Have them bill it to my card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a three o\u0027clock appointment with Mrs. Wittingham.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cancel it.\" Sam started out of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Hunter, this is a death claim. Mr. Wittingham passed away last week and she wants you to help fill out the papers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriella, let me clue you in on something: once the client is dead we can afford to be a little lax on the service. The chance of repeat business is, well, unlikely. So reschedule the appointment or handle it yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But sir, I\u0027ve never done a death claim before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s easy: feel for a pulse; if there isn\u0027t one, give them the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not amused, Mr. Hunter. I try to maintain a businesslike manner around here and you continually undermine me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Handle it, Gabriella. Call the garage. I have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only five minutes from Sam\u0027s office to his condo in the Cliffs, a three-hundred-unit complex on Santa Barbara\u0027s mesa. From Sam\u0027s back deck he could look across the city to the Santa Lucia Mountains and from his bedroom window he could see the ocean. Sam had once rented the apartment, but when the Cliffs went condo ten years before he optioned to buy it. Since then the value of his apartment had increased six hundred percent. The complex offered three swimming pools, saunas, a weight room, and tennis courts. It was restricted to adults without children or dogs, but cats were allowed. When Sam first moved in, the Cliffs had a reputation as a swinging singles complex, a party mecca. Now, after the rise in real estate prices and the death of the middle class, most of the residents were retirees or wealthy professional couples, and the cooperative agreement they all signed set strict limitations on noise and numbers of visitors. A team of security guards patrolled the complex in golf carts twenty-four hours a day under the supervision of a hard-nosed ex-burglar named Josh Spagnola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam parked the Mercedes by Spagnola\u0027s office in the back of the Cliffs\u0027 clubhouse, which, with its terra-cotta courtyards, stucco arches, and wrought-iron gates, looked more like the casa grande of a Spanish hacienda than a meeting place for condo dwellers. The door to the office was open and Sam walked in to find Spagnola shouting into the phone. Sam had never heard the wiry security chief shout. This was a bad sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I can\u0027t just shoot the damn dog! The owner is on the way, but I\u0027m not going into his townhouse and shooting his dog, rules or no rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam noticed that even in anger Spagnola remembered to use the word townhouse to refer to the apartment. No one wanted to pay a half-million dollars for an apartment; a townhouse was another thing. People were touchy about how one referred to their homes. When Sam was selling to people who lived in trailers he always referred to them as mobile estates. The term added a certain structural integrity; you never heard on the news of a tornado touching down and ripping the shit out of a park full of mobile estates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am listening, Dr. Epstein,\" Spagnola continued. \"But you don\u0027t seem to understand my position on you missing your nap. I don\u0027t give a desiccated damn. I don\u0027t give a reconstituted damn. I don\u0027t give a creamed damn on toast. I don\u0027t give a damn. I\u0027m not entering Mr. Hunter\u0027s home until he arrives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpagnola looked up and gestured for Sam to sit. Then he grinned, mimed a mimic of the caller he was listening to, looked bored, feigned falling asleep, gestured the international sign language for being jerked off, then said, \"Is that so, Doctor? Well, as far as I know I have no superiors since the Crucifixion, so give it your best shot.\" He slammed down the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam said, \"Got something on Dr. Epstein?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpagnola smiled. \"He\u0027s porking the Cliffs\u0027 highly ethical Monday-Wednesday-Friday masseuse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody\u0027s porking her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, everybody\u0027s porking the Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday masseuse. Monday-Wednesday-Friday is very exclusive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And highly ethical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Says so in the brochure.\" Spagnola grinned, then casually picked up a legal pad from his desk and looked it over. \"Samuel, my friend, your puppy has kept me on the phone with charming folks like Epstein all day. Shall I read you the log?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about, Josh. I don\u0027t have a dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you will want to notify security about the large canine that is currently on your back deck disturbing Dr. Epstein\u0027s nap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not kidding, Josh. If there\u0027s a dog on my deck I don\u0027t know anything about it.\" Sam suddenly remembered that he\u0027d left the sliding door to the deck open. \"Christ!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the door is open. I\u0027ve told you about that before, it\u0027s an invitation to burglars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That deck is twenty feet off the ground. How did a dog get up there? How did it get in my apartment without setting off the alarm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wondering that same thing. If it isn\u0027t your dog, how did it get up there? It looks bad. The other association members are having an emergency meeting tonight to discuss the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t a problem. Let\u0027s just go get the damn dog and take it to the pound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, let\u0027s. I\u0027ll read the log to you while we walk over.\" Spagnola rose, picked up the legal pad, and led Sam out the door, then paused, locked the office, and set the alarm. \"Can\u0027t trust anyone,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked brick paths shaded with arbors of pink and red bougainvillea while Spagnola read. \"Nine A.M.: Mrs. Feldstein calls to report that a wolf has just urinated on her wisterias. I ignored that one. Nine oh-five: Mrs. Feldstein reports that the wolf is forcibly having sex with her Persian cat. I went on that call myself, just to see it. Nine ten: Mrs. Feldstein reports that the wolf ate the Persian after having his way with it. There was some blood and fur on her walk when I got there, but no wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this thing a wolf?\" Sam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027ve only seen it from below your deck. It has the right coloring for a coyote, but it\u0027s too damn big. Naw, it can\u0027t be a wolf. You sure you didn\u0027t bring home some babe last night who forgot to tell you that she had a furry friend in the car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Josh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Ten fourteen: Mrs. Narada reports that her cat has been attacked by a large dog. Now I send all the boys out looking, but they don\u0027t find anything until eleven. Then one of them calls in that a big dog has just bitten holes in the tires on his golf cart and run off. Eleven thirty: Dr. Epstein makes his first lost-nap call: dog howling. Eleven thirty-five: Mrs. Norcross is putting the kids out on the deck for some burgers when a big dog jumps over the rail, eats the burgers, growls at the kids, runs off. First mention of lawsuit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kids? We\u0027ve got her right there,\" Sam said. \"Kids aren\u0027t allowed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her grandkids are visiting from Michigan. She filed the proper papers.\" Spagnola took a deep breath and started into the log again. \"Eleven forty-one: large dog craps in Dr. Yamata\u0027s Aston Martin. Twelve oh-three: dog eats two, count \u0027em, two of Mrs. Wittingham\u0027s Siamese cats. She just lost her husband last week; this sort of put her over the edge. We had to call Dr. Yamata in off the putting green to give her a sedative. The personal-injury lawyer in the unit next to hers was home for lunch and he came over to help. He was talking class action then, and we didn\u0027t even know who owned the dog yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpagnola ignored Sam. \"From twelve thirty to one we had mass sightings and frequent urinations\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I won\u0027t bore you with details\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;then one of my guys spotted the dog and followed it to your building, where it disappeared for a minute and reappeared on your deck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Disappeared? Josh, aren\u0027t you screening these guards for drug use?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he meant that he lost sight of it. Anyway, it\u0027s been on your deck for a couple of hours and all the residents are convinced that it\u0027s your dog. They want to boot you out of the complex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can\u0027t do that. I own the place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Technically, Sam, they can. You own shares in the whole complex, and in the event of a two-thirds vote by the residents they can force you to sell your shares for what you paid for them. It\u0027s in the agreement you signed. I looked it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were about a hundred yards from Sam\u0027s building and Sam could now hear the howling. \"That apartment\u0027s worth five times what I paid for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is on the open market, but not to the other residents. Don\u0027t worry about it, Sam. It\u0027s not your dog, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside Sam\u0027s front door thirty of his neighbors were waiting, talking in heated tones, and glancing around. \"There he is!\" one shouted, pointing toward Sam and Spagnola. For a moment Sam was grateful that Spagnola was at his side, and at Spagnola\u0027s side was a.38 special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ex-burglar leaned to Sam and whispered, \"Don\u0027t say anything. Not a word. This could get ugly\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I see at least two lawyers in that bunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpagnola raised his hands and walked toward the crowd. \"Folks, I know you\u0027re angry, but we need Mr. Hunter alive if we\u0027re going to deal with the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Sam said under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No charge,\" Spagnola said. \"It never occurred to them to kill you. Now they\u0027ll be embarrassed and go home. Lynchings are so politically incorrect, you know.\" Spagnola stopped and waited. Sam stayed beside him. As if the security chief had choreographed it, the people in front of Sam\u0027s door began to look around, avoiding eye contact with one another, then shuffled off, heads down, in different directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re amazing,\" Sam said to Spagnola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope, it\u0027s just that for a lot of years my living depended on the predictability of the professional class. Now it depends on the predictability of the criminal class. Same skills, less risk. You want me to go in first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, you wait here.\" Spagnola unlocked the door and palmed it open slowly. When the door was open just enough for him to pass, the thin security guard snaked through the opening and closed the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam noticed that the howling had stopped. He put his ear to the door and listened, forgetting for a moment that he had installed a soundproof fire door. A few minutes passed before the latch clicked and Spagnola poked his head out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Sam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How attached are you to that leather sofa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s insured,\" Sam said. \"Why, did he tear it up? Is he in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in here, but I was wondering if you had some sort of\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;well\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;sentimental attachment to the sofa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Why? What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpagnola threw the door open and stepped out of the way. Sam looked through the foyer into the sunken living room, where a large tan dog had his teeth dug into the arm of the leather sofa and was humping away on it like a furry jackhammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh, shoot that animal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam, I know how you feel. You go through life thinking that you\u0027re the only one, then you walk in on something like this\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it\u0027s a blow to the ego.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just shoot the damn dog, Josh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t do it. California law clearly states that a firearm may only be discharged in city limits in cases of imminent physical danger. Doesn\u0027t say a word about protecting the honor of someone\u0027s couch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam ran down the steps into the living room, but as he approached the dog turned and growled at him. The dog laid its ears back against its head, narrowed its golden eyes, and, still growling, began to back Sam into the corner of the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh! Does this qualify as imminent physical danger? Please say yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting there,\" Spagnola said, very calmly, as he drew his weapon. \"Don\u0027t let him see you\u0027re afraid, Sam. Dogs can sense fear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a dog, this is a coyote. This is a wild animal, Josh.\" Sam was flattened against the fifty-two-inch screen of his television and was still pushing so that the television was tilting back, ready to fall. He could smell a foul, musky odor coming off the animal. \"Shoot it, please. Now, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet, Sam. I\u0027m aiming. You can\u0027t shoot them in the head. They need that to see if it\u0027s rabid. Coyotes aren\u0027t normally aggressive. I saw it on PBS.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one didn\u0027t see the program, Josh. Shoot him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might take two shots to drop him. If he leaps, cover your throat until I get the second one into him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpagnola fired and the TV shattered behind Sam. The coyote stood its ground unaffected. Sam backpedaled over the destroyed television as Spagnola fired again, taking out a vase on the mantel. The coyote looked at Spagnola quizzically. The third shot shattered the sliding glass door, the fourth and fifth punctured a stereo speaker, and the sixth ricocheted off the fireplace and out over the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Spagnola\u0027s revolver clicked on an empty chamber he turned and bolted out the front door. Sam climbed off the broken television and braced for the coyote\u0027s attack. His ears rang with residual gunfire but he could hear laughing from across the room. The coyote was gone, but sitting on his couch, dressed in black buckskins trimmed with red feathers, was the Indian, his head thrown back in laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Sam shouted. \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant the Indian leapt up and ran through the shattered glass door onto the deck. He looked over his shoulder and grinned at Sam before vaulting over the railing and dropping out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam ran to the deck and looked over the rail. The Indian was gone, but he could hear his cackling laugh echoing down the canyon into town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam stumbled back from the rail and into the house, where he sat down on the couch and cradled his head in his hands. There had to be an explanation. Someone was screwing with his life. He riffled through his past as far as he would allow himself, looking for enemies he might have made. They were there\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;competing salesmen, angry customers, angrier women\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dotting his life like dandelions on a lawn, but none would have gone to such elaborate measures to cause him trouble. In an honest assessment of himself he realized that he had never really been passionate enough about anything to really make that big a difference to anyone, good or bad. Since he\u0027d run from the reservation he couldn\u0027t afford the high profile of passionate behavior. Still, there had to be an answer somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam thought about prayer, then faith, then remembered something that lay tucked away in the back of his sock drawer. He ran up the stairs to his bedroom and threw open the drawer. He removed a small buckskin bundle and untied the thong that held it together. Objects he had not seen in twenty years\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;teeth, claws, fur, and sweet grass braids\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;spilled out on the dresser. Among them lay a red feather that he had never seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam looked at the coyote medicine and began to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoyote Makes the World\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long time ago there was water everywhere. Old Man Coyote looked around and said, \"Hey, we need some land.\" It was his gift from the Great Spirit that he could command all of the animals, which were called the Without Fires Clan, so he called four ducks to help him find land. He ordered each of the ducks to dive under the water and find some mud. The first three returned with nothing, but the fourth duck, because four is the sacred number and that is the way things go in these stories, returned with some mud from the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Swell,\" said Old Man Coyote. \"Now I will make some land.\" He made the mountains and the rivers, the prairies and the deserts, the plants and the animals. Then he said, \"Guess I\u0027ll make some people now, so there will be someone to tell stories about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the mud he made some tall and beautiful people. Old Man Coyote liked them very much. \"I will call them Absarokee, which means \u0027Children of the Large-Beaked Bird. Someday some dumb white guys will come here and get the translation all wrong and call them Crow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they going to eat?\" one of the ducks asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have no feathers or fur. What will they cover themselves with?\" asked a second duck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said a third duck. \"They\u0027re pretty, but they won\u0027t be able to stay out in the weather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Man Coyote thought for a while about how much he disliked ducks, then he took some more mud and made a strange-looking animal with a thick coat and horns. \"Here,\" he said. \"They can get everything they need from this animal. I\u0027ll call it a buffalo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth duck had been standing by watching all this and smoking a cigarette. \"It\u0027s a big animal. Your people won\u0027t be able to catch it,\" he said, blowing a long stream of blue smoke in Old Man Coyote\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, so here\u0027s another animal that they can ride so they can catch the buffalo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how will they catch that one?\" asked the fourth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, duck, do I have to work out everything? I made the world and these people and I\u0027ve given them everything they need, so just back off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if they have everything they need, what will they do? Just sit around telling stories about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boring,\" said the duck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make them a bunch of enemies. They\u0027ll be hopelessly outnumbered and have to fight all the time and do all kinds of war rituals. How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll get wiped out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ll stay with them. The Children of the Large-Beaked Bird will be my favorites, although some of their enemies can tell stories about me too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if the buffalo animals all get killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t happen. There\u0027s too many of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if they do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I guess the people are fucked. I\u0027m tired and dirty and cold from standing in all that water. I\u0027m going to invent the sweat bath and warm up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Old Man Coyote built a sweat lodge out of willow branches and buffalo skins. He heated the rocks in a fire and put them in a pit in the middle of the sweat lodge, then he and the ducks crawled inside and closed the door, making it completely dark inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, put out that cigarette!\" Old Man Coyote said to the fourth duck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe duck threw the cigarette on the hot rocks and smoke filled the lodge. \"That smells pretty good,\" Old Man Coyote said. \"Let\u0027s throw some other stuff on the fire and see how it goes.\" He threw on some cedar needles and they smelled pretty good too, then he threw on some sweet grass and some sage. \"This stuff will be part of the sweat ceremony, too. And some water\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;we need some water so it will really get hot and miserable in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we can get truly purified and clean?\" asked the third duck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" said Old Man Coyote. \"First I\u0027ll pour four dippers of water on the rocks for the four directions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the four ducks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" said Old Man Coyote. \"Now I\u0027ll pour on seven dippers for the seven stars of the Big Dipper. Then ten more because ten is a nice even number.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed each of the ducks a willow switch to beat their backs with. \"Here, wail on yourself with these.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\" asked the second duck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tenderize... er... I mean... it brings up the sweat and purifies you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, when the ducks were beating their backs with the willow branches, Old Man Coyote said, \"Okay, now I\u0027m going to pour a whole bunch of dippers on the rocks. I\u0027m not even going to count, but we are going to be really hot and really clean and pure.\" Then he poured and poured until it was so hot in the lodge that he could not stand it and he slipped out the door, leaving the ducks inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, after he had plunged into the river to cool off, he ate a big meal and laid down to rest. \"That was plumb swell,\" he said to himself. \"I think I\u0027ll give the sweat to my new people. It can be their church and sacrament and they can think of me whenever they go in. It is my gift to them. I guess no one really needs to know about the ducks.\" Then Old Man Coyote picked up a willow twig and picked a bit of duck meat from between his teeth. \"The sage gives them a nice flavor, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Children of the Large-Beaked Bird\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow Country\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;1967\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamson Hunts Alone sat on a bench by the sweat lodge behind his grandma\u0027s house, watching as Pokey carried the hot rocks with a pitchfork from the fire to the pit in the sweat lodge. Samson was supposed to be paying attention to the ritual that Pokey was performing and preparing himself to pray to the Great Spirit to bring him good medicine on his fast, but more than anything he wanted to be inside with the little kids and the women watching \u0026amp;laquo;Bonanza\u0026amp;raquo; on television. Grandma had cooked up a big batch of fry bread for the meal after the sweat and Samson\u0027s stomach growled when he thought about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePokey, straining under a pitchfork full of red-hot rocks, said, \"Can\u0027t nobody cross my path between the fire and the sweat during the first four trips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Harlan, who was sitting next to Samson, let out a sarcastic snicker. Pokey looked up at him, his brow lowered in reproach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boys have to learn, Harlan,\" Pokey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarlan nodded. On the other side of Samson sat his two older cousins, Harry and Festus, thirteen and fourteen, who had been through the sweat for purification and prayer for their success on the basketball court at Hardin Junior High School. They had come the fifteen miles down to Crow Agency with Harlan, their father, to participate in Samson\u0027s sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Harlan didn\u0027t believe in the old ways. He often said that he didn\u0027t want his boys to grow up with their heads full of ideas that didn\u0027t work in the modern world. Still, because of the obligations he felt to his family he often drove down for sweats, participated in ritual gift giving, and never missed the Sun Dance in June. He lived in Hardin, north of the reservation, where he rebuilt truck engines during the day and drank hard in the bars at night. He fought often and lost seldom. When he was drinking with Uncle Pokey, the two of them lying on the bed of Pokey\u0027s pickup staring into the limitless stars of Montana\u0027s big sky, passing a bottle of Dickel Sour Mash between them, Harlan would talk of his time in Vietnam, of the two brothers he lost there, and of the warrior blood that was part of the Hunts Alone family. Pokey would answer Harlan\u0027s painful pride with parables and mystical references until Harlan could stand it no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, Pokey, can your medicine fix a Cummins diesel? Can it fill out a tax form? Can it get you a job? Fuck medicine. Fuck fasting. Fuck the Sun Dance. If I thought I could do it, I\u0027d take Joan and the kids and go a thousand miles from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be back,\" Pokey would say. Then the two of them would lie there drinking in silence for long minutes before one of them would bring up basketball, hunting, or truck engines\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;some topic safe and far away from Harlan\u0027s anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of those nights Samson would crawl out of his cot, sneak past the six cousins that slept in his room and out into the yard, where he would lie by the wheel of the old truck and listen to the two men talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarlan was the only adult Samson knew who would talk about the dead, so the boy would lie there with his face against the cold grass hoping to hear something about his father or his mother, but mostly he heard about his two uncles, dead in the jungles, or his grandfather, who died piece by piece in a white hospital of diabetes. His father had died too young to leave many stories or a strong ghost. Not that Harlan would admit to believing in ghosts. \"If I\u0027m haunted,\" he would tell Pokey, \"it\u0027s not by my unrevenged brothers, it\u0027s by you and your back-assward ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter time and hangovers passed, Samson would ask Pokey about Harlan and always get the same answer. \"Poor Harlan, he is out of balance. I should dance for him at the Sun Dance.\" It was no answer. Samson remained confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamson watched as Harlan rose from the bench and undressed for the sweat. He was tall and lean, his skin deep red-brown in the firelight, his eyes and hair black as an obsidian arrowhead: pure Crow brave. But as Samson undressed he wondered why his uncle seemed so unhappy with his heritage. He treated his Crow blood like a curse, while Pokey seemed to see it as a blessing. They were half brothers, sharing the same mother, belonging to her clan, growing up in the same house; why were they so different? Why did neither one seem to be able to live comfortably in his own skin?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaked, they all entered the low dome of the sweat lodge and sat in a circle around its perimeter. Pokey placed a bucket of water by the fire pit, then he pulled down the door flap. He added sweet grass and cedar to the hot rocks and fragrant smoke filled the lodge as he sang a prayer song. His prayers were in English, which Samson knew embarrassed him some. Pokey, like Grandma, had gone to a boarding school run by the BIA where Indians were forbidden to speak or learn their own language or religion. In this way the BIA hoped that the Native American culture would disappear into the larger white culture, assimilated. Harlan, on the other hand, was ten years younger than Pokey and, like Samson, had been taught Crow in school as part of the BIA\u0027s move to preserve Indian culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePokey poured four dippers of water onto the rocks and Samson lowered his face to avoid the steam. As Pokey sang, Samson let his mind wander to the Ponderosa. He would like to live on that big ranch in that big house and have his own room and two guns like Little Joe Cartwright. Until Grandma had taken all their per capita money a year ago and bought the big black-and-white television at the Kmart in Billings, Samson thought that everyone lived in a small house with twenty cousins and five or six aunts and uncles and their grandma. Everyone on the reservation seemed to. Before the television arrived Samson did not know he was poor. Now he spent every evening piled in the front room with his family watching people he did not know do things he did not understand in places he could not fathom, while the commercials told him that he should be just like those people. None of those people ever took a sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePokey had poured the seven dippers and the sweat lodge was so hot that Samson\u0027s mind went white. He lay down on the floor to breathe some cooler air. Someone lifted his head and asked him if he was okay. He answered yes and passed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u003d*\u003d-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater was being splashed on his face. Samson came to and realized that he was being held in Harlan\u0027s strong arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did a naming ceremony for you, Samson,\" Harlan said. \"From now on you shall be called Squats Behind the Bush. And you owe each of us a carton of cigarettes and a new Ford truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamson saw that Harlan was grinning at him and he smiled back. \"If I don\u0027t take the name, do I have to give you the gifts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarlan laughed and set the boy on his feet by a fifty-five-gallon drum where Harry and Festus were pouring dippers of water over their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they were dried off and redressed Pokey moved the rocks out of the pit and replaced them with hot ones from the fire so the women could take their sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePokey finished and led them into the house, which was surprisingly quiet. The little kids were in bed and the women filed out to the sweat silently as soon as the men entered. The cheap Formica table was set with five plastic bowls around a big pot of venison-and-cabbage stew and a basket of fry bread. Harlan poured them all coffee from a big black urn on the counter while Pokey dished up the stew. Samson attacked a piece of fry bread and was tearing away at its stretchy, donutlike crust when Harlan sat down next to him and said, \"So, Squats Behind the Bush, what are you gonna do tomorrow if you see Old Man Coyote in your vision like your Uncle Pokey did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFestus and Harry giggled. Samson answered the sarcasm in earnest. \"Pokey\u0027s the only one with Coyote medicine. Pretty Eagle said so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good thing, too,\" Harlan said. \"Some of us have to live in the real world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harlan!\" Pokey shouted. \"Let it go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gone,\" Harlan said. \"It\u0027s as gone as can be, Pokey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey finished their meal in silence, Samson wondering what Harlan meant by \"It\u0027s gone.\" Later, as he fell asleep listening to the soft breathing of his cousins, he imagined himself living on the Ponderosa; sleeping in his own room, herding cattle on his own black horse, carrying two shiny six-guns, practicing his fast-draw, and always staying on the lookout for Indians. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/coyote-blue/page-3.html","bookId":2046,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:43:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:43:36 PM"}
