Madame de Beauharnais, at the time of which we are writing, was, as we have said, about twenty-seven years of age, of indisputable beauty, with a charming grace of manner, exhaling from her whole person that subtle fascination which resembles the perfume which Venus gave to her chosen ones to inspire love.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her hair and eyes were black, her nose was straight, her mouth a smiling curve; the oval outline of her face was irreproachable. Her neck was set gracefully upon her shoulders, her figure was flexible and undulating, her arm was perfectly shaped, and her hand beautiful beyond comparison.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nothing could have been more attractive than her Creole accent, of which she had retained only sufficient trace to betray her tropical birth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As her maiden name indicated, Madame de Beauharnais belonged to a noble family. Born at Martinique, her education, like that of all Creoles, was left entirely to herself; but rare qualities of mind and heart had made of Mademoiselle Tascher de la Pagerie one of the most cultivated women of any age. Her kind heart had taught her early in life that, although they had wool on their heads, the negroes were more to be pitied than other men, since, through the power and cupidity of the whites, they had been torn from their own country and transferred to a land where they suffered constantly, and not infrequently were killed by cruelty.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 346]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The thing that attracted her attention was the plight of these unhappy men. All their family ties were sundered, but brothers in toil they stood with bent backs, toiling beneath the rays of the sun, delving in a soil which their blood and their sweat fertilized, but not for themselves.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She asked herself in her youthful intelligence, why these men had been placed beyond the pale of the law? Why they should vegetate, naked, without shelter, without property, honor, liberty? and she herself found the answer—that all this was to enrich avaricious masters, who, from infancy, condemned this race to a life of hopeless and unending torture. And young Josephine\u0027s pity had influenced her parents, at least, to make an earthly paradise for the slaves.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They were still white and black; but almost to the extent of being free, these blacks shared in all the advantages and some of the pleasures of life. And, while nowhere in the island were the negroes sure of marrying the women of their choice, marriages for love rewarded with affectionate and faithful service more surely their young mistress Josephine than was the case with any of the other slave owners.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She was about thirteen years old when a young officer of great merit and noble birth arrived at Martinique, and became acquainted with her at her Aunt Renaudin\u0027s house.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was the Vicomte de Beauharnais.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The one possessed in his person everything calculated to please. She possessed in heart everything destined to inspire love. They loved each other therefore with all the ardor of two young people who have the delight of realizing their dreams of kindred souls.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have chosen you,\" said Alexandre, pressing her hand tenderly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And I have found you,\" replied Josephine, holding up her forehead to him to kiss.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her Aunt Renaudin felt that it would be opposing the decrees of Providence to forbid the loves of the two young people. Their relatives were all in France. Their consent was necessary in order to consummate this marriage to which[Pg 347] Aunt Renaudin saw no obstacle. Obstacles were raised, however, by Messieurs de Beauharnais, the father and uncle of the young man. In an access of fraternal affection they had once promised each other that their children should marry each other. He whom the young Creole already regarded as her husband was therefore the destined spouse of another, and that other his cousin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Alexandre\u0027s father yielded first. When he saw the despair into which his refusal had plunged the young people, he himself agreed to go to his brother and tell him of the change which threatened to upset their plans. But the latter was less kindly in disposition, and informed his brother that while he might be willing to break his word, a thing unworthy of a gentleman, he, the brother, would not acquiesce in any such arrangement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The vicomte\u0027s father came away in despair at having quarreled with his brother, but he not only renewed his promise to consent, he actually did consent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was then that the young Josephine, who was later to give the world an example of such heroic self-sacrifice and absolute devotion, sounded the prelude as it were to the great divorce scene. She insisted that the vicomte should sacrifice his passion for her to the tranquillity and welfare of his family.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She informed the vicomte that she wished to have an interview with his uncle, and accompanied him to M. de Beauharnais\u0027s house. She bade him enter a smaller room, adjacent to the one where M. de Beauharnais, marvelling at her visit, had consented to receive her. M. de Beauharnais rose, for he was a gentleman and was receiving a lady.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sir,\" said she, \"you do not, and you cannot love me; but what do you know of me that you should hate me? Whence comes this hatred which you have declared for me, and what justifies it? Certainly not my affection for the Vicomte de Beauharnais, for that is pure and legitimate, and is returned by him. When we first revealed our love to each other we were ignorant that social obligations[Pg 348] and family interest, of which I knew nothing, could make that confession of love a crime. Well, Monsieur de Beauharnais, all our faults, and above all mine, hinge upon this marriage which was planned by my aunt and agreed to by M. de Beauharnais. Alexandre and I, more considerate of your wishes than of our own happiness, have the terrible courage to sacrifice that happiness to you. If he and I renounce this marriage, which prevents the one you have at heart, will you still think your nephew unworthy of your friendship and deem me deserving of your scorn?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Marquis de Beauharnais, amazed at what he had heard, studied Mademoiselle Tascher de la Pagerie for some time in silence; but not being able to credit the sincerity of her remarks, he retorted, concealing with a veneer of politeness the insulting nature of his remarks:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mademoiselle, I have heard of the beauty, the wit, and the noble sentiments of Mademoiselle Tascher de la Pagerie, always in terms of the highest praise; but this union which I feared, and in which my nephew is so well justified, or at least excusable, I find all the more blameworthy, because it is so invincible—because a rival, far from overcoming its influence, only tended to increase it, and because it was very difficult to foresee that it had the power to check its own progress. This, mademoiselle, is the spectacle which you present to-day—a spectacle so singular that, permit me to say, in order not to suspect you of the most adroit egotism and the most profound and well-acted dissimulation, I must have recourse to a third supposition, which you will perhaps resent just because it is a natural one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is that supposition, sir?\" asked Mademoiselle de la Pagerie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That you have either ceased to love my nephew or that he no longer loves you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The vicomte, who had been listening with mingled grief and astonishment, opened the door and rushed into the room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are mistaken, sir,\" he said; \"she still loves me and I love her more than ever. But as she is an angel, she is[Pg 349] sacrificing herself and me to our families; but by misunderstanding and calumniating her you have proved that you are not worthy of the sacrifice she was willing to make. Come, Josephine, come. All that I can do, and it is my last concession, is to leave the matter to my father to decide. What he determines upon we will do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They returned to the house, where Mademoiselle de la Pagerie related to Monsieur de Beauharnais all that had just occurred, asking for his final decision, and promising, on her own behalf and that of his son, to abide by it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the count, with tears in his eyes, took the hands of the two young people and said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Never were you more worthy of one another than when you renounced your hopes of mutual happiness. You ask my final decision. It is that you shall marry, and it is my earnest wish that you may be happy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A week later Mademoiselle de la Pagerie became the Vicomtesse de Beauharnais.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nothing happened to disturb the happiness of the young people until the Revolution began. The Vicomte de Beauharnais ranged himself among those who favored its adoption; only he made the mistake of thinking that the avalanche could be directed as it rushed on, carrying all before it. He was swept in its wake to the scaffold.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3318/90819.html","bookId":398,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 3:43:15 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 3:43:15 PM"}
