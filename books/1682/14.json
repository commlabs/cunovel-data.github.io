The whole cave is coming down around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ground by the fallen gangway I see Ivanick, his head nearly severed from his neck by the collapsed steel. Dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMogadorians scream all around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my own surprise, I like the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething heavy lands against my shoulder, slamming my head against the floor, pinning me in place. I can’t move, and am too stunned to know if it was a minor wound or a fatal blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy keep track now? I think. There’s more where that came from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed there is: concrete keeps falling, all around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the entire structure gives out and collapses onto us, I know I only have a few moments of consciousness left. But I’m not afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI survived my fall down the ravine. I survived the implosion of Ashwood Estates. I wasn’t even conscious then, and Malcolm said something kept us from being crushed, that it was as if some force kept us safe as the world fell down around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird time’s the charm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt may just be exhaustion, it may just be delirium, but I’m overcome by a deep, sweet certainty that I was meant to survive. That my ultimate purpose lies somewhere beyond these tumbling walls, sometime beyond this frenzied moment. That the best of me is yet to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will live. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-search-for-sam-lorien-legacies-the-lost-files-4/page-14.html","bookId":1682,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM"}
