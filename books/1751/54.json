He had made interesting measurements and his brilliantly colored sweater had showed fascinating changes from hour to hour as the suns\u0027 positions shifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now his shadow was a long red thing, with the lowest third of it gray, where the Lagrange II shadow coincided. He held out one arm and it cast two shadows. There was a smeared orange one some fifteen feet away and a denser blue one in the same direction but only five feet away. If he had time, he could work out a beautiful set of shadowgrams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so pleased with the thought that he felt no resentment at seeing Mark Annuncio skirting his trail in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put down his nucleometer and waved his hand. \"Come here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youngster approached diffidently. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just-just watching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? Well, go ahead and watch. Do you know what I\u0027m doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a nucleometer,\" said Vernadsky. \"You jab it into the ground like this. It\u0027s got a force-field generator at the top so it will penetrate any rock.\" He leaned on the nucleometer as he spoke, and it went two feet into the stony outcropping. \"See?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s eyes shone, and Vernadsky felt pleased. The chemist said, \"Along the sides of the uniped are microscopic atomic furnaces, each of which vaporizes about a million molecules or so in the surrounding rock and decomposes them into atoms. The atoms are then differentiated in terms of nuclear mass and charge and the results may be read off directly on the dials above. Do you follow all that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. But it\u0027s a good thing to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVernadsky smiled and said, \"We end up with figures on the different elements in the crust. It\u0027s pretty much the same on all oxygen-water planets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark said seriously, \"The planet with the most silicon I know of is Lepta, with 32.765 per cent. Earth is only 24.862. That\u0027s by weight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVernadsky\u0027s smile faded. He said dryly, \"You have the figures on all the planets, pal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no. I couldn\u0027t I don\u0027t think they\u0027ve all been surveyed. Bischoon and Spenglov\u0027s Handbook of Planetary Crusts only lists figures for 21,854 planets. I know all those, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVernadsky, with a definite feeling of deflation, said, \"Now Junior has a more even distribution of elements than is usually met up with. Oxygen is low. So far my average is a lousy 42.113. So is silicon, with 22.722. The heavy metals are ten to a hundred times as concentrated as on Earth. That\u0027s not just a local phenomenon, either, since Junior\u0027s over-all density is 5 per cent higher than Earth\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVernadsky wasn\u0027t sure why he was telling the kid all this. Partly, he felt, because it was good to find someone who would listen. A man gets lonely and frustrated when there is no one of his own field to talk to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on, beginning to relish the lecture. \"On the other hand, the lighter elements are also better distributed. The ocean solids aren\u0027t predominantly sodium chloride, as on Earth. Junior\u0027s oceans contain a respectable helping of magnesium salts. And take what they call the \"rare lights.\" Those are the elements lithium, beryllium, and boron. They\u0027re lighter than carbon, all of them, but they are of very rare occurrence on Earth, and in fact, on all planets. Junior, on the other hand, is quite rich in them. The three of them total almost four tenths of a per cent of the crust as compared to about four thousandths on Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark plucked at the other\u0027s sleeve. \"Do you have a list of figures on all the elements? May I see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so.\" He took a folded piece of paper out of his hip pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned as Mark took the sheet and said, \"Don\u0027t publish those figures before I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark glanced at them once and returned the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you through?\" asked Vernadsky in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes,\" said Mark thoughtfully, \"I have it all.\" He turned on his heel and walked away with no word of parting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last glimmer of Lagrange I faded below the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVernadsky gazed after Mark and shrugged. He plucked his nucleometer out of the ground, and followed after, walking back toward the tents. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-54.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
