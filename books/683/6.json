it was only from a chance allusion of Mrs. Jarrold before he went that he inferred it. \u0026nbsp;He did not think the matter of sufficient importance to wonder why Stephen, who generally told him everything, had not mentioned this.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n During their play, Stephen, after pledging him to secrecy, told Leonard of her intention of visiting the crypt, and asked him to help her in it. \u0026nbsp;This was an adventure, and as such commended itself to the schoolboy heart. \u0026nbsp;He entered at once into the scheme con amore; and the two discussed ways and means. \u0026nbsp;Leonard’s only regret was that he was associated with a little girl in such a project. \u0026nbsp;It was something of a blow to his personal vanity, which was a large item in his moral equipment, that such a project should have been initiated by the girl and not by himself. \u0026nbsp;He was to get possession of the key and in the forenoon of the next day he was to be waiting in the churchyard, when Stephen would join him as soon as she could evade her nurse. \u0026nbsp;She was now more than eleven, and had less need of being watched than in her earlier years. \u0026nbsp;It was possible, with strategy, to get away undiscovered for an hour.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n * * * * *\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At Carstone Harold got though what he had to do that same afternoon and arranged to start early in the morning for Normanstand. \u0026nbsp;After an early breakfast he set out on his thirty-mile journey at eight o’clock. \u0026nbsp;Littlejohn, his horse, was in excellent form, notwithstanding his long journey of the day before, and with his nose pointed for home, put his best foot foremost. \u0026nbsp;Harold felt in great spirits. \u0026nbsp;The long ride the day before had braced him physically, though there were on his journey times of great sadness when the thought of his father came back to him and the sense of loss was renewed with each thought of his old home. \u0026nbsp;But youth is naturally buoyant. \u0026nbsp;His visit to the church, the first thing on his arrival at Carstone, and his kneeling before the stone made sacred to his father’s memory, though it entailed a silent gush of tears, did him good, and even seemed to place his sorrow farther away. \u0026nbsp;When he came again in the morning before leaving Carstone there were no tears. \u0026nbsp;There was only a holy memory which seemed to sanctify loss; and his father seemed nearer to him than ever.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he drew near Normanstand he looked forward eagerly to seeing Stephen, and the sight of the old church lying far below him as he came down the steep road over Alt Hill, which was the short-cut from Norcester, set his mind working. \u0026nbsp;His visit to the tomb of his own father made him think of the day when he kept Stephen from entering the crypt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The keenest thought is not always conscious. \u0026nbsp;It was without definite intention that when he came to the bridle-path Harold turned his horse’s head and rode down to the churchyard. \u0026nbsp;As he pushed open the door of the church he half expected to see Stephen; and there was a vague possibility that Leonard Everard might be with her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The church was cool and dim. \u0026nbsp;Coming from the hot glare the August sunshine it seemed, at the first glance, dark. \u0026nbsp;He looked around, and a sense of relief came over him. \u0026nbsp;The place was empty.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But even as he stood, there came a sound which made his heart grow cold. \u0026nbsp;A cry, muffled, far away and full of anguish; a sobbing cry, which suddenly ceased.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was the voice of Stephen. \u0026nbsp;He instinctively knew where it came from; the crypt. \u0026nbsp;Only for the experience he had had of her desire to enter the place, he would never have suspected that it was so close to him. \u0026nbsp;He ran towards the corner where commenced the steps leading downward. \u0026nbsp;As he reached the spot a figure came rushing up the steps. \u0026nbsp;A boy in Eton jacket and wide collar, careless, pale, and agitated. \u0026nbsp;It was Leonard Everard. \u0026nbsp;Harold seized him as he came.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Where is Stephen?’ he cried in a quick, low voice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘In the vault below there. \u0026nbsp;She dropped her light and then took mine, and she dropped it too. \u0026nbsp;Let me go! \u0026nbsp;Let me go!’ \u0026nbsp;He struggled to get away; but Harold held him tight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Where are the matches?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘In my pocket. \u0026nbsp;Let me go! \u0026nbsp;Let me go!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Give me them—this instant!’ \u0026nbsp;He was examining the frightened boy’s waistcoat pockets as he spoke. \u0026nbsp;When he had got the matches he let the boy go, and ran down the steps and through the open door into the crypt, calling out as he came:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Stephen! \u0026nbsp;Stephen dear, where are you? \u0026nbsp;It is I—Harold!’ \u0026nbsp;There was no response; his heart seemed to grow cold and his knees to weaken. \u0026nbsp;The match spluttered and flashed, and in the momentary glare he saw across the vault, which was not a large place, a white mass on the ground. \u0026nbsp;He had to go carefully, lest the match should be blown out by the wind of his passage; but on coming close he saw that it was Stephen lying senseless in front of a great coffin which rested on a built-out pile of masonry. \u0026nbsp;Then the match went out. \u0026nbsp;In the flare of the next one he lit he saw a piece of candle lying on top of the coffin. \u0026nbsp;He seized and lit it. \u0026nbsp;He was able to think coolly despite his agitation, and knew that light was the first necessity. \u0026nbsp;The bruised wick was slow to catch; he had to light another match, his last one, before it flamed. \u0026nbsp;The couple of seconds that the light went down till the grease melted and the flame leaped again seemed of considerable length. \u0026nbsp;When the lit candle was placed steadily on top of the coffin, and a light, dim, though strong enough to see with, spread around, he stooped and lifted Stephen in his arms. \u0026nbsp;She was quite senseless, and so limp that a great fear came upon him that she might be dead. \u0026nbsp;He did not waste time, but carried her across the vault where the door to the church steps stood out sharp against the darkness, and bore her up into the church. \u0026nbsp;Holding her in one arm, with the other hand he dragged some long cushions from one of the pews and spread them on the floor; on these he laid her. \u0026nbsp;His heart was smitten with love and pity as he looked. \u0026nbsp;She was so helpless; so pitifully helpless! \u0026nbsp;Her arms and legs were doubled up as though broken, disjointed; the white frock was smeared with patches of thick dust. \u0026nbsp;Instinctively he stooped and pulled the frock down and straightened out the arms and feet. \u0026nbsp;He knelt beside her, and felt if her heart was still beating, a great fear over him, a sick apprehension. \u0026nbsp;A gush of thankful prayer came from his heart. \u0026nbsp;Thank God! she was alive; he could feel her heart beat, though faintly underneath his hand. \u0026nbsp;He started to his feet and ran towards the door, seizing his hat, which lay on a seat. \u0026nbsp;He wanted it to bring back some water. \u0026nbsp;As he passed out of the door he saw Leonard a little distance off, but took no notice of him. \u0026nbsp;He ran to the stream, filled his hat with water, and brought it back. \u0026nbsp;When he came into the church he saw Stephen, already partially restored, sitting up on the cushions with Leonard supporting her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was rejoiced; but somehow disappointed. \u0026nbsp;He would rather Leonard had not been there. \u0026nbsp;He remembered—he could not forget—the white face of the boy who fled out of the crypt leaving Stephen in a faint within, and who had lingered outside the church door whilst he ran for water. \u0026nbsp;Harold came forward quickly and raised Stephen, intending to bring her into the fresh air. \u0026nbsp;He had a shrewd idea that the sight of the sky and God’s greenery would be the best medicine for her after her fright. \u0026nbsp;He lifted her in his strong arms as he used to do when she was a very little child and had got tired in their walks together; and carried her to the door. \u0026nbsp;She lent herself unconsciously to the movement, holding fast with her arm round his neck as she used to do. \u0026nbsp;In her clinging was the expression of her trust in him. \u0026nbsp;The little sigh with which she laid her head on his shoulder was the tribute to his masculine power, and her belief in it. \u0026nbsp;Every instant her senses were coming back to her more and more. \u0026nbsp;The veil of oblivion was passing from her half-closed eyes, as the tide of full remembrance swept in upon her. \u0026nbsp;Her inner nature was expressed in the sequence of her emotions. \u0026nbsp;Her first feeling was one of her own fault. \u0026nbsp;The sight of Harold and his proximity recalled to her vividly how he had refused to go into the crypt, and how she had intentionally deceived him, negatively, as to her intention of doing that of which he disapproved. \u0026nbsp;Her second feeling was one of justice; and was perhaps partially evoked by the sight of Leonard, who followed close as Harold brought her to the door. \u0026nbsp;She did not wish to speak of herself or Harold before him; but she did not hesitate to speak of him to Harold:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘You must not blame Leonard. \u0026nbsp;It was all my fault. \u0026nbsp;I made him come!’ \u0026nbsp;Her generosity appealed to Harold. \u0026nbsp;He was angry with the boy for being there at all; but more for his desertion of the girl in her trouble.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I’m not blaming him for being with you!’ he said simply. \u0026nbsp;Leonard spoke at once. \u0026nbsp;He had been waiting to defend himself, for that was what first concerned that young gentleman; next to his pleasure, his safety most appealed to him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I went to get help. \u0026nbsp;You had let the candle drop; and how could I see in the dark? \u0026nbsp;You would insist on looking at the plate on the coffin!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A low moan broke from Stephen, a long, low, trembling moan which went to Harold’s heart. \u0026nbsp;Her head drooped over again on his shoulder; and she clung close to him as the memory of her shock came back to her. \u0026nbsp;Harold spoke to Leonard over his shoulder in a low, fierce whisper, which Stephen did not seem to hear:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘There! that will do. \u0026nbsp;Go away! \u0026nbsp;You have done enough already. \u0026nbsp;Go! \u0026nbsp;Go!’ he added more sternly, as the boy seemed disposed to argue. \u0026nbsp;Leonard ran a few steps, then walked to the lich-gate, where he waited.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stephen clung close to Harold in a state of agitation which was almost hysterical. \u0026nbsp;She buried her face in his shoulder, sobbing brokenly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Oh, Harold! \u0026nbsp;It was too awful. \u0026nbsp;I never thought, never for a moment, that my poor dear mother was buried in the crypt. \u0026nbsp;And when I went to look at the name on the coffin that was nearest to where I was, I knocked away the dust, and then I saw her name: “Margaret Norman, aetat 22.” \u0026nbsp;I couldn’t bear it. \u0026nbsp;She was only a girl herself, only just twice my age—lying there in that terrible dark place with all the thick dust and the spiders’ webs. \u0026nbsp;Oh, Harold, Harold! \u0026nbsp;How shall I ever bear to think of her lying there, and that I shall never see her dear face? \u0026nbsp;Never! \u0026nbsp;Never!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He tried to soothe her by patting and holding her hands. \u0026nbsp;For a good while the resolution of the girl faltered, and she was but as a little child. \u0026nbsp;Then her habitual strength of mind asserted itself. \u0026nbsp;She did not ask Harold how she came to be out in the church instead of in the crypt when she recovered her senses. \u0026nbsp;She seemed to take it for granted that Leonard had carried her out; and when she said how brave it had been of him, Harold, with his customary generosity, allowed her to preserve the belief. \u0026nbsp;When they had made their way to the gate Leonard came up to them; but before he could speak Stephen had begun to thank him. \u0026nbsp;He allowed her to do so, though the sight of Harold’s mouth set in scorn, and his commanding eyes firmly fixed on him, made him grow hot and cold alternately. \u0026nbsp;He withdrew without speaking; and took his way home with a heart full of bitterness and revengeful feelings.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the park Stephen tried to dust herself, and then Harold tried to assist her. \u0026nbsp;But her white dress was incurably soiled, the fine dust of the vault seemed to have got ingrained in the muslin. \u0026nbsp;When she got to the house she stole upstairs, so that no one might notice her till she had made herself tidy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next day but one she took Harold for a walk in the afternoon. \u0026nbsp;When they were quite alone and out of earshot she said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I have been thinking all night about poor mother. \u0026nbsp;Of course I know she cannot be moved from the crypt. \u0026nbsp;She must remain there. \u0026nbsp;But there needn’t be all that dust. \u0026nbsp;I want you to come there with me some time soon. \u0026nbsp;I fear I am afraid to go alone. \u0026nbsp;I want to bring some flowers and to tidy up the place. \u0026nbsp;Won’t you come with me this time? \u0026nbsp;I know now, Harold, why you didn’t let me go in before. \u0026nbsp;But now it is different. \u0026nbsp;This is not curiosity. \u0026nbsp;It is Duty and Love. \u0026nbsp;Won’t you come with me, Harold?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harold leaped from the edge of the ha-ha where he had been sitting and held up his hand. \u0026nbsp;She took it and leaped down lightly beside him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Come,’ he said, ‘let us go there now!’ \u0026nbsp;She took his arm when they got on the path again, and clinging to him in her pretty girlish way they went together to the piece of garden which she called her own; there they picked a great bunch of beautiful white flowers. \u0026nbsp;Then they walked to the old church. \u0026nbsp;The door was open and they passed in. \u0026nbsp;Harold took from his pocket a tiny key. \u0026nbsp;This surprised her, and heightened the agitation which she naturally suffered from revisiting the place. \u0026nbsp;She said nothing whilst he opened the door to the crypt. \u0026nbsp;Within, on a bracket, stood some candles in glass shades and boxes of matches. \u0026nbsp;Harold lit three candles, and leaving one of them on the shelf, and placing his cap beside it, took the other two in his hands. \u0026nbsp;Stephen, holding her flowers tightly to her breast with her right hand, took Harold’s arm with the left, and with beating heart entered the crypt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For several minutes Harold kept her engaged, telling her about the crypt in his father’s church, and how he went down at his last visit to see the coffin of his dear father, and how he knelt before it. \u0026nbsp;Stephen was much moved, and held tight to his arm, her heart beating. \u0026nbsp;But in the time she was getting accustomed to the place. \u0026nbsp;Her eyes, useless at first on coming out of the bright sunlight, and not able to distinguish anything, began to take in the shape of the place and to see the rows of great coffins that stood out along the far wall. \u0026nbsp;She also saw with surprise that the newest coffin, on which for several reasons her eyes rested, was no longer dusty but was scrupulously clean. \u0026nbsp;Following with her eyes as well as she could see into the further corners she saw that there the same reform had been effected. \u0026nbsp;Even the walls and ceiling had been swept of the hanging cobwebs, and the floor was clean with the cleanliness of ablution. \u0026nbsp;Still holding Harold’s arm, she moved over towards her mother’s coffin and knelt before it. \u0026nbsp;Harold knelt with her; for a little while she remained still and silent, praying inwardly. \u0026nbsp;Then she rose, and taking her great bunch of flowers placed them lovingly on the lid of the coffin above where she thought her mother’s heart would be. \u0026nbsp;Then she turned to Harold, her eyes flowing and her cheeks wet with tears, and laid her head against his breast. \u0026nbsp;Her arms could not go round his neck till he had bent his head, for with his great height he simply towered above her. \u0026nbsp;Presently she was quiet; the paroxysm of her grief had passed. \u0026nbsp;She took Harold’s hand in both hers, and together they went to the door. \u0026nbsp;With his disengaged hand, for he would not have disturbed the other for worlds, Harold put out the lights and locked the door behind them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the church she held him away from her, and looked him fairly in the face. \u0026nbsp;She said slowly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Harold, was it you who had the crypt cleaned?’ \u0026nbsp;He answered in a low voice:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I knew you would want to go again!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She took the great hand which she held between hers, and before he knew what she was doing and could prevent her, raised it to her lips and kissed it, saying lovingly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Oh, Harold! \u0026nbsp;No brother in all the wide world could be kinder. \u0026nbsp;And—and—’ this with a sob, ‘we both thank you;
