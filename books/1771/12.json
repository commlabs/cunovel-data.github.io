His eyes are falling all over my frame. My jaw tightens on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You hurt him,” I find myself saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shouldn’t care,” he says with a tilt of his head, gesturing to my dress. “But it’s obvious you do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI zip my lips and pray my hands aren’t shaking too much. I don’t know where Adam is. I don’t know how badly he’s hurt. I don’t know what Warner will do, how far he’ll go in the pursuit of what he wants but the prospect of Adam in pain is like a cold hand clutching my esophagus. I can’t catch my breath. I feel like I’m struggling to swallow a toothpick. If Adam is trying to help me it could cost him his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touch the piece of paper tucked into my pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner’s eyes are on my window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s time to go,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are we going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe step out the door. I look around. The hallway is abandoned; empty. “Where is Adam everyone . . . ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really like that dress,” Warner says as he slips an arm around my waist. I jerk away but he pulls me along, guiding me toward the elevator. “The fit is spectacular. It helps distract me from all your questions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your poor mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner almost trips over his own feet. His eyes are wide; alarmed. He stops a few feet short of our goal. Spins around. “What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach falls over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on his face: the unguarded strain, the flinching terror, the sudden apprehension in his features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trying to make a joke, is what I don’t say to him. I feel sorry for your poor mother, is what I was going to say to him, that she has to deal with such a miserable, pathetic son. But I don’t say any of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs my hands, focuses my eyes. Urgency is pulsing at his temples. “What do you mean?” he insists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“N-nothing,” I stammer. My voice breaks in half. “I didn’t—it was just a joke—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner drops my hands like they’ve burned him. He looks away. Charges toward the elevator and doesn’t wait for me to catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder what he’s not telling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly once we’ve gone down several floors and are making our way down an unfamiliar hall toward an unfamiliar exit does he finally look at me. He offers me 4 words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome to your future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m swimming in sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner is holding open a door that leads directly outside and I’m so unprepared for the experience I can hardly see straight. He grips my elbow to steady my path and I glance back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going outside.” I say it because I have to say it out loud. Because the outside world is a treat I’m so seldom offered. Because I don’t know if Warner is trying to be nice again. I look from him to what looks like a concrete courtyard and back to him again. “What are we doing outside?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have some business to take care of.” He tugs me toward the center of this new universe and I’m breaking away from him, reaching out to touch the sky like I’m hoping it will remember me. The clouds are gray like they’ve always been, but they’re sparse and unassuming. The sun is high high high, lounging against a backdrop propping up its rays and redirecting its warmth in our general direction. I stand on tiptoe and try to touch it. The wind folds itself into my arms and smiles against my skin. Cool, silky-smooth air braids a soft breeze through my hair. This square courtyard could be my ballroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to dance with the elements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner grabs my hand. I turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This,” he says, gesturing to the cold gray world under our feet, “this makes you happy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around. I realize the courtyard is not quite a roof, but somewhere between two buildings. I edge toward the ledge and can see dead land and naked trees and scattered compounds stretching on for miles. “Cold air smells so clean,” I tell him. “Fresh. Brand-new. It’s the most wonderful smell in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes look amused, troubled, interested, and confused all at once. He shakes his head. Pats down his jacket and reaches for an inside pocket. He pulls out a gun with a gold hilt that glints in the sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull in a sharp breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inspects the gun in a way I wouldn’t understand, presumably to check whether or not it’s ready to fire. He slips it into his hand, his finger poised directly over the trigger. He turns and finally reads the expression on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost laughs. “Don’t worry. It’s not for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you have a gun?” I swallow, hard, gripping my arms tight across my chest. “What are we doing up here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner slips the gun back into his pocket and walks to the opposite end of the ledge. He motions for me to follow him. I creep closer. Follow his eyes. Peer over the barrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery soldier in the building is standing not 15 feet below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI distinguish almost 50 lines, each perfectly straight, perfectly spaced, so many soldiers standing single file I lose count. I wonder if Adam is in the crowd. I wonder if he can see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder what he thinks of me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers are standing in a square space almost identical to the one Warner and I occupy, but they’re one organized mass of black: black pants, black shirts, shin-high black boots; not a single gun in sight. Each is standing with his left fist pressed to his heart. Frozen in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack and gray\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblack and gray\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblack and gray\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebleak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I’m acutely aware of my impractical outfit. Suddenly the wind is too callous, too cold, too painful as it slices its way through the crowd. I shiver and it has nothing to do with the temperature. I look for Warner but he has already taken his place at the edge of the courtyard; it’s obvious he’s done this many times before. He pulls a small square of perforated metal out of his pocket and presses it to his lips; when he speaks, his voice carries over the crowd like it’s been amplified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sector 45.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne word. One number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire group shifts: left fists released, dropped to their sides; right fists planted in place on their chests. They are an oiled machine, working in perfect collaboration with one another. If I weren’t so apprehensive I think I’d be impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have two matters to deal with this morning.” Warner’s voice penetrates the atmosphere: crisp, clear, unbearably confident. “The first is standing by my side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThousands of eyes snap up in my direction. I feel myself flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Juliette, come here, please.” 2 fingers bend in 2 places to beckon me forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inch into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner slips his arm around me. I cringe. The crowd starts. My heart careens out of control. I’m too scared to back away from him. His gun is too close to my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers seem stunned that Warner is willing to touch me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jenkins, would you step forward, please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers are running a marathon down my thigh. I can’t stand still. I can’t calm the palpitations crashing my nervous system. Jenkins steps out of line; I spot him immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jenkins had the pleasure of meeting Juliette just last night,” he continues. The tension among the men is very nearly tangible. No one, it seems, knows where this speech is headed. And no one, it seems, hasn’t already heard Jenkins’ story. My story. “I hope you’ll all greet her with the same sort of kindness,” Warner adds, his lips laughing without a sound. “She will be with us for some time, and will be a very valuable asset to our efforts. The Reestablishment welcomes her. I welcome her. You should welcome her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers drop their fists all at once, all at exactly the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shift as one, 5 steps backward, 5 steps forward, 5 steps standing in place. They raise their left arms high and curl their fingers into a fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd fall on one knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run to the edge, desperate to get a closer look at such a strangely choreographed routine. I’ve never seen anything like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner makes them stay like that, bent like that, fists raised in the air like that. He doesn’t speak for at least 30 seconds. And then he does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers rise and rest their right fists on their chests again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The second matter at hand is even more pleasant than the first,” Warner continues, though he seems to take no pleasure in saying it. His eyes are sharpening over the soldiers below, shards of emerald flickering like green flames over their bodies. “Delalieu has a report for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spends an eternity simply staring at the soldiers, letting his few words marinate in their minds. Letting their own imaginations drive them insane. Letting the guilty among them tremble in anguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner says nothing for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one moves for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI begin to fear for my life despite his earlier reassurances. I begin to wonder if perhaps I am the guilty one. If perhaps the gun in his pocket is destined for me. I finally dare to turn in his direction. He glances at me for the first time and I have no idea how to read him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face is 10,000 possibilities staring straight through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Delalieu,” he says, still looking at me. “You may step forward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thin, balding sort of man in a slightly more decorated outfit steps out from the very front of the fifth line. He doesn’t look entirely stable. He ducks his head an inch. His voice warbles when he speaks. “Sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner finally unshackles my eyes and nods, almost imperceptibly, in the balding man’s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelalieu recites: “We have a charge against Private 45B-76423. Fletcher, Seamus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers are all frozen in line, frozen in relief, frozen in fear, frozen in anxiety. Nothing moves. Nothing breathes. Even the wind is afraid to make a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fletcher.” One word from Warner and several hundred necks snap in the same direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher steps out of line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks like a gingerbread man. Ginger hair. Ginger freckles. Lips almost artificially red. His face is blank of every possible emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never been more afraid for a stranger in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelalieu speaks again. “Private Fletcher was found on unregulated grounds, fraternizing with civilians believed to be rebel party members. He had stolen food and supplies from storage units dedicated to Sector 45 citizens. It is not known whether he betrayed sensitive information.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner levels his gaze at the gingerbread man. “Do you deny these accusations, soldier?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher’s nostrils flare. His jaw tenses. His voice cracks when he speaks. “No, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner nods. Takes a short breath. Licks his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd shoots him in the forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eighteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one moves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher’s face is etched in permanent horror as he crumbles to the ground. I’m so struck by the impossibility of it all that I can’t decide whether or not I’m dreaming, I can’t determine whether or not I’m dying, I can’t figure out whether or not fainting is a good idea. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shatter-me-shatter-me-1/page-12.html","bookId":1771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:23 AM"}
