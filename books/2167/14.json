His breath came slow and steady, and he let that sensation spread throughout his tense body, easing muscles, finding a solid harmony, a more perfect balance. He could see the deer\u0027s shoulder over the next rise. Its head had not come up; it had not heard the slight noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat slight noise had sounded so clearly to Elbryan!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man paused then to consider the extent of his progress. Only the previous autumn, his fourth in Andur\u0027Blough Inninness, he had not been able to get within fifty feet of such a wary creature. Only the previous autumn, he would not even have noticed his last slight misstep. The elves had worked him hard, very hard. He continued his daily gathering of the milk-stones, though now he ate a hot meal every time, easily avoiding even the most cunning of the elvish traps. No longer was the rest of the day his own, though, for the elves had filled his afternoons and early evenings with lessons on the ways of beast and plant. He had learned to identify the various plants and their properties, often medicinal. Elbryan had learned to walk nearly silently -- though he still thought himself clumsy when measured against the graceful elves! He had learned truly to understand and recognize the perspective of those animals watching him, that he might better blend into the forest background. He had learned to observe the world through the senses of each animal, understood now each creature\u0027s fears and needs. To a squirrel and a rabbit, he could become perfectly unthreatening, coaxing the beast to feed right from his hand. And to a deer, perhaps the most skittish creature of all ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was barely a half dozen steps away, unnoticed, on open ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis focus went back to the task at hand, to the six most difficult steps of all. He considered the air around him, the slight breeze in his face. Winter was still present in this part of Andur\u0027Blough Inninness, but its grip was fast loosening. The deer was having little trouble finding grass through the spotty layer of snow, and its treasurelike find had it, perhaps, a little less alert than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan couldn\u0027t suppress his widening smile. Eagerness welled within him, the very real hope that this time he would touch that animal. He took another step, then another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo quickly, with too little time to find his center of balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deer\u0027s head came up, ears twitching, scanning; Elbryan\u0027s smile vanished. He went forward with all speed, scrambling over the low ridge. He dove and reached, desperate to slap the creature, though he knew perfectly well that this kind of closing rush was not what Juraviel and Tuntun wanted from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould his victory prove tainted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point was moot, anyway, for Elbryan never got close to touching the elusive deer. A single great leap sent the beast flying away, disappearing so quickly into the twigs and branches of the forest lining the small meadow that it was lost to Elbryan\u0027s sight before he ever recovered from his lunging roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man shifted to a sitting position and sagged on the wet ground. Juraviel came to him at once, the elf grinning and nodding. \"Elu touise!\" Juraviel exclaimed and patted the young man on the back. \"So very close!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lost control,\" Elbryan said despondently. \"At the last, and most crucial moment, my eagerness overcame my movement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ah, but you miss the point,\" the elf replied. \"You kept control for all this time, closing perfectly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not touch the deer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have approached the goal,\" Juraviel cried. \"You have just begun, my young friend. Think not of the failure but of the triumph. Never have you gotten this close; but you shall again, and when you do, you will know better and will temper your eagerness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan looked at the elf long and hard, glad for the words. Put in that manner, this was indeed a day of celebration. He hadn\u0027t touched the deer, that was true, but his progress beyond his last few fumbling attempts was marked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as the young man\u0027s smile began to widen, Tuntun came out of the brush, walking back from the spot where the deer had disappeared She moved right in front of Elbryan and put her tiny hand up to his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smelled the scent of deer on her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood of Mather.\" Tuntun snorted sarcastically as she moved away, the all too familiar phrase that Elbryan had grown tired of years before. He looked back at Juraviel for support and found that the elf was working hard to hide his grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan sighed deeply. He tried to keep a perspective on his gains. Could any of the men of Dundalis, could his own father, have ever gotten that close to a deer? Still, Elbryan wasn\u0027t among those folk anymore, and in measuring his progress in all areas but physical strength against the elves of Andur\u0027Blough Inninness, he felt a novice indeed. It was hard for the young man to appreciate all he had learned when he considered all he had left to learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuraviel offered him a hand, and Elbryan took it, though in truth the elf could do little to help the large man rise. There was very little boyishness left in Elbryan\u0027s frame. He stood three inches over six feet, tall and muscular, and his two hundred and twenty lean, strong pounds put him at more than three times the weight of the average elf. Not that Juraviel and the others weren\u0027t strong; it constantly amazed Elbryan how much power an elf packed into its tiny frame, power he felt all too often in the sting of a practice sword\u0027s strike during his sparring sessions!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, with Tuntun nearby but comfortably -- for herself and for Elbryan -- out of sight, the pair enjoyed the fine day as they made their way to the southern end of the enchanted valley, the area of Andur\u0027Blough Inninness where winter had never found a hold. They chatted easily, Juraviel doing most of the talking, explaining this plant and that, talking of ways to bind a wound, then shifting the subject back to where Elbryan had performed well and where he had failed in his quest to slap the deer. Such were Juraviel\u0027s methods, his enchanting and engrossing conversation techniques, that Elbryan hardly realized this to be perhaps the most important part of his training, these daily chats, anecdotal and enjoyable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked down confusing trails, often branching, seeming to go in circles, seeming as if they merely ended until that apparent end was reached. Elbryan still could not navigate this area, but he was gaining some understanding. Juraviel let him lead often and corrected him whenever he went wrong -- which was not often any longer -- and soon the pair came into the low dell called Caer\u0027alfar: Elvenhome. It was a place of thick grass and lines of trees, with houses built in the boughs above\u0027 the ground. It was a place of flowers and song, where the forest was not so thick and the sky could be seen from many vantage points. This was the very center of the mist that blanketed Andur\u0027Blough Inninness during the light of day, and yet Caer\u0027alfar was rarely covered, a small hole remaining in the gray canopy, unnoticeable from anywhere but this low meadow, that the elves might enjoy the sun as well as the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDozens of elves were about this day, some sparring with practice weapons, others dancing. Some rested back against the trees or lay comfortably in the soft grass, drinking their sweet Questel ni\u0027touel wine. Here and there debates sprang up concerning the value of the spirits and what they should bring in trade, for the spring caravan. would soon depart, a group of elves going to their secret contacts in the frontier villages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, the peaceful scene struck a chord in Elbryan about how out of place he was, and yet, he somehow felt as if he belonged. He had been coming into Caer\u0027alfar regularly since the turn of the year, and now the elves hardly gave him a thought as he walked in. No longer was he an outcast -- he even joined in their nightly party of song and dance -- and yet, he was so obviously different. For Elbryan, his entire existence seemed as it had been on those occasions many years back in Dundalis when his father and mother invited friends to the house. Sometimes Elbryan would be allowed to stay up late, sometimes he would even be allowed to join in their dice games for a bit before retiring. How grown up he had felt! And yet, he was not really a part of that game, of that group. His parents and their adult friends had accepted him with smiles that he now realized were somewhat condescending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it was with the elves. He could never truly be one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Juraviel continued their conversation until Tuntun walked by, eyeing Elbryan derisively and tapping her smooth cheek and chin. Elbryan understood -- so did Juraviel -- and the elf motioned for the young man to go to his place. Above all else, the elves were meticulous about grooming. Elbryan was expected to bathe daily, to keep his clothing clean, and since his beard was splotchy and uneven, not yet that of a man, to keep his face clean shaven. That was the one task which always seemed to elude the young man -- until Tuntun inevitably pointed it out -- although, with the impossibly fine-edged elven knife, shaving was neither painful nor troublesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan moved grudgingly to his lodging, a low, wide house on the bottom boughs of a thick-limbed elm. He collected his bowl, towel, and knife, but before he began, remembered that he had not yet asked Juraviel when they would again stalk a deer, something the eager young man greatly wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped down from the tree house and moved about Caer\u0027alfar, spotting Juraviel talking with another elf across the way. Elbryan smiled sneakily and went into a crouch. Perhaps the only creature more difficult to surprise than the wary deer was the forest elf! Using all his skills, the young man picked his way through the trees, scampering across the opening, finding cover wherever he could. The other elves took little notice, hardly caring for his games, and Juraviel and his companion remained apparently oblivious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan put his back to a tree barely a dozen feet from the pair and considered his next move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Within six strides,\" Juraviel was saying in the elven tongue. \"Perhaps five. And the deer did not notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well done!\" the other congratulated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan nearly fainted away. He recognized the voice, melodic and higher pitched than Juraviel\u0027s, as that of Lady Dasslerond, the High Lady of Caer\u0027alfar and of all Andur\u0027Blough Inninness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was speaking of him! Elbryan held steady his breath, paying close attention, for though he could understand the melodic language, many individual words might elude him if he was not careful. With Lady Dasslerond speaking of him, the young man didn\u0027t want to miss a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the fighting, too,\" she went on, \"he is losing much of the clumsiness that comes with his human heritage, and what a combination of power and grace he shall be when one of his stature learns to wield the sword as an elf!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan peeked around the tree to see Juraviel nodding his agreement. He forgot all about his game of surprising the pair then, and used his stealth ability to extract himself from the area, return to his tree house -- which was closer to the ground than the sky -- to shave and to prepare himself for his next sparring session, one he suddenly intended to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly that evening, Elbryan walked onto the low meadow, ringed by tall, thick pines and capped by the starry canopy. He carried only a long smooth pole, his weapon. The elf was already there, and Elbryan breathed a sigh of relief when he noted that it was not Tuntun waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could never catch Tuntun off her guard; she relished the sparring matches, acting as if they were her personal forum for punishing the young man. After his first few encounters with the surly elf, Elbryan had wondered what it was that so prompted her desire to punish. Soon enough the young man had realized that it was for no particular act but merely because he was not elvish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis opponent this night was Tallareyish Issinshine, an older and calmer member of the elvish band. He was a quiet sort and rarely talked with Elbryan, though, according to Juraviel, Tallareyish had the finest singing voice in all of Andur\u0027Blough Inninness. Elbryan had sparred with him only once, very early in. his training, and had been put down rather easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this time,\" the young man muttered under his breath as he walked determinedly to the center of the meadow. He moved to a spot five feet from the sprite and bowed low, as did Tallareyish, in respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan presented his long pole horizontally in front of him; the elf responded by crossing his two smaller poles, replicas of slender elvish swords, in the air before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fight well,\" Tallareyish said, the proper beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you,\" Elbryan answered, and on he came, full of fury and determination. His skills had improved, so he had heard Juraviel say, and now he meant to show how much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started with a cunning feint, boring in, mock spear leading, as if he meant to overrun the diminutive elf, and then pulling to an abrupt stop and swishing his weapon hard to the side. He had to guess, of course, which way agile Tallareyish would spin, and even though he guessed correctly that the elf would go to his right, his swipe was batted aside, not once but three times, before it ever got close to hitting the mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTallareyish came right back in, wooden swords dancing and weaving, cutting figure eights and then darting straight ahead suddenly, viciously. Elbryan could not watch them and try to react. He had to anticipate, and so he did, flipping his spear over one hand counterclockwise and then back again, then again clockwise, then back the other way. He hardly saw the elf\u0027s attacks, but he took comfort in the clicking sounds as the twirling pole picked off each one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well done!\" Tallareyish commented, pressing the attack with every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan\u0027s green eyes sparkled with pride. He kept his focus, though, and knew that he had to get off the defensive posture. He had spent many hours with Juraviel playing the game the elves called pellell, resembling something close to a three-tiered chess match, and he had learned well the value of taking the initiative. At this point, Tallareyish was playing white, pressing the attack, but Elbryan meant to reverse that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver went his spinning pole, clockwise to his right, then it went over again, and then a third time, Elbryan sliding his foot further to the right with each spin. Tallareyish turned in pursuit and came forward, one step, left foot. Elbryan tensed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother step, right foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan caught his long pole in both hands to stop its spin. He threw it out diagonally to his left, then let go with his left hand, planted the pole against his right hip with his elbow, and swept it back across in front of him, forcing Tallareyish to fall a step to the side, forcing the elf\u0027s wooden weapon away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eager young man rushed through the opening, shuffling a few steps past Tallareyish\u0027s right flank, then cut a swift pivot, grabbing his pole down low with both hands and sweeping it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt swished through the air, hitting nothing, and Elbryan\u0027s eyes widened in shock as he came to realize that Tallareyish had followed his move perfectly, had run out right behind him. Elbryan was not surprised, therefore, when the elf\u0027s poles smacked him, but not so hard, on the rump and the back of the knee. His, leg nearly buckled, but he managed to swing about, his pole still flying in a desperate, wide arc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTallareyish ducked low under it and double-poked his weapons, stabbing at the young man\u0027s belly twice, though neither connected. The elf came forward suddenly, furiously, as Elbryan halted the flow of his pole and snapped it back to the ready, a beautiful recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one that might have worked against a human or a goblin. Tallareyish, though, was diving low before the pole ever got back in front of Elbryan. The elf went into a headlong roll, right between the young man\u0027s widespread legs, came up to his feet behind the yelling and turning Elbryan, and reversed his momentum, stabbing both his poles back. over his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan was already into his responding turn but not far enough; and the elf\u0027s blades poked him hard in the kidneys. Waves of pain buckled the young man\u0027s legs. He continued to swing, but he was down on one knee then, and his blurred vision didn\u0027t even register that Tallareyish had moved again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next hit, a heavy slash, caught the young man across the shoulder blades and laid him out facedown on the wet grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan lay still for a long, long while, his eyes closed, his thoughts whirling. He had come in so full of hope, and had gone down so very hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well done,\" he heard above him -- Juraviel\u0027s voice. The young man rolled over and opened his eyes; he was surprised to find that Tallareyish was no longer there, that Juraviel was apparently speaking to him, was, for some reason that Elbryan could not understand, congratulating him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you often salute corpses?\" Elbryan asked sarcastically, each word strained from the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuraviel only laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you,\" Elbryan said accusingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elf stopped his grinning and painted a serious expression, understanding the sudden gravity and frustration in the young man\u0027s tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Lady Dasslerond,\" Elbryan clarified. \"You said that I had come far in fighting as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuraviel\u0027s expression hardly changed, as if he didn\u0027t understand the point Elbryan was trying to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said that!\" the frustrated young man accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed,\" replied Juraviel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But here I am.\" Elbryan spat, pulling himself to his knees and tossing aside his pole -- a useless piece of wood, by his current estimation. He flinched as he straightened and grabbed at his kidney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here you are,\" Juraviel agreed, \"fighting better than any, Tuntun included, would have believed possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here I am,\" Elbryan corrected grimly, \"spitting grass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuraviel laughed aloud, something the young man obviously did not appreciate. \"Two in three,\" the elf remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan shook his head, not understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tallareyish\u0027s maneuver,\" Juraviel explained. \"The roll through your legs. Two in three attempts, it will work; the third equals complete disaster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan quieted and considered the thought. He didn\u0027t like his odds in that prospect -- only one in three -- but the mere fact that he had forced Tallareyish into so desperate a routine -- and any routine that held a reasonable chance of utter failure was indeed desperate-surprised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And of the two that work, only half will gain a solid strike,\" Juraviel went on. \"Even worse, you have now seen the `shadow dive,\u0027 as we call it, and you will never, ever be taken by it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tallareyish was worried,\" Elbryan said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tallareyish was nearly beaten,\" Juraviel agreed. \"You executed the plant of your staff on hip perfectly, and your step timing was without error. Even in running behind you was Tallareyish forced off his balance; that is why his passing strikes were of little consequence. Your turn, and subsequent blows, would have forced a close-quarters parry, at the very least, and no elf desires that with one of your size and strength.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he dove ahead,\" Elbryan concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was stumbling anyway,\" Juraviel explained. \"And only that stumble allowed your mighty swipe to go over his, head.\" The elf gave a chuckle. \"Had it connected, I fear that Tallareyish would still be lying facedown on the field!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan managed a smile. To think that he had almost won! To think that he had put one of the agile elves off his balance!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When first we began the sparring, any elf in Caer\u0027alfar could defeat you easily, with hardly any effort;\" Juraviel said. \"We drew lots each night to find your opponent, for none, other than Tuntun, wanted to waste time in battling you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbryan chuckled, not surprised that predictable Tuntun enjoyed issuing the beatings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now your opponents are selected carefully, as we bring to you different fighting styles, ones that we believe will offer you the greatest challenge. You have come far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have far to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuraviel would not argue the point. \"You heard my conversation,\" he replied. \"Our Lady was not exaggerating when she spoke of your potential, my young friend. With your great strength, and the elven sword dancing style, you will be the match of any man, of any elf, of any goblin, of any fomorian. You have been with us only four years and a season. You have time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last sentence brought a strange feeling over Elbryan. He was indeed grateful for the kind and optimistic words, and felt better, much better, about his loss to Tallareyish. But now something else tugged at him and put him on edge. What might come next for him? Elbryan had come to think of his life with the elves as a permanent arrangement, had figured that he would live in Andur\u0027Blough Inninness for the rest of his mortal days. The notion of going out from the enchanted valley, perhaps of walking with his own kind again, scared him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut also intrigued him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the world seemed much wider. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-demon-awakens-the-demonwars-saga-1/page-14.html","bookId":2167,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:32:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:32:39 PM"}
