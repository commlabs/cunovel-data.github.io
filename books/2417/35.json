A half mile away, on the far shore, the hills were dotted with cabins and radio towers. Occasionally a motorboat would zip by a few hundred yards away? a minute or so afterward we\u0027d find ourselves bobbing up and down as we cut through the wake. By the time we\u0027d turned the boat toward the mouth of Maple End Cove we had lake water up to our ankles and I\u0027d had to move my backpack off the floor and into my lap. Bip had assured us those little holes in the boat would be no problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison took off her shoes and was about to dangle her footsies over the side when I said, \"I wouldn\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. In the afternoon sun, the purple glasses cast long red reflections down her cheeks. \"What? They\u0027re already wet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the water. It\u0027s the moccasins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed ahead to a spot where the water was rippling a little bit more aggressively than the normal dips and swells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison brought her feet back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe passed the floating nest. A dozen or so green and silver whips were twisting into sailor\u0027s knots just below the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison whistled softly. \"Only snakes we had in Falfurrias got made into belts. Hope these guys understand if the boat sinks next to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too. Last year a waterskier took a spill into one of those nests. She died instantly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison put her feet up on my bench, one on either side of my legs. Her toenails were painted red. Her pants legs were rolled halfway up her tan calves and fit tight that way, not loose as they would\u0027ve on Carolaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rested her elbow on her knee and cupped her hand on her chin and blinked her eyes at me. \"I believe you made that up, Mr. Navarre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, tried not to smile. We puttered along past the snakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe southern tip of Maple End Cove, sure enough, had a huge maple tree jutting from the top of the ridge. Maples are pretty rare in Texas, but this one apparently hadn\u0027t heard the news that it wasn\u0027t supposed to thrive. It was at least thirty feet tall and blazing with fall colours. The rocky ground around it was littered with burnt orange and apple yellow. At the waterline below, several women were sunbathing on an old floating pontoon dock. There were stairs cut into the rock, leading down to the dock, but they stopped a good twenty feet above, where the waterline used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cove narrowed quickly as our boat puttered into it. After one curve the banks on either side were no more than twenty yards apart. The water this far back was murky green and smelled of stagnation—scum and leaking septic material and dead fish. The shoreline on the right was fairly steep and thick with cedars and live oaks, all the branches overgrown with spiky Spanish moss. I could glimpse the tops of semis or RVs speeding along the highway above where Elgin was parked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two cabins, both on that side of the cove. The one farther down was a wellkept whiteshingled house set almost at the top of the ridge. At the water level was a floating dock, and above that a small patch of lawn grass. A handpainted wooden sign meant to be read from the water proudly announced: THE HEIDEL MANS, with daisies and frogs all around the letters. There was a small army of plastic waterfowl with wind propellers for wings surrounding the sign and a flagstone path up to the house. The windows were all shuttered and no lights were on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half acre closer to us was a militarystyle Quonset hut that jutted out of the slope about halfway between the water and the highway. It had a wooden deck facing the water. The front wall was painted chocolate brown, with a screen door and two windows covered in yellow curtains. The hut\u0027s shell was an arc of corrugated aluminium as dull as the inside of a food can. There was a metal pipe chimney in the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My husband,\" Allison sighed. \"Wonder if I can figure out which one of these is his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut the boat\u0027s engine and drifted into the tall weeds by the shore below the Quonset hut. The boat ground against the rocks as it came to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a dock, sort of. The cement pylons were still there, and a few boards not yet rotted to splinters. I wasn\u0027t sure I wanted to trust them with my weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen feet to the left of the dock there was a sunken boat sticking its prow out of the water. The remnants of Bip\u0027s last customer, maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sloshed and slipped my way onto dry land. Allison stayed right behind me. I looked up at the dark windows and the closed door of the Quonset hut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Elgin was smart, if he was keeping watch because he thought Les might show up here, he\u0027d have his partner Frank somewhere down here. Maybe at the Heidelmans, or even inside Les\u0027 cabin. Of course if Elgin was smart, he wouldn\u0027t have been so damn easy to spot on the highway. I figured we had a fighting chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe climbed what passed for steps—old boards hammered perpendicularly into the clay of the hill. The stairs to the deck were on the side of the cabin. Nobody on the highway could\u0027ve seen us from there. Nobody jumped out of the woods in commando gear. We made plenty of creaks and cracks getting to the front door. If anybody was inside, they\u0027d sure as hell know we were coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was padlocked—one of those loops slotted through a metal hinge. Dumb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got Allison to hand me a Phillips head out of my backpack and removed the base of the hinge in less than a minute. We could\u0027ve gone through the window pretty easily too, but I wasn\u0027t ready to break glass just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went inside the hut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison said, \"Yuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dark. It smelled like rotten food and sour laundry. In the light of my pencil flashlight it was difficult to piece together exactly what we were seeing, what happened here. There was an unmade single bed against the left wall. A portable stereo against the right littered all around with CDs and cassettes. The CD carriage was sticking out—the \"drink holder,\" as my brother Garrett called it. The floor was covered in grass mat that was starting to tear into separate squares. The curved roof was covered with black cloth that just made the space seem more claustrophobic. In the back was a kitchenette and a phone and one shuttered window and a tiny walledin area that must\u0027ve been the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen our eyes adjusted to the dark Allison went into the kitchen and lifted a pan of halfscrambled eggs from the electric grill. They were rubberized in places, crystallized in others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two eggs for breakfast,\" Allison said. \"Every day, no exceptions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He left halfway through making those,\" I said. \"What do you think—about two or three days ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison shuddered, put the pan down. \"Something like that. So the bastard\u0027s alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded less than thrilled. She gave me a tentative smile. \"I guess I figured that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s just—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hooked her thumbs in her borrowed Banana Republics, looked around at her feet where men\u0027s clothes were strewn around as if somebody had walked through a laundry pile. Then she kicked one of Les\u0027 shirts with a vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went into the bathroom. A man\u0027s toiletry bag was in the sink, next to a propanepowered Destroilet with directions on the lid about how to avoid a house fire when you flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out my Polaroid and took a picture of the toilet. Nobody would believe me about it, otherwise. Then I took some pictures of the rest of the cabin—the eggs, the laundry, the scattered CDs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the kitchen counter and picked up the phone. The line was active. I set the switch from touch tone to pulse and pressed redial. I was pretty sure I got the number on the first listen but I hung up before it rang, then tried it again. I wrote the number on my hand and let the phone ring. No answer on ten, no answering machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison said, \"Tres.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned. She was looking at me reproachfully, holding the frying pan with the eggs. As quietly as possible she said, \"Well? This or the Mace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wha—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I heard the creaking, from outside, like someone trying to climb the old porch steps with at least some semblance of stealth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e38\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow moved across the yellow curtain into the doorway and became Frank the Bubba, my courteous shakedown deputy from the night before. He scowled and smushed his nose against the screen door, trying to see into the interior gloom. He was wearing jeans and an orange Hawaiian shirt. More advanced surveillance techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Allison. \"You\u0027re a lot of fun. But right now I want you to put down the frying pan, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank\u0027s eyes adjusted to the dark. He focused on me. I smiled and waved. He looked at Allison. Slowly, she lowered the pan and waved too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we had a gun,\" she speculated quietly, \"we could\u0027ve shot him five or six times by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" I told her. \"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank opened the door and came inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was lyescrubbed red and his eyes were bleary. His blond moustache whiskers spiked at weird angles. He looked groggy and irritated but not particularly surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" he said. \"You two really need to be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walkietalkie on his belt made a click, then a metallic crackling sound. He kept his eyes on me while he picked it up. \"Never mind, Garwood. False alarm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garbled response sounded vaguely like Elgin\u0027s voice. I couldn\u0027t make out what he said but apparently Frank could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said. \"It was nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank turned the volume knob down to zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"False alarm?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank scanned the room, tapping the walkietalkie against his thigh. \"Elgin has some ideas what he might do if he ever sees you again. I don\u0027t want him to get too excited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank looked around for a place to sit, opted for the bed. He sank into the foam mattress, hesitated, then crossed his legs and began to pry off his left boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got to excuse me,\" he grumbled. \"Feet are killing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison said, \"You want us to rub them for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was leaning against the kitchen counter, head on her hand like she was bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at me and said, \"This guy managed to get you on the pavement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank\u0027s ears turned the same colour orange as his Hawaiian shirt. He raised his eyebrows at me. \"New woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allison SaintPierre. She\u0027s charming, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name registered, maybe the reputation, too. Frank gave me a weary look of condolence. He switched legs and tugged off the other boot. His socks were two slightly different shades of blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I didn\u0027t like what happened last night, Mr. Navarre. I didn\u0027t like it worth a damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try being the one with your nose in the gravel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile flickered underneath the moustache. \"You don\u0027t get what I\u0027m saying. People bother Mr. Sheckly, I got no problem pushing them around a little. That\u0027s not my beef.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reassuring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison sighed. She fiddled wistfully with the Mace on her key chain, picking at the little plastic tab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheck takes care of his people,\" Frank continued. \"It\u0027s a closeknit county out here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP.I.s come around all year long, sticking their noses into the Paintbrush\u0027s business, looking for paternity suits, blackmail photos, you name it. I don\u0027t have any problem dissuading them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Planting guns in their cars,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank sat quiet for a long time, then apparently decided something. He sat forward, reached into his wallet, and pulled out a photograph. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-35.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
