I can\u0027t find anywhere in the manuscript where Kelley mentions the cemetery by name, and-\" Allen sat up, eyes going unfocused, a strange expression on his face. \"Cemetery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny reached for him, stopped short. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my dreams,\" Allen said. \"I\u0027ve been seeing images of a cemetery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy asked, \"Would you recognize it if you saw it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s make that our priority,\" Penny said. \"We\u0027ll put his name into Google and find out where he\u0027s buried. There\u0027s an internet caf¨¦ upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after we find out, then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it obvious?\" A mischievous smile spread over Penny\u0027s face. \"We go grave robbing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNinety minutes later they had nothing. None of the popular historical websites or Wikipedia mentioned Roderick by name, although accounts of alchemists and astrologers and other occult figures at court were plentiful. Amy brought up pictures of various graveyards around Prague, but Allen could not say for sure that any one of them matched his dream images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the diary doesn\u0027t say either,\" Allen said. \"Kelley says Roderick was entombed, and that he put the stone in with him. And he calls Rudolph a madman. But nothing about the name of the cemetery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny turned away from the computer screen, rubbed her eyes. \"This is useless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I had all the time in the world, I could find it,\" Allen said. \"But if I have to dig up a grave, I\u0027d like to be in and out of the cemetery before nightfall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why before nightfall?\" Penny asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy put her fingers up to her mouth and mimed a set of fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny blanched. \"Oh, yeah.\" Amy\u0027s recent revelation still troubled her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of them sat there. A minute passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There might be somebody who can help,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny crossed her arms. \"If you say somebody from your precious Society, I\u0027ll scream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Somebody freelance. The Society puts him on specialized errands from time to time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This person is safe?\" Allen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can keep his mouth shut, if that\u0027s what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy and Allen stood in the doorway of the two-story brick building in the old Jewish Quarter. The Quarter-Josefov-had an almost claustrophobic feel, the old buildings crowding the narrow, cobblestone street, souvenir kiosks hogging much of the sidewalk. To Allen, the Quarter felt old, with so much more history then the Letna area and the younger Hole\u0026amp;#353;ovice suburb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy raised her hand to knock but cast a sideways glance at Allen. \"You sure about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no time for anything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was already late afternoon. It had taken hours to track down Amy\u0027s contact, and Allen felt more and more nervous every minute they inched toward nightfall. Allen worried with growing apprehension that there were still bits of Cassandra\u0027s vampiric hypnotism lingering in his subconscious, and he couldn\u0027t be sure how he would react if he saw her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy knocked. They waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere nearby Penny had installed herself at a caf¨¦ or coffeehouse. She didn\u0027t tell them where in case Allen and Amy were interrogated, but she was close at hand in case she needed to effect some kind of rescue or, at the very least, call in the cavalry. Penny had raised holy hell about being left out, but she could see the wisdom of the maneuver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy was about to knock again, when the door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abraham Zabel?\" Amy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked from Amy to Allen and back again. \"You\u0027re the one who called earlier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I\u0027m Abraham Zabel. Please come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen thought Zabel did not look anything like he imagined a wizard should look. Maybe he was thinking too much of Gandalf. Zabel looked like Allen\u0027s dentist. Allen hated his dentist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel led them into a small sitting room. The furnishings were old-not Commie surplus, but not quite antiques either. Threadbare chairs, a table that needed polishing, tall shelves filled with books, a small Persian rug, also threadbare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel didn\u0027t sit, didn\u0027t offer chairs to Amy or Allen. \"So what can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to speak with a dead man,\" Amy told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel nodded. \"Uh-huh. Who\u0027s paying for this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m with the Society. I know you\u0027ve done jobs for us before, and I was hoping our credit was good. It\u0027s sort of a rush job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel frowned, eyes darting around the room. \"What do you know about my work for the Society?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No details,\" Amy said. \"I heard your name, knew you were in Prague. I\u0027m not even sure you have a spell for what we need, but we had to try something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to relax, scratched his chin. \"I have a spell. How long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The person you want to speak with,\" Zabel said. \"How long\u0027s he been dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little over four hundred years,\" Allen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel laughed. \"Who do you want, Rudolph the Second himself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward Kelley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel stopped laughing. \"Who sent you here? Somebody\u0027s playing a joke on you. Or on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" Amy said. \"We think the philosopher\u0027s stone is-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The philosopher\u0027s stone?\" Now Zabel laughed again. \"Now I know you\u0027re jerking me. Save it for the tourists, okay? We\u0027ve all heard the legends. I don\u0027t have time for jokes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a joke,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Zabel said. \"You expect me to pluck a four-hundred-year-old ghost from the cosmos and bring him here so you can play twenty questions. Spells like that are complex. I\u0027d need a lock of his hair or some clothing, something to help focus the spell. Otherwise it\u0027s pointless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about this?\" Allen held out the manuscript. \"It\u0027s Edward Kelley\u0027s diary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis caught Zabel by surprise. He looked at the manuscript. \"His what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found it in Strahov Monastery,\" Allen said. \"It\u0027s handwritten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel reached for the manuscript, and took it carefully. \"This has to be some kind of hoax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen shook his head. \"It was kept in the library\u0027s special collection. It was among the items relocated from the castle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The philosopher\u0027s stone.\" A hint of reverence crept into Zabel\u0027s voice. He ran his hand over the cracked leather. \"Lead into gold. It\u0027s nonsense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it has anything to do with gold,\" Amy said. \"The stone represents a kind of power. Something never seen before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood in a small circle, nobody speaking. Zabel had a faraway look in his eyes. He bit his thumbnail in thought while he held the manuscript in his other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" Zabel said, \"that you\u0027ve piqued my curiosity. Wait here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel left and returned two minutes later with a black leather bag, the Kelley diary tucked under one arm. He motioned for Amy and Allen to follow him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy asked, \"Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the roof,\" Zabel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed him up to the second floor, down a hall and into a small bedroom, up a tight spiral staircase to a trapdoor in the ceiling. Zabel slid back an iron bolt, threw the hatch open. Daylight flooded in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey climbed out onto the roof. There was a clean breeze, a good view of the castle beyond the river. Zabel pulled over a small table, placed the diary in the center. He opened his black bag and began to fish around for items. He came out with a squat, black candle, lit it from a book of matches, and set it next to the diary. Allen squirmed at the sight of the open flame near the old manuscript but said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel measured various powders into a mortar and pestle, crushed some dried leaves and other ingredients into the mix. He mumbled words that danced just at the edge of Allen\u0027s comprehension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I help with something?\" Amy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just stay out of the way.\" Businesslike. No time for chitchat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d crushed and mixed the powder to his satisfaction, he took a handful, flung it at the candle flame with a few harsh syllables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA purple gout of flame erupted from the candle, engulfed the entire rooftop. Allen and Amy flinched, but the flame was cool, didn\u0027t burn. The purple light continued to shimmer around them, turned the world beyond the rooftop into a hazy blur, like they were looking at Prague through the bottom of a bottle of grape soda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" Amy whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen agreed. Damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a particularly potent casting,\" Zabel said. \"Usually I do this for people who\u0027ve lost a loved one, six months dead or a year. I thought I\u0027d better crank up the power for what we need. I hope I haven\u0027t overdone it. I wouldn\u0027t want this to turn into a cattle call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" Amy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes the summoning catches other spirits. Not all ghosts are at the same level of self-awareness. A powerful spell like this... moths to a flame. Even when it\u0027s not meant for them, they often come anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t sound very useful,\" Allen said. \"Do we have to wait very long or-shit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen jumped back, bumped into Amy. A glowing apparition hovered in front of him. A young girl, a ragged slice across her throat. Her eyes were hollow, her mouth open, a vague moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just Bethany,\" Zabel said. \"She haunts the building next door, so she didn\u0027t have far to come. Murdered, I think, but I don\u0027t know the whole story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" Allen tried to sound sarcastic, but it came out slightly frightened. \"How many more of these things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel grinned. \"Wait and see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs wizards go, Zabel is a better technician than he is a scholar. You can see he has little interest in reading my diary. To him it\u0027s more useful as a component for his spell. But he knows about the philosopher\u0027s stone-the legends, anyway. The notion that the stone holds some secret power appeals to his natural wizardly greed for power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose it\u0027s possible that-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you feel that? No? Okay, sorry. Got distracted. As I was saying-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it is again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t tell me you didn\u0027t feel that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel it tugging me so hard that I dig in my heels. Not actually my heels, of course. That\u0027s just the outside manifestation of my resistance. If you were able to see me being dragged along the halls of Prague Castle, you\u0027d see my heels digging in, my hands grabbing at doorknobs and window ledges, like a doomed astronaut trying to keep from being blown out an airlock. That\u0027s what it looks like, but it\u0027s with my mind that I resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t fight it too long. Too strong. Some mighty hand that has reached for me, grabbed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go with the flow and start to fly, sailing over the castle walls and toward the river. I haven\u0027t been this far in decades. I stop wondering what\u0027s happening to me, such is the awe of seeing this part of Prague again for the first time in so very long. I\u0027m over the river now, a tour barge below me, young couples sipping wine. I am equal parts blue sky and wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe far bank comes into view, crowded Josefov beyond that. I have not seen the Jewish Quarter in three hundred years. I glance to the right and to the left. A half-dozen glowing streaks in the sky, ghosts like me. We converge on the same place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pulsing purple beacon on a Josefov rooftop. I feel like a kite being reeled in, right toward the rooftop. People standing there I recognize. I already know them, yet I\u0027ve never met them before. Time works so strange here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI land on the rooftop. Zabel is there, sending away other ghosts, lost souls. Confused. I don\u0027t want this. I try to blend in, hide toward the back of the crowd. Zabel spots me over the shoulder of another ghost, and I look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resist, but it\u0027s no use. I float toward him. He has me now. The other ghosts fade, dissolve, dismissed. They evaporate to whatever perpetual doom they call home. It\u0027s only me and Amy and Allen and Zabel holding my leash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are Edward Kelley?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say nothing. My ghost teeth bite my ghost tongue. The pain is real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARE YOU EDWARD KELLEY?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabel pauses to say something to Allen and Amy, but I can\u0027t hear it. It\u0027s as if a translucent, purple curtain hangs between us. Zabel turns back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell me about the philosopher\u0027s stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Zabel gets tough. I feel something, like he\u0027s reaching inside me, strong-arming. It feels like cold iron fingers in my chest, getting a hold of my soul, squeezing it like a physical thing. I scream, and nobody hears it. I cry. Nobody sees the tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the look on Zabel\u0027s face. Annoyed. Like he couldn\u0027t open a tough jar of peanut butter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there is pain. I talk, spill everything I\u0027ve ever known or will know about the stone. I\u0027m not sure how long it takes. I talk until I stop, and then Zabel asks another question and I talk again. It becomes a kind of confession, but Zabel becomes impatient whenever I get too personal. He cares not one tiny shit about my tortured soul. Just the facts, man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m weeping. Telling it all over again. It has been so long, so many years. To talk to somebody and have them talk back. But he\u0027s finished before I am. I want to tell him so much more, so much I\u0027ve seen over the years and centuries. Zabel\u0027s indifference is like a punch in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere is Roderick the astrologer buried?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tell him. Why not? I\u0027d tell him anything. Just please keep talking to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vysehrad. Prague\u0027s other castle. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-a-go-go/page-22.html","bookId":2600,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM"}
