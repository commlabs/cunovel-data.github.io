I guarantee you, you’ve never seen someone who can wait like me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m more patient than anyone, maybe even more patient than an eighty-year-old man. I used to live in the deep mountains, and once, I waited to see a camellia bloom. Can you guess how long I waited?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No less than three days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you picked the flower and pinned it onto your coat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” said Little Gao. “Once it bloomed, I just left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You waited three days just to watch the few seconds of a flower blooming?” Zheng Cheng was also a patient person, so he understood Little Gao’s deeper meaning. “No matter what you are waiting for, you have a reason for waiting. Even though you didn’t pick the flower, you still achieved your purpose. And it wasn’t simply to watch the camellia bloom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What other purpose would I have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A flower is also a life, and the instant that it bloomed, it was the birth of a life. When a life is born into the world, it is profound and miraculous. Nothing in the world can compare to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at Little Gao “I think that the three days you spent were not wasted. After your observation concluded, your sword technique would have improved significantly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao looked at him, surprised. This ordinary, square-jawed young man was much more intelligent than he appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s even more important to have a purpose when waiting for people. You surely won’t wait for Mr. Zhuo to arrive and then just leave.” Zheng Cheng calmly asked, “What is your purpose this time?” He didn’t let Little Gao respond. “There’s no need to answer the question. I don’t want to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You asked me. Why don’t you want an answer? Why don’t you want to know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because the less one knows, the better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you didn’t want to know, then why did you ask?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wanted to give you a reminder: if I say something like this, then Mr. Zhuo is also thinking it. And when he asks you the question, you’d better have a good response, a reason that will satisfy him. Otherwise, it would be better not to wait for him.” He was very solemn and sincere. “There are not many people alive who have left Mr. Zhuo unsatisfied.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he finished speaking, he began to leave. He didn’t want to see Little Gao’s reaction to his statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when he reached the door, he looked back. “There’s something else I forgot to tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Zhuo instructed me to give you anything you want, regardless of what it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He really said that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao laughed. His laugh was extremely joyful. “That’s wonderful. Extremely wonderful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Zhuo Donglai called Zheng Cheng in, it was already almost noon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng Cheng couldn’t see anything different about him. It was as if all the tragic and fearsome things that had happened yesterday had nothing to do with him. What had Zhuo Qing done to exact revenge? He didn’t mention or ask about it at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just asked Zheng Cheng, “Is Gao Jianfei still waiting?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. He’s still waiting,” said Zheng Cheng. “But his request was impossible to completely fulfil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was his request?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wanted me to in two hours time arrange for twenty tables of the finest food and drink, all prepared by cooks from Chang’an Restaurant and Brilliant Lake Spring restaurant. He also wanted me to in two hours time find all the finest professional working girls in Chang’an to drink with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many did you get?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I found 72, at least half of which were already in bed with a man and had to be pulled out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai laughed. “At that hour, any girl who isn’t it bed with a man surely isn’t a professional. You did well. It must have been quite a lively morning here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Extremely lively. All the Agency brothers who can drink ended up joining him. He wanted everyone to celebrate with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Celebrate? Celebrate what?” asked Zhuo Donglai. “What is it about today that he thinks is worth celebrating?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t say. But I’ve always said, many people act like this when they think they will die soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai thought for a moment, and his pupils suddenly began to constrict. After a very long time he said, “Unfortunately, I happen to know that for the moment, there is no way that he will die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wine had been drunk, the guests departed. In the courtyard and the hall were a few broken hairpins and discarded necklaces, some belts and gauze stockings along with broken snuff bottles and rouge boxes as well as some other unidentifiable objects. It seemed as if they had all been especially placed so that the host would know that everyone was thoroughly drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the host?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the host wasn’t drunk, how could the guests truly enjoy themselves?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao looked like he was dead, laying face down on a long table. But when Zhuo Donglai arrived, the dead person awoke, and let out a long sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you always wait until everyone is gone before you show up? Do you really hate seeing people enjoy themselves?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai looked at him coldly. “I definitely don’t like it. There’s nothing amusing at all about waking up and seeing drunk people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at Little Gao. “Thankfully, you’re not drunk. The others are drunk, but not you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao’s eyes held not the slightest fraction of intoxication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can see you are quite sober,” said Zhuo Donglai. “More sober than a rabbit in spring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao laughed, a hearty laugh. “You’re not mistaken. Not mistaken at all.” Laughing, he said, “Your eyes are sharper than the eyes of a fox in autumn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You get others drunk. Why aren’t you drunk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I knew the fox would be coming sooner or later. When a fox is coming, the rabbit needs to stay sober.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If a fox arrives, it won’t help the rabbit to be sober.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If a rabbit knows a fox is coming, the best thing to do is run away as fast as possible.” Zhuo Donglai laughed. “Unless, of course, the rabbit isn’t afraid of the fox!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could a rabbit not be afraid of a fox?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because behind the rabbit is a spear, a spear pointed at the fox’s heart. The spear could pierce the fox’s heart at any time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spear?” Little Gao blinked. “Where is a spear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai laughed. “Obviously it comes from within a solitary box. A solitary box, once lost, but then found again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao laughed. He did not blink again, and in fact a look of heartfelt admiration filled his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You found out?” he asked Zhuo Donglai. “How did you find out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think I found out? I just know that there is a type of person in the world, who, when they lose to someone, will find a way to repay the debt tenfold. I know that Xiao Leixue just so happens to be that type of person, and he just so happens to have found you already.” He laughed. “I know this little bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao looked at him for a long time, and then sighed. “That’s not just a little bit, that’s a lot. No wonder Xiao Leixue told me that doing business with Mr. Zhuo is not fun. Often there are things you don’t need to say, because he knows already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai’s smile was beginning to seem forced. “Unfortunately, I don’t know how much I actually know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know that I was sent here by Xiao Leixue?” Little Gao answered the question himself. “Of course you know. And you most certainly know that what he sent me here to discuss isn’t something good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are many types of bad things. What type did he send you here to discuss?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The worst type, basically.” Little Gao sighed again. “If it weren’t for the fact that I owe him a favor, I wouldn’t have been willing to come talk with you about it at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wrong!” Zhuo Donglai smiled again. “In this point, you are wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What point?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In some aspects, the best types of things turn out to be the worst. And in some ways, the worst types of things turn out to be the best. In the world of men, many situations are like this.” He continued to explain, “If Mr. Xiao had decided not to send someone to talk with me, but instead decided to come in the middle of the night when no one is around, and bring along his box… Well, that would be the worst type of thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So no matter what it is he sent me here to talk with you about, you won’t be too upset?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s excellent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, Little Gao’s expression became very solemn. Imitating Zhuo Donglai’s own tone, he said, one word at a time, “He wants me to take over Sima Chaoqun’s position. To bear the standard of the Great Protection Agency, and to be its ultimate leader.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone would expect Zhuo Donglai to leap up upon hearing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn’t even blink. He just coolly asked Little Gao: “That’s what Xiao Leixue wants?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” And then Little Gao asked, “What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai didn’t even take a moment to consider. He simply responded with two words. “Very good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very good?” Little Gao was shocked. “What do you mean by ‘very good?’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai smiled, and then bowed toward Little Gao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very good means that your excellency has already become the head of the Great Protection Agency. You hold the number one seat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao was flabbergasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai’s attitude was already becoming more respectful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From today on, the brave leaders of the thirty-six routes are under your command. If anyone does not comply, Zhuo Donglai’s blade will be the first to chop them down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at Little Gao with his dark, grey eyes. “But from today on, you are part of the Great Protection Agency. The Agency follows the course set by the leader. You must be utterly loyal and spare no efforts in your service. The troubles of the Great Protection Agency are your troubles, its enemies are your enemies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao finally let out a sigh. “I understand what you mean.” He laughed bitterly. “At first I didn’t understand why you would agree so quickly. But now I get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was always this way. Just like the two edges of a treasured sword.” Zhuo Donglai’s voice was solemn and calm. “If you wish to gain something, you must pay a price.” His voice suddenly became hoarse. “I think you know what price Sima Chaoqun paid in the past.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you?” asked Little Gao. “What did you pay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai laughed. “What did I pay? What did I gain?” Pain filled his laughter. “I’m afraid I can’t answer that question, because even I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not lying, and his words really were filled with emotion. So much so that even Little Gao had begun to feel sorry for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, Zhuo Donglai quickly regained his rock-like calm. And then he raised a question sharper than a blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m willing to let you lead the Great Protection Agency. And I’m willing to swear my loyalty and my service to you. I believe that we understand each other, and can benefit from this kind of arrangement. But, what about others?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Others?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Great Protection agency is comprised of forces on thirty-six routes. To get them to sincerely support your leadership will not be easy. What are you willing to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think I should do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First you must gain prestige, and then you can have trust. When you have trust, you can command the heroes and make people obey you. For you to assume this position, you of course must first gain prestige.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gain prestige? How do I gain prestige?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sima and I have gone our separate ways. He’s already disappeared in a rage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you know, then I’m quite certain many others know. Before his death, Zhuo Qing would not have forgotten to dispatch people to carry the news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As long as it didn\u0027t interfere with his revenge, and he had the means, I’m sure he wouldn’t forget. I think he could do a lot of things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you heard that Xiao Leixue sent me to take over leadership of the Great Protection Agency, you had no inclination to oppose. Because you need my help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai didn’t deny this point. “Right now, our circumstances are not stable. Mr. Xiao presumably understands the situation well, and so he sent you here.” He continued, “Mr. Xiao and I understand each other, and I would never have considered refusing.” He looked at Gao Jianfei and said, one word at a time, “To gain prestige in these circumstances, you must use the most effective and direct method.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao looked at him. After a long time, he asked, one word at a time, “Are you saying I must kill Zhu Meng?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is your requirement?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a requirement, it’s an inevitability,” he said coldly. “Faced with this kind of inevitability, we really have no other choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Jianfei suddenly stood up and walked to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the snow had not yet melted. The weather was clear and sunny, but everything was still covered in white. The sky had become an azure blue. Far in the distance, a white cloud floated past. It came to a stop, and then flew again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long time passed. Zhuo Donglai sighed. “I understand. You and Zhu Meng are men of Jianghu. You take promises very seriously, and you don’t care about death. You know that living and dying can be determined by the snap of a finger.” His words were sincere. “You met by chance, but instantly got along. You will be together until death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, a sigh truly filled with emotion. “In the eyes of those ‘gentlemen’ who don’t truly understand friendship, perhaps you don’t count as friends. But I understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued: “So I also understand that to ask you to kill Zhu Meng is truly grievous. Not just for you, or for him, but for everyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao was speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I hope that you understand something,” said Zhuo Donglai. “If you don’t kill Zhu Meng, someone else will. If he doesn’t die by your hand, he will die by someone else’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When the Qin State lost the support of the people, everyone under heaven vied for power. Sima Chaoqun lost his position in exactly the same circumstances. And therefore, Zhu Meng’s head has already become the target of any hero among the 36 routes of the Great Protection Agency who wishes to seize power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued to explain: “Zhu Meng is the hero of a lifetime, and he is the archenemy of the Great Protection Agency. Anyone in the Agency who can take his head will gain enough prestige to assume Sima’s place. At the least, there are three people who have a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you fear them!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I fear is not them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why don’t you seize the position?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because of you,” said Zhuo Donglai. “I don’t fear you, but when you add Xiao Leixue into the mix, it is an unstoppable force.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet again, he spoke the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The reason I didn’t kill Zhu Meng before was because I wished to leave him for Sima. And the reason I don’t kill him now is because I wish to leave him for you. It would be better for him to die by your hand than another’s. In any case, he is a dead man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao suddenly turned around and stared at him. His eyes were bloodshot, his face colorless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The three people you mentioned. Have they already arrived in Chang’an?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most likely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A ruthless sword, a deadly spear, and a hidden weapon coated in barkcloth tree poison. Each one is qualified to be listed among the 70 most fearsome weapons under heaven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I asked you who they are, not what weapons they use.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are all killers, and they all have informants in Chang’an.

Do you want every last person in the Lion Clan to be wiped out and exterminated?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, no one moved. No one said anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng forcefully ripped the belt off his waist, a leather strap as wide as a hand.

It seemed as if he had no feelings whatsoever regarding what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, fresh blood oozed from the corner of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was grinding his teeth too hard, and had bitten himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind blew.

If you wish to stay behind to die with me, then I’ll let you stay. But,” he said harshly, “you must not forget, whether it is me or Sima Chaoqun who prevails in this battle, it has nothing to do with you. You must not make a move against him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun suddenly gave a cold laugh. “It’s useless.

The thunderbolt-like fury suddenly subsided into calm.

Could it be that ‘Fierce Lion” Zhu Meng is nothing more than a coward?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng suddenly laughed, a wild laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well said. Well cursed. Cursed really freaking well.” He laughed like a shrieking ape. “Sadly, it’s really useless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Sima Chaoqun was still laughing coldly. “What are you farting about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Zhu Meng was not angry. In fact, he let out a long sigh. “Sima Chaoqun, you are a true man. In my whole life of roaming, I’ve never admired anyone. Yet now, I have to give you a little admiration. But if you think that Zhu Meng is just a boorish man who doesn’t know right from wrong, then you’re mistaken. I understand what you’re thinking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t need to try to provoke me into killing you. And you don’t need to use these methods to try to piss me off. I’m defeated. I’ve lost my soul like an idiot, because of a woman; I am more heart-broken than if my own mother died.” He suddenly slapped his chest. “But as long as I have breath left in my body, I’ll fight to the bitter end. You don’t need to provoke me, I will definitely keep going all the way to the finish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zhu Meng’s head isn’t here for just anyone to take. Not even to help you achieve your aims. And I don’t need your help to achieve my aims.” His large eyes stared at Sima Chaoqun. “Our battle today is not about life and death, victory and defeat. I don’t care about that. However, it seems like you are trying to help me.” His voice became more harsh. “If you try to do that, then you are not a person raised by loving parents, but a person raised by dogs. If you hold back even one move or stance, then I will die here and come back as an evil spirit to haunt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun looked at him, at his large bloodshot eyes, at his frame, which, although gaunt, still carried the spirit of a fierce lion. After a long time, he said, “Very well. I promise you. No matter what, in today’s battle I will use all my power and fight to the death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng looked at him, this man who had once been the most outstanding figure in the world, the greatest hero under heaven, and yet who had fallen deep into the muck. He let out a sigh. “You and I are doomed to be enemies. I only wish that in my next left, we can be friends. Regardless of who wins or loses today, who lives or dies, this is my wish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind grew colder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distant mountains were cold, the dark grave was cold.

Zhu Meng never imagined he would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he was knocked down. The two of them rolled on the ground. Zhu Meng’s anger rose.

The two of them stood shoulder to shoulder, panting unceasingly.

It’s the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng said nothing. A long time passed. Then he spoke. “Yes. It’s the truth,” he said, his voice filled with sadness. “Sima is not the same Sima from the former days, and Zhu Meng isn’t the same Zhu Meng as before. Otherwise, how could we be pursued like wild dogs into the middle of nowhere?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand what you mean. You would rather die than flee. The world only has Zhu Meng the killer, not Zhu Meng the escaper. But why would you be willing to give your head to despicable, brazen villains?

I think it would be much better to deliver them to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was both far and the near, both from the left and then the right. It made it impossible to tell where exactly he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng’s body grew stiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis person was not Zhuo Donglai, and was more fearsome than Zhuo Donglai. In his entire life, Zhu Meng had never encountered someone with a more frighteningly high level of lightness kung fu. He simply couldn’t believe that there could be someone in the world who had achieved such ability, to be able to flit about at will like a demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quickly regained his calm, as Sima Chaoqun whispered in his ear, “It’s not one person speaking, it’s twins. As long as we remain calm, they won’t act rashly. We mustn’t allow them to see the truth about our current state.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, the two of them were suddenly illuminated. Every wrinkle and scar and expression was illuminated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least thirty deftly constructed Kongming lanterns shone brightly in all directions, shining onto their bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this instant, they stood there straight and erect, their faces expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though they could not see their opponents, they would not allow their opponents to see their fatigue and pain and fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had fought through hundreds of battles.

Very well said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the laughter rang out from both the right and the left at the same time. And then two people walked out from the darkness into the shining lantern light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked completely different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne wore a crown of pearls and a jade belt, and carried a long, pearl-encrusted sword.

And which one was truly content?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng could not figure out the answer to this question, and in the current situation, he didn’t have time to continue thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Sima Chaoqun speak to the brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I knew you two would arrive.” He was still smiling. “Several years ago, you had already cultivated the desire to expel me from the Great Protection Agency.
