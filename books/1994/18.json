{"id":74599,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u003cp\u003eRush\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you not remember what I asked you the other day, Nan?\" I snarled once Blaire and her cart were out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were being pathetic. I was trying to help you not look like a lovesick loser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around and stalked toward her. She was pushing me. I\u0027d never had that all consuming rage most brothers have to physically harm their sisters when we were younger. But right now I was experiencing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant stepped in front of me putting a barrier between us. \"Whoa. You need to back off and calm down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted my glare from Nan to Grant. What the fuck was he doing? He hated Nan. \"Move. This is between me and my sister,\" I reminded him. He\u0027d never claimed her before. Even when his father had been married to our mother he\u0027d made sure we all understood he hated Nan. There had never been even a remote sibling attachment between those two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re gonna have to go through me to get to your sister,\" Grant replied taking a step in my direction. \"\u0027Cause right now you aren\u0027t thinking about anyone\u0027s feelings but Blaire\u0027s. Remember how Blaire\u0027s presence affects Nan. You cared about that once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the fuck! Was I hallucinating? When did Grant start defending Nan? \"I know exactly how Blaire affects Nan. But what I\u0027m trying to get through to her is that nothing was Blaire\u0027s fault. Nan has hated the wrong person for so damn long she can\u0027t let go. What the hell is wrong with you anyway? You already knew this! You were the one who championed Blaire when she first showed up here. You never believed this was her fault. You saw her innocence in this from the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant shifted uncomfortably and then glanced back at Nan whose eyes had gone as round as saucers. \"You made her weak, Rush. All her life you protected her. She relied on you. Then you go and drop her and focus all your attention on Blaire and expect Nan to be okay. She may be an adult but she has been so codependent on you her whole life she doesn\u0027t know any other way. If you weren\u0027t so damn focused on getting Blaire back you\u0027d see this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved Grant out of my way and leveled my gaze on my sister. I didn\u0027t need this lecture from him even if there was some truth to it. Deep down I was pleased that these two had finally found common ground. Maybe Grant cared for her afterall. We had lived in the same house for years. We\u0027d been neglected together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Nan. You know that. But you can\u0027t ask me to choose. It\u0027s not fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNan put both her hands on her hips. It was her defiant position. \"You can\u0027t love us both. I\u0027ll never accept her. She held a gun on me, Rush! You saw her. She\u0027s insane. She was going to shoot me. How can you love her and love me? That makes no sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She would have never shot you. She held a gun on Grant too. He got over it. And yes I can love you both. I love you differently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNan shifted her gaze to Grant and gave him a sad smile. That was even weirder. \"He won\u0027t listen to me, Grant. I give up. He is choosing his love for her over me and my feelings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nan, just listen to him. Come on. He has a point,\" Grant told her in a gentle tone I\u0027d never heard him use with her. I was in the fucking Twilight Zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNan stomped her foot. \"No. I hate her. I can\u0027t stand to look at her. She is hurting him now and I hate her more for it,\" Nan screamed. I glanced around to see if anyone had heard her and saw Woods walking toward us. Shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant turned and followed my gaze. \"Ah, hell,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods stopped in front of us and looked from Nan, to Grant and then to me. \"I overheard enough to know what this conversation is about,\" he said, keeping his focus locked on me. \"Let me make myself very clear. We\u0027ve all been friends most of our lives. I know the dynamic of your family.\" He shifted his gaze to Nan with a disgusted snarl of his lip then back to me. \"If anyone has a problem with Blaire then they need to take it up with me. She has a job here as long as she wants one. The three of you may not like it but I personally don\u0027t give a flying fuck. So get over it. She doesn\u0027t need this shit right now. Back off. Are we understood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied him. What did he mean and why was he acting as Blaire\u0027s protector? I didn\u0027t like it. My blood started to boil and I fisted my hands at my sides. Did he think he could make his move now? Show up when she was weak and be the hero? Hell no. That wasn\u0027t happening. Blaire was mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods didn\u0027t wait for a response. He stalked off instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like you have competition,\" Nan drawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant walked over to her and put her behind him again. \"That\u0027s enough, Nan,\" he whispered then he looked over at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was done with this. I couldn\u0027t deal with the two of them right now. I threw my club down and went after Woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe either heard me or felt the anger rolling off me because he stopped just before he reached the clubhouse and turned around to look at me. One of his eyebrows shot up as if he were amused. That just pissed me off more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both want the same thing. Why don\u0027t you take a few deep breaths and calm down?\" Woods said as he crossed his arms over his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay away from her. Do you hear me? Back the fuck off. Blaire loves me; she\u0027s just confused and hurt. She\u0027s also very vulnerable. So help me God, if you even think you\u0027re going to take advantage of her current state I will beat the shit out of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods tilted his head to the side and frowned. He wasn\u0027t very affected by my warning. Maybe I needed to make him affected. \"I know you love her. I\u0027ve never seen you act this crazed in your life. I get that. But Nan hates her. If you love Blaire then protect her from the venom that is dripping from your sister\u0027s fangs. Or I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like he\u0027d slapped me in the face. Before I could respond, he opened the door behind him and went inside. I stared at the closed door for several minutes before moving. I was going to lose one of them. I loved my sister but over time she\u0027d forgive me. I could lose Blaire forever. I wasn\u0027t going to allow that to happen. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-18.html","bookId":1994,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:58 AM"}
