He looked up from his papersafter some seconds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"A what? What?\"\"I would like to pray outside without getting my pants dirty.\n\u003cbr\u003e And I\u0027m attending a Christian school without having receivedthe proper baptism of Christ.\"\"Why do you want to pray outside? In fact, why do youwant to pray at all?\"\"Because I love God.\"\"Aha.\" He seemed taken aback by my answer, nearlyembarrassed by it. There was a pause. I thought he was goingto offer me ice cream again. \"Well, Petit Seminaire is Christianonly in name. There are many Hindu boys there who aren\u0027tChristians. You\u0027ll get just as good an education without beingbaptized. Praying to Allah won\u0027t make any difference, either.\"\"But I want to pray to Allah. I want to be a Christian.\"\"You can\u0027t be both. You must be either one or the other.\"\"Why can\u0027t I be both?\"\"They\u0027re separate religions! They have nothing in common.\"\"That\u0027s not what they say! They both claim Abraham astheirs. Muslims say the God of the Hebrews and Christians isthe same as the God of the Muslims. They recognize David,Moses and Jesus as prophets.\"\"What does this have to do with us, Piscine? We\u0027re Indians!\"\"There have been Christians and Muslims in India forcenturies! Some people say Jesus is buried in Kashmir.\"He said nothing, only looked at me, his brow furrowed.\n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly business called.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Talk to Mother about it.\"She was reading.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mother?\"\"Yes, darling.\"\"I would like to be baptized and I would like a prayer rug.\"\"Talk to Father about it.\"\"I did. He told me to talk to you about it.\"\"Did he?\" She laid her book down. She looked out in thedirection of the zoo. At that moment I\u0027m sure Father felt ablow of chill air against the back of his neck. She turned tothe bookshelf. \"I have a book here that you\u0027ll like.\" She alreadyhad her arm out, reaching for a volume. It was Robert LouisStevenson. This was her usual tactic.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve already read that, Mother. Three times.\"\"Oh.\" Her arm hovered to the left.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"The same with Conan Doyle,\" I said.\n\u003cbr\u003e Her arm swung to the right. \"R. K. Narayan? You can\u0027tpossibly have read all of Narayan?\"\"These matters are important to me, Mother.\"\"Robinson Crusoe!\"\"Mother!\"\"But Piscine!\" she said. She settled back into her chair, apath-of-least-resistance look on her face, which meant I had toput up a stiff fight in precisely the right spots. She adjusted acushion. \"Father and I find your religious zeal a bit of amystery.\"\"It is a Mystery.\"\"Hmmm. I don\u0027t mean it that way. Listen, my darling, ifyou\u0027re going to be religious, you must be either a Hindu, aChristian or a Muslim. You heard what they said on theesplanade.\"\"I don\u0027t see why I can\u0027t be all three. Mamaji has twopassports. He\u0027s Indian and French. Why can\u0027t I be a Hindu, aChristian and a Muslim?\"\"That\u0027s different. France and India are nations on earth.\"\"How many nations are there in the sky?\"She thought for a second. \"One. That\u0027s the point. Onenation, one passport.\"\"One nation in the sky?\"\"Yes. Or none. There\u0027s that option too, you know. These areterribly old-fashioned things you\u0027ve taken to.\"\"If there\u0027s only one nation in the sky, shouldn\u0027t all passportsbe valid for it?\"A cloud of uncertainty came over her face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bapu Gandhi said â€“ \"\"Yes, I know what Bapu Gandhi said.\" She brought a handto her forehead. She had a weary look, Mother did. \"Goodgrief,\" she said.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1841/53344.html","bookId":122,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 4:22:12 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 4:22:12 AM"}
