{"id":93166,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"\u003cp\u003eEven on a Sunday afternoon, the high-ceilinged waiting room of Thomas Nolan\u0027s studio was crowded with aspirant models of all sexes. Kate had never seen so many long legs, knobbly vertebrae and knife-blade cheekbones. Pulses throbbed in throats, wrists and ankles. She wouldn\u0027t know where to bite, for fear of scraping bone. Pretty creatures perched on low, backless couches like uncomfortable grasshoppers. They wore in fancy dress: astronaut, flamingo, cowgirl, Boy Scout. Glass-top tables had still-life arrangements of foreign-language magazines the waifs couldn\u0027t read and exotic fruits they wouldn\u0027t eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig black-and-white movie star posters hung on whitewashed walls. Bogart in a white tux, Rita Hayworth as Gilda, Jack Andrus as Ulysses, Bardot on a motorbike, Byron Orlok as Clayface, Theda Bara as Countess Addhema, Toby Dammit gaunt and drugged. Someone had reddened their eyes with magic marker and added fangs to black-lipped mouths. She didn\u0027t get the point. A chrome-and-crystal American jukebox played Procul Harem. She glanced at the selection panel: \u0027A Whiter Shade of Pale\u0027, over and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...her face, at first just ghostleeeee, turned...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNolan\u0027s Chinese personal assistant was present, issuing orders to minions. Kate was surprised\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the PA was the woman she knew as the Daughter of the Dragon. She\u0027d used more elaborate names, but now called herself Lin Tang. Kate hadn\u0027t kept track of the woman, but heard the Lord of Strange Deaths, her father, had joined his ancestors. Before the ceiling fell in on his Limehouse lair, he had issued his customary statement, \u0027the world shall hear from me again\u0027. So far, it hadn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Kate,\u0027 Lin Tang acknowledged, stone-faced. \u0027And some official gentlemen.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShorter and slighter even than her, Lin Tang wore a black miniskirt, vinyl kinky boots and a sleeveless top consisting of gold rings sewn together. Her hair once fell unbound to her knees. Now, she had sharp-cut fringes and showed the nape of her neck. Kate remembered the Daughter as a hapkido whirlwind in 1896, dicing Carpathian Guardsmen with twin scimitars in the Battle of Lamb\u0027s Conduit Street. Did anyone else here realise the tiny woman was more dangerous than the bald, pockmarked wrestler who barred the inner doors? He was for show: arms crossed like the genie in Aladdin, single earring, flower painted on his forehead. Lin Tang might have inherited him from her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the \u002790s, a time of odd alliances, Kate and the Daughter had served in different branches of the Underground dedicated to the overthrow of Prince Dracula. Then, Lin Tang dutifully carried out her dreadful father\u0027s bidding. Later, she turned against him\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;for love, Kate understood\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and made her own way in the world. Good for her. Not a vampire, she seemed about the same age as she had eighty years ago. Her family had access to potions and elixirs. Like vampirism, they carried a high, invisible price. The Lord came to resemble a Chinese mummy. Lin Tang\u0027s painted face might crack yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellaver searched through his pockets for his warrant card, and found it only after Griffin had flashed police I.D. at Lin Tang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027d like a word with Mr Nolan, miss... ?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Tang gave nothing away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It is a serious matter,\u0027 Bellaver insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wrestler shifted a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this bubbleworld, B Division\u0027s authority was scarcely recognised. No wonder the Super was wary of the case. When Kate started as a crime reporter, policemen found it almost impossible to interview anyone of superior social standing. Well-born ruffians of the 1880s, like Caleb Croft and his chums generations earlier, could more or less get away with anything. In this egalitarian age, being famous\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;no matter what for\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;earned the privileges which once came with title and estates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thomas is not to be disturbed,\u0027 said Lin Tang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors opened behind the wrestler, bumping him out of the way. Thomas Nolan, more wasted than Toby Dammit in the poster, stalked out, blond hair wild, brick-dust streaks on his blinding white jeans. Not a tall man, he displaced a lot of air. Behind him somewhere, a woman sobbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Tang noticed the Presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thomas looks disturbed to me,\u0027 said Bellaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photographer began inspecting the crop of models, pinching chins and staring into eyes. None spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hopeless, useless, spotty, malnourished, too tall... t\u0027chah! The lot of you, out out out!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe astronaut misted up the inside of her plastic bubble helmet and passed out. Her spacesuit had a vent which exposed her miraculously flat midriff in a manner not advised for extra-vehicular activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Tang clapped her hands, like her father signalling that more Western barbarians be tossed into the river. The models were banished, though Kate guessed they\u0027d be replaced by interchangeables within the half-hour. The cowgirl took the spacegirl with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You must be joking,\u0027 he said to Bellaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he came to Kate...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027...but you... interest me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a square with thumbs and forefingers and looked through it at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Snappy snappy,\u0027 he said. \u0027Teeth please.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He means smile,\u0027 said Lin Tang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I means teeth,\u0027 said Thomas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate opened her mouth, as if for the dentist. Her fangs slid out of gumsheaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften, her teeth noticed she fancied someone before her brain did. Thomas Nolan. She felt a sting of interest. Meanwhile, he saw her as an object. Damn. She\u0027d been here before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Lovely gnashers,\u0027 he said. \u0027Come in and we\u0027ll expose some film.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But I\u0027m... I don\u0027t... no reflection. No pictures.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, tightly. \u0027Let\u0027s see if we can do something about that, luv. You\u0027re definitely what I want.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this was the only way in, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas led her into the inner studio. The wrestler thought better of stopping Bellaver from following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building was a former carriage-works. The studio still smelled of wood and horses. Large sheets of white or pastel paper were tacked to the walls. Cameras and lamps perched on stands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sobbing woman was a vampire, another tall blonde bone-bag in a silvery evening dress. Barefoot, her soles were grubby from the uncarpeted floor. Kate recognised Barbara von Weidenborn, a professional artists\u0027 model under the name Barbarushka. A twig of the Dracula family tree, she was now in abject distress, like a harem bed-warmer who has failed to please the sultan and is doomed to the oubliette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Tang snapped long-nailed fingers. The wrestler escorted the Dracutwig off the premises. Kate trusted there were no trapdoors hereabouts for such poor things. The Daughter must have moderated her methods of disposing of people, though brief acquaintance suggested Thomas Nolan could be as cold-blooded as the Lord of Strange Deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate saw what Barbarushka\u0027s problem was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScattered on the floor were developing Polaroid photographs, all of strange shadows on white paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I won\u0027t photograph either,\u0027 she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNolan summoned an attractive, auburn-haired woman. She wore a black sweater and britches and had a cinema usherette\u0027s tray slung around her neck, full of cosmetics rather than ice cream tubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Edwina,\u0027 he ordered, \u0027do your magic.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman started puffing powder at Kate\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt tingled, oddly. Her eyes watered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s got silver in it,\u0027 she said, gripping Edwina\u0027s wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s so you\u0027ll show up,\u0027 Nolan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t necessarily want to,\u0027 said Kate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwina was strong, Kate realised. She might well be up to a tussle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellaver stood back, amused. Kate had not signed up for whatever this was, especially if it involved disfigurement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Mr Nolan is working on processes to photograph vampires,\u0027 Lin Tang explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You have such a look,\u0027 the photographer said. \u0027But if it\u0027s not on film, it\u0027s wasted.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That argument only works on girls who get older,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wouldn\u0027t you like to see your own face?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not really. People weren\u0027t kind about it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNolan was puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027She means she has red hair,\u0027 Lin Tang said. \u0027When she was warm, Western women with red hair were considered hideous...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate must remember to thank the Daughter of the Dragon for her concision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd glasses,\u0027 Kate said. And freckles.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNolan peered at her and didn\u0027t see a problem. Which ought to be cheering. The snapper spent his days peering through viewfinders at Jean Shrimpton and Penelope Tree. If he saw nothing wrong with specs, frecks and ginger, it was one in the eye for all those lads in cricket caps who made droll remarks about pillar-boxes and owls when not asking her to dance in 1886. They were mostly dead, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up a camera and started snapping at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Lovely,\u0027 he said. \u0027More fang, please. And the eyes. Flash \u0027em, luv. Teeth and smiles. That\u0027s the business, darling. Oh yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlashbulbs popped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was backed against a sheet of butchers\u0027 paper, which fell down. The photographer advanced on her. Click click click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwina also had a camera\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the Polaroid, which spat out instant images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe showed one to Nolan, who took a photograph of her holding it out to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate saw Edwina\u0027s photograph. There she was, in it. A pale, round face. The blank circles of her specs. Prominent eyeteeth, a defensive snarl. Even her hair. The magic had worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite herself, she was interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnoyingly, she looked startled in the picture. Like every long exposure taken when she was alive and had to sit in a chair with head-pincers to be photographed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellaver failed to stifle laughter. Griffin was smirking too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d make them pay later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Now, stop all this,\u0027 she said. \u0027We\u0027re here about something serious.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Thomas Nolan, this was serious. He shot more pictures, with various cameras, fixed on tripods and hand-held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to exert her will on his. It wasn\u0027t one of her talents, but she\u0027d been a vampire long enough to pick up some of the tricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach snap was something taken from her. A layer of skin? It was like being bitten, being drained\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;which she\u0027d only gone through once, albeit profoundly\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;being turned. She was worried she would fade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike ice in the sun, I melt away...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwina and Lin Tang stood to one side, attendant harpies. Why didn\u0027t he photograph them instead? They were pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA big lens was close to her face, like the probe of the Martian War Machine in the film of War of the Worlds. She had no reflection in it. The shutter irised inside the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick click click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrank, cringing, almost in terror. Nolan went down on his knees, over her, aiming down, still shooting. She put a hand behind her, and felt the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was strong. She could throw him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was thirsty. She could bite him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick click damnable click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t resist. The clicks were kisses now. Her teeth cut her own lips. Her mouth would be reddened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Stop,\u0027 she said, firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNolan gripped her thighs with his knees. He bore down on her, a cyclops. The upper half of his face, above his cherub lips, was all camera, a big eye on an extending stalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an automatic quality to his clicking. He took a shot and rolled the film on, again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wrung out, limp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw what was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Bellaver,\u0027 she said. \u0027Get him off me. It\u0027s about the case.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Super stepped forward, Kate reached up and took away Nolan\u0027s camera. He still made click-and-roll motions. He cooed at her, trying to capture the look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in a daze, imagining himself taking photographs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Luv,\u0027 he said, \u0027come on, luv...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGriffin and Bellaver helped him stand up. His hands still made motions. He wasn\u0027t seeing anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis studio girls showed little concern. They were used to not questioning bizarre behaviour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Lin Tang,\u0027 she said. \u0027He\u0027s been fascinated. Barbarushka?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Daughter snorted contempt. \u0027Not that one.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Another vampire, then. Recently. How long has he been like this? Manic, not all here...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question didn\u0027t mean anything to Lin Tang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good news and bad news, Super,\u0027 she told Bellaver. \u0027Nolan must know\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;must have known\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;something. But a vampire has got into his head and locked it up.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photographer was quieter now, suggestible. Edwina sat him in an egg-shaped chair that hung from the ceiling on a chain. His feet dangled, scraping the floor. He muttered, and his hands worked an invisible camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Were either of you with Nolan last night?\u0027 Bellaver asked. \u0027On a boat, and then somewhere else?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Tang nodded. Edwina shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Did he take any photographs last night?\u0027 Kate asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Of course,\u0027 said Lin Tang. \u0027He always takes photographs.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have they been developed?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No. He does that himself.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ll need the film,\u0027 said Bellaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That won\u0027t be possible,\u0027 said Lin Tang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Make it possible, Lotus Blossom. Or we\u0027ll find something to charge you with. Obstruction, most likely. If Insidious Fiendishness isn\u0027t an actual offence, we\u0027ll make it up specially.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My name isn\u0027t Lotus Blossom, Inspector Plodder. Or Suzie Wong.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I did make it clear this is a murder enquiry.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Tang was unimpressed. Given who the woman was, Kate understood why. A murder? Only one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nolan will need help,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027To fix his head. You\u0027d best cooperate.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Very well,\u0027 said Lin Tang. \u0027But I will develop the film myself. One of you may join me in the darkroom.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027An offer you don\u0027t hear every day,\u0027 said Bellaver. \u0027Katie, I\u0027m assuming you can see in the dark.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Like a cat,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Miaow away, then.
