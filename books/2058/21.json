{"id":110428,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\u003cp\u003eMaddie claimed that even Seth\u0027s family didn\u0027t know where he was. According to her, he\u0027d really just...vanished. He wasn\u0027t answering his phone. He wasn\u0027t showing up at the bookstore. When people disappeared, I immediately jumped to supernatural conclusions, but Maddie then added - through more tears - that she used her key to get her belongings from Seth\u0027s place and found a suitcase and some clothing missing. Feeling guilty about having the key anymore, she then shoved it into my hand and told me to return it. Or throw it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did my best to comfort her some more and then offered to take her over to Doug\u0027s. Roman shot me a warning look as we were about to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do anything stupid,\" he said out of Maddie\u0027s hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew your nice bedside manner wouldn\u0027t last,\" I returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite Doug\u0027s slacker rocker-boy lifestyle, I knew Maddie\u0027d be in good hands with him. I dropped her off there and found Doug a mixture of personas. To Maddie, he was astonishingly kind and gentle - the caring brother as opposed to the usual teasing brother. Once she was lying down in the other room, he made sure I knew exactly what he thought of Seth in very explicit detail. There wasn\u0027t much I could say to that except that they should call me if they needed anything. I left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of Maddie\u0027s words, I drove to Terry and Andrea\u0027s anyway. Seth ending things with Maddie so abruptly was crazy - almost crazier than him proposing to her in the first place. But him disappearing without telling his family? No. He wouldn\u0027t do that. He was too responsible. Most likely he\u0027d told them not to tell Maddie where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendall opened the door when I arrived, her face lighting up like Christmas morning. \"Georgina! Georgina\u0027s here!\" Morgan and McKenna, who had been watching cartoons, came tearing over and each wrapped themselves around a leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to see you guys too,\" I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry had been sitting on the couch near the twins and came over to me with a little less zeal. \"Hey, Georgina,\" he said, face typically friendly. He was shorter than Seth and a few years older, but overall, they bore a notable resemblance. \"Sorry for the mass assault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\" I unwound Morgan from me, but McKenna proved a little more resistant. Glancing back at Terry, I said hesitantly, \"I was wondering if I could talk to you, uh, about something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry wasn\u0027t stupid. None of the Mortensens were. \"Sure,\" he said. \"Girls, let go of Georgina and go back to the cartoons. We\u0027re going to go into the kitchen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we want her to watch TV with us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry laid down firm but friendly fatherly law, and with great reluctance, the girls returned to the couch. I was impressed. I wasn\u0027t sure I could have refused that group anything. He led me to the kitchen, but before either of us could say anything, Andrea came in from down the hall, smiling in surprise when she saw me. I smiled in surprise right back at her, but it was more from her appearance than anything else. It was the middle of the day, but she wore a robe over pajamas. Her mussed blond hair and dark eye circles suggested she\u0027d been sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry had been leaning against the counter but jumped up when he saw her. \"Oh, honey, you should go back to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged him off. \"I wanted to see who\u0027s here. How\u0027s it going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said. Then, unable to resist: \"Are you feeling okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little under the weather. Fortunately, Terry\u0027s manning up today. He does almost as good a job as me with the girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed politely at the joke, but it soon faded. We stood awkwardly for a moment, everyone knowing why I was here but no one doing anything about it. Finally, I took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve come to ask you where Seth is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny,\" said Andrea. \"We were going to ask you the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was taken aback. \"How would I know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both just stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When this happened a couple days ago...this thing with Maddie...\" Terry glanced uneasily at his wife before continuing. \"We just assumed, well, that it was because of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would it be because of me? I just found out about this today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s always been because of you,\" said Andrea gently. \"There was never anyone else. We like Maddie. He likes her. But that\u0027s the problem. Throughout it all, we could just tell that you were always the one. Now, whatever happened between you guys to make it go bad isn\u0027t any of our business. We\u0027re just not that surprised to see this new development.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would, however, like to know where he is,\" said Terry more pragmatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said helplessly, still a little stunned by Andrea\u0027s words. \"Maddie said he\u0027d packed up, and I figured you guys were keeping his location a secret from her.\" I eyed them suspiciously. \"And me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Terry. \"We really don\u0027t know.\" I didn\u0027t have an angel\u0027s talent, but I believed he was telling the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrea nodded in agreement. \"He just called us a couple days ago and said he\u0027d ended things. Didn\u0027t give any explanation - but well, you know how he is. He doesn\u0027t explain much anyway. Then, when Maddie and no one else had seen him, we started to get worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple days ago. Seth had ended things with her a couple days ago - when the whole soul retrieval gig had gone down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We actually tried calling you,\" added Terry. \"But never got an answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yeah. I\u0027ve been sick this week too.\" Eyeing Andrea - who looked exhausted - I suddenly felt bad for taking up any more of their time. \"Look, I should go. Thanks for the info. Will you...let me know if you hear from him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrea smiled again. \"Something tells me you\u0027ll hear from him before we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t as confident. Leaving the house was a little tricky since the other girls didn\u0027t want me to go, but I managed to escape their adorable clutches at last and make a break for it. I was walking toward my car when a voice said, \"She\u0027s sick, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned, startled, and saw Brandy standing near a gate that led to their backyard. She had the same sullen look about her she\u0027d had for so long. \"Hey,\" I said in greeting. \"Where\u0027d you come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was around. I heard you talking to Mom and Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI replayed Brandy\u0027s initial words. \"Your mom...you mean she\u0027s sick, right? I could tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean she\u0027s really sick. She\u0027s really sick, and they won\u0027t talk about it.\" Brandy gave a nod toward the front door. \"No one else knows. Not even Uncle Seth knows just how sick she is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chilly breeze stirred dried leaves around my feet, but it was nothing compared to the cold starting to fill me. \"Just how sick are we talking, Brandy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandy scuffed her feet against the driveway, eyes averted. \"She has ovarian cancer. It\u0027s bad...but they\u0027re still trying to figure out just how bad it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was going to the doctor that day I was here,\" I recalled aloud. Andrea had been so bright and cheery, I\u0027d assumed something routine was going on. I also realized I hadn\u0027t technically been here; I\u0027d seen it in a dream. Fortunately, Brandy was too distracted to notice my slip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been at the doctor a lot. Dad\u0027s missing tons of work. Uncle Seth\u0027s helped out sometimes, and I\u0027ve been babysitting all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly felt incredibly selfish. I\u0027d been assuming Brandy\u0027s moodiness was all over me and Seth breaking up. But that was only a symptom of the larger problem. Her mother was dangerously ill, and every part of her world was destabilizing. Her own life was probably being put on hold to watch her sisters, and even something like her uncle\u0027s romantic life could ripple what she\u0027d regarded as the norm. All the constants in her world were disappearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandy, I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go,\" she interrupted, heading back toward the gate, face stony. \"Kayla\u0027ll be up from her nap soon. I\u0027m supposed to keep an eye on her today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandy disappeared around the corner before I could say anything. I stood there, feeling lost. I didn\u0027t know who I felt worse for: Brandy and Terry for knowing what was going on or the little girls for being oblivious. I felt bad enough for myself because there was nothing I could do. There was never anything I could do. I had powers beyond human imaginings, but they were nothing that could actually help humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove downtown with a heavy heart, trying hard - and failing - not to overreact. Brandy herself had said things were bad but that they were still learning the extent of it. Surely there were more tests, tests that would give some hope. And surely there was treatment. Humans could do that much on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerome was where I\u0027d hoped he\u0027d be. Really, I decided, the Cellar was nearly as good as him having an office. Carter was by his side at the back table, both of them doing shots from a bottle of J\u0026amp;auml;germeister. Those two didn\u0027t discriminate among their liquor. I wondered if they were drinking away the hardships of the other day or toasting their success over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must have been the latter because Jerome almost smiled when he saw me. \"Georgie, out among the living and back to your petite self. Yet...so blue. Blue like always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, they\u0027d been drinking. Angels and demons could sober up at will, and he was apparently indulging in the full effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got some bad news,\" I said, sitting opposite them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, about losing Mortensen?\" asked Jerome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I talked to Roman. He recapped your day - the old man checking in, you comforting your romantic rival...it was quite moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled. \"Great. You have Roman spying on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not spying. I just demand answers from him. If it makes you feel better, he\u0027s never very happy to give up those answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How often do you do it?\" I asked incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that often.\" A waiter set down a new bottle. \"Mostly I wanted to see how you were recovering post-dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. I\u0027m fine.\" I glanced at Carter. \"No comments from you today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave me out of this,\" he replied. \"I\u0027m just drinking.\" So he said, but he was also watching and listening very carefully. He was not letting the alcohol affect him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned back to Jerome. \"I\u0027ve come to call in my favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark amusement in his eyes turned to suspicion. \"What favor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one you promised me for helping save you from Grace, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, no amusement at all anymore. \"I just rescued you from another plane of existence from creatures who were torturing your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched but pushed on with my words. \"You promised a favor, and I didn\u0027t call it in for that. Besides, you would have done it anyway so that you wouldn\u0027t get in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That favor offer was brought on by the drama at the time,\" he countered. \"I probably said all sorts of things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promised,\" I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can understand you just fine without putting italics in your voice, Georgie,\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did, though,\" pointed out Carter. Demons could lie - and did - but certain deals they were bound to. Jerome had said he\u0027d grant me a favor out on the beach, and it had been a true promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" he said irritably, gesturing for another shot. \"What is it you want? And I don\u0027t have to grant it if it\u0027s something totally unreasonable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful,\" interrupted Carter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused, and Jerome glared at the angel. Carter offered no other insight, but those gray eyes were still watchful - and cautious. Which was what I needed to be. Jerome had promised me a favor, and like all demons, he would try to find as many loopholes in it as possible. I had been about to ask where Seth was, but that wouldn\u0027t necessarily do me any good. I wouldn\u0027t be able to get to Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to send me to Seth so I can spend a few days with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerome studied me, expression shrewd. \"There\u0027s a couple problems. One is that you\u0027ve kind of asked for two things. The other is that I\u0027m not omniscient. I don\u0027t know where he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can find out,\" I said. \"At least, if he\u0027s flown anywhere, you can find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth packing indicated serious travel. Maddie had said his car was still at the house, meaning he hadn\u0027t driven somewhere. If he had, he\u0027d be harder to track. But airports had records, and Hell had its hand in that kind of thing. Jerome could easily get an imp or lesser demon to access Sea-Tac\u0027s records this week and see where Seth had gone. I probably could have asked Hugh to do it, but that wouldn\u0027t have gotten me leave to actually go to Seth, hence my wording.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we both know it\u0027d be stupid for you to send me right there and right back. Asking for a few days makes it worthwhile or else it\u0027s a shitty favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Debatable,\" Jerome replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be worse,\" said Carter. \"She didn\u0027t ask for world peace or anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay out of this,\" returned the demon. \"I know what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter shrugged and ordered another drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" said Jerome at last. \"I\u0027ll have Hugh check travel records. You know there might not be a paper trail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But if you find him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you can go to him. For now, go home. You\u0027re ruining my good mood. I\u0027ll find you if there\u0027s news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t need to be told twice. \"Soon,\" I said. \"You have to search soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerome\u0027s lips quirked. \"You didn\u0027t put that into the wording.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter elbowed him, and I had to take it on faith that Jerome would act in a timely manner. My words had implied that I wanted to be where Seth was now. One could argue that waiting meant Seth would change locations, meaning I couldn\u0027t have what I wanted. I also had to believe that Carter had a point in saying this was a relatively easy favor. I could have demanded more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimple or not, it was hard to wait to hear back. Roman was gone when I returned to my condo, and I had nothing to do but ruminate. I\u0027d given myself a leave of absence at work and didn\u0027t regret it. Still, being alone with my thoughts was never a good thing, and I had far too many to trouble me: the Oneroi, Seth, Andrea...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Georgie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was four hours later when Jerome appeared in my living room with a pop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sagged in relief. \"You found him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ll send me to him - for a worthwhile amount of time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three days,\" the demon said. He sounded irritable and impatient. I\u0027d wondered if he\u0027d been drinking this entire time and was angry at the interruption. \"I want you back here in seventy-two hours, and you\u0027re on your own as to how you do it. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said eagerly. \"Just send me to him.\" I had to talk to him. I had to find out exactly what had happened. I had to make sure he was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that settles the favor. Agreed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed,\" I said. There was power in that word, just as there had been in Jerome\u0027s initial promise. I could ask for nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then go,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI vanished from my living room......and reappeared on a busy sidewalk. People swarmed around me, none of them seeming to notice I\u0027d appeared out of thin air. The sun was on its way down, but the sky was bright and clear - and hot. Very hot. The masses around me were dressed in beach clothes and had the feel of tourists. I stepped out of their path and found myself standing in front of a large, resort-type hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe abrupt change in location - and discomfort of teleportation - had left me disoriented, and I needed to get my bearings. Taking in more of my surroundings, I could hear people speaking in both Spanish and English. I turned to the closest person near me, a short, deeply tanned man in a hotel uniform who was directing taxis around the building\u0027s driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to ask where I was and decided that would be a little too stupid sounding. I pointed at the hotel and asked him what its name was. I knew tons of languages perfectly, and Spanish rolled off my lips easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"El Grande Mazatl¨¢n, se\u0026amp;ntilde;orita,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMazatl¨¢n? This time, I did ask a stupid question: \"\u0026amp;iquest;Estoy in M¨¦xico?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, giving me the are-you-crazy look I\u0027d expected. It was probably made worse by my jaw dropping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I supposed if you were going to run away, you should run away somewhere warm. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-shadows-georgina-kincaid-5/page-21.html","bookId":2058,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:59:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:59:24 PM"}
