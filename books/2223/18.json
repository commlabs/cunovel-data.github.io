Five minutes after I left the Brotherhood he came at me, which means he was waiting. Just like the guy outside the Groveland Tap had been waiting. Now, why do I have a feeling that everything that’s happened today was staged for my benefit? Like I’m a minor piece being maneuvered around a chessboard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsey paused for a moment before saying, “If you’re being maneuvered, then so am I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what to do about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the expression on her face, Lindsey didn’t have a clue, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is bigger than it seems,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will help me, though, won’t you, Mac?

Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The way he looked at you when you first arrived . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d be amazed at the way some men look at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The way he looked at us when we danced together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happens next?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Lindsey a head start before leaving the restroom and making my way back to the atrium. I searched unsuccessfully for Nina, wondering if she had become so fed up with me for ignoring her that she left the ball. Couldn’t say I blamed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orchestra was taking a break and there was no one on the dance floor. It was getting late for a weeknight. Wives were looking at husbands the way they do when they want to go home, and husbands, at least for the time being, were pretending not to notice. Yet the exodus would soon begin. The couples with younger children would depart first, followed shortly by those with older children, followed by the single and the childless. Most of the partygoers would be gone by the time the orchestra finished its final set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought the set might be about to begin when Bobby DeNucci walked to the microphone at center stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ladies and gentlemen,” DeNucci announced. “We have a treat for you while the orchestra takes a few moments to catch its breath. Please welcome Nina Truhler.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparse applause followed Nina across the stage. She briefly hugged DeNucci and sat at the piano and immediately began to play. I moved to the edge of the sunken floor while a few partygoers ventured onto the dance floor itself. They were met there by a piece of classical music, one of the variations on Bach’s Goldberg Variations; I didn’t know which one. The would-be dancers glanced at each other as if to say, who is this woman? Wait for it, wait for it, I urged them silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a full minute of playing the slow, melodic music, Nina’s left hand began to beat out a hard rhythm. The dancers looked up at her in anticipation. People who weren’t listening suddenly were. DeNucci and a few of the other musicians gathered next to the stage. I was sure I heard Abby Hunter exclaim, “Bring it, girl.” Nina brought it. After establishing the baseline with her left hand, her right abandoned Bach’s sweet sound for something much grittier—Jay McShann’s bluesy “My Chile.” When she squeezed as much out of the song as she wanted, Nina segued without pause into “Cow Cow Blues” by Meade Lux Lewis. Soon a few of the musicians joined her on stage—she had percussion, a bass keeping time for her, and Abby Hunter’s violin lending unexpected shadings to the melody she riffed. The floor began to fill, yet the people didn’t dance so much as they swayed and hopped to the sound Nina was laying down. At the edge of the sunken floor, I clapped my hands in delight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3/page-18.html","bookId":2223,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:55 PM"}
