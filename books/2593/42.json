{"id":96501,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" I say, my voice trembling with emotion, \"have whatever you want but I\u0027m telling you I recommend the Diet Pepsi.\" I look down at my lap, at the blue cloth napkin, the words Deck Chairs sewn into the napkin\u0027s edge, and for a moment think I\u0027m going to cry; my chin trembles and I can\u0027t swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourtney reaches over and touches my wrist gently, stroking my Rolex. \"It\u0027s okay Patrick. It really is....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sharp pain near my liver overcomes the surge of emotion and I sit up in my chair, startled, confused, and the waiter leaves and then Anne asks if we\u0027ve seen the recent David Onica exhibit and I\u0027m feeling calmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turns out we haven\u0027t seen the show but I don\u0027t want to be tacky enough to bring up the fact I own one, so I lightly kick Courtney under the table. This raises her out of the lithium-induced stupor and she says robotically, \"Patrick owns an Onica. He really does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, pleased; sip my J\u0026amp;B.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh that\u0027s fantas tic, Patrick,\" Anne says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? An Onica?\" Scott asks. \"Isn\u0027t he quite expensive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let\u0027s just say...\" I sip my drink, suddenly confused: say... say what? \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourtney sighs, anticipating another kick. \"Patrick\u0027s cost twenty thousand dollars.\" She seems bored out of her mind, picking at a flat, warm piece of corn bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give her a sharp look and try not to hiss. \"Uh, no, Courtney, it was really fifty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slowly looks up from the corn bread she\u0027s mashing between her fingers and even in her lithium haze manages a stare so malicious that it automatically humbles me, but not enough to tell Scott and Anne the truth: that the Onica cost only twelve grand. But Courtney\u0027s frightening gaze - though I might be overreacting; she might be staring disapprovingly at the patterns on the columns, the venetian blinds on the skylight, the Montigo vases full of purple tulips lining the bar - scares me enough to not elaborate on the procedure of purchasing an Onica. It\u0027s a stare that I can interpret fairly easily. It warns: Kick me again and no pu**y, do you understand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That seems....\" Anne starts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold my breath, my face tight with tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...low,\" she murmurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exhale. \"It is. But I got a fabulous deal,\" I say, gulping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But fifty thousand?\" Scott asks suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I think his work... it has a kind of... wonderfully proportioned, purposefully mock-superficial quality.\" I pause, then, trying to remember a line from a review I saw in New York magazine: \"Purposefully mock...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t Luis own one, Courtney?\" Anne asks, and then tapping Courtney\u0027s arm, \"Courtney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luis... owns... what?\" Courtney shakes her head as if to clear it, widening her eyes to make sure they don\u0027t close on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Luis?\" Scott asks, waving to the waitress to have the butter the busboy recently placed on the table removed - what a party animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne answers for Courtney. \"Her boyfriend,\" she says after seeing Courtney, confused, actually looking at me for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s he at?\" Scott asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Texas,\" I say quickly. \"He\u0027s out of town in Phoenix, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Scott says. \"I meant what house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"L. F. Rothschild,\" Anne says, about to look at Courtney for confirmation, but then at me. \"Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He\u0027s at P \u0026amp; P,\" I say. \"We work together, sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t he dating Samantha Stevens at one point?\" Anne asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Courtney says. \"That was just a photo someone took of them that was in W.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI down my drink as soon as it arrives and wave almost immediately for another and I\u0027m thinking Courtney is a babe but no sex is worth this dinner. The conversation violently shifts while I\u0027m staring across the room at a great-looking woman - blonde, big tits, tight dress, satin pumps with gold cones - when Scott starts telling me about his new compact disc player while Anne unwittingly prattles on to a stoned and completely oblivious Courtney about new kinds of low-sodium wheat-rice cake, fresh fruits and New Age music, particularly Manhattan Steamroller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Aiwa,\" Scott\u0027s saying. \"You\u0027ve got to hear it. The sound\" - he pauses, closes his eyes in ecstasy, chewing on corn bread - \"is fantastic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you know, Scottie, the Aiwa is okay.\" Oh holy shit, dream on, Scot-tie, I\u0027m thinking. \"But Sansui is really top of the line.\" I pause, then add, \"I should know. I own one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I thought Aiwa was top of the line.\" Scott looks worried but not yet upset enough to please me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-42.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
