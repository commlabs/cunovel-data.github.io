Two minutes later, a small metal container shot out of the pneumatic tube and landed with a plink next to me on the desk. I jumped and grabbed the thing, pulling out the message. It read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Linton,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are three minutes late. This will be deducted from your wages at the end of the month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBring me file 38XI301.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRikkard Ambrose\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right. So, at a guess I’d say he wasn’t pining with passionate love for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he didn’t want me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErgo: the kiss never happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, so much the better. I wasn’t even a tiny bit disappointed. No, I wasn’t. After all, the fact that last night’s more… intimate occurrences had just been a dream had been what I had been trying to convince myself all the time. Now that I knew it was true, I ought to feel nothing but deep satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOught to, yes, but…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurriedly, I stood up and marched to the shelves of files. In no time at all, I had discovered the required document and transported it to the door. I reached for the doorknob, turned it - and almost ran headlong into a closed door. A very unladylike word escaped my lips as I stumbled back, the file clutched to my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the…!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried the door again. I hadn’t been mistaken. It was firmly and utterly locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hey!’ With my free hand, I pounded against the heavy wood. ‘What’s the matter? Why is the door locked?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Didn’t you hear me? I said why is the door lock-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft plink interrupted me. Turning my head, I saw that another metal cylinder had arrived on my desk. Mystified and annoyed, I stomped over to the desk and grabbed it. Now what would he have to say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I locked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRikkard Ambrose\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep, cleansing breath, trying to calm my stormy temper. It didn’t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing out the original with maybe a little bit more force than strictly necessary, I wrote under his message:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Mr Ambrose,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why did you do that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours faithfully\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilly Linton\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa! I wondered what he was going to say now. Was he going to claim you could work more efficiently with all the doors locked? I wouldn’t put it past him, the stingy, stony old…!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Linton,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a measure to further your abstinence and thereby the efficiency of your work. There is a liquor store only two streets away and a sweetshop selling solid chocolate right beside it. From your behaviour at the tavern, I deduced that keeping you locked up is the only way to prevent you from succumbing to irresistible urges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRikkard Ambrose\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow on earth did he know I liked chocolate? Wait… irresistible urges? My eyes sparked!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll give him irresistible urges!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot alcoholic ones, though - the ones I was feeling right now tended more towards homicidal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill… there might be other kinds of irresistible urges, too. I blushed as, unbidden, memories flooded into my mind… soft skin pressing against my lips, moving, caressing…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreams! Hallucinations! The whole lot of them! Things like that would never happen in real life. In real life, Mr Ambrose didn’t go around kissing people. He went around bossing people around and locking them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d show him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuming, I grabbed the next best bit of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy very, very, very dear Mr Ambrose,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay I inform you that the strongest urge I feel at the moment has nothing whatsoever to do with alcohol, and everything to do with your disembowelment? OPEN THAT DOOR!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour affectionate secretary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilly Linton\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer wasn’t long in coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Linton,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may say anything you like as long as it distracts neither you nor me from working. The door stays locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Ambrose\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe obstinate…! But why was I wasting my time like this, anyway? I was in a superior position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDearest Mr Ambrose\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might not recall, but I have the necessary keys in my possession to open the aforementioned door. You gave them to me yourself. Therefore, I shall see you in a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours affectionately,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilly Linton\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuffed the message into the tube, pulled the lever and marched off triumphantly towards the door without waiting for an answer. My triumphant march was somewhat impeded, however, when my keys wouldn’t fit in the lock. I tried them again, and again. Still, they didn’t fit. Marching over to the other door, the one to the hallway, I tried to open this one, but discovered that it, too, had been locked, and my keys didn’t fit. By the time I had returned to the desk, another message had arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Linton,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the locks changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRikkard Ambrose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP.S. Affection is not among the services I require of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat rose to my cheeks on reading the last line. I had reached for the pen before I had started to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Mr Ambrose,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder you went to the expense of two new locks, simply for the sake of my abstinence! How wasteful of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilly Linton\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP.S: If you do not require it, I shall not offer it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly half a minute later, his response arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Linton,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were not new, but second-hand. I am still waiting for file 37VI288. Shove it under the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRikkard Ambrose\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d like to shove it up his…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no. I didn’t want to have anything to do with his… Well, with that part of him. No matter how juicy it looked. Not even for shoving files up it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Mr Ambrose,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI demand to be let out immediately!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilly Linton\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis reply was short and to the point. Who could have guessed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Linton,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou work for me, not the other way around. You cannot demand anything. Now bring me file 37VI288.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRikkard Ambrose\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did I do? Yell? Hammer at the door in protest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brought him the file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just managed it, all the while chanting in my head ‘Think of the money. Think of the independence it will bring you. Think of what you can do for Ella if all goes horribly wrong. You must have that money. You must.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chant was interrupted by the plink of another message arriving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mr Linton?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resurfaced from a mountain of files I was sorting through and looked around. But there was no one there. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-168.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM"}
