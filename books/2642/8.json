He couldn\u0027t help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he couldn\u0027t stop it. His hand was on her arm, and he could feel her skin, feel the soft warmth of it, and then when he looked down, her face was tilted toward his, and her eyes, deep and blue but so completely unmysterious, were gazing up at him, and in truth there was no way - simply no way - he could do anything in that moment but kiss her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything else would have been a tragedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an art to kissing - he\u0027d long known that, and he\u0027d been told he was an expert. But this kiss, with this woman - the one time it should have been art, it was all breathless nerves, because never in his life had he wanted someone in quite the manner he wanted Miss Grace Eversleigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd never had he wanted quite so much to get it all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t scare her. He had to please her. He wanted her to want him, and he wanted her to want to know him. He wanted her to cling to him, to need him, to whisper in his ear that he was her hero and she\u0027d never want to so much as breathe the air near another man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to taste her. He wanted to devour her. He wanted to drink in whatever it was that made her her, and see if it would transform him into the man he sometimes thought he ought to be. In that moment she was his salvation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his temptation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd everything in between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grace,\" he whispered, his voice brushing across her lips. \"Grace,\" he said again, because he loved saying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moaned in response, a soft whimpering sound that told him everything he wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her softly. Thoroughly. His lips and tongue found every corner of her soul, and then he wanted more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grace,\" he said again, his voice hoarser now. His hands slid around to her back, pressing her against him so he could feel her body as a part of the kiss. She was not corseted under her gown, and every lush curve became known to him, every warm contour. He wanted more than the shape of her, though. He wanted the taste, the smell, the touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kiss was seduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was the one being seduced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grace,\" he said again, and this time she whispered -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was his undoing. The sound of his name on her lips, the single, soft syllable - it shot through him like no Mr. Audley ever could. His mouth grew urgent and he pressed her more tightly to his body, too far gone to care that he\u0027d gone hard against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her cheek, her ear, her neck, moving down to the hollow of her collarbone. One of his hands moved along the side of her rib cage, the pressure plumping her breast up until the upper curve was so close to his lips, so tantalizingly -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was more of a whisper than anything else, but still, she pushed him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, his breath rushed and heavy. Her eyes were dazed, and her lips looked wet and well-kissed. His body was thrumming with need, and his eyes slid down to her belly, as if he could somehow see through the folds of her dress, down, down to the V where her legs met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever he\u0027d been feeling just then - it tripled. Dear God, he hurt with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shuddering groan, he tore his gaze back up to her face. \"Miss Eversleigh,\" he said, since the moment called for some thing, and there was no way he was going to apologize. Not for something that good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Audley,\" she replied, touching her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he realized, in a single blinding moment of pure terror, that everything he saw on her face, every stunned blink of her eyes - he felt it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no, that was impossible. He\u0027d just met her, and beyond that, he did not do love. Amendment: he did not do the heart-pounding, mind-fogging, overabundance of lust that was so often confused with love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved women, of course. He liked them, too, which he was aware made him rather unique among men. He loved the way they moved, and he loved the sounds they made, whether they were melting in his arms or clucking their disapproval. He loved how each one smelled different, and how each moved differently, and how even so, there was something about them all as a group that seemed to brand them together. I am woman, the air around them seemed to say. I am most definitely not you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thank heavens for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had never loved a woman. And he did not have any inclination to do so. Attachments were messy things, given to all sorts of unpleasantries. He preferred to move from affaire to affaire. It fit his life - and his soul - much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. Just a little one. Exactly the sort one would expect from a man like him at a time like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps with a little extra tilt in one corner. Just enough to lend some wry wit to his tone when he said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stepped into my room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, but the motion was so slow he couldn\u0027t be sure she even realized she was doing it. When she spoke, there was a certain dazedness to it, as if perhaps she was talking to herself. \"I won\u0027t do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, that would be a tragedy. \"I wish you would,\" he said, offering her his most disarming smile. He reached out, and before she could guess his intentions, took her hand and raised it to his lips. \"It was certainly,\" he murmured, \"the most pleasant welcome of my day here at Belgrave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not let go of her fingers as he added, \"I very much enjoyed discussing that painting with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true. He had always liked the smart women best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As did I,\" she answered, and then she gave her hand a gentle tug, forcing him to relinquish his hold. She took a few steps toward the door, then paused, turning partway around as she said, \"The collection here rivals any of the great museums.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I look forward to viewing it with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall begin in the gallery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. She was clever. But just before she reached the door, he called out, \"Are there nudes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wondering,\" he said innocently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are,\" she replied, but she did not turn around. He longed to see the color of her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVermillion, or merely pink?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the gallery?\" he asked, because surely it would be impolite to ignore his query. He wanted to see her face. One last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in the gallery, no,\" she said, and she did turn then. Just enough so he could see the sparkle in her eyes. \"It is a portrait gallery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" He made his expression appropriately grave. \"No nudes, then, please. I confess to a lack of desire to see Great-Grandfather Cavendish au naturel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips pressed together, and he knew it was with humor, not disapproval. He wondered just what it would take to nudge her further, to dislodge the laughter that was surely bubbling at the base of her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or, good heavens,\" he murmured, \"the dowager.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sputtered at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought a hand to his forehead. \"My eyes,\" he moaned. \"My eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, bloody hell, he missed it. She laughed. He was sure that she did, even though it was more of a choking sound than anything else. But he had his hand over his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Mr. Audley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned his hand to its proper place at his side. \"Good night, Miss Eversleigh.\" And then - and he would have sworn he\u0027d been prepared to allow her to depart - he heard himself call out, \"Will I see you at breakfast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused, her hand on the outer doorknob. \"I expect so, if you are an early riser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe absolutely was not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the dowager\u0027s favorite meal,\" she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the chocolate and the newspaper?\" He wondered if he remembered everything she\u0027d said that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite possibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"That is at six. Breakfast is laid at seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the breakfast room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know where it is, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t a clue,\" he admitted. \"But it seemed a likely choice. Will you meet me here, to escort me down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said, her voice dipping slightly with amusement (Or exasperation? He couldn\u0027t be sure), \"but I will arrange to have someone else lead you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pity.\" He sighed. \"It won\u0027t be the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should hope not,\" she said, slowly shutting the door between them. And then, through the wood, he heard, \"I plan to send a footman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed at that. He loved a woman with a sense of humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt precisely six the following morning, Grace entered the dowager\u0027s bedroom, holding the heavy door open for the maid who had followed her with the tray from the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager was awake, which was no great surprise. She always woke early, whether the summer sun was slipping in around the curtain edges, or the winter gloom hung heavy on the morning. Grace, on the other hand, would have gladly slept until noon if permitted. She\u0027d taken to sleeping with her drapes open since her arrival at Belgrave - the better to let the sunlight batter her eyelids open every morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t work very well, nor did the chiming clock she\u0027d installed upon her bedside table years earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought she would have adapted to the dowager\u0027s schedule by this point, but apparently her inner timepiece was her one rebellion - the last little bit of her that refused to believe that she was, and forever would be, companion to the dowager Duchess of Wyndham.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, it was a good thing she\u0027d befriended the housemaids. The dowager might have Grace to start her day, but Grace had the maids, who took turns each morning, slipping into her room and shaking her shoulder until she moaned, \"Enough...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow strange about Mr. Audley. She would never have pegged him for a morning person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, your grace,\" Grace said, moving to the windows. She pulled open the heavy velvet curtains. It was overcast, with a light mist, but the sun seemed to be making a good effort. Perhaps the clouds would burn off by afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager sat up straight against her pillows, queenly in her elaborately styled, domed canopy bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was nearly done with her series of morning exercises, which consisted of a flexing of the fingers, followed by a pointing of the toes, finishing with a twisting of her neck to the left and right. She never stretched it side to side, Grace had noticed. \"My chocolate,\" she said tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here, ma\u0027am.\" Grace moved to the desk, where the maid had left the tray before hurrying off. \"Be careful, ma\u0027am. It\u0027s hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager waited while Grace arranged the tray on her lap, then smoothed out the newspaper. It was only two days old (three was standard in this region) and had been neatly ironed by the butler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My reading glasses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were already in Grace\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager perched them on the tip of her nose, taking a gingerly sip of her chocolate as she perused the paper. Grace sat in the straight-back chair by the desk. It was not the most convenient location - the dowager was as demanding in the morning as she was the rest of the day, and would surely have her hopping up and down and across the room to her bed. But Grace was not permitted to actually sit next to the bed. The dowager complained that it felt as if Grace were trying to read over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was true, of course. Grace now had the newspaper transferred to her room once the dowager was through with it. It was still only two and a half days old when she read it, which was twelve hours better than anyone else in the district.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was strange, really, the things that made one feel superior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace tilted her head but did not inquire. If she inquired, the dowager would never tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a fire at Howath Hall,\" the dowager said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace was not certain where that was. \"I do hope no one was injured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager read a few more lines, then answered, \"Just a footman. And two maids.\" And then a moment later: \"The dog perished. Oh my, that is a shame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace did not comment. She did not trust herself to engage in early morning conversations until she\u0027d had her own cup of chocolate, which she was generally not able to do until breakfast at seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer stomach rumbled at the thought. For someone who detested mornings as she did, she\u0027d come to adore breakfast fare. If they could only serve kippers and eggs for supper each evening, she\u0027d have been in heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the clock. Only fifty-five more minutes. She wondered if Mr. Audley was awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably. Morning people never awoke with only ten minutes to spare before breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered what he looked like, all sleepy and rumpled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong, Miss Eversleigh?\" the dowager sharply inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace blinked. \"Wrong, ma\u0027am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You... chirped.\" She said this with considerable distaste, as if handling something with a particularly foul smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry, ma\u0027am,\" Grace said quickly, looking down at her hands folded in her lap. She could feel her cheeks growing warm, and she had a feeling that even in the morning light and with the dowager\u0027s diminished vision, her blush would be clearly visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, she should not be imagining Mr. Audley, and especially not in any state of dishabille. Heaven only knew what sorts of inappropriate sounds she would make the next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was handsome. Even when all she\u0027d seen of him was the lower half of his face and his mask, that much had been clear. His lips were the sort that always held a touch of humor. She wondered if he even knew how to frown. And his eyes...Well, she hadn\u0027t been able to see those that first night, and that was almost certainly a good thing. She\u0027d never seen anything quite so emerald. They far outshone the dowager\u0027s emeralds, which, Grace was still chagrined to remember, she\u0027d risked her life (in theory, at least) to keep safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Eversleigh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace jerked upright. \"Ma\u0027am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager pierced with a stare. \"You snorted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you questioning my hearing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not, ma\u0027am.\" The dowager abhorred the notion that any part of her might be susceptible to the usual impairments of age. Grace cleared her throat. \"I apologize, ma\u0027am. I was not aware. I must have, ehrm, breathed heavily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breathed heavily.\" The dowager appeared to find that as appealing as she had Grace\u0027s earlier chirp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace touched a hand lightly to her chest. \"A bit of congestion, I\u0027m afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager\u0027s nostrils flared as she peered down at the cup in her hands. \"I do hope you did not breathe on my chocolate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not, ma\u0027am. The kitchen maids always carry the tray up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager evidently did not find any reason to ponder that further, and she turned back to her newspaper, leaving Grace alone once more with her thoughts of Mr. Audley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Audley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Eversleigh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that Grace stood. This was getting ridiculous. \"Yes, ma\u0027am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sighed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sighed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you deny it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Grace replied. \"That is to say, I did not notice that I sighed, but I certainly allow that I could have done so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager waved an irritated hand in her direction. \"You are most distracting this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace felt her eyes light up. Did this mean she\u0027d escape early?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Miss Eversleigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat. Apparently not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager set down her newspaper and pressed her lips together. \"Tell me about my grandson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the blush returned. \"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager\u0027s right eyebrow did a rather good imitation of a parasol top. \"You did show him to his room last night, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, ma\u0027am. At your directive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well? What did he say? I am eager to learn what sort of man he is. The future of the family may very well rest in his hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace thought guiltily of Thomas, whom she\u0027d somehow forgotten in the past twelve hours. He was everything a duke ought to be, and no one knew the castle as he did. Not even the dowager. \"Er, don\u0027t you think that might be a bit premature, your grace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Defending my other grandson, are we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace\u0027s eyes widened. Something about the dowager\u0027s tone sounded positively malevolent. \"I consider his grace a friend,\" she said carefully. \"I would never wish him ill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pfft. If Mr. Cavendish - and don\u0027t you dare call him Mr. Audley - really is the legitimate issue of my John, then you are hardly wishing Wyndham ill. The man ought to be grateful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For having his title pulled from beneath his feet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For having had the good fortune to have had it for as long as he did,\" the dowager retorted. \"If Mr. - oh, bloody hell, I\u0027m going to call him John - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack, Grace thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If John really is my John\u0027s legitimate son, then Wyndham never really had the title to begin with. So one could hardly call it stripping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except that he has been told since birth that it is his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not my fault, is it?\" scoffed the dowager. \"And it has hardly been since birth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Grace allowed. Thomas had ascended to the title at the age of twenty, when his father perished of a lung ailment. \"But he has known since birth that it would one day be his, which is much the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager grumbled a bit about that, using the same peevish undertone she always used when presented with an argument to which she had no ready contradiction. She gave Grace one final glare and then picked up her newspaper again, snapping it upright in front of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace took advantage of the moment to let her posture slip. She did not dare close her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sure enough, only ten seconds passed before the dowager brought the paper back down and asked sharply, \"Do you think he will make a good duke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Au - \" Grace caught herself just in time. \"Er, our new guest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager rolled her eyes at her verbal acrobatics. \"Call him Mr. Cavendish. It is his name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it is not what he wishes to be called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t give a damn what he wishes to be called. He is who he is.\" The dowager took a long gulp of her chocolate. \"We all are. And it\u0027s a good thing, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace said nothing. She\u0027d been forced to endure the dowager\u0027s lectures on the natural order of man far too many times to risk provoking a repeat performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did not answer my question, Miss Eversleigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace took a moment to decide upon her reply. \"I really could not say, ma\u0027am. Not on such a short acquaintance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was mostly true. It was difficult to think of anyone besides Thomas holding the title, but Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudley - for all his lovely friendliness and humor - seemed to lack a certain gravitas. He was intelligent, certainly, but did he possess the acumen and judgment necessary to run an estate the size of Wyndham?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelgrave might have been the family\u0027s primary domicile, but there were countless other holdings, both in England and abroad. Thomas employed at least a dozen secretaries and managers to aid him in his stewardship, but he was no absentee landlord. If he had not walked every inch of the Belgrave lands, she would wager that he\u0027d come close. And Grace had substituted for the dowager on enough of her duties around the estate to know that Thomas knew nearly all of his tenants by name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had always thought that a remarkable achievement for one brought up as he had been, with a constant emphasis on the Wyndham place in the hierarchy of man. (Just below the king, and well above you, thank you very much.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas liked to present to the world the image of a slightly bored, sophisticated man of the ton, but there was quite a bit more to him. It was why he was so very good at what he did, she supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why it was so callous of the dowager to treat him with such a lack of regard. Grace supposed that one had to possess feelings in order to have a care for those of others, but really, the dowager had quite gone beyond her usual selfishness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had no idea whether Thomas had returned the night before, but if he hadn\u0027t...well, she wouldn\u0027t blame him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More chocolate, Miss Eversleigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace stood and refilled the dowager\u0027s cup from the pot she\u0027d left on the bedside table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you talk about last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace decided to feign obtuseness. \"I retired early.\" She tilted the pot back, careful not to drip. \"With your very kind permission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager scowled. Grace avoided the expression by returning the chocolate pot to its spot on the table. It took her an impressively long time to get it just so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he speak of me?\" the dowager asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er, not so very much,\" Grace hedged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not very much or not at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace turned. There was only so much interrogation she could avoid before the dowager lost her temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m certain he mentioned you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood heavens. How was she meant to say that he\u0027d called her an old bat? And if he hadn\u0027t called her that, then he\u0027d probably called her something worse. \"I don\u0027t recall precisely, ma\u0027am,\" Grace said. \"I\u0027m terribly sorry. I was not aware you wished for me to take note of his words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, next time, do so,\" the dowager muttered. She turned to her newspaper, then looked up toward the window, her mouth in a straight, recalcitrant line. Grace stood still, her hands clasped in front of her, and waited patiently while the dowager fussed and turned and sipped and ground her teeth, and then - it was hard to believe, but Grace thought she might actually feel sorry for the older woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He reminds me of you,\" she said, before she could think the better of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager turned to her with delighted eyes. \"He does? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace felt her stomach drop, although she was not certain if this was due to the uncharacteristic happiness on the dowager\u0027s face or the fact that she had no idea what to say. \"Well, not completely, of course,\" she stalled, \"but there is something in the expression.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after about ten seconds of smiling blandly, it became apparent to Grace that the dowager was waiting for more. \"His eyebrow,\" she said, in what she thought was a stroke of genius. \"He lifts it like you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like this?\" The dowager\u0027s left brow shot up so fast Grace was surprised it did not fly off her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er, yes. Somewhat like that. His are...\" Grace made awkward motions near her own brows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bushier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he is a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Oh, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can he do both?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace stared at her blankly. \"Both, ma\u0027am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager began lifting and dropping her brows in alternation. Left, right, left, right. It was a singularly bizarre spectacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not know,\" Grace said. Quickly. To cut her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very strange,\" the dowager said, returning both of her brows back to where Grace hoped she\u0027d keep them. \"My John could not do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heredity is very mysterious,\" Grace agreed. \"My father could not do this\" - she took her thumb and bent it back until it touched her forearm - \"but he said his father could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aah!\" The dowager turned aside in disgust. \"Put it back! Put it back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace smiled and said with perfect mildness, \"You will not wish to see what I can do with my elbow, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good Lord, no.\" The dowager snorted and waved toward the door. \"I am through with you. Go see to breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I have Nancy help you dress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dowager let out the most amazingly long-suffering sigh, as if a lifetime of aristocratic privilege was just too much. \"Yes,\" she agreed gracelessly, \"if only because I can\u0027t bear to look at your thumb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace chuckled. And she must have been feeling especially bold, because she did not even attempt to stifle it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you laughing at me, Miss Eversleigh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" the dowager said sharply, \"even think about saying you\u0027re laughing with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just laughing, ma\u0027am,\" Grace said, her face twitching with the smile she could not keep contained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do that sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have never witnessed it.\" Said as if this meant it couldn\u0027t possibly be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace could not say any of the three rejoinders that immediately sprang to mind -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is because you are not listening, your grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is because I rarely have cause to laugh in your presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eor\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat of it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo instead she smiled - warmly, even. Now this was strange. She\u0027d spent so much of her time swallowing her retorts, and it always left a bitter taste in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not this time. This time she felt light. Unfettered. If she could not speak her mind to the dowager, she didn\u0027t much care. She had too much to look forward to this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreakfast. Bacon and eggs. Kippers. Toast with butter and marmalade, too, and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Audley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lost-duke-of-wyndham-two-dukes-of-wyndham-1/page-8.html","bookId":2642,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:45 PM"}
