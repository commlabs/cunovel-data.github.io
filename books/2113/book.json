Unfortunately, there are no streets by that name in Wichita, KS. Described as a loner in the orphanage, her adult life is much the same--save for a Lhasa Apso anklebiter named Achilles. She\u0027s an investigative reporter working the paranormal beat at WTCH TV in Wichita, KS. So, she spends a lot of time watching TV. She\u0027s stunned when \"CSI Vegas V\" comes on showing a cadaver being dissected that could be her twin--right down to the topaz nose ring she wears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dancing-with-werewolves-delilah-street-1.jpg","author":"Carole Nelson Douglas","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dancing-with-werewolves-delilah-street-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:15 PM"}
