Those two were just way too sure of themselves. Then again, so was he. He smiled to himself. They were cursed with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a second,\" Mike shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai turned back around, annoyed. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreens lit up with warnings and scrolled text faster than Jai could read. Mike tapped away at the keyboards, his fingers flashing over the keys as he started swearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Jai repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something\u0027s leaping in through our communications dishes. I can\u0027t stop it; incursion alerts all over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai felt his stomach flip. Mike was the systems expert, had always been. He\u0027d figured out how to steal that Pelican when he\u0027d been conscripted into the Spartan II program because he\u0027d been flown into the camp on one, and that single session of watching how the pilot flew was enough for him. He had a gift with machines and computers that Jai envied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Mike looked flustered. \"Hit the kill switch. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai ran to the center of the cockpit and pulled up a plate-of metal. He yanked out the red handle inside and the entire freighter abruptly plunged into darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What just happened?\" Adriana shouted. \"Was that the kill switch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Without any power the artificial gravity had failed. Jai hung near the kill switch, a manual circuit breaker Mike had installed during the long Slipspace journey to this system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust in case, he\u0027d always said. You can\u0027t hack into a ship if someone yanks the power cord loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Petya, their home for the last several months, coasted along in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike twisted onto his back in the starlight and moved over to one of the windows. \"We\u0027re not going to hit anything for twenty minutes or so,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll give us time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it came to the ships and hardware, Mike called the shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike spun in place to face them. \"Jai, get clippers and snip the wires going to any comms arrays. You have eighteen minutes before we go bump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdriana, you should suit up. If someone was trying to get into our systems they might try a less virtual route and show up outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On it.\" Adriana kicked off the edge of the cockpit door and back down the dark center of the ship toward the bunks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai followed, leaving Mike in the cockpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later, after crawling around the guts of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetya to trace wiring, Jai had two of the arrays cut. Adriana had cycled out the lock in full armor and coasted up the belly of the freighter and just ripped the last array off the ship and flung it clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Jai pulled himself out and shoved himself through the air into the cockpit, Adriana exited the airlock and followed. With full armor, she seemed to take up the entire cockpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no one out there; didn\u0027t spot anything moving toward us either,\" she reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s both reassuring and worrying,\" Mike said. \"Plug her back in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Petya\u0027s emergency lights flicked on. A bit late, Jai thought, but then it was an old tramp freighter, just barely able to struggle from Slipspace point to Slipspace point until Mike had insisted they snag it. The team had spent a whole week under his direction, refitting a faster, military-grade Slipspace unit into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jai had to agree now, it had been worth it. There was more space in the cargo area for the weapons they\u0027d accumulated, which made Adriana very happy. Mike as well; he\u0027d picked up a few extra Shiva nuclear Warheads, and stocked up on just about everything else he could get his hands on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe primary lights flicked on as Mike tapped at screens and guided the ship\u0027s rebooting. Jai realized everything had fallen deathly silent as fans and pumps whirred back into life. The entire ship\u0027s steady background hum slowly trickled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArtificial gravity returned. Adriana and Mike twisted like cats and landed on their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, let\u0027s see what we\u0027ve got.\" Mike moved back to the controls and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetya shuddered as he adjusted their trajectory with thrusters. They passed by one of the flexible, clear docking tubes stretching half a mile between two asteroids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside people hustled from point to point on their business, hardly even noticing that the freighter had come within a mile of striking it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the screens to Mike\u0027s right flickered, and a woman appeared on it, her skin a ghostly skein of numbers and calculations. The effected look of many AIs. It seemed to look around the cockpit. \"Neat trick,\" it said through the cockpit\u0027s many speakers. \"But before you cut the power again, know that I infected a number of your external stellar navigation sensors. They don\u0027t have much broadcasting power, but I have a lot of comms equipment trained on your guys throughout the Rubble listening for them. Plus I already disabled your Slipspace drives, so you really do have to listen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike checked a screen, then swore and turned to Jai, who reached down for the red handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, wait, please hear me out,\" the AI on their screen said. \"I have an offer for you. I can get you the Rubble navigation data, but I want to cut a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai froze and locked eyes with Mike, who shrugged. Jai looked back up. \"A deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AI nodded on the screen. \"You\u0027re Spartans. The best of the best of the best.\" It smiled. \"There are a lot of lives at stake here, soldiers. I will help you get that navigation data, because I want you to protect it. But you can\u0027t leave right away. And that\u0027s the deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to stick around?\" Jai asked, a bit incredulously. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the lives of everyone in the Rubble are at stake, Spartan. And I am going to need you three to help save them in the very short days ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will be their deliverance, and you three their paladins, my very own knights in somewhat shining armor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike shook his head and held up seven fingers by his thigh for Jai to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn artificial intelligence usually lasted seven years before it legally had to be put down. After seven years they often started to go through stages of instability. They became rampant: convinced of their godlike power and ability. Rampant AIs were destructive, dangerous, and somewhat insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut rampancy was not inevitable, just statistically likely. An AI older than seven years was playing a dangerous game. Out here in the Rubble, they must have felt it prudent to keep the AI running this long in order to keep the system together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" snapped the AI, yelling at them. \"I can see your fingers, Spartan. I am over the age, yes. Maybe I am rampant. I damn well deserve to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdriana turned to look at Jai, but he waved his hand. Let it talk. See where it went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They unpacked me from storage to run the Rubble the year after Madrigal was glassed -- they couldn\u0027t handle the course corrections manually to keep asteroids connected to each other. They needed the constant and genius-like attention of someone like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That kept me busy, growing all this out, until the Jackals came. Since then, well, I\u0027ve been planning for the end, Spartans. And now it\u0027s here. Yes, I am Juliana, the goddess of the Rubble. Your experts may suspect me of rampancy, but a benevolent goddess may be exactly what you need right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this one happens to be very, very attached to the idea of saving the people of the Rubble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike shifted. \"Doesn\u0027t sound rampant to me.\" He was mollifying it, engaging it, Jai saw. Maybe even validating it. And Jai felt not pulling the plug had been worth it. This unsettled AI, somewhat frazzled by the chores it had been given in keeping the Rubble going, might be a very useful ally indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuliana looked down, suddenly tired, a flash of sadness crossing her face. \"I... think, right now, my preoccupation with the tricky, immense, complicated task of saving the Rubble\u0027s citizenry is all that does actually keep me from the depths of rampancy. It\u0027s been eating away at the edges of me for two years now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you want us to help?\" Adriana prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AI looked back up. \"In return I\u0027ll give you even more than the data you want. The Covenant forces here are up to a lot more than just setting up shop in a few of the Rubble\u0027s asteroids. I have details. You\u0027ll want these.\" She had a coy smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdriana and Mike looked over at Jai, who smiled back at the AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have much time,\" Juliana said. \"We need to help each other now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had a rampant Insurrectionist AI demanding their help, with a promise of greater secrets. Adriana\u0027s pet Insurrectionist running around. And a crippled freighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai smiled. This was just the sort of situation Gray Team thrived on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVADAM KEEP, YERMO, SANGHELIOS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly in the predawn light of the day after Thel \u0027Vadamee\u0027s ascension to kaidon of his keep, he woke to the faint scratching sound of three pairs of feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were on the roof outside his window, moving quickly and getting ready to vault the lip of his windowsill into his room. Thel wasted no time getting up from the chair that he had sat in all night, waiting for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the first assassin broke through the window, Thel pressed the button on the thick bar of metal in his hand that had been lying casually by his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe energy sword flicked into being with a crack of ionized air from the handle as the twin half ovals of blue plasma appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first swipe of the angry-sounding sword dug deep into the assassin\u0027s chest, spearing him on the tip of the concentrated plasma. To his credit the assassin did not scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel barely had time to duck, though, as the next two assassins bearing energy swords of their own hit the floor in front of him. Their crackling energy weapons just barely missed Thel\u0027s head. But their overeager swings doomed them. Even as their energy swords passed by him, Thel was coming back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eup to a full stand, slicing the sword arm of the nearest assassin clear off his body\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last assassin backpedaled, looking for room to defend himself, realizing that this was not a simple job anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a lot of space in the master room. The assassin stepped back over the large stone slabs of the room\u0027s floor, his eyes darting from door to door, wondering whether he could make a run for it. Or at least, how he might use the space to his advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel remained in front of the window, watching the assassin. To be honest he had expected more than this. The Vadam elders had voted him kaidon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebased on his abilities as a leader, fighter, and zealot. The keeps worked on a system of meritocracy -- only the most capable would be voted as kaidon upon the death of the previous one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for those who felt that their vote had been ill advised, or who had second thoughts, it was both a cherished right and a tradition to send in assassins to test the true merit of that ruler\u0027s martial abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was another layer of meritocracy. A kaidon who could not defend himself from assassins was not a true ruler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was classic Sangheili thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assassin tested the first door, and found it locked. The four-inch-thick kafel wood would not break easily, and the assassin had to have known that with just a glance. The second door was just as locked and solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he turned and looked at Thel, realizing that he was as good as dead, and ran straight for the window where Thel stood. A last stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel pulled a plasma pistol out of his holster and shot the assassin straight through the head. The assassin tumbled to the floor right in front of Thel\u0027s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow which elder, Thel wondered as he turned around to look out over the solid rocky walls of the ancient Vadam keep, was brave enough to order\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe massive moons of Sanghelios, hanging over the peaks of the mountain, offered no answers for Thel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and stepped over the corpses, and unlocked the door with the key hung by brass links around his neck. Several of his personal guard stood outside, weapons drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gather the elders,\" Thel ordered them. \"In the stone hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not even morning yet,\" one of them protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel rounded on him. \"Who is kaidon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard snaked his long head downwards. \"I swear on the blood of my ancestors I shall not question you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel looked his guards over. Lean and tall, their muted brown skin was almost all hidden by sturdy armor. Covenant armor. Their long-necked heads were sheathed in chain mail, and their large eyes gleamed in the flickering light of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all well built, powerful, overly trained since birth, specimens of Sangheili warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll poised to do Thel\u0027s bidding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey split off to go rouse the elders, as Thel walked through the stone corridors and tight spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a tense but glorious day that Thel had worked toward his whole life. The lineage of Vadam, in the long history of his kind, was relatively young -- founded by a distant ancestor during the first exploratory age, when Sangheili ships plied the dangerous oceans, risking terrific tides due to the multiple suns and moons the planet danced with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the sides of Kolaar Mountain the Vadam keep looked out toward Vadam harbor, thirty miles away. They\u0027d huddled against invaders throughout\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe ages here, and it was also from this well-defended location that they\u0027d lashed back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Prophets themselves had even tried but had been unable to properly destroy Vadam, among many others. They\u0027d been too buried into the crags and cliffs of their mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat Sangheili had built Vadam\u0027s power up through the generations. Thel wanted to add his own name to the Vadam Saga, etched into the living rock of the walls under the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are waiting for you,\" a guard said outside the stone room, as Thel walked down the steps that took him ever farther down into the depths of the mountain\u0027s bedrock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the distance, the thunder of the river shook the stone under Thel\u0027s feet. An underground water source, and power source, that no enemy had ever managed to get to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel entered the stone hall, and looked up at the curved timbers rising a hundred feet over his head. Then he looked down at the long table in the center of the room. The elders, most of them with their cloaks wrapped around them against the morning cold, stared at him with large, unblinking eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My blood,\" Thel said, as he walked to the head of the table. \"You voted me for kaidon, and yet it seems one of you did not believe in his vote, and did not believe in me, for three assassins broke into the High Room just minutes ago.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6/page-9.html","bookId":1638,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:18 PM"}
