The strange and quiet atmosphere continued between the two...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong felt a little embarrassed in his heart. Although a preposterous deed had happened between the two of them, it had occurred to due Ling Qingzhu falling into a trap. Now however, the two of them were clearly completely awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, Lin Dong could feel the soft body in his embrace. There was also a scalding heat being emitted at this moment. The wet thin clothes did not hide much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heat that was transmitted across the thin fabric also caused Lin Dong’s breathing to suddenly become a little heavier. It was likely that any ordinary man would not be able to maintain complete calmness in such a situation…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Release me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLing Qingzhu had also detected the slight change in Lin Dong. Fear immediately flashed in the depths of her eyes. She struggled a little, before finally uttering those words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current Ling Qingzhu had clearly lost her usual cool and calm self in this unusual situation. At the same time, she had also forgotten just what kind of fatal allure it was to a man, when a usually pure and noble goddess revealed such an extremely rare timidness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a that of drastic transformation, when the brilliance of a goddess was peeled away, and turned into a delicate woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHence, after she spoke, she did not see Lin Dong release her. Instead, a lustful flame surged within the latter’s black eyes. Next, her eyes suddenly widened as Lin Dong’s face rapidly expanded in her eyes. That arm which hugged her body completely fixed her in place. In the end, she sensed Lin Dong’s hot mouth landing on her lips in an overbearing and fearless manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scalding heat from her lips caused Ling Qingzhu’s body to instantly stiffen. Very quickly however, she regained her wits. Her delicate hand became just like the paws of a cat, as they viciously scratched Lin Dong’s back. Immediately, many bloody marks appeared, while her body struggled violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Lin Dong completely ignored her violent struggling. Both of his arms were like iron pliers, which firmly hugged the lovely figure in his embrace. That great strength appeared as though he was attempting to crush her into his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang bang bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLing Qingzhu’s jadelike hands resisted in front of her, and a palm landed on Lin Dong’s chest. The resulting deep and muffled sound caused one to be scared witless. Clearly, the former was both extremely embarrassed and furious at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLing Qingzhu was extremely powerful. When this palm landed, Lin Dong was still somewhat unable to endure despite his powerful physical body. His body immediately leaned forward, and caused the two bodies to press tightly on each other. Soon after, his lips withdrew as he viciously glared at the woman in his embrace. He spoke with a heavy breath, “I will take you here and now if you move again!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You dare!” Ling Qingzhu’s face was filled with embarrassment and fury, as she clenched her teeth and rebuked. Although she spoke in such a manner, her struggles had clearly weakened. It seemed that she was indeed a little afraid of Lin Dong turning crazy this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong grinned. He felt the intense pain that was transmitted from his chest and back. However, his heart had a joy that could not be hidden. It had been five years. That noble and arrogant woman from back then, whom he could only look up to and not touch, was once again being ruthlessly taken advantage of by him today. That somewhat perverse joy practically had an even greater satisfaction compared to when he killed Lin Langtian back then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lin Dong, you are asking to die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Lin Dong’s heart was filled pleasure, the voice of the woman in his embrace suddenly turned cold. Immediately, he lowered his head, only to see that the embarrassment and fury on Ling Qingzhu’s face start to vanish. In their place was her usual and familiar coldness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, this woman’s willpower was quite extraordinary. Even at this moment, she was still able to swiftly suppress the disturbance in her heart, and regain her normal state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s expression also altered slightly when he saw this. Even though he had managed to cause Ling Qingzhu to be unable to resist him, this was only because the latter had panicked. Given the latter’s strength, if she was to really calm down, Lin Dong would definitely not be able to do much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s prediction was correct. After Ling Qingzhu calmed down, an unusually mighty fluctuation suddenly spread from her body. A great force unfurled, and directly jolted Lin Dong’s arm away. The force was so great, that even he was forced to take a couple of steps back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLing Qingzhu had also taken this opportunity to escape Lin Dong’s control, as her figure drifted backwards. The face with a soul-stirring beauty, however, was covered with frost at this moment. Clearly, Lin Dong’s act of taking advantage of her earlier had greatly infuriated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong quickly became clear-headed when he saw Ling Qingzhu’s expression. He immediately cried out inwardly, “This is bad”...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Lin Dong felt an ominous feeling in his heart, to his front, Ling Qingzhu extended her jadelike hand. Promptly, she clenched her hand gently, as a blue longsword appeared in a flash. A formidable aura abruptly unfurled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Run.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s scalp skin turned numb upon seeing this. It seemed like this woman had gone mad. Without any hesitation, he immediately turned around and rushed out of the pond. He did not doubt that the Ling Qingzhu at this moment would not give any face or take their relationship into account when she attacked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwoosh swoosh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s body had barely moved, when two unusually sharp sword glows suddenly shot at him from behind. In the end, they skimmed passed his body, and directly cut two enormous water channels in the pond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lin Dong, I will kill you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLing Qingzhu’s voice, which contained embarrassment and fury amidst the coldness, was transmitted from behind. Subsequently, Lin Dong felt sharp sword glows rushing over from all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwoosh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong was naturally not foolish enough to stay behind and suffer those sword attacks. His green dragon wings extended. With a ‘swoosh’, he rushed forth. Countless formidable sword glows were like swimming fish, as they chased after him at lightning speed from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Supreme Purity Celestial Pond in the valley was completely quiet. However, this silence did not last for long, before an enormous whirlpool formed within the pond. In the next moment, a green figure burst out from it. Next, sword glows shot out in all directions. The surrounding mountain walls were instantly blasted apart. Many huge sword scars had appeared on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong glanced at the mess around him after rushing out from the pond, and the corners of his mouth twitched involuntarily. It turns out that Ling Qingzhu was actually this frightening when she flipped out…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surface of the Supreme Purity Celestial Pond once again exploded. Water splashed over the sky as a beautiful figure appeared. Subsequently, a completely wet black robe flew out. A white dress shook and swiftly covered her jadelike body. As the water fell, a great beauty in a white dress was already standing in the sky. She descended like an azure waterfall, however, her pretty face was still covered with frost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swoosh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLing Qingzhu held a longsword in her hand. Her face was frosty as she watched Lin Dong, who was forcing a smile. Without further ado, the longsword danced, and another formidable sword glow shot out, shooting at the fatal spots on Lin Dong’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon seeing this, Lin Dong hurriedly pulled back. He pushed his speed to the limit, and continuously dodged Ling Qingzhu’s attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I went down to rescue you. Do you need to be so ferocious?” Lin Dong hurriedly said as he dodged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I had not gone down, your life would have been sucked away by that thing…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was worried about you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLing Qingzhu gnashed her pearly white teeth and coldly stated, “What has this got to do with your disrespectful acts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong was speechless. A desire had indeed rose within himself earlier, and it was due to this that he was unable to resist doing those things. Even with his thick skinned nature, he was unable to find any excuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Humph.” Ling Qingzhu snorted coldly when she saw this. Her sword slashed again, and another formidable sword glow, which was a couple of dozen feet in size, furiously cut at Lin Dong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong gazed at the sword glow that had once again came slashing at him. He sighed somewhat helplessly and actually ceased having any intentions of dodging it. From the looks of it, he seemed to be wanting to suffer her attack…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwoosh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword glow arrived in a flash. However, Ling Qingzhu eventually clenched her teeth just as it was about to land on Lin Dong’s body. Her delicate jadelike finger thrust forward, and the sword glow slightly shifted its direction. After which, it narrowly passed Lin Dong’s body and viciously hacked downwards, directly cutting a huge scar on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong sighed in relief when the sword glow missed. After which, he helplessly spoke to an icy faced Ling Qingzhu, “Are you done venting your anger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud rumbling sound was suddenly transmitted from a short distance away soon after Lin Dong’s voice faded. After which, the three headed monster snake, which had been diverted away earlier, once again hissed as it wildly charged towards the valley. Its eyes immediately filled with a violent murderous intent the moment it saw the two individuals in the valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwoosh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong watched this monster snake’s return, and was just about to attack, but a figure had already flashed past him. Lin Dong was stunned as he watched countless sharp sword glows rushing out from Ling Qingzhu’s sword, seemingly covering the sky as they bared onto the monster snake from all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHiss hiss hiss!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three headed monster snake emitted a sharp and miserable screech when faced with this merciless attack of Ling Qingzhu. Many bloody scars rapidly appeared on its enormous body. Soon after, the monster snake, which had a strength comparable to Lei Qian, was cut into pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the air, Lin Dong stared blankly at this scene. He gazed upon the incomparably miserable fate of the monster snake, before once again looking at Ling Qingzhu’s face, as the iciness slowly started to withdraw from it. For a time, his scalp felt somewhat numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis woman was likely using her actions to warn him; this was the outcome when she became furious…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-794\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-796\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-795","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM"}
