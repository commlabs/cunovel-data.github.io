What is it with your gestures? Your eagerness to sacrifice? Why do you all give yourselves to us? We are not pure vessels. We are not innocent. We will not handle your soul like a precious, fragile jewel. No, you fool, we’ll abuse it as if it was our own, or, indeed, of lesser value than that-if that is possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crunch of stones, and suddenly Udinaas was crouching before her. In his cupped hands, a minnow. Writhing trapped in a tiny, diminishing pool of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Plan on splitting it six ways, Udinaas?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s not that, Acquitor. Look at it. Closely now. Do you see? It has no eyes. It is blind.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And is that significant?’ But it was, she realized. She frowned up at him, saw the sharp glitter in his gaze. ‘We are not seeing what is truly here, are we?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Darkness,’ he said. ‘The cave. The womb.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But… how?’ She looked round. The landscape of broken rock, the pallid lichen and mosses and the very dead trees. The sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gift, or curse,’ Udinaas said, straightening. ‘She took a husband, didn’t she?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him walking back to the stream, watched him tenderly returning the blind minnow to the rushing water. A gesture Seren would not have expected from him. She? Who took a husband?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gift or curse,’ said Udinaas as he approached her once again. ‘The debate rages on.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mother Dark… and Father Light.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned his usual cold grin. At last, Seren Pedac stirs from her pit. I’ve been wondering about those three brothers.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree brothers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on as if she knew of whom he was speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Spawn of Mother Dark, yes, but then, there were plenty of those, weren’t there? Was there something that set those three apart? Andarist, Anomander, Silchas. What did Clip tell us? Oh, right, nothing. But we saw the tapestries, didn’t we? Andarist, like midnight itself. Anomander, with hair of blazing white. And here, Silchas, our walking bloodless abomination, whiter than any corpse but just as friendly. So what caused the great rift between sons and mother? Maybe it wasn’t her spreading her legs to Light like a stepfather none of them wanted. Maybe that’s all a lie, one of those sweetly convenient ones. Maybe, Seren Pedac, it was finding out who their father was.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could not help but follow his gaze to where stood Silchas Ruin. Then she snorted and turned away. ‘Does it matter?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Does it matter? Not right now,’ Udinaas said. ‘But it will.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why? Every family has its secrets.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. ‘I have my own question. If Silchas Ruin is all Light on the outside, what must he be on the inside?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The world is his mirror.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the world we now look upon is a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Udinaas, I thought the Tiste Edur were the children of Mother Dark and Father Light.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Successive generations, probably. Not in any obvious way connected to those three brothers.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Scabandari.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, I imagine so. Father Shadow, right? Ah, what a family that was! Let’s not forget the sisters! Menandore with her raging fire of dawn, Sheltatha Lore the loving dusk, and Sukul Ankhadu, treacherous bitch of night. Were there others? There must have been, but they’ve since fallen by the wayside. Myths-prefer manageable numbers, after all, and three always works best. Three of this, three of that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But Scabandari would be the fourth-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndarist is dead.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. Andarist is dead.’ And how does he know such things? Who speaks to you, Udinaas, in your nightly fevers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could find out, she suddenly realized. She could slide in, like a ghost. She could, with the sorcery of Mockra, steal knowledge. I could rape someone else’s mind, is what I mean. Without his ever knowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was necessity, wasn’t there? Something terrible was coming. Udinaas knew what it would be. What it might be, anyway. And Fear Sengar-he had just vowed to protect her, as if he too suspected some awful confrontation was close at hand. I remain the only one to know nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could change that. She could use the power she had found within her. It was nothing more than self-protection. To remain ignorant was to justly suffer whatever fate awaited her; yes, in lacking ruthlessness she would surely deserve whatever befell her. For ignoring what Mockra offered, for ignoring this gift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder it had said nothing since that first conversation. She had been in her pit, stirring old sand to see what seeds might spring to life, but there was no light reaching that pit, and no life among the chill grains. An indulgent game and nothing more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-317.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
