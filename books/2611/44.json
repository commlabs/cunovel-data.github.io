No one shouted “Werewolf!” and ran away screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bent down and spoke quietly in Kane’s ear. It twitched as he listened. “The last time I saw Juliet, we were standing by that crashed taxi. Mab was inspecting the driver’s injuries, I stood beside her, and Juliet was behind us. We stood there for a minute, tops. But when I turned around to leave, Juliet was gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane nudged at the plastic bag I held. I removed Juliet’s sweater and held it out to him. He sniffed at the fabric, taking his time. Then he put his nose to the ground. He moved back and forth along Berkeley Street, nudging people out of the way or scooting between their legs, trying to find the scent. It must have been hard trying to sniff out one vampire in that jumble of confusing odors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore long, though, Kane froze. He raised his head and yipped quietly, looking back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got it?” I mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and lowered his head to the ground again. He broke out of the crowd and moved toward Beacon Street at a swift trot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the intersection, Kane turned right on Beacon. He went maybe a dozen yards and then veered toward the curb. Beside a parked car, he stopped and raised his head. He looked up and down the street, nostrils flaring, trying to catch a scent on the wind. Then he squeezed between two parked cars, stepping into the street. He walked slowly along the street side of the cars, sniffing the ground. There wasn’t much traffic on the oneway street at this time of night, but I watched for cars coming from Beacon Hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane bounded across the street and paced up and down the sidewalk there. After a few minutes, he returned to where I stood. He sat and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So the trail disappears right here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. He got up on his hind legs, leaning his front paws against a car, and then looked down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, that must be what happened. They put her in some vehicle and drove off.” I slumped against the parked car. Damned dead end. Now what? The Old Ones had Juliet. Myrddin had the bloodstone, and Mab was aging by the minute. Kane was stuck in wolf form, thanks to Myrddin’s magic. And in forty-eight hours, someone else would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was more than I could handle. Maybe I could do something to stop the Reaper—and frustrate Myrddin’s plans. But I couldn’t do it alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to look for Daniel,” I told Kane. I couldn’t imagine Detective Costello would be happy to see me, the “amateur detective” who wasn’t good at much besides handing over mysterious virus samples and getting in the way. But if I told him where the Reaper would strike next, he could flood the place with cops and, with luck, prevent the final murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’d be there, too, to settle things with Myrddin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe made our way back to the crime scene. The crowd had thinned. There wasn’t much to see: crime scene technicians crawling over the place, a photographer taking photos, cops standing around talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding beside the Channel 10 On-the-Scene News van was Lynne Hong, investigative reporter. Lynne had been dating Daniel since the Paranormal Appreciation Day concert. She was pretty and petite and, right now, mad as hell. I went over to talk to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded in greeting when she saw me, then turned her annoyed gaze back to the crime scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Daniel here?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Not that it’s doing me any good. There’s been no official statement yet, and he won’t talk to me unofficially. What good is dating a cop if you can’t get inside information?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d gone out with Daniel a few times, and I could think of lots of good reasons to date him. “He’s under a lot of stress right now—” I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re keeping all the reporters way back,” she said, as if I hadn’t spoken. “We couldn’t even get a decent shot of the ambulance crew removing the body.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to talk to Daniel. Can you point out where he is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” Her head whipped around, and she looked at me as though she’d only just realized I stood beside her. “Do you have information? Can give me something to follow up on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes shone with eagerness. A month ago, when a mysterious force was killing Deadtown’s zombies, “eager” had nothing to do with Lynne Hong, who’d been slow to cover the story. Now that humans were the victims, she was all over it. I wasn’t going to give her any scoops. I shook my head and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s over there,” she called. I turned around to see where she was pointing, then waved my thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I walked in the direction Lynne had indicated, I noticed that all the police activity was on the strip of grass between Back Street and Storrow Drive. There were no cops in the place where Mab and I had been cornered by Myrddin’s vampire allies. That area wasn’t marked off as part of the crime scene. The vampires were gone. No bodies lay in the street. Not even the SUV Myrddin had blasted remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Old Ones had done one hell of a clean-up job. And fast. But why bother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could think of only one reason. They must have feared the vampire, the one I didn’t kill, would betray them. They’d lost their grip on Juliet, who’d run away. Maybe they worried their power was slipping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the crime scene’s perimeter, a uniformed cop stood with his arms folded across his chest. He was young and trying to look tough. Probably not the best cop to approach, but he was closest to Daniel. I stopped in front of him, and he gave me a distinctly unfriendly look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to talk to Detective Costello.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” His sneer looked like he’d been taking lessons from Norden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My name’s Vicky Vaughn. He knows me. I have some information for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t turn around, didn’t even blink. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but Detective Costello is busy right now. This is a crime scene.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, really? I thought you’d strung up all that black-and-yellow tape for a birthday party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still didn’t blink. “If you call the department, you can make an appointment to see him tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see Daniel right now, standing near the taxi, his partner beside him. They were talking to a woman who stood with her back to me. Long black hair cascaded down her back. For a second, I thought it was Juliet, but then I realized this woman was taller. It was Roxana Jade. I wondered what a witch was doing at the crime scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daniel!” I shouted, my hands cupped around my mouth. He turned, and I waved my arm over my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cop standing guard pivoted to see Daniel’s reaction. When he did, Kane bolted from the shadows and into the crime scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel held up a finger, telling me to wait. He touched Roxana’s arm. She turned, her eyes scanning the crowd until she saw me, and nodded. The two of them came over. Daniel’s partner moved off to talk to the photographer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vicky.” Daniel’s voice was wary. “What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to play the concerned citizen, not the amateur detective: Give my information to the professionals and let them handle it. I certainly wasn’t going to tell him it was my second visit here tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My aunt and I plotted the murder sites on a map. We thought we recognized a pattern, and then we heard that there’d been another murder, right where the pattern indicated. I figured you’d be here, so I came to tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What pattern?” Roxana asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a rune.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eihwaz.” Roxana nodded. “That rune was carved—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roxana.” Daniel’s sharp voice cut her off. He wouldn’t be giving me any free information, that was clear. Suddenly, I understood Lynne’s frustration. Daniel turned to me. “What do you know about this rune?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It represents the yew tree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a complex symbol,” Roxana said. “It symbolizes both death and transcendence over death. Yew trees are planted in cemeteries throughout the British Isles. They belong to the dead, yet the trees themselves are some of the oldest living things on the planet.” She traced the symbol in the air with her finger. “Death not as an ending, but as a beginning. That’s how I’ve always thought of eihwaz.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made a whole lot of sense. It meshed with what the Old Ones wanted, passing through undeath into eternal life. It also expressed what Myrddin was trying to do—use the deaths of others to create a new life for Pryce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked Roxana what she was doing here. Daniel gave her a sharp glance and answered for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roxana’s an expert in magical symbols. She’s working for us as a consultant.” His tone said that she had a reason to be here—and I didn’t. The implication stung. Well, I wasn’t here to win Daniel’s approval. I just needed to make sure he knew where the next murder would take place. “I came to tell you about the rune. But since you already know about it, you can see why the pattern is important: It predicts the next murder site. The Reaper will kill again near the Boylston Street T station, the night after tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel nodded, and I drew in a deep breath of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to push my luck. “I told you that I think that a wizard named Myrddin is using the Reaper to try to resuscitate Pryce Maddox.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWary, yet interested, Daniel nodded. Since the Paranormal Appreciation Day concert, there had been an arrest warrant out for Pryce, who was wanted for using sorcery to incite terror. I knew that Daniel would love to be the one who arrested him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There will be some sort of facility near the murder site set up to do the ritual transfer,” I continued. “It will be dark”—the Old Ones didn’t like sunlight any more than vampires—“probably underground. In fact, I bet if you check the basements of these buildings, you’ll find something like that here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel’s expression made me suspect they were already doing just that. It made sense. They’d found an underground facility at the previous murder site. Roxana caught her breath. “There’s an abandoned subway tunnel right near that T station,” she exclaimed. “It runs south from Boylston under Tremont Street. An ex-boyfriend of mine—he belongs to an urban explorers’ club, and they check out abandoned buildings and tunnels and such—anyway, he told me about it. You get into the old tunnel through the emergency exit at the Boylston Street station, inbound side.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodstone-deadtown-3/page-44.html","bookId":2611,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:26 PM"}
