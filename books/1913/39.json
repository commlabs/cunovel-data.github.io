I’ll go get you some coffee, find your aunts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was almost out the door when Mama’s eyes cleared suddenly, pinned on Sully. “Wait,” she said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ma?” The sound of her mother’s voice should’ve been reassuring, but instead it alarmed her. She patted her mother’s arm, and it felt like thin crepe draped over bone. When had Ma gotten so thin? Should she have put her in a home? Thinking on it now, she realized her mother hadn’t been eating much, not really. Marlene knew a spurt of guilt and pushed it away. She beckoned Tom closer, saying in as bright and even a tone as she could muster, “You remember Tom Sullivan? Sully? Tom helped me. He drove me to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Marlene hadn’t needed to bring him to her mother’s attention—Emerald’s eyes were glued to the man. Mama’s voice was strong and steady when she said, “I don’t regret you for a minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully shot Marlene a wary glance, but came to sit at Ma’s bedside. “I beg your pardon?” He took her mother’s hand without thinking, and Marlene thought him a good man for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Emerald spoke again, an eerie clarity infused her eyes and voice, focusing on Tom like he was the only person in the room. Her hand trembled and knuckles turned pale with the grip she had on his hand. “I don’t regret our running off. What I regret is that we didn’t keep running.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She thinks you’re someone else,” Marlene whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gus?” The old woman became agitated, her tone turned frantic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene held her breath. Gus. She’d never before heard her mother say the name. The man who must’ve been her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom remained calm, though, his demeanor so warm and open. “Yes, Emerald? What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis equanimity calmed her mother, calmed her, and a question slammed to the forefront of Marlene’s mind: how on earth is this man single?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMama’s chin quivered with emotion, but her voice rang clearly through the hospital room. “If I had it to do again, I’d stay. I loved you, Gus. And I love you still. And that’s all there is. Daddy said I was reckless and I believed him, but my mistake wasn’t that I ran off with you. It was heeding anything but my own heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched as Ma fell asleep wearing the most peaceful expression Marlene had ever seen. Sully silently disengaged his fingers and tucked her mother’s hand beneath the covers. As he took Marlene’s hand, she let her gaze meet his. The man behind those dark blue eyes was steadfast and strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to learn from her mother. Time to let her heart run free. And as she held Sully’s gaze, she knew. Her heart would be safe with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty-one\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorrow’s eyes shot open, her heart pounding, unsure why she was awake and where. She knew a moment of sweet relief, feeling Billy at her back. Billy. Wondrous, amazing, hot as hell Billy. Then a ringing. The phone. The phone had woken her. Her heart kicked into double time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiddle of the night phone calls were never good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly sat up, as alert as if a switch had flicked in his mind. He answered the phone, and his voice might’ve been all business, but he put a warm, strong hand on her suddenly chilled shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer first thought was of BJ—phone calls at odd hours were terrifying when you had a loved one at war. She told herself they never called—they came, first thing in the morning. Gray light filtered through the blinds—what time was it? Would her parents have gotten word and called her here? She glanced at the clock. 7:17 A.M. Early, but was it too early for some Marine Corps chaplain to drive out to Sierra Falls and knock on her folks’ door?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s up?” he said, then mouthed to her, Marshall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bolted upright, cradling the sheet across her chest, unable to relax. Why was the deputy calling? Had there been another accident at the lodge? Billy worried the culprit was after her, but if they thought she was at home in her bed…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly and Marshall went back and forth, but then Billy looked at her. Hesitating, he said, “Yeah, she’s here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned against the headboard, feeling numb. “What is it?” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly didn’t drop her gaze, but he didn’t tell her what was going on either. “I’m sorry to hear that. We’ll be there in no time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pounced on him the moment he was off the phone. “What is it? What happened? It’s not BJ, is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“BJ?” He had a perplexed look on his face. “Oh! God, no, Sorrow. BJ and your folks are all fine. It’s Emerald. I’m sorry, she passed last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh…” She slouched, letting the news sink in. “Poor Marlene.” Emerald Kidd had been ailing for some time, but that didn’t make it any easier on the family left behind. She frowned, thinking. “But why was he asking about me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your folks were looking for you. The lodge was up at dawn. Your mom apparently has a bee in her bonnet to hold a reception this afternoon. Emerald was well-loved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We all loved Emerald.” Sorrow sighed, nodded. It was what you did in a small town—when crisis hit, you banded together and you ate. “Grief,” she said sadly. “It’s feed or be fed.” She shifted to face him full-on. “But how did they know to call here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When they realized you weren’t in your bed, Bear called dispatch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slapped a hand to her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “Our secret’s out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” she said. His job as sheriff kept him in the public eye—would he shy away from the extra attention? The speculation? She was ready to jump in with both feet, but what about him? Was he even fully done with his grieving?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry?” He gently drew her hands from her face and pulled her close. “What kind of nonsense are you talking? I’m not sorry. You were here last night with me. I’m walking on air, Sorrow. I’m thrilled for people to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking on air. No man had ever said such a thing about her. “You are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely,” he said. “Not only that, do you honestly think anyone will be surprised?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a shy smile. “No, I guess not.” The question of Damien and his response was one she’d consider another time. With a sigh, she pulled off the sheet. “I guess we’ve been summoned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh no you don’t.” He tugged the sheet back up and burrowed deeper, snaking his hands around to grab her and roll her atop him. “They definitely won’t miss you for another hour or so.” As he glided his hands up and down her thighs, he told her slowly, “You need to shower, and do your hair, and eat breakfast, and lots of other things that will take you lots of time.” His hands came to rest cupped on her bottom, nestling her into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair fell in a curtain around his face. His body was already straining to meet hers, and she wriggled suggestively. “You sure we have time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Life’s short, Sorrow.” Billy’s face grew serious, the dark glint of desire in his eyes. “We’ll make time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura looked from her to Billy. “Well, lookee what the cat dragged in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning to you, too,” Billy said, unruffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorrow felt herself blush, but refused to take her sister’s bait. Today wasn’t about them. “What happened?” she asked, redirecting the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura’s teasing smile faded at once. “Emerald fell yesterday. She was on the porch, trying to go down the front stairs, wearing just her slippers and robe. Ruby and Pearl were in the kitchen when it happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The poor women. I bet they feel horrible.” It wasn’t the first time something like that had happened, but there’d been no way to keep an eye on Emerald twenty-four hours a day. Not even a nursing home could claim that. “Where was Marlene when it happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura raised her brows. “On a date. With Sully.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the sad news, Sorrow couldn’t help the smile that popped onto her face. “Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, really.” Laura sighed. “But talk about feeling bad. Marlene hates that she wasn’t there. Thank God she was able to catch up with Emerald at the hospital. She passed in the night, very peacefully, I gather.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you need us to do?” Billy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura gave him an assessing look. “So you’re sticking around, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marshall’s on duty today, so you best get used to my ugly mug.” He slid Sorrow’s coat from her shoulders. “You go help your mom. I’ll see if I can occupy Bear, keep him out of your hair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he left the room, Laura grinned shamelessly. “You go, girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she had with Billy felt too special to gossip over, so she cut off her sister, saying, “Let’s get to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura’s shoulders slumped. “Fine,” she muttered. “But you have no idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just follow me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed into the dining room, and her eyes widened at the devastation. It looked like someone had come and emptied their breakfront. Every piece of blue Wedgwood they owned was stacked on the buffet, the good silverware looked like it’d exploded over the dining table, a few cut-glass vases were waiting to be dusted, and blackened silver polish rags littered the place. “What’s the story?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The story?” Her sister sighed. “The story is, Mom’s losing it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to illustrate the point, their mom bustled in, holding a tablecloth in each hand. “Which one?” she demanded, looking a little wild-eyed. “The gingham or Meemaw’s table runner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meemaw’s,” the girls said in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith looked doubtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meemaw was friendly with the Kidd sisters. It’s a nice touch.” Sorrow took it from her, and with Laura’s help, moved the silver aside to spread it on the table. Before her mom could bustle back out of the room, Sorrow snatched her hands, forcing Mom to meet her eyes. “What’s the plan?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sierra-falls-sierra-falls-1/page-39.html","bookId":1913,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:28:27 PM"}
