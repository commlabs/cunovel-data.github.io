Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car honked as she swerved across four lanes to exit the highway, and she seemed utterly oblivious. “So, you and Cole are at the stage where he’s comfortable enough to call your Nana, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. It’s kind of weird, right, and...” Wait. I knew Cole. He’d always been a guy with a plan. A purpose. He never did anything without a rock-solid reason. But what reason could he possibly have had to—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer slammed into me, and I nearly liquefied in my seat. I’d lost my family, and this was my first Halloween without them. He was trying to reduce the number of memories I’d have to battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t know that I’d never before celebrated Halloween. My dad hadn’t allowed us to leave the house at night, so there had been no reason to buy a costume, and opening the door to strangers to pass out candy had been just as big a no-no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I said to Kat, wishing I could crawl into Cole’s arms and never leave. “We are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re so lucky. My dad has never been a Frosty fan. I’m pretty sure he’s only ever threatened to castrate the boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad to be those serial-killer eyes. Sometimes, when Frosty looked at you, you just expected to die horribly. “Your dad still lets you guys date, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, and he always will. When I was first diagnosed with defunct kidneys, he promised to let me make my own decisions and live my life the way I wanted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood man. “So, what have you decided to do tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The same thing you are. And I didn’t mention it before now because I didn’t want you drowning in jealousy knowing I was out having the best time ever while you were still languishing in your sickbed.” She gripped the steering wheel so tightly her knuckles bleached of color. “I’m trying not to be nervous. I mean, I know all the slayers will be there, but the night will be filled with all kinds of creepers, so how will I know who’s dangerous and who’s not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You aren’t able to see real zombies,” I reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That doesn’t mean they aren’t there. First, I told Frosty no, but then he said, ‘Would I ever put you at risk, woman?’ And I said, ‘How would I know? You’ve been living a double life since we started dating.’ And he said, ‘You want me to apologize again, don’t you?’ And I said, ‘Every day for the rest of your life.’ He had the nerve to laugh as if I was joking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smothered a laugh of my own. “So...what’s your costume?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A too-sexy-to-handle Little Red Riding Hood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me guess. Frosty’s going as the Big Bad Wolf.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else? I have a feeling he thinks it’ll be hilarious to snap his teeth at me and say, ‘I’m going to eat you up, my dear.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicturing it, I shook my head. “You’re going to tell him to prove it. Aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like that you know me so well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned onto a winding gravel road nestled between rows of trees in the process of shedding their fall coats. When the trees finally gave way to fields of wheat, Cole’s “workout station for stallions” became visible—a big red barn that looked ready to topple over. Actually, the thing could withstand a military invasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This place is in the middle of nowhere,” Kat remarked as she eased to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For many reasons.” Slayers coming at all hours of the day and night. The sheer number of weapons kept here. The condition we sometimes left in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were more cars than usual in the driveway. I frowned as I stepped into the coolness of the day. Grunts, groans and even cheers seeped from the crack in the door. “Come on.” I quickened my pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped just inside the entrance and could only gape. I’d assumed Cole, and maybe the überdedicated Frosty and Bronx would be the only guys willing to forgo a countrywide day off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat bumped into me and froze. “Oh, spank me,” she whispered, her tone reverent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere they were, all of the slayers in all their glory. There was enough testosterone in the air to jump-start the deadest of hearts. Most of the boys were shirtless, displaying bronzed muscles honed from more than just weights—honed from hacking at the enemy. I saw wicked scars, sexy tattoos and piercings, and even a few house-arrest anklets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond and scarily beautiful Frosty pounded his fists into a poor, defenseless punching bag. The rough-and-tumble Bronx held the thing in place, his feet planted firmly on the floor. There was no force on earth that could move him, even one as violent as Frosty. Collins ran on a treadmill, and Cruz lifted weights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Cole, well, he was in the boxing ring with a girl I didn’t recognize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an unfamiliar boy standing at the side, watching the pair. The only other females in the room were Mackenzie—Cole’s very feral ex—and Trina, a girl Kat had yet to forgive for not having a summer fling with Frosty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrina waved at me, and I waved back, but my attention quickly returned to Cole. He swung lightheartedly at the unknown girl, and she ducked before straightening and swinging at him. He ducked, too, and when she swung again, he caught her fist and jerked her against the hard line of his body, effectively disabling her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned up at him, all cocky assurance and feminine wiles—and she stayed right where she was, clearly happy to be there. A boy with a girlfriend should have released her and stepped back. Although Cole stiffened, the gleam in his eyes turning granite-hard, he remained just as he was, returning her grin with one of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t sure what any of that meant. I only knew I didn’t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime for Pep Talk Ali. He’s trained other girls. He’s even smiled at other girls. This isn’t romantic. This isn’t sexual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Downer Ali wasn’t fully convinced (yes, there are many sides to me). He didn’t pick you up because he didn’t want to leave this girl’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. He was mine, my toy, and I wouldn’t share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if he wanted me to share him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Stupid insecurity. Cole wasn’t like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kitten,” Frosty called, sounding more than a little surprised. “How’d you find me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat lifted her chin, the picture of female pique. “Don’t flatter yourself. I’m not here for you. But just so you know, I used my phenomenal detective skills, coupled with Ali’s mediocre directions. No offense,” she said to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None taken.” Mediocre was actually better than I deserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be that way, baby,” he replied, unwinding the tape from his fists. “You know I would have given you a ride on the Frosty Express. You just had to ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBronx rolled his eyes. Several of the other guys groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole’s attention arrowed in my direction. Our gazes locked, and guilt filled those violet irises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuilt? Why guilt? Whatever the answer, it couldn’t be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not stomp into that ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not pull the pair apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not beat them both into pulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set the girl away from him. Once again I found myself waiting and hoping for a vision. I was back on my feet. Things should go back to normal. But a moment passed, then another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormal remained at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dash of dread joined a pinch of jealousy, a recipe for trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new guy whistled under his breath, and my attention shifted to him. Our gazes collided. A second later, the world washed away, just as I’d wanted it to do with Cole—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—we were in my bedroom, standing beside my bed. No, we were lying on my bed. I’d just pushed him down. I tilted his head with one hand and pulled at his clothes with the other. Then I licked my way down his throat. I was making strange little growling noises, as if I’d never enjoyed a taste so much and had to have more—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—Ali!” Cole shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, and the vision evaporated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole appeared, his features tense. “What just happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude,” Frosty said to the new guy. “Your brain just checked out for a bit. I haven’t seen anything like that since Cole first met Al—and uh, yeah, never mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew Guy stared at me, looking suspicious and angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumbled back a few steps. I couldn’t believe I’d just mind-cheated on Cole. Like, big-time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cole asked a good question,” New Guy croaked. “What just happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he’d had the vision, too. No. No, no, no. What did that mean? That strong of a connection had never happened with anyone but Cole. Why here? Why now? Why this guy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a better question,” the new girl said with a sweet Southern drawl. “Will someone please introduce me to the newcomers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to make sure the vision never came true. It couldn’t come true. It would mean Cole and I were over. It would mean the new life I’d carved for myself had crashed and burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle ticked in Cole’s jaw. “Veronica, meet Ali. Ali, Veronica. She’s one of the slayers from Atlanta. Ali’s friend is Kat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My girl,” Frosty added, proudly thumping his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In your dreams,” Kat replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey launched into a heated argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Veronica is another of Cole’s exes,” Mackenzie piped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, good glory, no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not just any ex,” Veronica added, offering me a grin as sweet as her voice. “I’m his favorite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened, waiting for Cole to say the words Actually, Ali is my favorite—and she’s not an ex. He didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice to meet you,” I whispered, fighting panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I hadn’t thought there was a girl more beautiful than Mackenzie. Now I knew how wrong I’d been. Veronica was. By far. She had perfectly tanned skin, dark glossy hair that was iron-board straight and fell to her shoulders and light green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackenzie had dark hair, though hers was curly, and dark green eyes. Put the three of us side by side, and you wouldn’t have to ask who didn’t belong. I had wavy hair so pale it could have been classified as old-granny white, and eyes so blue they bordered on freaky. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-zombie-glass-white-rabbit-chronicles-2/page-5.html","bookId":2521,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:05 PM"}
