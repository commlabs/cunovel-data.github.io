He glanced at the locator screen, glowing in the dark on the passenger seat. Luca\u0027s car was a fixed dot in the center of the green LCD monitor; the Lexus was a blip floating directly above it. A GPS program laid out a map of the city around them, showing both cars crossing the Hudson River toward the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll was well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell?he thought. Who am I kidding?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. He\u0027d almost forgotten whatwell meant. Nothing was anywhere nearwell .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarryl Lister had become a raw, twitching nerve after he learned of the fateful question at the stockholders\u0027 meeting, a nonstop question box:Who asked it? How could he know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Luca had soon found out that it wasn\u0027t a \u0027he\u0027 at all. The meeting had been recorded - a matter of routine - and who did he spot while reviewing the video files: Cadman. Romy fucking Cadman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially Lister had been sure that Palmer had talked under his own Totuus, but then they\u0027d tracked the operative to some Long Island hospital where he was spending his days sitting around babbling gibberish. Obviously the MTW had worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca shuddered at the thought of such a fate, even if the effect only lasted for ninety days. Ninety days of hell. If you weren\u0027t loony before, you damn sure might be after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the success of the MTW had sent Luca back to the leak problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe already knew it was Ellis Sinclair. But who was he was leaking to? That was what mattered. Tonight Luca would find out. Once he learned Sinclair\u0027s contact, the rest would fall into place. Then he\u0027d make his move. And take no prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed Sinclair down the West Side Highway to Fifty-fourth Street, crawled across Midtown -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;traffic in the city would be murder until after Christmas - to a parking garage across the street from the Warwick Hotel. Shit! He couldn\u0027t very well pull in right behind him. He should have brought backup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the car double-parked and running while he trotted to the ramp that led down to the parking area. Crouching, he spotted Sinclair accepting a ticket from the attendant. But instead of walking back this way, he started up the ramp on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck! He was heading out to Fifty-third!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca ducked back into his car. He folded up the locator unit and grabbed the keys. As he slammed and locked the door he heard a voice behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t leave that here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to see an NYPD uniform. Black, big face, big gut stretching his blue shirt, big black belt laden with police paraphernalia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Officer, this is an emergency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care if your hair is on fire, you can\u0027t leave that car here. There\u0027s a garage right there. Pull it in and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have time. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You leave that car there, I promise you, it\u0027ll be long gone and far away when you come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Luca said, moving off. He tossed the keys to the cop. \"Take it. Merry Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cop opened his mouth, then closed it. Luca doubted he\u0027d ever had anyone tell him to go ahead and tow his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca dashed straight through the garage - down, across, and up onto Fifty-third. He stopped when he reached the sidewalk, frantically peering east and west through the lights, the shadows, the people hurrying to escape the chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich way, damn it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced longingly at the locator unit, dangling from his hand like a small valise. If only there had been some way to affix a transponder to Sinclair himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever mind the wishing. What now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t see Sinclair on Fifty-third. Maybe he\u0027d headed downtown on Sixth Avenue. Luca\u0027s instincts urged him in that direction. He started off at a run but the crowds on the avenue slowed him to a crawl. The Radio City Music Hall Christmas Show was in full swing, jamming the Sixth Avenue sidewalks with parents and their screaming kiddies. But that meant Sinclair couldn\u0027t move fast either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca bullied and bulled his way through the throng as fast as he could, earning angry looks and comments. Yeah, merry Christmas to you too, fuckers. He kept rising on tiptoes to check the other side of the street - he saw oversized Venus de Milos framing the Credit Lyonnaise Building, and a line of fifteen-foot nutcrackers standing guard against the columns of the Paine-Webber, but no Ellis Sinclair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Art Deco marquee directly ahead now,Radio City blazing in red neon, and the damned charter busses vomiting tourists onto the sidewalk blocked his view of the opposite side. No sign of Sinclair here, so he stepped between two buses to check the other side - just in time to spot Sinclair starting down a subway entrance by the Time \u0026amp; Life Building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca congratulated his instincts. And his luck. But it occurred to him that Sinclair was moving pretty quick for a guy who was supposedly dosed to the eyeballs on antidepressants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo time to wonder about that now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sprang forward to follow but a horn blared him back. The light was against him and traffic was moving just fast enough to make crossing impossible. Cursing, he edged to the corner. As soon as the light changed Luca lunged forward, damn near knocking down a few slow movers on his way to the subway. He flew down the steps and raced along the longest, fanciest goddamn subway ramp he\u0027d ever seen - marble tile, brass trim, all part of the Rockefeller Center complex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached the token booth, Sinclair was nowhere in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUptown or down?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw theALL TRAINS sign and ducked under the turnstile - no time for a token - and followed the sound of a train pulling in. He reached the platform just in time to see the doors of an F train pincer closed behind Sinclair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca pelted after the train as it began to move, intending to grab a handle and jump onto the landing between the cars, but it picked up speed too quickly and he was left standing on the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lighted sign on the rear car said its last stop was 179th Street in Jamaica. That meant Sinclair could be going across town or to the far side of Queens, or anywhere between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a roar and kicked the nearest tiled pillar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, don\u0027t worry, buddy,\" said a shabby guy a few feet away. \"There\u0027ll be another along soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca wanted to kill him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-66.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
