It was as if Georgia’s gut-wrenching scream had awakened something inside her that knew something was coming, something that she dreaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt eleven o’clock, she was still staring at the canvas. She didn’t have anything really strong to help her sleep, but she decided on an over-the-counter aid. In another half an hour, she was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might have been the pill. She slept, but she tossed and turned and awakened throughout the night. And she dreamed that Georgia was standing in front of her, giant tears dripping down her cheeks. “I told you, I told you there were monsters!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia’s image disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dreamed of giant shadow figures rising over her tent and of seaweed monsters rising out of the ocean, growing and growing and devouring ships, boats and people, and reaching up to the sky to snatch planes right from the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe awoke feeling better, laughing at herself for the absurdity of her dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t believe in seaweed monsters—sea snakes, yes, sharks and other demons of the real world, but seaweed monsters, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she had nightmares, they were usually more logic-based—being chased in the darkness by a human killer, finding out she was in a dark house alone with a knife-wielding madman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been Georgia. Georgia and that terrifying scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, stretched and rose. Taking off the long T-shirt nightgown she’d worn, she put on a bathing suit, ready to hit the beach. There were showers in the heads on both boats the crew had been using, the Seven Seas and the Jalapeño. Of course, one boat wouldn’t be back until Carlos returned. It was a bright and beautiful morning, and she felt that a good dousing in the surf would be refreshing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped out of her tent. The morning sun was shining, but the air retained a note of the night’s pleasant coolness. The sea stretched out before her, azure as it could only be in the Bahamas. Jay and Zoe were already up, and one of them had put the coffeepot to brew on the camp stove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning!” Jay called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning!” she returned. “How long till coffee?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey! As fast as it brews!” Jay told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoe giggled. “What? Did you think this film had a budget for a cook?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVanessa walked on out to the water. It was delightful; warm, but not too warm. So clear she could easily see the bottom, even when she had gone out about twenty-five feet from shore and the depth was around ten feet. The current of the Gulf Stream was sweeping the water around to the north; she decided to fight it and swim south, then let it bring her on back offshore from the campsite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swam a hard crawl, relaxed with a backstroke, worked on her butterfly and went back to doing the crawl, and then decided that she had gone far enough. She had angled herself in toward shore, so she paused a minute, standing, smoothing back her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then that she looked toward the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have screamed, but the sound froze in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood paralyzed, suddenly freezing as if she were a cube of ice in the balmy water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bones…the bodies…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia’s terrified words of the night before seemed to echo and bounce in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she did scream, loud and long. And she found sense and logic, amazingly, and started shouting for the others to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bones…the bodies…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were there. There was no sign of the boat, but Georgia Dare and Travis Glenn were there—in the sand. Their heads, eyes glaring open, were posed next to one another, staring toward the sea. Inches away from each, arms stretched out of the sand as well—just as props had done in the filming. It was as if they desperately reached out for help as the earth sucked them down, leaving only those pathetic heads, features frozen in silent screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay had reached the scene. He was shaking and staring, in shock and denial. He shouted. “Travis, what is this, damn it! Georgia—no! No, no, no! Where is Carlos? What kind of a stunt is this?” Jerking like a mechanical figure, Jay went to touch the actor’s head, as if he could wake him up or snap him out of whatever game he was playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head rolled through the sand. The body wasn’t attached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay himself began to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrozen still, shaking from a sudden cold that threatened never to leave her, Vanessa remained just offshore. She didn’t move until Lew had gotten the authorities, until a kindly Bahamian official came and wrapped a towel around her shoulders, and led her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2 years later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKey West\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore him, frond coral waved in a slow and majestic dance, and a small ray emerged from the sand by the reef, weaving in a swift escape, aware that a large presence, possibly predatory, was near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean O’Hara shot back up to the surface, pleased with his quick inspection of Pirate Cut, a shallow reef where divers and snorkelers alike came to enjoy the simple beauty of nature. It was throughout history a place where many a ship had met her doom, crushed by the merciless winds of a storm. Now only scattered remnants of that history remained; salvage divers of old had done their work along with the sea, salt and the constant shift of sands and tides and weather that remained just as turbulent through the centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was still, he decided, a great place to film.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t opted for scuba gear that day—it had been just a quick trip, thirty minutes out and thirty back in, early morning, just to report to his partner, David Beckett, so they could talk about their ever-changing script and their plans for their documentary film.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Sean was an expert diver, he seldom went diving alone. Good friends—some of the best and most experienced divers in the world—had died needlessly by diving alone. But a free dive on a calm day hadn’t seemed much of a risk, and he was pleased that he had taken off early in the morning. Most of the dive boats headed out by nine, but few of them came to Pirate Cut as a first dive, and it wouldn’t get busy until later in the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd out in the boat, he wasn’t exactly alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBartholomew was with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing up the dive ladder at the rear of his boat, Conch Fritter, he tossed his flippers up and hauled himself on board. His cell phone sat on his towel, and the message light was blinking. Caller ID showed him that he’d been called from O’Hara’s, his uncle’s bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought about answering it, but refrained.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean turned at the sound of the voice. Bartholomew was seated at the helm of the dive boat, feet in buckle shoes up on the wheel, a National Geographic magazine in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBartholomew was getting damned good at holding things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for refraining. And tell me again, why the hell are you with me? You hate the water,” Sean said, irritated. He pushed buttons on his phone to receive his messages, staring at Bartholomew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Love boats, though,” Bartholomew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean groaned inwardly. It was amazing—once he hadn’t believed in Bartholomew. Actually, he’d thought the ghost might have been one of his sister Katie’s imaginary friends. He realized he either had to accept that she was crazy or that there was a ghost. At that time, Sean couldn’t see or hear Bartholomew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that had been a while ago now. While solving the Effigy Murders—as the press wound up calling them—he’d ended up with his head in a bandage and stitches in his scalp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the day the damned stitches had come out that he’d first seen the ghost—as clearly as if he had physical substance—sitting in a chair next to the hospital bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean listened to his messages. The first, from David Beckett, asking him what time he wanted to go out. Sean grinned. David was in love—and sleeping late. Sean was glad, since it seemed that his old friend was in love with his sister, Katie, and she was in love with him. They’d both seen some tough times, and Sean was happy for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next message was from his uncle just asking him to call back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did so. Still, he didn’t learn much. His uncle just wanted him to come to the bar. Sean told him it would take him about forty-five minutes, and Jamie said that was fine, just to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what’s up?” Bartholomew asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Going to the bar, that’s all,” Sean said. He was curious. Jamie wasn’t usually secretive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you keep a hand on the helm? Bring her straight in?” Sean asked Bartholomew as he brought up the anchor. Securing it, he added, “Jeez, am I crazy asking you that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBartholomew looked at him with tremendous indignation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really! That was absolutely—churlish of you! If there’s one thing I know, it’s a lazy man’s boat like this!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean grinned. “I’ll be in the head in the shower for about fifteen minutes. That’s all you need to manage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’ll be great if we pass the Coast Guard or a tour boat!” Bartholomew cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean ignored him. He just wanted to rinse off the sea salt—his uncle had him curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe showered, dried and dressed in the head and cabin well within his fifteen minutes. In another twenty, he was tying up at the pier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval Street was quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he walked from the docks to O’Hara’s, Sean mused with a certain wry humor that Key West was, beyond a doubt, a place for night owls. He was accustomed enough to working at night—or even partying at night—but he was actually more fond of the morning hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think Jamie wants?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean heard the question again—for what seemed like the tenth time now—and groaned inwardly without turning to look at the speaker. Imagine, once he had wanted to see the damned ghost!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, he could see Bartholomew way too clearly now, though when he had first come home to Key West—hearing that David Beckett was in town and worried for his sister’s safety—he had come with his longtime fear for Katie’s mind. She had always seemed to sense or see things. But that had been Katie, not him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBartholomew had apparently wanted to be known, though at first he proved his presence by moving things around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Sean had seen him in that damned chair in the hospital room. Now he could see the long-dead privateer as easily as he could see any flesh-and-blood, living person who walked into his life. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-night-bone-island-trilogy-2/page-3.html","bookId":2287,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:01 PM"}
