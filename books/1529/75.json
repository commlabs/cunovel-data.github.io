Could Trithemius have tapped into that language during his meditations?\" He straightened as another thought struck him. \"And consider ancient Hebrew, how its characters are similar to angelic script. Could early written languages have somehow been derived from this, arising out of some inherent genetic memory? In fact, it makes you wonder if this language isn\u0027t the Word of God, mapping out something greater in all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor shifted his light, sweeping it to cover the breadth of the vast chamber. \"But either way, all of this. All this angelic language. What is it telling us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s a genetic blueprint,\" Gray said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But a blueprint to what?\" Seichan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably a turtle,\" Kowalski mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor snorted at the man\u0027s joke, but both Seichan and Gray reacted with surprise, glancing to the man with matching expressions of incredulity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Vigor asked, sensing something important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray stepped closer, dropping his voice. \"I think he may be right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am?\" Kowalski asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray expanded upon his theory of the cavern below. \"The turtle\u0027s shell represents the cave. But what about the turtle itself? According to the story, it represents an incarnation of Vishnu, an angelic being.\" Gray waved to the wall. \"And here is evidence of some strange biological process, some secret knowledge. Beyond merely a viral disease. I think the coding on the walls is some diary of that process. Possibly still incomplete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor studied the wall, the blueprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore they could contemplate it further, a commotion arose from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shifted in a group back to the center. It looked as if the demolition team were close to finishing. Their leader had coiled all his charge wires and cinched them into an electronic detonator so they could blow it all from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverhead, Vigor spotted a woman climbing down the ladder. It was difficult to discern her features through the glare of the sunlit shaft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Gray recognized her, stepping forward. \"Lisa . . . ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarther above, near the lip to the shaft, Nasser appeared, accompanied by a frantic, half-naked woman. She fought forward, as if to throw herself into the pit, but she was restrained by the barrels of four rifles, kept at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor gaped up at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer skin shone out from the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cover the eyes!\" she screamed below, pointing an arm down into the pit. \"Cover the eyes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor could not comprehend what she was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray did. The commander swept from Vigor\u0027s side, dragged up a tarp used by the demolition team, and tossed it over the sculpture\u0027s eyes like a blindfold, cutting the flow of sunlight to the cavern below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp top, the woman collapsed as if the strings suspending her had been cut. She dropped to a slab of the broken altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser frowned back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa stepped from the ladder and joined them. Her gaze remained above, but her words were for them all. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:05 a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, Gray watched the last of Nasser\u0027s men mount the ladder and climb up. Above, a ring of rifles pointed down at their group. The last satchel of demolition equipment vanished over the lip, hauled up on one of the two ropes. The other rope still dangled, taunting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are they leaving us down here?\" Lisa asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray eyed the rigged sandstone face. \"1 think we\u0027ve just become obsolete,\" he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa remained quiet, then mumbled an apology. \"I had no choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d already explained her sudden, unexpected appearance. A desperate act, born out of the necessity for a cure. The attempt had to be risked . . . even if it meant delivering the cure into the hands of the Guild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Monk,\" Lisa said with a choke. \"He gave his life ... for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Gray put an arm around Lisa\u0027s shoulders. He couldn\u0027t even acknowledge that reality. Not yet. \"No. Monk got you all here. And as long as we\u0027re alive, there\u0027s still hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser returned to the edge of the pit. \"We\u0027re just about finished here,\" he announced, not so much gloating as simply stating a matter of fact. With all the cards in his hand, he kept his tone cold and civil. \"Monsignor, you mentioned earlier how the scientific trail and historical trail merged at these ruins. It appears you were most astute. Here we have the two halves of Sigma joined.\" He waved below—then turned to Susan, who still sat in a stupefied slump, head hanging to her chest. \"And it seems the Guild\u0027s efforts have also joined. The survivor from the scientific trail here . . . and the source of the Judas Strain below.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray slipped his arm from Lisa and stepped forward. \"You may still need our help!\" he called up, knowing it was a wasted breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll manage. The Guild has abundant resources to fit these last pieces together. We\u0027ve managed to reach this point, starting with only a few words in an ancient text. A text, I understand, that came into our possession because of your actions, Commander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray\u0027s fist tightened. He should have burned the Dragon Court\u0027s library when he\u0027d had the chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, it was the Guild\u0027s efforts afterward—through the employment of marine archaeologists and satellite imagery—that uncovered one of Marco\u0027s sunken ships off the coast of Sumatra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Gray a moment to realize what Nasser was implying. \"You found one of Polo\u0027s ships?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we were lucky. One of the keel beams, encased in insulating clay, still contained biological activity. But we couldn\u0027t understand its full capacity without an in vitro trial, a real-world scenario.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray felt his blood go cold. If Nasser was telling the truth, the outbreak at Christmas Island hadn\u0027t been a matter of chance exposure. \"You .. . you purposely contaminated Christmas Island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced to Seichan for confirmation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would not meet his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser continued. \"From the study of sea currents and tidal patterns, it required just planting the beam off the coast and observing what happened. In fact, we were monitoring and collecting samples when our patient here stumbled onto the scene. She and her party. The first human subjects. Of course, the currents eventually carried the tide to the island. As planned. A perfect localized and contained scenario.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa mumbled, \"Then with the cruise ship, the Guild saw the opportunity to reap what they\u0027d sown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray sank back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan mumbled behind him. \"Now you know why I had to stop them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray glanced to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she had failed . . . they\u0027d all failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:11 a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan drifted in a haze, as if in a waking dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire danced across her brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince baring herself to the raw sunlight, she had passed beyond an edge. She felt it inside her skull. She was no longer fully herself—or maybe more herself than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had become unmoored as a lifetime of memories rebuilt inside her. Her past swelled up out of recesses long thought lost and inaccessible. They knit together, one day to another, one hour to the next, blending into a seamless whole. Her past came alive again, not just bits and pieces, but the full spread and panorama of it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she could remember it all as a single moment: from the crush of her skull as she was squeezed out her mother\u0027s womb ... to the beat of her heart now. She sensed the traces of air over her naked skin, every current, scribed into memory, indelible, adding to the whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all held in a suspended, shimmering bubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd beyond that thin surface .. . more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she wasn\u0027t ready to venture there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew there were steps still to be taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the fiery eyes closed, the panic inside her subsided to a dull glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFloating between past and present, adding moments with every breath, new words slowly dropped into the pool that was her life, overheard from a step away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... it required just planting the beam off the coast and observing what happened. . . when our patient here stumbled onto the scene. She and her party. The first human subjects. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe single note rang through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her life held in that endless moment between one breath and the next, she was again underwater, weightless. She saw the finger of age-blackened wood protruding from the sand. Her thoughts from then returned, as if she were still in those waters. At the time, she had supposed earthquakes had shaken the keel beam free, or perhaps the recent tsunami had stripped away the sand, exposing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she knew the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beam had been planted there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePurposefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered how excited she had been to tell her husband, who loved diving wrecks. Just the memory of him filled her senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she knew the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy he had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the truth was fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:12 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa leaned against Gray, his arm over her shoulders. She stared up at the rifles. Nasser was saying something, but she didn\u0027t hear, lost in her own guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray suddenly flinched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough she hadn\u0027t moved, she snapped back to the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the rim of the well, Susan\u0027s head slowly lifted, her blond hair parting from a face lost in fury. The guards\u0027 attentions remained focused on Nasser. Past Nasser\u0027s shoulder, Lisa watched the soft glow of Susan\u0027s skin flush fiercer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes burned with an inner fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser must have sensed something and had begun to turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa did not see Susan move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne moment the woman was seated on the crumbled bit of altar—the next she was latched around Nasser, hugging tight to him, cheek to cheek in an intimate embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe screamed—a wail that tore from his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoke curled between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the guards reacted, clubbing Susan from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped loose, head lolling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill screaming, Nasser shoved her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the edge of the pit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan!\" Lisa called up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-75.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
