The shrill ring of the telephone startled him, and he jumped to his feet, thinking that the planes were about to take off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pilot picked up the receiver, said \"Yes\" into it twice and handed it to Bloggs. \"A Mr Godliman for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Percy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fred, somebody on the island just broadcast an S.O.S.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs shook his head to clear the last remains of sleep. \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know. There was just the one signal, not repeated, and they don\u0027t seem to be receiving at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still, there\u0027s not much doubt now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Everything ready up there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All except the weather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloggs hung up and returned to the young pilot who was till reading War and Peace. \"Good news,\" he told him. \"The bastard\u0027s definitely on the island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jolly good show,\" said the pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaber closed the door of the jeep and began walking quite slowly toward the house. He was wearing David\u0027s hacking jacket again. There was mud all over his trousers where he had fallen and his hair was plastered wetly against his skull. He was limping slightly on his right foot. Lucy backed away from the window and ran out of the bedroom and down the stairs. The shotgun was on the floor in the hall where she had dropped it. She picked it up. Suddenly it felt very heavy. She had never actually fired a gun, and she had no idea how to check whether this one was loaded. She could figure it out, given time, but there was no time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath and opened the front door. \"Stop!\" she shouted. Her voice was pitched higher than she had intended, and it sounded shrill and hysterical. Faber smiled pleasantly and kept on walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy pointed the gun at him, holding the barrel with her left hand and the breech with her right. Her finger was on the trigger. \"I\u0027ll kill you!\" she yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly, Lucy,\" he said mildly. \"How could you hurt me after all the things we\u0027ve done together? Haven\u0027t we loved each other, a little?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true. She had told herself she could not fall in love with him, and that was true too; but she had felt something for him, and if it was not love, it was something very like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew about me this afternoon,\" he said, and now he was thirty yards away, \"but it made no difference to you then, did it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was partly true. For a moment she saw in her mind\u0027s eye a vivid picture of herself sitting astride him, holding his sensitive hands to her breasts, and then she realised what he was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucy, we can work it out, we can still have each other-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an ear-splitting crash, and the weapon jumped in her hands, its butt bruising her hip with the recoil. She almost dropped it. She had never imagined that firing a gun would feel like that. She was quite deaf for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shot went high over Faber\u0027s head but all the same he ducked, turned, and ran zigzagging back to the jeep. Lucy was tempted to fire again but she stopped herself just in time realising that if he knew both barrels had been emptied there would be nothing to stop him turning and coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flung open the door of the jeep, jumped in and shot off down the hill. Lucy knew he would be back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut suddenly she felt happy, almost gay. She had won the first round: she had driven him off... But he would be back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she had the upper hand. She was indoors, and she had the gun. And she had time to prepare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrepare. She must be ready for him. Next time he would be more subtle. He would surely try to surprise her somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hoped he would wait until dark, that would give her time... First she had to reload the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went into the kitchen. Tom kept everything in his kitchen- food, coal, tools, stores-and he had a gun like David\u0027s. She knew the two firearms were the same because David had examined Tom\u0027s, then sent away for one exactly like it. The two men had enjoyed long discussions about weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found Tom\u0027s gun and a box of ammunition. She put the two guns and the box on the kitchen table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMachines were simple, she was convinced; it was apprehension not stupidity that made women fumble when faced with a piece of engineering. She fiddled with David\u0027s gun, keeping the barrel pointed away from herself, until it came open at the breech. Then she figured out what she had done to open it, and practiced doing it again a couple of times. It was surprisingly simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loaded both guns. Then, to make sure she had done everything correctly, she pointed Tom\u0027s gun at the kitchen wall and pulled the trigger. There was a shower of plaster, Bob barked like he\u0027d gone mad, and she bruised her hip and deafened herself again. But she was armed. She must remember to pull the triggers gently so as not to jerk the gun and spoil her aim. Men probably got taught that kind of thing in the army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat to do next? She should make it difficult for Henry to get into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of the doors had locks, of course; if a house was burgled on this island, one would know that the culprit lived in the other house. Lucy rummaged in Tom\u0027s tool box and found a shiny, sharp-bladed axe. She stood on the stairs and began to hack away at the bannister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe work made her arms ache, but in five minutes she had six short lengths of stout, seasoned oak. She found a hammer and some nails and fixed the oak bars across the front and back doors, three bars to each door, four nails to each bar. When it was done her wrists were in agony and the hammer felt as heavy as lead, but she was still not finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got another handful of the shiny four-inch nails and went around to every window in the house, nailing them shut. She realised, with a sense of discovery, why men always put nails in their mouths: it was because you needed both hands for the work and if you put them in your pocket they stuck into your skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she had finished it was dark. She left the lights off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could still get into the house, of course, but at least he could not get in quietly... He would have to break something and thereby alert her and then she would be ready with the guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went upstairs, carrying both guns, to check on Jo. He was still asleep, wrapped in his blanket, on Tom\u0027s bed. Lucy struck a match to look at his face. The sleeping pill must have really knocked him out, but he was an average sort of colour, his temperature seemed normal, and he was breathing easily. \"Just stay that way, little boy,\" Lucy whispered. The sudden access of tenderness left her feeling more savage toward Henry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe restlessly patrolled the house, peering through the windows into the darkness, the dog following her everywhere. She took to carrying just one of the guns, leaving the other at the head of the stairs; but she hooked the axe into the belt of her trousers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered the radio, and tapped out her S.O.S. several more times. She had no idea whether anybody was listening, or even whether the radio was working. She knew no more Morse, so she could not broadcast anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to her that Tom probably did not know Morse code. Surely he must have a book somewhere? If only she could tell someone what was happening here... She searched the house, using dozens of matches, feeling terrified every time she lit one within sight of a downstairs window. She found nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, perhaps he did know Morse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, why should he need it? He only had to tell the mainland that there were enemy aircraft approaching, and there was no reason why that information shouldn\u0027t go over the air... what was the phrase David had used?... au clair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went back to the bedroom and looked again at the wireless set. To one side of the main cabinet, hidden from her previous cursory glance, was a microphone. If she could talk to them, they could talk to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of another human voice-a normal, sane, mainland voice -suddenly seemed the most desirable prospect in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the microphone and began to experiment with the switches. Bob growled softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the mike down and reached out her hand toward the dog in the darkness. \"What is it, Bob?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe growled again. She could feel his ears standing stiffly upright. She was terribly afraid; the confidence gained by confronting Henry with the gun, by learning how to reload, by barricading the door and nailing down the windows... all evaporated at one growl from an alert dog. \"Downstairs,\" she whispered. \"Quietly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held his collar and let him lead her down the stairs. In the darkness she felt for the bannister, forgetting she had chopped it up for her barricades, and she almost overbalanced. She regained her equilibrium and sucked at a splinter in her finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog hesitated in the hall, then growled more loudly and tugged her toward the kitchen. She picked him up and held his muzzle shut to silence him. Then she crept through the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked in the direction of the window, but there was nothing in front of her eyes other than the deep blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened. The window creaked at first almost inaudibly, then louder. He was trying to get in. Bob rumbled threateningly, deep in his throat, but seemed to understand the sudden squeeze she gave his muzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night became quieter. Lucy realised the storm was easing, almost imperceptibly. Henry seemed to have given up on the kitchen window. She moved to the living room. She heard the same creak of old wood resisting pressure. Now Henry seemed more determined: there were three muffled bumps, as if he were tapping the window frame with the cushioned heel of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy put the dog down and hefted the shotgun. It might almost have been imagination, but she could just make out the window as a square of grey in the blank darkness. If he got the window open, she would fire immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a much harder bang. Bob lost control and gave a loud bark. She heard a scuffling noise outside. Then came the voice. \"Lucy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was using the voice he used in bed deep, soft, intimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucy, can you hear me? Don\u0027t be afraid. I don\u0027t want to hurt you. Talk to me, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to fight the urge to pull both triggers there and then, just to silence that awful sound and destroy the memories it brought to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucy, darling...\" She thought she heard a muffled sob. \"Lucy, he attacked me. I had to kill him... I killed for my country, you shouldn\u0027t hate me for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat in the world did that mean...? It sounded crazy. Could he be insane and have hidden it for two intimate days? Actually he had seemed saner than most people and yet he had already committed murder... though she had no idea of the circumstances... Stop it... She was softening up, which of course was exactly what he wanted. She had an idea. \"Lucy, just speak to me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice faded as she tiptoed into the kitchen. Bob would surely warn her if Henry did anything more than talk. She fumbled in Tom\u0027s tool box and found a pair of pliers. She went to the kitchen window and with her fingertips located the heads of the three nails she had hammered there. Carefully, as quietly as possible, she drew them out. The job demanded all her strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were out she went back to the living room to listen. \"... don\u0027t cause me trouble and I\u0027ll leave you alone...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs silently as she could she lifted the kitchen window. She crept into the living room, picked up the dog and returned once again to the kitchen. \"... hurt you, last thing in the world...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stroked the dog once or twice and murmured, \"I wouldn\u0027t do this if I didn\u0027t have to, boy.\" Then she pushed him out of the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed it rapidly, found a nail, and hammered it in at a new spot with three sharp blows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped the hammer, picked up the gun, and ran into the front room to stand close to the window, pressing herself up against the wall. \"... give you one last chance!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a scampering sound, from Bob, followed by a terrible, terrifying bark Lucy had never before heard from a sheepdog; then a scuffling sound and the noise of a man falling. She could hear Henry\u0027s breathing, gasping, grunting; then another flurry of Bob\u0027s scampering, a shout of pain, a curse in a foreign language, another terrible bark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noises now became muffled and more distant, then suddenly ended. Lucy waited, pressed against the wall next to the window, straining to hear. She wanted to go and check Jo, wanted to try the radio again, wanted to cough; but she did not dare to move. Bloody visions of what Bob might have done to Henry passed in and out of her mind, and she badly wanted to hear the dog snuffling at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the window... then realised she was looking at the window; she could see, and not just a square patch of faintly lighter grey, but the wooden crosspiece of the frame. It was still night, but only just, and she knew if she looked outside the sky would be faintly diffused with a just-perceptible light instead of being impenetrably black. Dawn would come at any minute, she would be able to see the furniture in the room, and Henry would no longer be able to surprise her in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a crash of breaking glass inches away from her face. She jumped. She felt a small sharp pain in her cheek, touched the spot, and knew that she had been cut by a flying shard. She hefted the shotgun, waiting for Henry to come through the window. Nothing happened. It was not until a minute or two had passed that she wondered what had broken the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe peered at the floor. Among the pieces of broken glass was a large dark shape. She found she could see it better if she looked to one side of it rather than directly at it. When she did, she was able to make out the familiar shape of the dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes, then looked away. She was unable to feel any emotion at all. Her heart had been numbed by all the terror and death that had gone before: first David, then Tom, then the endless screaming tension of the all-night siege...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll she felt was hunger. All day yesterday she had been too nervous to eat, which meant it was some thirty-six hours since her last meal. Now, incongruously, ridiculously, she found herself longing for a cheese sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething else was coming through the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw it out of the corner of her eye, then turned her head to look directly at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Henry\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at it, mesmerised: a long-fingered hand, without rings, white under the dirt, with cared-for nails and a bandaid around the tip of the index finger; a hand that had touched her intimately, had played her body like an instrument, had thrust a knife into the heart of an old shepherd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand broke away a piece of glass, then another, enlarging the hole in the pane. Then it reached right through, up to the elbow, and fumbled along the windowsill searching for a catch to unfasten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to be utterly silent, with painful slowness, Lucy shifted the gun to her left hand, and with her right took the axe from her belt, lifted it high above her head, and brought it down with all her might on Henry\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have sensed it, or heard the rush of wind, or seen a blur of ghostly movement behind the window, because he moved abruptly a split-second before the blow landed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe axe thudded into the wood of the windowsill, sticking there. For a fraction of an instant Lucy thought she had missed; then, from outside, came a scream of pain, and she saw beside the axe blade, lying on the varnished wood like caterpillars, two severed fingers. She heard the sound of feet running. She threw up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exhaustion hit her then, closely followed by a rush of self-pity. She had suffered enough, surely to God, had she not? There were policemen and soldiers in the world to deal with situations like this. Nobody could expect an ordinary housewife and mother to hold off a murderer indefinitely. Who could blame her if she gave up now? Who could honestly say they would have done better, lasted longer, stayed more resourceful, for another minute?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was finished. They would have to take over: the outside world, the policemen and soldiers, whoever was at the other end of that radio link. She could do no more...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tore her eyes away from the grotesque objects on the windowsill and went wearily up the stairs. She picked up the second gun and took both weapons into the bedroom with her. Jo was still asleep, thank God. He had hardly moved all night, blessedly unaware of the apocalypse going on around him. She could tell, somehow, that he was not sleeping so deeply now, something about the look on his face and the way he breathed let her know that he would wake soon and want his breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe longed for that old routine now: getting up in the morning, making breakfast, dressing Jo, doing simple, tedious, safe household chores like washing and cleaning and cutting herbs from the garden and making pots of tea... It seemed incredible that she had been so dissatisfied with David\u0027s lovelessness, the long boring evenings, the endless bleak landscape of turf and heather and rain...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would never come back, that life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had wanted cities, music, people, ideas. Now the desire for those things had left her, and she could not understand how she had ever wanted them. Peace was all a human being ought to ask for, it seemed to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat in front of the radio and studied its switches and dials. She would do this one thing, then she would rest. She made a tremendous effort and forced herself to think analytically for a little longer. There were not so many possible combinations of switch and dial. She found a knob with two settings, turned it, and tapped the Morse key. There was no sound. Perhaps that meant the microphone was now in circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled it to her and spoke into it. \"Hello, hello, is there anybody there? Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a switch that had \"Transmit\" above it and \"Receive\" below. It was turned to \"Transmit.\" If the world was to talk back to her, obviously she had to throw the switch to \"Receive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said: \"Hello, is anybody listening?\" and threw the switch to \"Receive.\" Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen: \"Come in, Storm Island, receiving you loud and clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a man\u0027s voice. He sounded young and strong, capable and reassuring, and alive and normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in, Storm Island, we\u0027ve been trying to raise you all night... where the devil have you been?\" Lucy switched to \u0027Transmit\u0027, tried to speak, and burst into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercival Godliman had a headache from too many cigarettes and too little sleep. He had taken a little whisky to help him through the long, worried night in his office, and that had been a mistake. Everything oppressed him: the weather, his office, his job, the war. For the first time since he had got into this business he found himself longing for dusty libraries, illegible manuscripts and mediaeval Latin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Terry walked in with two cups of tea on a tray. \"Nobody around here sleeps,\" he said cheerfully. He sat down. \"Ship\u0027s biscuit?\" He offered Godliman a plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodliman refused the biscuit and drank the tea. It gave him a temporary lift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just had a call from the great man,\" Terry said. \"He\u0027s keeping the night vigil with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t imagine why,\" Godliman said sourly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Godliman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have the Royal Observer Corps in Aberdeen for you, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new voice came on, the voice of a young man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Royal Observer Corps, Aberdeen, here, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that Mr Godliman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Dear God, these military types took their time. \"We\u0027ve raised Storm Island at last, sir... it\u0027s not our regular observer.

Hold on.\" There was a pause punctuated by several clicks and a hum. Then Godliman heard the sound of a woman weeping. He said, \"Hello, can you hear me?\" The weeping went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man came back on the line to say, \"She won\u0027t be able to hear you until she switches to \u0027Receive,\u0027 sir ah, she\u0027s done it.

When I\u0027ve finished speaking I\u0027ll say \u0027Over,\u0027 then you switch to \u0027Transmit\u0027 to speak to me and you say \u0027Over\u0027 when you have finished. Do you understand? Over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman\u0027s voice came on. \"Oh, thank God for somebody sane, yes, I understand.

I\u0027ve nailed the windows shut and fired at him with a shotgun, and barred the door and set the dog on him but he killed the dog and I hit him with an axe when he tried to get in through the window and I can\u0027t do it anymore so please come for God\u0027s sake.

Now, there\u0027s something I want you to do, and I can\u0027t tell you why you must do it because of the people who may be listening to us, but I can tell you that it is absolutely essential...
