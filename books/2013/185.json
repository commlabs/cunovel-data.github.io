Massive shoulders behind the neck, long heavily muscled arms with huge curved blades of iron strapped where hands should have been. Leaning far forward as it ran towards them on enormous hind legs, the huge tail thrust straight back for balance, the beast was suddenly in their midst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorses screamed. Brohl found himself to the demon’s right, almost within reach of those scything sword blades, and he stared in horror as that viper’s head snapped forward, jaws closing on the neck of a horse, closing, crunching, then tearing loose, blood spraying, its mouth still filled with meat and bone, the horse’s spine half ripping loose from the horrid gap left in the wake of those savage jaws. A blade cut in half the warlock astride that mount. The other sword slashed down, chopping through another warlock’s thigh, the saddle, then deep into the horse’s shoulder, smashing scapula, then ribs. The beast collapsed beneath the blow, as the rider-the severed stump of his leg gushing blood-pitched over, balanced for a moment on the one stirrup, then sprawled to land on the ground, even as another horse’s stamping hoof descended onto his upturned face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Overseer’s horse seemed to collide with something, snapping both front legs. The animal’s plunging fall threw Brohl over its head. He struck, rolled, the scimitar’s blade biting into his left leg, and came to a stop facing his thrashing mount. The demon’s tail had swept into and through their path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw it wheel for a return attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA foaming wave of sorcery rose into its path, lifting, climbing with power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon vanished from Brohl’s view behind that churning wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun’s light suddenly blotted-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– the demon in the air, arcing over the crest of the K’risnan’s magic, then down, the talons of its hind feet outstretched. One closing on another warlock, pushing the head down at an impossible angle into the cup between the man’s shoulders as the demon’s weight descended-the horse crumpling beneath that overwhelming force, legs snapping like twigs. The other raking towards the K’risnan, a glancing blow that flung him from the back of his bolting horse, the claws catching the horse’s rump before it could lunge out of reach, the talons sinking deep, then tearing free a mass of meat to reveal-in a gory flash-the bones of its hips and upper legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horse crashed down in a twisting fall that cracked ribs, less than three strides away from where Brohl was lying. He saw the whites of the beast’s eyes-shock and terror, death’s own spectre-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Overseer sought to rise, but something was wrong with his left leg-drained of all strength, strangely heavy, sodden in the tangled grass. He looked down. Red from the hip down-his own scimitar had opened a deep, welling gash at an angle over his thigh, the cut ending just above the knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA killing wound-blood pouring out-Brohl Handar fell back, staring up at the sky, disbelieving. I have killed myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the thump of the demon’s feet, swift, moving away-then a deeper sound, the rush of warriors, closing now around him, weapons drawn. Heads turned, faces stretched as words were shouted-he could not understand them, the sounds fading, retreating-a figure crawling to his side, hooded, blood dripping from its nose-the only part of the face that was visible-a gnarled hand reaching for him-and Brohl Handar closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtri-Preda Bivatt sawed the reins of her horse as she came between two units of her reserve medium infantry, Artisan on her right, Harridict on her left, and beyond them, where another Artisan unit was positioned, there was the commotion of fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw a reptilian monstrosity plunging into their ranks-soldiers seeming to melt from its path, others lifting into the air on both sides, in welters of blood, as the beast’s taloned hands slashed right and left. Dark-hued, perfectly balanced on two massive hind legs, the demon tore a path straight to the heart of the packed square-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching out, both hands closing on a single figure, a woman, a mage-plucking her flailing into the air, then dismembering her as would a child a straw doll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond, she could see, the southernmost unit, seven hundred and fifty medium infantry of the Merchants’ Battalion, were a milling mass strewn with dead and dying soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sorcery!’ she screamed, wheeling towards the Artisan unit on her right-seeking out the mage in its midst-motion, someone pushing through the ranks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDust clouds caught her eye-the camp-the Edur legion was nowhere in sight-they had rushed to its defence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst more of these demons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature barrelled free of the Artisan soldiers south of the now-retreating Harridict unit, where a second sorceror stumbled into view, running towards the other mage. She could see his mouth moving as he wove magic, adding his power to that of the first. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-185.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
