{"id":89590,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d learned to follow a blood trail before I grew breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot from my father. No. He disappeared right about the time I uttered the word Da-da. I should have kept my mouth shut. But that was nothing new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother was, make that is, a true girlie-girl. She never knew what to make of a daughter who preferred to play with boys, shoot guns, and get dirty. She still doesn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a wild child. Not her fault, though she blames herself. I don\u0027t think I turned out too bad. I\u0027m a cop, not a delinquent. That has to be good for something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept my mother\u0027s approval. I gave up on that a long time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t hear much from her these days. If she couldn\u0027t have the perfect daughter, she\u0027d hoped for perfect grandchildren -\u0026nbsp; as if she\u0027d get them from me. Marriage and family aren\u0027t high on my list of priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, wait -\u0026nbsp; they aren\u0027t on the list at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no doubt Miss Larson\u0027s wolf was long gone; still I couldn\u0027t just give up without trying. It wasn\u0027t in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing a blood trail through the dark was a neat trick, one I\u0027d picked up from my best friend in the sixth grade, Craig Simmons, who\u0027d learned it from his best friend in the fifth grade, George Standwater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Indian kids didn\u0027t mix much with the white kids, and vice versa, despite any smiley-faced propaganda to the contrary. Once in a while a few became friends, but it never lasted long. The adults, on both sides, took care of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll never forget how awful Craig felt when his parents told him he couldn\u0027t see George anymore. Kind of how I felt, I\u0027m sure, when Craig decided he\u0027d rather play with girls in the Biblical sense and he no longer had any need for a friend-girl like Jessie McQuade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a near audible whoosh, the forest closed in around me, leaving the civilized world of cars, electric lights, and roads behind. Beneath the canopy of the evergreens and birch trees I could barely see the stars. That\u0027s how a lot of losers got lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d learned in my years on the force that quite a few more people disappeared than the public ever heard about. Miniwa was no exception. Folks walked into the woods on a regular basis and never came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot me. I had my flashlight, my gun, and my compass. I could stay out here for days and find my way home, too, even without the antiquated walkie-talkie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe machine chose that moment to crackle, so I shut if off. All I needed was to get close to the wolf and have Zee cuss a blue streak through the receiver. I\u0027d have one chance, if that, and I wasn\u0027t going to blow it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished momentarily for a rifle. With a pistol I\u0027d have to get awfully close, but we didn\u0027t keep long-range firearms in the squad cars. They were all locked up safe and tight back at the station -\u0026nbsp; where they were of no use to me at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood trail veered right, then left, then right again. Nearing three-quarter size, the moon was blaring bright. The kind of night most animals kept to the forest, spooked into hiding by the shiny disc in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for the wolves. They seemed to like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, I liked it, too. Because the silver sheen bounced off a glistening splotch on the ground here, a leaf there. That the blood was still wet gave me hope my quarry might not be too far ahead. The wolf could even be dead, which would solve a whole lot of problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I kept my gun handy. I knew better than to follow a wounded wild animal without protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breeze ruffled the short length of my hair and I paused, lifted my face to the night, then cursed. I was upwind. If the wolf wasn\u0027t dead, he knew I was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA howl split the night, rising on the breeze, sifting through the darkness, and fleeing toward the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the soulful sound of a lonely animal searching for a mate, but the furious, aggressive wail of a dominant male, which caused the back of my neck to tingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew I was coming, and he was ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy adrenaline kicked in. I wanted to move faster. Get there. Fight, not flee. Finish this. But I had to follow the blood, and that hadn\u0027t gotten any easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, suddenly, the trail was gone. I backtracked. Located the blood again. Moved forward, found nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wolf seemed to have disappeared into thin air. Uneasy, I glanced up at the swaying silhouettes of the trees. A laugh escaped, the sound more nervous than amused. What kind of wolf could climb a tree? Not one that I wanted to meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA movement ahead had me scurrying forward, damn the blood trail. I burst through the brash and into a clearing, nearly stumbled, and fell at the sight of a shiny log cabin that hadn\u0027t been there a few weeks ago. Had it sprouted from the dirt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy curiosity about the new house vanished when my gaze lit on a swaying, shivering bush at the far side of the clearing. The windows of the cabin were dark. If I was lucky, the occupants were asleep or, even better, not in residence. I didn\u0027t want to scare anyone with gunshots outside their new home at 4:00 a.m., but I wasn\u0027t going to let my quarry get away, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGun drawn, I advanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single, glistening drop of blood on a leaf made me cock my pistol. The bush stilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so tense my body ached with it. I couldn\u0027t just shoot without knowing what was there. But what if the wolf leaped out, jaws slashing before I could fire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecisions, decisions. I hated them. Give me a nice, sure, clean shot any day. Black-and-white. Right and wrong. Good versus evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" I shouted, hoping the wolf would run the other way and I could blast him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo such luck. The bush began to shake again, and a shadow lifted, lengthened, grew broader, and took the shape of a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA very handsome, well-proportioned, naked man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the -\u0026nbsp; ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom far to the north came the cry of a wolf, silencing my question, reminding me I needed to move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the naked man -\u0026nbsp; which wasn\u0027t easy, he was quite spectacular and I hadn\u0027t seen one in a long, long time -\u0026nbsp; I searched the ground and the trees for the blood trail. However, it was well and truly gone this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it!\" I holstered my weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was deep, almost soothing, flowing like water over smooth stones. He was taller than me by a good five inches, which made him six-three in bare feet. The moon shone silver across his golden skin, which appeared to be the same hue all over. He obviously had no qualms about going bare-assed beneath the sun as well as the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me calmly, as if he didn\u0027t know, or maybe just didn\u0027t care, that he\u0027d forgotten his clothes when he\u0027d stepped outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, if he could be nonchalant, so could I. \"Did a wolf run through here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed his arms over his chest. His biceps flexed; so did the muscles in his stomach. I couldn\u0027t help myself. I stared. Ridges and dips in all the right places. He\u0027d been working out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seen enough?\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith no small amount of difficulty, I raised my gaze to his face. I refused to be embarrassed. He was the one standing naked in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Is there more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth flashed against the darker shade of his face. His eyes were black, his hair, too, and nearly as short as my own. A golden feather swung from one ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting. Most Native American jewelry was silver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he were white, he\u0027d take a lot of heat for that earring in a place like Miniwa. This might be a new millennium, but in small Midwestern towns earrings were for faggots, just as tattoos were for motorcycle gangs. Unless you were an Indian; then folks just ignored you. However, I doubted a man who looked like he did was ignored by the entire population.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re after a wolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped from behind the bush, giving me a much clearer view of a whole lot more. My cheeks heated. For all my bravado and smart-mouthed comments, I\u0027d never had much use for men beyond friendship. Probably because they\u0027d never had much use for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, a girl has needs, or so I discovered beneath the shiny, silver moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanna put on some clothes before we chat?\" I aimed for a bored, woman-of-the-world tone. I got a breathless, sexy rasp. To cover my embarrassment I snapped, \"What are you doing out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not out anywhere. This is my place, my land. And I don\u0027t have to explain anything. You\u0027re trespassing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot pursuit. Exigent circumstances,\" I mumbled. \"Just seems odd to be out in the dark in the buff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why have a cabin in the woods if you can\u0027t walk around naked whenever the urge strikes you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I don\u0027t know. Maybe poison ivy in all the wrong places?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought he laughed, but when I glanced at him, he\u0027d turned away. I lost my train of thought again at the sight of his back. The muscles rippled as he moved. Was it hot out here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re chasing a wolf, alone, through the woods in the middle of the night, Officer... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he was right in front of me. Had I been so entranced with my fantasies that I hadn\u0027t noticed him slip in close? Obviously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slim, dark finger reached out; the white moon of a nail brushed the nameplate perched on my left breast. \" \u0027 McQuade,\u0027\" he read, then lifted his eyes to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to tilt my head back, not a common occurrence for me. I could usually stare guys straight in the eye, and I was rarely this close to them. They were never naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smelled like the forest -\u0026nbsp; green trees, brown earth, and... something wild, something free. I felt as if I were falling into his dark, endless eyes. His cheekbones were sharp, his lips full, his skin perfect. The man was prettier than I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a giant step back. Just because I was in a woodland clearing with a gorgeous, naked Indian man didn\u0027t mean I had to swoon like the heroine of a historical romance novel. I wasn\u0027t the type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing my job,\" I said, as much to answer him as remind myself. \"A wolf bit a woman out on the highway. I need to find the thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flickered in his eyes and was gone so quickly I wasn\u0027t sure if I\u0027d seen anything beyond the shift of the moon through the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt you\u0027ll succeed.\" He turned away again, and this time my gaze caught on a nasty bruise along his hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I -\u0026nbsp; uh -\u0026nbsp; \" I waved my hand vaguely at his ass. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twisted, glanced down, frowned, then raised his eyes to mine. \"I\u0027m not sure. I must have been clumsy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he strolled toward the cabin, I watched him move. Funny, he didn\u0027t appear clumsy at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plucked a pair of cutoffs from the porch and yanked them on without benefit of underwear. Why I found that incredibly erotic, I have no idea. But there it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot bothering with a shirt, either, he returned. I found myself entranced by his chest. Smooth, strong, no hair to mar the perfection, would he taste as good as he smelled?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my eyes to make the image go away. I needed to get laid and fast. When my pulse leaped in response to the thought, my cheeks heated again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown, girl, I admonished my panting libido. You\u0027re in the minors; he\u0027s a major leaguer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I could dream, couldn\u0027t I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... Um. Could you help me pick up the trail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice, Jessie. Why don\u0027t you stutter and drool while you\u0027re at it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, he didn\u0027t seem to notice my red face and awkward tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" He ran his fingers through his short hair, frowned, and shook his head, almost as if the cut was new, unfamiliar. His earring danced in the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blood disappears beyond that bush where you -\u0026nbsp; \" I frowned. \"You\u0027re sure you didn\u0027t see him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave an impatient sigh. \"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then maybe you could help me pick up the trail again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you think that I know how to track a wolf? Just because I\u0027 in Ojibwe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled his eyes. \"Come on, Officer, you aren\u0027t blind and you\u0027ve been looking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been showing. I\u0027m also not stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips twitched. He nearly smiled before he caught himself. \"Even if I knew jack about tracking in the dark, I wouldn\u0027t help you find that wolf. You\u0027ll kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"He bit a woman. She\u0027s going to need rabies shots if I don\u0027t find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnoyance flashed through me. \"You psychic or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-2.html","bookId":2088,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM"}
