They transformed into six beams of light that shot directly toward him. As for Wang Mu, his eyes suddenly gleamed with a bizarre light, and he seemed to go crazy, causing ripples to spread out through the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly raised his right hand, and a murky, flickering light appeared that began to suck in all of his soul and life force. It transformed into an attack... a profound Daoist magic of the Wang Clan that was incredibly difficult to master!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Immobilize!” Wang Mu roared. His fingertip seemed to tear open the starry sky, causing all the ripples to stop in place. A terrifying power appeared which instantly wrapped around Meng Hao, forming invisible bonds that instantly immobilized him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he couldn’t move, it was different than his bodily Hexing. It was as if time had been stopped in place, as if Meng Hao’s body was now suspended in eternity!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene which was playing out left everyone completely amazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before anyone could even react, the six attackers, including Wang Mu, transformed into something like six sharp swords. Their eyes flickered with battle lust, and their energy erupted as they attacked Meng Hao with virtually all of the life force they could muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWang Mu’s aura might have been greatly weakened, but even still he attacked explosively. He lifted his right hand and an illusory finger materialized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wang Patriarch Finger Attack!” Rumbling echoed out as the gigantic, illusory finger seemed to replace the starry sky and descend upon Meng Hao. Brilliant energy surged, causing everything to seem to be on the verge of transforming into ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXie Yixian’s Burning Incense aura seethed, transforming into his own personal kingdom and world. Using the power of his Immortal meridians, he fueled his Burning Incense World, causing the energy from the aura to form his personal kingdom. It transformed into countless images which then crushed down towards Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Hao roared in rage. Flames surged around him as his Immortal meridians erupted with power. His flame dragons merged together, transforming into a gigantic dragon head, which opened its mouth as if to consume all living things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaiyang Zi went all out with everything he had. He spit out mouthfuls of blood, causing nine suns to appear in front of him, superimpose, and then transform into one huge sun that shot forward with deadly force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSong Luodan\u0027s energy rocketed up. Gradually, a blade appeared above his head, the blade of the Song Clan, which was also a Dao. [1. As a quick reminder, \"blade” and “Dao” sound very similar] A Heavenly blade slashed down, like the arrival of a Heavenly Dao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast of all was Yu Xinglong. His body was completely stiff, as he spared no expense to transform himself into an ancient corpse. The aura of reincarnation emanated out, forming an incredible power that manifested in the form of a Corpse Needle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe needle stabbed through the air directly toward Meng Hao’s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Mountain and Sea was completely shaken. Everyone looked on with reeling minds as the scene played out. Earlier, they had been shocked to see Meng Hao’s one punch completely defeat various Chosen, and couldn’t help but look down on the true Immortal Chosen a bit because of that. But now they were shocked to find that any one of these Chosen could single-handedly be blazing suns that could rock everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, the six of them joined forces in an Earth-shaking, Heaven-rocking attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng Hao is going to lose!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, they engulfed Meng Hao. However, it was at this point... that intense booming sounds echoed out from within Meng Hao. They were like thunder and lightning, exploding and rumbling ceaselessly. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShockingly, exactly one hundred such sounds echoed out!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hundred booming sounds represented the power of 100 Immortal meridians unleashing all their power. Instantly, the Wang Clan\u0027s bizarre immobilization technique fell apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it collapsed, Wang Mu coughed up a mouthful of blood. It was as if his entire body had been scraped clean from the inside out. His expression was one of shock; he had never before experienced such an intense backlash from someone of the same generation as himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Meng Hao, all eyes were on him as booming sounds echoed out constantly. The power of one Immortal meridian after another erupted, causing Meng Hao’s energy to skyrocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now it’s my turn,” he said, his eyes flickering with a cold light. Moments ago, the Wang Clan’s magical technique had left him shaken. Now, his eyes brimmed with coldness as his body flickered, suddenly reappearing directly in front of Xie Yixian. As usual, he clenched his right hand and began to punch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first punch caused blood to spray out of Xie Yixian’s mouth. His Burning Incense World, his kingdom, collapsed into pieces, and he was sent tumbling backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second punch landed in front of Chen Hao. The flames which surrounded him suddenly encountered a fierce wind, and were extinguished. The shocking flame dragon head exploded, causing Chen Hao to let out a roar of defiance. However, he couldn’t stop the blood from spraying out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third punch descended towards Wang Mu. Meng Hao actually had fairly complex feelings regarding the Wang Clan. However, he also feared their divine ability. When his punch made contact with the finger attack, a huge boom rang out. The finger attack collapsed, and Wang Mu spit up a mouthful of blood and passed directly into unconsciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour punches, five punches, six punches!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSong Luodan’s body was covered in a haze of blood. Taiyang Zi’s chest caved in, and he appeared to be on the verge of death. Yu Xinglong from the Paleo-Immortal Mausoleum saw his needle collapse into nothing more than bits of ash. His face was pale as Meng Hao\u0027s punch very nearly caused him to explode. In the end, he passed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao didn\u0027t kill any of them. He had no enmity with them, and knew that as true Immortal Chosen, they were fighting this battle with him because of their own Daos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix punches. Six enemies completely swept aside. Meng Hao hovered there in the starry sky, hair whipping about. More booms could be heard coming from inside of him, until a total of 123 rang out, indicating that Meng Hao had unleashed the full power of his Immortal meridians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too powerful!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Immortal Realm Paragon!” Cries of astonishment could be heard throughout the Ninth Mountain and Sea. Meng Hao\u0027s current battle prowess left everyone completely shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless spectators were watching this battle in the starry sky closely. It was a battle of Chosen, a battle of true Immortals that would determine the future standing of the various sects and clans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt some point during the action, a strangely ordinary ship appeared in the boundless starry sky, completely undetectable even to the Ji Clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn older man sat on the ship, next to whom was a young man, who was frowning as he looked out at an illusory screen which depicted Meng Hao battling the various Chosen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are they fighting him?” the young man asked. “They have to know that they’re not his match. What’s the point? Don’t these so-called Chosen of the Ninth Mountain and Sea completely overestimate their ability? If it were me, I would definitely prepare secretly to rise to prominence later! Looks like these people from the Ninth Mountain and Sea amount to virtually nothing. They’re all idiots. Fools!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s because... they are Chosen,” replied the older man softly. “They can accept defeat, and they can accept that they do not measure up to others. However, if they lack even the courage to fight, the determination to draw their swords, then they will forever… be unable to lift a finger against this boy named Fang Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are in the Immortal Realm now, and despite the huge gap, if they refuse to fight now... then in the future, that gap will only widen. Then... they would forever lack the courage to fight.” He lifted his glass of alcohol and took a sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ll even team up to fight him?” the young man said with a cold laugh. “Whatever would it prove if they won that way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It would prove that he could be beaten by peers from the same generation,” was the calm reply. “Lin’er, that is the difference between you and them. You cannot underestimate these people from the Nine Mountains and Seas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man laughed coldly. “Ah, who cares? When it comes to them, we already--” He was about to continue when the older man glared at him sternly. The young man’s heart thumped, and he swallowed his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one detected the existence of the ship, as if they actually existed in a different time and space. They floated slowly through the starry sky, drifting off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battle was being watched by countless spectators, which was especially true considering... that what should have been a battle to showcase everyone’s glory ended up being a whole group of people joining forces to attack Meng Hao, which made things even more interesting to the onlookers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, not all Chosen teamed up to attack Meng Hao. Fang Wei hovered motionless in midair, his eyes closed as he completely ignored what was happening in the starry sky. However, he was slowly building his energy, and his aura continued to grow more intense thanks to the amalgamation of his various Fang Clan secret magics. Furthermore, he had two Nirvana Fruits inside of him, which began to pulse as if they were beating hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was waiting for his energy to reach its peak, whereupon he would battle it out with Meng Hao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to him, Fan Dong’er was also building up her energy. Then there was Zhao Yifan, Li Ling’er, as well as two other people.... One was from the Ji Clan, someone nobody else noticed because of the fact that the Ji Clan had kept the Door of Immortality concealed when it came to this person. The only thing that people knew was that she had entered true Immortality; no one had any idea of how many Immortal meridians she had. It was Ji Yin!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not the Dao Child of the Ji Clan. However, she was the number one figure underneath the Dao Child!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to Ji Yin, there was Fan Dong’er of the Nine Seas God World, who had by this point been forgotten by the majority of people. Also from the Three Great Daoist Societies were Zhao Yifan and Zhou Xin from the Sublime Flow Sword Grotto. Of course, there was also the Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no one who knew of what blazing sun might emerge from the Rite, nor had anyone even heard any whispers of who it might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost in the same moment that Taiyang Zi and the other five Chosen were defeated, rumbling sounds filled the starry sky as more teleportation portals glimmered into existence. Numerous true Immortal Chosen appeared from the Three Churches and Six Sects, and also from the Holy Lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of them were people Meng Hao recognized, others were strangers. There were eleven or twelve of them, and they instantly caused explosive ripples to spread out. Each one of these people were blazing suns from their respective sects, and it was without hesitation that they joined forces to attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey knew that they couldn\u0027t possibly defeat Meng Hao by relying on their own strength. However, they needed this battle to result in a victory!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, they teamed up. If they could win, that would be enough to purge the Devils in their hearts, and would prove to them that Meng Hao... could be defeated in battle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassive roaring echoed out as the dozen cultivators’ Immortal meridians erupted. This was the era of true Immortals, so anyone who had risen to true Immortality, who had opened at least 90 Immortal meridians, and who had secret arts, unleashed their Immortal souls and powered up. They transformed into a dozen beams of prismatic light that shot directly toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of them unleashed different divine abilities as they attacked Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao\u0027s eyes shone with the desire to do battle. He looked around at his thirteen opponents, and his mouth twisted into a smile. A very cold smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis 123 Immortal meridians were in full rotation. As his enemies closed in, Meng Hao charged forward like an explosive dragon. Massive rumbling echoed out as a completely domineering aura emanated out from him. He clenched his hand into a fist and punched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slashed through everything like a sharp knife through bamboo. Everywhere he went, divine abilities collapsed, secret magics were destroyed, blood sprayed about, and everything shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoundless ripples spread out through the starry sky like waves over water. Roars of defiance echoed out as Meng Hao simultaneously fought all of these true Immortal Chosen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe starry sky trembled and the Heavens dimmed. One punch. Another punch. ANOTHER!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumerous enemies were sent tumbling away, blood spraying from their mouths. Bright beams of light were shattered, divine abilities were completely destroyed....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the audience, jaws dropped and eyes widened. Meng Hao was like a celestial warrior, and the image of him fighting was branded indefinitely into the minds of everyone in the current generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, when all of the opponents were left ashen-faced, and when the final Chosen was sent flying backward in defeat, Meng Hao raised his hand and waved it toward the Heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Writ of Karma!” Numerous Karma threads suddenly emerged from his body, as well as from the bodies of all of the Chosen, including the six he had fought earlier. In total, eighteen streams of Karma could be seen coming from the true Immortal Chosen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of Meng Hao\u0027s domineering cultivation base and Daoist magic, he was able to force the formation of Karma. It transformed into numerous promissory notes, which materialized in thin air and then floated down onto Meng Hao’s palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need to write anything, nor any need for anyone to agree to the matter. That was because... they now owed him money!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis Karmic Daoist magic forced ties of destiny!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant that A Writ of Karma appeared, his eighteen opponents coughed up blood, and their eyes went bright red. The feeling of having destined ties and promissory notes forced upon them, and the sense that their Karma would be disturbed if they failed to pay back that debt, caused all of the Chosen to look over at Meng Hao, eyes bloodshot and seething with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng Hao, how dare you!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, you’re too shameless!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe true Immortal Chosen all roared with fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shameless, huh?” he replied, his expression the same as ever, although slightly bashful. He cleared this throat continued on with an air of self-righteousness. “Well... you people wanted to fight me to solidify your Dao hearts; you were even willing to gang up on me. If you defeated me, your Dao hearts would be freed of their obstruction. In that case, I think I need to collect some interest from you. If you think about it that way, I’m sure you’ll agree....” It was just as he had said to Fang Xiufeng, that his dream was to get all of the Chosen in the Ninth Mountain and Sea to owe him money. [1. Meng Hao mentioned his ambition to get everyone to owe him money in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-6-chapter-841/\"\u003echapter 841\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat dream... was already becoming a reality. All of a sudden, Meng Hao realized that he had actually set his ambitions a bit too low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should have said that I want all of the Chosen in all the Nine Mountains and Seas to owe me money!” As this grand ambition rose up in his heart, he looked up, and his long hair drifted in the wind. His energy pulsed, and it was as if his desire caused all of the starry sky to tremble. Countless ripples emanated out in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, the Ninth Mountain and Sea had fallen silent. Everyone was speechless as they gazed at Meng Hao. The true Immortal Chosen were in a rage, and yet, couldn’t think of a single thing to say in response.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-986\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-988\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-6-chapter-987","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
