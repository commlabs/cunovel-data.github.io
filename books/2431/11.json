Baley was grateful to them for the care they unfailingly gave him, even though they were only machines, helpless to disobey instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he thought: Why dismiss them with a word machines? They\u0027re good machines in a Universe of sometimes evil people. I have no right to favor the machines vs. people sub-categorization over the good vs. evil one. And Daneel, at least, I cannot think of as a machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard said, \"I must ask again, sir. Do you feel well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley nodded. \"Quite well, Giskard. I am glad to be out here with you two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky was, for the most part, white - off-white, actually. There was a gentle wind and it had felt distinctly cool - until they got into the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said, \"Partner Elijah, I was listening carefully to the conversation between yourself and Dr. Vasilia. I do not wish to comment unfavorably on what Dr. Vasilia has said, but I must tell you that, in my observation, Dr. Fastolfe is a kind and courteous human being. He has never, to my knowledge, been deliberately cruel, nor has he, as nearly as I can judge, sacrificed a human being\u0027s essential welfare to the needs of his curiosity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley looked at Daneel\u0027s face, which gave the impression, somehow, of intent sincerity. He said, \"Could you say anything against Dr. Fastolfe, even if he were, in fact, cruel and thoughtless?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could remain silent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If, by telling a lie, I were to harm a truthful Dr. Vasilia by casting unjustified doubt on her truthfulness, and if, - by remaining silent, I would harm Dr. Fastolfe by lending further color to the true accusations against him, and if the two harms were, to my mind, roughly equal in intensity, then it would be necessary for me to remain silent. Harm through an active deed outweighs, in general, harm through passivity - all things being reasonably equal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Then, even though the First Law states: \u0027A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm,\u0027 the two halves of the law are not equal? A fault of conimission, you say, is greater than one of omission?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The words of the law are merely an approximate description of the constant variations in positronomotive force along the robotic brain paths, Partner Elijah. I do not know enough to describe the matter mathematically, but I know what my tendencies are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they are always to choose not doing over doing, if the harm is roughly equal in both directions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In general. And always to choose truth over nontruth, if the harm is roughly equal in both directions. In general, that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, in this case, since you speak to refute Dr. Vasilia an thus do her harm, you can only do so because the First Law is mitigated sufficiently by the fact that you are telling the truth - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is so, Partner Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet the fact is, you would say what you have said, even though it were a lie - provided Dr. Fastolfe had instructed you, with sufficient intensity, to tell that, lie when necessary and to refuse to admit that you had been so instructed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause and then Daneel said, \"That is so, Partner Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a complicated mess, Daneel - but you still believe that Dr. Fastolfe did not murder Jander Panell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My experience with him is that he is truthful, Partner Elijah, and that he would not do harm to friend Jander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And yet Dr. Fastolfe has himself described a powerful motive for his having committed the deed, while Dr. Vasilia has described a completely different motive, one that is just as powerful and is even more, disgraceful than the first.\" Baley brooded a bit. \"If the public were made aware of either motive, belief in Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s guilt would be universal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley turned suddenly to Giskard. \"How about you, Giskard? You have known Dr. Fastolfe longer than Daneel has. Do you agree that Dr. Fastolfe could not have committed - the deed and could not have destroyed Jander, on the basis of your understanding of Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s character?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley regarded the robot uncertainly. He was less advanced than Daneel. How far could he be trusted as a corroborating witness? Might he not be impelled to follow Daneel in whatever direction Daneel chose to take?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"You knew Dr. Vasilia, too, did you not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew her very well,\" said Giskard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And liked her, I gather?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was in my charge for - many years and the - task did not in any way trouble me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even though she fiddled with your programming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was very skillful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would she lie about her father - about Dr. Fastolfe, that is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard hesitated. \"No, sir. She would not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you are saying that what she says is the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite, sir. What I am saying is that she herself believes she is telling the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why should she believe such evil things about her father to be true if, in actual fact, he is as kind a person as Daneel has just told me he was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard said slowly, \"She has been embittered by various events in her youth, events for which she considers Dr. Fastolfe to have been responsible and for which he may indeed have been unwittingly responsible - to an extent. It seems to me it was not his intention that the events in question should have the consequences they did. However, human beings are not governed by the straightforward laws of robotics. It is therefore diffIcult to judge the complexities of their motivations under most conditions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True enough,\" muttered Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard said, \"Do you think the task of demonstrating Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s innocence to be hopeless?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley\u0027s eyebrows moved toward each other in a frown. \"It may be. As it happens, I see no way out - and if Dr. Vasilia talks, as she has threatened to do - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you ordered her not to talk. You explained that it would be dangerous to herself if she did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley shook his head. \"I was bluffing. I didn\u0027t know what else to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you intend to give up, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Baley said forcefully, \"No! If it were merely Fastolfe, I might. After all, what physical harm would come to him? Roboticide is not even a crime, apparently, merely a civil offense. At worst, he will lose political influence and, perhaps, find himself unable to continue with his scientific labors for a time. I would be sorry to see that happen, but if there\u0027s nothing more I can do, then there\u0027s nothing more I can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if it were just myself, I might give up, too. Failure would damage my reputation, but who can build a brick house without bricks? I would go back to Earth a bit tarnished, I would lead a miserable and unclassified life, but that is the chance that faces every Earthman and woman. Better men than I have had to face that as unjustly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving ended in what was almost a whisper, he suddenly looked up and said in a peevish tone, \"Why are we sitting here parked, Giskard? Are you running the motor for your own amusement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With respect, sir,\" said Giskard, \"you have not told me where to take you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True! I beg your pardon, Giskard. First, take me to the nearest of the Community Personals that Dr. Vasilia made mention of. You two may be immune to such things, but I have a bladder that needs emptying. After that, find someplace nearby where I can get something to eat. I have a stomach that needs filling. And after that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Partner Elijah?\" asked Daneel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To tell you the truth, Daneel, I don\u0027t know. However, after I tend to these purely physical needs, I will think of something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how Baley wished he could believe that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e45\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airfoil did not skim the ground for long. It came to a halt, swaying a bit, and Baley felt the usual odd tightening of his stomach. That small unsteadiness told him he was in a vehicle and it drove away the temporary feeling of being safe within walls and between robots. Through the glass ahead and on either side (and backward, if he craned his neck) was the whiteness of sky and the greenness of foliage, all amounting to Outside - that is, to nothing. He swallowed uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had stopped at a small structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Is this the Community Personal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said, \"It is the nearest of a number on the Institute grounds, Partner Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You found it quickly. Are these structures also included in the map that has been pumped into your memory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is the case; Partner Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this one in use now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may be, Partner Elijah, but three or four may use it simultaneously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there room for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very likely, Partner Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, let me out. I\u0027ll go there and see - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robots did not move. Giskard said, \"Sir, we may not enter with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am aware of that, Giskard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will not be able to guard you properly, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley frowned. The lesser robot would naturally have the more rigid mind and Baley suddenly recognized the danger that he would simply not be allowed out of their sight and, therefore, not allowed to enter the Personal. He put a note of urgency into his voice and turned his attention to Daneel, who might be expected to more nearly understand human needs. \"I can\u0027t help that, Giskard. Daneel, I have no choice in the matter. Let me out of the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard looked at Baley without moving and, for one horrid moment, Baley thought the robot would suggest that he unburden himself in the nearby field in the open, like an animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment passed. Daneel said, \"I think we must allow Partner Elijah to have his way in this respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhereupon Giskard said to Baley, \"If you can wait for a short while, sir, I will approach the structure first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley grimaced. Giskard walked slowly toward the building and then, deliberately, circumnavigated it. Baley might have predicted the fact that, once Giskard disappeared, his own sense of urgency would increase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to distract his own nerve endings by staring around at the prospect. After some study, he became aware of thin wires in the air, here and there - fine, dark hairs against the white sky. He did not see them, to begin with. What he saw first was an oval object sliding along beneath the clouds. He became aware of it as a vehicle and realized that it was not floating but was suspended from a long horizontal wire. He followed that long wire with his eyes, forward and back, noting others of the sort. He then saw another vehicle farther offand yet another still farther off. The farthest of the three was a featureless speck whose nature he understood only because he had seen the nearer ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUndoubtedly, these were cable cars for internal transportation from one part of the Robotics Institute to another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow spread out it all was, thought Baley. How needlessly the Institute consumed space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, in doing so, it did not consume the surface. The structures were sufficiently widely spaced so that the greenery seemed untouched and the plant and animal life continued (Baley imagined) as they might in emptiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolaria, Baley remembered, had been empty. No doubt all the Spacer worlds were empty, since Aurora, the most populous, was so empty, even here in the most built-up region of the planet. For that matter, even Earth - outside the Cities - was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were the Cities and Baley felt a sharp pang of homesickness, which he had to push to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said, \"Ah, friend Giskard has completed his examination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard was back and Baley said tartly, \"Well? Will you be so kind as to grant me permission - \" He stopped. Why expend sarcasm on the impenetrable hide of a robot?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard said, \"It seems quite certain that the Personal is unoccupied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good! Then get out of my way.\" Baley flung open the door of the airfoil and stepped out onto the gravel of a narrow path. He strode rapidly, with Daneel following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached the door of the structure, Daneel wordlessly indicated the contact that would open it. Daneel did not venture to touch the contact himself. Presumably, thought Baley, to have done so without specific instructions would have indicated an intention to enter and even the intention was not permitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley pushed the contact and entered, leaving the two robots behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not until he was inside that it occurred to him that Giskard could not possibly have entered the Personal to see that it was unoccupied, that the robot must have been judging the matter from external appearance - a dubious proceeding at best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Baley realized, with some discomfort, that, for the first time, he was isolated and separated from all protectors - and that the protectors on the other side of the door couldn\u0027t easily enter if he were suddenly in trouble. What, then, if he were, at this moment, not alone? What if some enemy had been alerted by Vasilia, who knew he would be in search of a Personal, and what if that enemy was in hiding right now in the structure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley grew suddenly and uncomfortably aware that (as would not have been the case on Earth) he was totally unarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e46\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be sure, the structure was not large. There were small urinals, side by side, half a dozen of them; small washbasins, side by side, again half a dozen. No showers, no clothes fresheners, no shaving devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were half a dozen stalls, separated by partitions and with small doors to each. Might there not be someone waiting inside one of them -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors did not come down to the ground. Moving softly, he bent and glanced under each door, looking for any sign of legs. He then approached each door, testing it, swinging it open tensely, ready to slam it shut at the least sign of anything untoward and then to dash to the door that led to the Outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the stalls were empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around to make sure there were no other hiding places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could find none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went to the door to the Outside and found no indication of a way of locking it. It occurred to him that there would naturally be no way of locking it. The Personal was clearly for the use of several men at the same time. Others would have to be able to enter at need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he could not very well leave and try another, for the danger would exist at any - and besides, he could delay no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, he found himself unable to decide which of the series of urinals he should use. He could approach and use any of them. So could anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced the choice of one upon himself and, aware of openness all around, was afflicted at once with bashful bladder. He felt the urgency, but had to wait impatiently for the feeling of apprehension at the possible entrance of others to dissipate itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe no longer feared the entrance of enemies, just the entrance of anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he thought: The robots will at least delay anyone approaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, he managed to relax -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quite done, greatly relieved, and about to turn to a washbasin, when he heard a moderately high-pitched, rather tense voice. \"Are you Elijah Baley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley froze. After all his apprehension and all his precautions, he had been unaware of someone entering. In the end, he had been entirely wrapped up in the simple act of emptying his bladder, something that should not have taken up even the tiniest fraction of his conscious mind. (Was he getting old?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be sure, there seemed no threat of any kind in the voice he heard. It seemed empty of menace. It may have been that Baley simply felt certain - and had the sure confidence within him - that Daneel, at least, if not Giskard, would not have allowed a threat to enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat bothered Baley was merely the entrance. In his whole life, he had never been approached - let alone addressed - by a man in a Personal. On Earth that was the most strenuous taboo and on Solaria (and, until now, on Aurora) he had used only one-person Personals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice came again. Impatient. \"Come! You must be Elijah Baley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Baley turned. It was a man of moderate height, delicately dressed in well-fitted clothing in various shades of blue. He was light-skinned, light-haired, and had a small mustache that was a shade darker than the hair on his head. Baley found himself staring with fascination at the small strip of hair on the upper lip. It was the first time he had seen a Spacer with a mustache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said (and was filled with shame at speaking in a Personal), \"I am Elijah Baley.\" His voice, even in, his own, ears, seemed a scratchy and unconvincing whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spacer seemed to find it unconvincing, certainly. He said, narrowing his eyes and staring, \"The robots outside said Elijah Baley was in here, but you don\u0027t look at all the way you looked on hyperwave. Not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat foolish dramatization! thought Baley fiercely. No one would meet him to the end of time without having been preliminarily poisoned by that impossible representation. No one would accept him as a human being at the start, as a fallible human being - and when they discovered the fallibility, they would, in disappointment, consider him a fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned resentfully to the washbasin and splashed water, then shook his hands vaguely in the air, while wondering where the hot-air jet might be found. The Spacer touched a contact and seemed to pluck a thin bit of absorbent fluff out of midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" said Baley, taking it. \"That was not me in the hyperwave show. It was an actor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that, but they might have picked one that looked more like you, mightn\u0027t they?\" It seemed to be a source of grievance to him. \"I want to speak to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get past my robots?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was another source of grievance, apparently. \"I nearly didn\u0027t,\" said the Spacer. \"They tried to stop me and I only had one robot with me. I had to pretend I had to get in here on an emergency basis and they searched me. They absolutely laid hands on me to see if I was carrying anything dangerous. I\u0027d have you up on charges - if you weren\u0027t an Earthman. You can\u0027t give robots the kind of orders that embarrass a human being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Baley stiffly, \"but I am not the one who gave them their orders. What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to speak to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are speaking to me. - Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other seemed to hesitate, then said, \"Gremionis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Santirix Gremionis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you want to speak to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Gremionis stared at Baley, apparently with embarrassment. Then he mumbled, \"Well, as long as I\u0027m here if you don\u0027t mind - I might as well - \" and he stepped toward the line of urinals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley realized, with the - last refinement of horrified queasiness, what it was Gremionis intended to do. He turned hastily and said, \"I\u0027ll wait for you outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No no, don\u0027t go,\" said Gremionis desperately, in what was almost a squeak. \"This won\u0027t take a second. Please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only that Baley now wanted, just as desperately, to talk to Gremionis and did not want to do anything that might offend the other and make him unwilling to talk; otherwise he would not have been willing to accede to the request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his back turned and squinted his eyes nearly shut in a sort of horrified reflex. It was only when Gremionis came up around him, his hands kneading a fluffy towel of his own, that Baley could relax again, after a fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you want to speak to me?\" he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gladia - the woman from Solaria - \" Gremionis looked dubious and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know Gladia,\" said Baley coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gladia viewed me - trimensionally, you know - and told me you had asked about me. And she asked me if I had, in any way, mistreated a robot she owned - a human-looking robot like one of those outside - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, did you, Mr. Gremionis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! I didn\u0027t even know she owned a robot like that, until - Did you tell her I did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was only asking questions, Mr. Gremionis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGremionis had made a fist of his right hand and was grinding it nervously into his left. He said intensely, \"I don\u0027t want to be falsely accused of anything - and especially where such a false accusation would affect my relationship with Gladia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"How did you find me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGremionis said, \"She asked me about that robot and said you had asked about me. I had heard you - had been called to Aurora by Dr. Fastolfe to solve this - puzzle - about the robot. It was on the hyperwave news. And - \" The words ground out as though they were emerging, from him with the utmost difficulty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" said Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to talk to you and explain that I had had nothing to do with that robot. Nothing! Gladia didn\u0027t know where you were, but I thought Dr. Fastolfe would know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you called him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no, I - I don\u0027t think I\u0027d have the nerve to - He\u0027s such an important scientist. But Gladia called him for me. She\u0027s that kind of person. He told her you had gone to see his daughter, Dr. Vasilia Aliena. That was good because I know her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know you do,\" said Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGremionis looked uneasy. \"How did you - Did you ask her about me, too?\" His uneasiness seemed to be degenerating to misery. \"I finally called Dr. Vasilia and she said you had just left and I\u0027d probably find you at some Community Personal and this one is the closest to her establishment. I was sure there would be no reason for you to delay in order to find a farther one. I mean why should you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You reason quite correctly, but how is it you got here so quickly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I work at the Robotics Institute and my establishment is on the Institute grounds. My scooter brought me here in minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you come here alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! With only one robot. The scooter is a two-seater, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your robot is waiting outside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me again why you want to see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to make sure you don\u0027t think I\u0027ve had anything to do with that robot. I never even heard of him till this whole thing exploded in the news. So can I talk to you now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but not here,\" said Baley firmly. \"Let\u0027s get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow strange it was, thought Baley, that he was so pleased to get out from behind walls and into the Outside - There was something more totally alien to this Personal than anything else he had encountered on either Aurora or Solaria. Even more disconcerting, than the fact of planet-wide indiscriminate use had been the horror of being openly and casually addressed of behavior that drew no distinction between this place and its purpose and any other place and purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book-films he had viewed had said nothing of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, as Fastolfe had pointed out, they were not written for Earthpeople but for Aurorans and, to a lesser extent, for possible tourists from the other forty-nine Spacer worlds. Earthpeople, after all, almost never went to the Spacer worlds, least of all to Aurora. They were not welcome there. Why, then, should they be addressed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why should the book-films expand on what everyone knew? Should they make a fuss over the fact that Aurora was spherical in shape, or that water was wet, or that one man might address another freely in a Personal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet did that not make a mockery of the very name of the structure? Yet Baley found himself unable to avoid thinking of the Women\u0027s Personals on Earth where, as Jessie had frequently told him, women chattered incessantly and felt no discomfort about it. Why women, but not men? Baley had never thought seriously about it before, but had accepted it merely as custom - as unbreakable custom - but if women, why not men?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter. The thought only affected his intellect and not whatever it was about his mind that made him feel overwhelming and ineradicable distaste for the whole idea. He repeated, \"Let\u0027s get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGremionis protested, \"But your robots are out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they are. What of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this is something I want to talk about privately, man to m-man.\" He stumbled over the phrase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose you mean Spacer to Earthman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My robots are necessary. They are my partners in my investigation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this has nothing to do with the investigation. That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be the judge of that,\" said Baley firmly, walking out of the Personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGremionis hesitated and then followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e47\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel and Giskard were waiting - impassive, expressionless, patient. On Daneel\u0027s face, Baley thought he could make out a trace of concern, but, on the other hand, he might merely be reading that emotion into those inhumanly human features. Giskard, the less human-looking, showed nothing, of course, even to the most willing personifier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA third robot waited as well - presumably that of Gremionis. He was simpler in appearance even than Giskard and had an air of shabbiness about him. It was clear that Gremionis was not very well-to-do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaneel said, with what Baley automatically assumed to be the warmth of relief, \"I am pleased that you are well, Partner Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Entirely well. I am curious, however, about something. If you had heard me call out in alarm from within, would you have come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At once sir,\" said Giskard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even though you are programmed not to enter Personals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The need to protect a human being - you, in particular - would be paramount, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is so, Partner Elijah,\" said Daneel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad to hear that,\" said Baley. \"This person is Santirix Gremionis. Mr. Gremionis, this is Daneel and this is Giskard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach robot bent his head solemnly. Gremionis merely glanced at them, and lifted one hand in indifferent acknowledgment. He made no effort to introduce his own robot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley looked around. The light was distinctly dimmer, the wind was brisker, the air was cooler, the sun was completely hidden by clouds. There was a gloom to the surroundings that did not seem to affect Baley, who continued to be delighted at having escaped from the Personal. It lifted his spirits amazingly that he was actually experiencing the feeling of being pleased at being Outside. It was a special case, he knew, but it was a beginning and he could not help but consider it a triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley was about to turn to Gremionis to resume the conversation, when his eye caught movement. Walking across the lawn came a woman with an accompanying robot. She was coming toward them but seemed totally oblivious to them. She was clearly making for the Personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley put out his arm in the direction of the woman, as though to stop her, even though she was still thirty meters away, and muttered, \"Doesn\u0027t she know that\u0027s a Men\u0027s Personal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" said Gremionis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman continued to approach, while Baley watched ih total puzzlement. Finally, the woman\u0027s robot stepped to one side to wait and the woman entered the structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said helplessly, \"But she can\u0027t go in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGremionis said, \"Why not? It\u0027s communal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s for men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s for people,\" said Gremionis. He seemed utterly confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either sex? Surely you can\u0027t mean that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any human being. Of course I mean it! How would you want it to be? I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley turned away. It had not been many minutes before that he had thought that open conversation in a Personal was the acme in bad taste, of Things Not Done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he had tried to think of something worse yet, he would have completely failed to dredge up the possibility of encountering a woman in a Personal. Convention on Earth required him to ignore the presence of others in the large Community Personals on that world, but not all the conventions ever invented would have prevented him from knowing whether a person passing him was a man or a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if, while he had been in the Personal, a woman had entered - casually, indifferently - as this one had just done? Or, worse still, what if he had entered a Personal and found a woman already there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not estimate his reaction. He had never weighed the possibility, let alone met with such a situation, but he found the thought totally intolerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the book-films had told him nothing about that either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had viewed those films in order that he might not approach the investigation in total ignorance of the Auroran way of life - and they had left him in total ignorance of all that was important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen how could he handle this triply knotted puzzle of Jander\u0027s death, when at every step he found himself lost in ignorance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment before he had felt triumph at a small conquest over the terrors of Outside, but now he was faced with the feeling of being ignorant of everything, ignorant even of the nature of his ignorance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was now, while fighting not to picture the woman passing through the airspace lately occupied by himself, that he came near to utter despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e48\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Giskard said (and in a way that made it possible to read concern into his words - if not into the tone), \"Are you unwell, sir? Do you need help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley muttered, \"No no. I\u0027m all right. - But let\u0027s move away. We\u0027re in the path of people wishing to use that structure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked rapidly toward the airfoil that was resting in the open stretch beyond the gravel path. On the other side was a small two-wheeled vehicle, with two seats, one behind the other. Baley assumed it to be Gremionis\u0027 scooter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis feeling of depression and misery, Baley realized, was accentuated by the fact that he felt hungry. It was clearly past lunchtime and he had not eaten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Gremionis. \"Let\u0027s talk - but if you don\u0027t mind, let\u0027s do it over lunch. That is, if you haven\u0027t already eaten and if you don\u0027t mind eating with me,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Where does one eat at the Institute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGremionis said, \"Not at the Community Diner. We can\u0027t talk there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there an alternative?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to my establishment,\" said Gremionis at once. \"It isn\u0027t one of the fancier ones here. I\u0027m not one of your high executives. Still, I have a few serviceable robots and we can set a decent table. - I tell you what. I\u0027ll get on my scooter with Brundij - my robot, you know - and you follow me. You\u0027ll have to go slowly, but I\u0027m only a little over a kilometer away. It will just take two or three minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved away at an eager half-run. Baley watched him and thought there seemed to be a kind of gangly youthfulness about him. There was no easy way of actually judging his age, of course; Spacers didn\u0027t show age and Gremionis might easily be fifty. But he acted young, almost what an Earthman would consider teenage young. Baley wasn\u0027t sure exactly what there was about hirn that gave that impression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley turned suddenly to Daneel. \"Do you know Gremionis, Daneel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have never met him before, Partner Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, Giskard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have met him once, sir, but only in passing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know anything about him, Giskard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing that is not apparent on the surface, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His age? His personality?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGremionis shouted, \"Ready?\" His scooter was humming rather roughly. It was clear that it was not air-jet assisted. The wheels would not leave the ground. Brundij sat behind Gremionis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard, Daneel, and Baley moved quickly into their airfoil once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGremionis moved outward in a loose circle. Gremionis\u0027 hair flew backward in the wind and Baley had a sudden sensation of how the wind must feel when one traveled in an open vehicle such as a scooter. He was thankful he was totally enclosed in an airfoil - which suddenly seemed to him a much more civilized way of traveling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scooter straightened out and darted off with a muted roar, Gremionis waving one hand in a follow-me gesture. The robot behind him maintained his balance with almost negligent ease, and did not hold on to Gremionis\u0027 waist, as Baley was certain a human being would have needed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airfoil followed. Although the scooter\u0027s smooth forward progression seemed high-speed, that was apparently the illusion of its small size. The airfoil had some difficulty maintaining a speed low enough to avoid running it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just the same,\" said Baley thoughtfully, \"one thing puzzles me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that, Partner Elijah?\" asked Daneel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vasilia referred to this Gremionis disparagingly as a \u0027barber.\u0027 Apparently, he deals with hair, clothes, and other matters of personal human adornment. How is it, then, that he has an establishment on the grounds of the Robotics Institute?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-robots-of-dawn-robot-3/page-11.html","bookId":2431,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:24 PM"}
