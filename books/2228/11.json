Mixed media. The room was a lushly adorned Renaissance library complete with inlaid bookshelves, oriental carpets, and colorful tapestries... and yet the room bristled with high-tech gear - banks of computers, faxes, electronic maps of the Vatican complex, and televisions tuned to CNN. Men in colorful pantaloons typed feverishly on computers and listened intently in futuristic headphones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait here,\" the guard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon and Vittoria waited as the guard crossed the room to an exceptionally tall, wiry man in a dark blue military uniform. He was talking on a cellular phone and stood so straight he was almost bent backward. The guard said something to him, and the man shot a glance over at Langdon and Vittoria. He nodded, then turned his back on them and continued his phone call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard returned. \"Commander Olivetti will be with you in a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard left and headed back up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon studied Commander Olivetti across the room, realizing he was actually the Commander in Chief of the armed forces of an entire country. Vittoria and Langdon waited, observing the action before them. Brightly dressed guards bustled about yelling orders in Italian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Continua cercando!\" one yelled into a telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probasti il museo?\" another asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon did not need fluent Italian to discern that the security center was currently in intense search mode. This was the good news. The bad news was that they obviously had not yet found the antimatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" Langdon asked Vittoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, offering a tired smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the commander finally clicked off his phone and approached across the room, he seemed to grow with each step. Langdon was tall himself and not accustomed to looking up at many people, but Commander Olivetti demanded it. Langdon sensed immediately that the commander was a man who had weathered tempests, his face hale and steeled. His dark hair was cropped in a military buzz cut, and his eyes burned with the kind of hardened determination only attainable through years of intense training. He moved with ramrod exactness, the earpiece hidden discreetly behind one ear making him look more like U.S. Secret Service than Swiss Guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander addressed them in accented English. His voice was startlingly quiet for such a large man, barely a whisper. It bit with a tight, military efficiency. \"Good afternoon,\" he said. \"I am Commander Olivetti - Comandante Principale of the Swiss Guard. I\u0027m the one who called your director.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria gazed upward. \"Thank you for seeing us, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander did not respond. He motioned for them to follow and led them through the tangle of electronics to a door in the side wall of the chamber. \"Enter,\" he said, holding the door for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon and Vittoria walked through and found themselves in a darkened control room where a wall of video monitors was cycling lazily through a series of black-and-white images of the complex. A young guard sat watching the images intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuori,\" Olivetti said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard packed up and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti walked over to one of the screens and pointed to it. Then he turned toward his guests. \"This image is from a remote camera hidden somewhere inside Vatican City. I\u0027d like an explanation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon and Vittoria looked at the screen and inhaled in unison. The image was absolute. No doubt. It was CERN\u0027s antimatter canister. Inside, a shimmering droplet of metallic liquid hung ominously in the air, lit by the rhythmic blinking of the LED digital clock. Eerily, the area around the canister was almost entirely dark, as if the antimatter were in a closet or darkened room. At the top of the monitor flashed superimposed text: Live Feed - Camera #86.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria looked at the time remaining on the flashing indicator on the canister. \"Under six hours,\" she whispered to Langdon, her face tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon checked his watch. \"So we have until...\" He stopped, a knot tightening in his stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Midnight,\" Vittoria said, with a withering look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidnight, Langdon thought. A flair for the dramatic. Apparently whoever stole the canister last night had timed it perfectly. A stark foreboding set in as he realized he was currently sitting at ground zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti\u0027s whisper now sounded more like a hiss. \"Does this object belong to your facility?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria nodded. \"Yes, sir. It was stolen from us. It contains an extremely combustible substance called antimatter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti looked unmoved. \"I am quite familiar with incendiaries, Ms. Vetra. I have not heard of antimatter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s new technology. We need to locate it immediately or evacuate Vatican City.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti closed his eyes slowly and reopened them, as if refocusing on Vittoria might change what he just heard. \"Evacuate? Are you aware what is going on here this evening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. And the lives of your cardinals are in danger. We have about six hours. Have you made any headway locating the canister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti shook his head. \"We haven\u0027t started looking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria choked. \"What? But we expressly heard your guards talking about searching the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Searching, yes,\" Olivetti said, \"but not for your canister. My men are looking for something else that does not concern you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria\u0027s voice cracked. \"You haven\u0027t even begun looking for this canister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti\u0027s pupils seemed to recede into his head. He had the passionless look of an insect. \"Ms. Vetra, is it? Let me explain something to you. The director of your facility refused to share any details about this object with me over the phone except to say that I needed to find it immediately. We are exceptionally busy, and I do not have the luxury of dedicating manpower to a situation until I get some facts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is only one relevant fact at this moment, sir,\" Vittoria said, \"that being that in six hours that device is going to vaporize this entire complex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti stood motionless. \"Ms. Vetra, there is something you need to know.\" His tone hinted at patronizing. \"Despite the archaic appearance of Vatican City, every single entrance, both public and private, is equipped with the most advanced sensing equipment known to man. If someone tried to enter with any sort of incendiary device it would be detected instantly. We have radioactive isotope scanners, olfactory filters designed by the American DEA to detect the faintest chemical signatures of combustibles and toxins. We also use the most advanced metal detectors and X-ray scanners available.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very impressive,\" Vittoria said, matching Olivetti\u0027s cool. \"Unfortunately, antimatter is nonradioactive, its chemical signature is that of pure hydrogen, and the canister is plastic. None of those devices would have detected it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the device has an energy source,\" Olivetti said, motioning to the blinking LED. \"Even the smallest trace of nickel-cadmium would register as - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The batteries are also plastic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti\u0027s patience was clearly starting to wane. \"Plastic batteries?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Polymer gel electrolyte with Teflon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti leaned toward her, as if to accentuate his height advantage. \"Signorina, the Vatican is the target of dozens of bomb threats a month. I personally train every Swiss Guard in modern explosive technology. I am well aware that there is no substance on earth powerful enough to do what you are describing unless you are talking about a nuclear warhead with a fuel core the size of a baseball.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria framed him with a fervent stare. \"Nature has many mysteries yet to unveil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti leaned closer. \"Might I ask exactly who you are? What is your position at CERN?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a senior member of the research staff and appointed liaison to the Vatican for this crisis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me for being rude, but if this is indeed a crisis, why am I dealing with you and not your director? And what disrespect do you intend by coming into Vatican City in short pants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon groaned. He couldn\u0027t believe that under the circumstances the man was being a stickler for dress code. Then again, he realized, if stone penises could induce lustful thoughts in Vatican residents, Vittoria Vetra in shorts could certainly be a threat to national security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander Olivetti,\" Langdon intervened, trying to diffuse what looked like a second bomb about to explode. \"My name is Robert Langdon. I\u0027m a professor of religious studies in the U.S. and unaffiliated with CERN. I have seen an antimatter demonstration and will vouch for Ms. Vetra\u0027s claim that it is exceptionally dangerous. We have reason to believe it was placed inside your complex by an antireligious cult hoping to disrupt your conclave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti turned, peering down at Langdon. \"I have a woman in shorts telling me that a droplet of liquid is going to blow up Vatican City, and I have an American professor telling me we are being targeted by some antireligious cult. What exactly is it you expect me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find the canister,\" Vittoria said. \"Right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible. That device could be anywhere. Vatican City is enormous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your cameras don\u0027t have GPS locators on them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are not generally stolen. This missing camera will take days to locate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have days,\" Vittoria said adamantly. \"We have six hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six hours until what, Ms. Vetra?\" Olivetti\u0027s voice grew louder suddenly. He pointed to the image on the screen. \"Until these numbers count down? Until Vatican City disappears? Believe me, I do not take kindly to people tampering with my security system. Nor do I like mechanical contraptions appearing mysteriously inside my walls. I am concerned. It is my job to be concerned. But what you have told me here is unacceptable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon spoke before he could stop himself. \"Have you heard of the Illuminati?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander\u0027s icy exterior cracked. His eyes went white, like a shark about to attack. \"I am warning you. I do not have time for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you have heard of the Illuminati?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti\u0027s eyes stabbed like bayonets. \"I am a sworn defendant of the Catholic Church. Of course I have heard of the Illuminati. They have been dead for decades.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon reached in his pocket and pulled out the fax image of Leonardo Vetra\u0027s branded body. He handed it to Olivetti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am an Illuminati scholar,\" Langdon said as Olivetti studied the picture. \"I am having a difficult time accepting that the Illuminati are still active, and yet the appearance of this brand combined with the fact that the Illuminati have a well-known covenant against Vatican City has changed my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A computer-generated hoax.\" Olivetti handed the fax back to Langdon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon stared, incredulous. \"Hoax? Look at the symmetry! You of all people should realize the authenticity of - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Authenticity is precisely what you lack. Perhaps Ms. Vetra has not informed you, but CERN scientists have been criticizing Vatican policies for decades. They regularly petition us for retraction of Creationist theory, formal apologies for Galileo and Copernicus, repeal of our criticism against dangerous or immoral research. What scenario seems more likely to you - that a four-hundred-year-old satanic cult has resurfaced with an advanced weapon of mass destruction, or that some prankster at CERN is trying to disrupt a sacred Vatican event with a well-executed fraud?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That photo,\" Vittoria said, her voice like boiling lava, \"is of my father. Murdered. You think this is my idea of a joke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Ms. Vetra. But I do know until I get some answers that make sense, there is no way I will raise any sort of alarm. Vigilance and discretion are my duty... such that spiritual matters can take place here with clarity of mind. Today of all days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon said, \"At least postpone the event.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Postpone?\" Olivetti\u0027s jaw dropped. \"Such arrogance! A conclave is not some American baseball game you call on account of rain. This is a sacred event with a strict code and process. Never mind that one billion Catholics in the world are waiting for a leader. Never mind that the world media is outside. The protocols for this event are holy - not subject to modification. Since 1179, conclaves have survived earthquakes, famines, and even the plague. Believe me, it is not about to be canceled on account of a murdered scientist and a droplet of God knows what.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take me to the person in charge,\" Vittoria demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti glared. \"You\u0027ve got him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"Someone in the clergy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe veins on Olivetti\u0027s brow began to show. \"The clergy has gone. With the exception of the Swiss Guard, the only ones present in Vatican City at this time are the College of Cardinals. And they are inside the Sistine Chapel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about the chamberlain?\" Langdon stated flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The late Pope\u0027s chamberlain.\" Langdon repeated the word self-assuredly, praying his memory served him. He recalled reading once about the curious arrangement of Vatican authority following the death of a Pope. If Langdon was correct, during the interim between Popes, complete autonomous power shifted temporarily to the late Pope\u0027s personal assistant - his chamberlain - a secretarial underling who oversaw conclave until the cardinals chose the new Holy Father. \"I believe the chamberlain is the man in charge at the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Il camerlegno?\" Olivetti scowled. \"The camerlegno is only a priest here. He is not even canonized. He is the late Pope\u0027s hand servant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he is here. And you answer to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti crossed his arms. \"Mr. Langdon, it is true that Vatican rule dictates the camerlegno assume chief executive office during conclave, but it is only because his lack of eligibility for the papacy ensures an unbiased election. It is as if your president died, and one of his aides temporarily sat in the oval office. The camerlegno is young, and his understanding of security, or anything else for that matter, is extremely limited. For all intents and purposes, I am in charge here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take us to him,\" Vittoria said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible. Conclave begins in forty minutes. The camerlegno is in the Office of the Pope preparing. I have no intention of disturbing him with matters of security.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria opened her mouth to respond but was interrupted by a knocking at the door. Olivetti opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guard in full regalia stood outside, pointing to his watch. \"ee l\u0027ora, comandante.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti checked his own watch and nodded. He turned back to Langdon and Vittoria like a judge pondering their fate. \"Follow me.\" He led them out of the monitoring room across the security center to a small clear cubicle against the rear wall. \"My office.\" Olivetti ushered them inside. The room was unspecial - a cluttered desk, file cabinets, folding chairs, a water cooler. \"I will be back in ten minutes. I suggest you use the time to decide how you would like to proceed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria wheeled. \"You can\u0027t just leave! That canister is - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not have time for this,\" Olivetti seethed. \"Perhaps I should detain you until after the conclave when I do have time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Signore,\" the guard urged, pointing to his watch again. \"Spazzare di capella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti nodded and started to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spazzare di capella?\" Vittoria demanded. \"You\u0027re leaving to sweep the chapel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti turned, his eyes boring through her. \"We sweep for electronic bugs, Miss Vetra - a matter of discretion.\" He motioned to her legs. \"Not something I would expect you to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that he slammed the door, rattling the heavy glass. In one fluid motion he produced a key, inserted it, and twisted. A heavy deadbolt slid into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Idi��ta!\" Vittoria yelled. \"You can\u0027t keep us in here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the glass, Langdon could see Olivetti say something to the guard. The sentinel nodded. As Olivetti strode out of the room, the guard spun and faced them on the other side of the glass, arms crossed, a large sidearm visible on his hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect, Langdon thought. Just bloody perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e37\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria glared at the Swiss Guard standing outside Olivetti\u0027s locked door. The sentinel glared back, his colorful costume belying his decidedly ominous air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Che fiasco,\" Vittoria thought. Held hostage by an armed man in pajamas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had fallen silent, and Vittoria hoped he was using that Harvard brain of his to think them out of this. She sensed, however, from the look on his face, that he was more in shock than in thought. She regretted getting him so involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria\u0027s first instinct was to pull out her cell phone and call Kohler, but she knew it was foolish. First, the guard would probably walk in and take her phone. Second, if Kohler\u0027s episode ran its usual course, he was probably still incapacitated. Not that it mattered... Olivetti seemed unlikely to take anybody\u0027s word on anything at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember! she told herself. Remember the solution to this test!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembrance was a Buddhist philosopher\u0027s trick. Rather than asking her mind to search for a solution to a potentially impossible challenge, Vittoria asked her mind simply to remember it. The presupposition that one once knew the answer created the mindset that the answer must exist... thus eliminating the crippling conception of hopelessness. Vittoria often used the process to solve scientific quandaries... those that most people thought had no solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, however, her remembrance trick was drawing a major blank. So she measured her options... her needs. She needed to warn someone. Someone at the Vatican needed to take her seriously. But who? The camerlegno? How? She was in a glass box with one exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTools, she told herself. There are always tools. Reevaluate your environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinctively she lowered her shoulders, relaxed her eyes, and took three deep breaths into her lungs. She sensed her heart rate slow and her muscles soften. The chaotic panic in her mind dissolved. Okay, she thought, let your mind be free. What makes this situation positive? What are my assets?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe analytical mind of Vittoria Vetra, once calmed, was a powerful force. Within seconds she realized their incarceration was actually their key to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m making a phone call,\" she said suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon looked up. \"I was about to suggest you call Kohler, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Kohler. Someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The camerlegno.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon looked totally lost. \"You\u0027re calling the chamberlain? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Olivetti said the camerlegno was in the Pope\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. You know the Pope\u0027s private number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I\u0027m not calling on my phone.\" She nodded to a high-tech phone system on Olivetti\u0027s desk. It was riddled with speed dial buttons. \"The head of security must have a direct line to the Pope\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He also has a weight lifter with a gun planted six feet away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we\u0027re locked in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was actually aware of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean the guard is locked out. This is Olivetti\u0027s private office. I doubt anyone else has a key.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon looked out at the guard. \"This is pretty thin glass, and that\u0027s a pretty big gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he going to do, shoot me for using the phone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who the hell knows! This is a pretty strange place, and the way things are going - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either that,\" Vittoria said, \"or we can spend the next five hours and forty-eight minutes in Vatican Prison. At least we\u0027ll have a front-row seat when the antimatter goes off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon paled. \"But the guard will get Olivetti the second you pick up that phone. Besides, there are twenty buttons on there. And I don\u0027t see any identification. You going to try them all and hope to get lucky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope,\" she said, striding to the phone. \"Just one.\" Vittoria picked up the phone and pressed the top button. \"Number one. I bet you one of those Illuminati U.S. dollars you have in your pocket that this is the Pope\u0027s office. What else would take primary importance for a Swiss Guard commander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon did not have time to respond. The guard outside the door started rapping on the glass with the butt of his gun. He motioned for her to set down the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria winked at him. The guard seemed to inflate with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon moved away from the door and turned back to Vittoria. \"You damn well better be right, \u0027cause this guy does not look amused!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn!\" she said, listening to the receiver. \"A recording.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Recording?\" Langdon demanded. \"The Pope has an answering machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t the Pope\u0027s office,\" Vittoria said, hanging up. \"It was the damn weekly menu for the Vatican commissary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon offered a weak smile to the guard outside who was now glaring angrily though the glass while he hailed Olivetti on his walkie-talkie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e38\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vatican switchboard is located in the Ufficio di Communicazione behind the Vatican post office. It is a relatively small room containing an eight-line Corelco 141 switchboard. The office handles over 2,000 calls a day, most routed automatically to the recording information system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, the sole communications operator on duty sat quietly sipping a cup of caffeinated tea. He felt proud to be one of only a handful of employees still allowed inside Vatican City tonight. Of course the honor was tainted somewhat by the presence of the Swiss Guards hovering outside his door. An escort to the bathroom, the operator thought. Ah, the indignities we endure in the name of Holy Conclave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, the calls this evening had been light. Or maybe it was not so fortunate, he thought. World interest in Vatican events seemed to have dwindled in the last few years. The number of press calls had thinned, and even the crazies weren\u0027t calling as often. The press office had hoped tonight\u0027s event would have more of a festive buzz about it. Sadly, though, despite St. Peter\u0027s Square being filled with press trucks, the vans looked to be mostly standard Italian and Euro press. Only a handful of global cover-all networks were there... no doubt having sent their giornalisti secundari.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operator gripped his mug and wondered how long tonight would last. Midnight or so, he guessed. Nowadays, most insiders already knew who was favored to become Pope well before conclave convened, so the process was more of a three -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or four-hour ritual than an actual election. Of course, last-minute dissension in the ranks could prolong the ceremony through dawn... or beyond. The conclave of 1831 had lasted fifty-four days. Not tonight, he told himself; rumor was this conclave would be a \"smoke-watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operator\u0027s thoughts evaporated with the buzz of an inside line on his switchboard. He looked at the blinking red light and scratched his head. That\u0027s odd, he thought. The zero-line. Who on the inside would be calling operator information tonight? Who is even inside?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Citta del Vaticano, prego?\" he said, picking up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice on the line spoke in rapid Italian. The operator vaguely recognized the accent as that common to Swiss Guards - fluent Italian tainted by the Franco-Swiss influence. This caller, however, was most definitely not Swiss Guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn hearing the woman\u0027s voice, the operator stood suddenly, almost spilling his tea. He shot a look back down at the line. He had not been mistaken. An internal extension. The call was from the inside. There must be some mistake! he thought. A woman inside Vatican City? Tonight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman was speaking fast and furiously. The operator had spent enough years on the phones to know when he was dealing with a pazzo. This woman did not sound crazy. She was urgent but rational. Calm and efficient. He listened to her request, bewildered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Il camerlegno?\" the operator said, still trying to figure out where the hell the call was coming from. \"I cannot possibly connect... yes, I am aware he is in the Pope\u0027s office but... who are you again?... and you want to warn him of...\" He listened, more and more unnerved. Everyone is in danger? How? And where are you calling from? \"Perhaps I should contact the Swiss...\" The operator stopped short. \"You say you\u0027re where? Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listened in shock, then made a decision. \"Hold, please,\" he said, putting the woman on hold before she could respond. Then he called Commander Olivetti\u0027s direct line. There is no way that woman is really -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line picked up instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Per l\u0027amore di Dio!\" a familiar woman\u0027s voice shouted at him. \"Place the damn call!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door of the Swiss Guards\u0027 security center hissed open. The guards parted as Commander Olivetti entered the room like a rocket. Turning the corner to his office, Olivetti confirmed what his guard on the walkie-talkie had just told him; Vittoria Vetra was standing at his desk talking on the commander\u0027s private telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChe coglioni che ha questa! he thought. The balls on this one!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLivid, he strode to the door and rammed the key into the lock. He pulled open the door and demanded, \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria ignored him. \"Yes,\" she was saying into the phone. \"And I must warn - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti ripped the receiver from her hand, and raised it to his ear. \"Who the hell is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the tiniest of an instant, Olivetti\u0027s inelastic posture slumped. \"Yes, camerlegno...\" he said. \"Correct, signore... but questions of security demand... of course not... I am holding her here for... certainly, but...\" He listened. \"Yes, sir,\" he said finally. \"I will bring them up immediately.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/angels-demons-robert-langdon-1/page-11.html","bookId":2228,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:23 PM"}
