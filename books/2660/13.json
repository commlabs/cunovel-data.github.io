There Amelia was delighted to find a blanket stretched out on the ground, the corner of which was held down by a basket filled with delicious smelling tarts and various cuts of meat and cheeses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you manage this?” she breathed, filled with pleasure by his thoughtfulness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dear Amelia,” he drawled, his eyes twinkling. “You know who I am now, and who I will be. I can manage anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew the rudiments of the peerage, and saw the power wielded by her father, a viscount. How many more times the magnitude was the power wielded by Ware, whose future held a marquessate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened at the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come now,” he urged. “Have a seat, enjoy a peach tart, and tell me about your day. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My life is dreadfully boring, ” she said, dropping to the ground with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then tell me a tale. Surely you daydream about something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dreamt about kisses given passionately by a dark-eyed Gypsy lover, but she would never say such a thing aloud. She rose to her knees and dug into the basket to hide her blush. “I lack imagination,” she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well, then.” Ware situated himself on his back with his hands clasped at his neck and stared up at the sky. He looked as at ease as she had ever seen him. Despite the rather formal attire he wore—including pristine white stockings and polished heels—he was still a far more relaxed person than the one she met weeks ago. Amelia found that she rather liked the new earl and felt a touch of pleasure that she had wrought what she considered to be a positive change in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It appears I must regale you with a story,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lovely.” She settled back to a seated position and took a bite of her treat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once upon a time . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia watched Ware’s lips move as he spoke, and imagined kissing them. A now-familiar sense of sadness shivered through her, an effect of leaving her beloved romantic notions behind and embracing unfamiliar new ones, but the sensation lessened as she thought of Colin and what he had done. He certainly did not feel any sadness about leaving her behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you kiss me?” she blurted out, her fingertips brushing tart crumbs from the corners of her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe earl paused midsentence and turned his head to look at her. His eyes were wide with surprise, but he appeared more intrigued than dismayed. “Beg your pardon. Did I hear you correctly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you kissed a girl before?” she asked, curious. He was two years older than she was, only one year younger than Colin. It was quite possible that he had experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin had an edgy, dark restlessness about him that was seductive even to her naïve senses. Ware, on the other hand, was far more leisurely, his attractiveness stemming from innate command and the comfort of knowing the world was his for the taking. Still, despite her high regard for Colin, she could see how Ware’s lazy charm appealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows rose. “A gentleman does not speak of such things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How wonderful! Somehow, I knew you would be discreet. ” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Repeat the request again,” he murmured, watching her carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you kiss me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this a hypothetical question, or a call to action?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly shy and unsure, Amelia looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amelia, ” he said softly, bringing her gaze back to his. There was deep kindness there on his handsome patrician features, and she was grateful for it. He rolled to his side and then pushed up to a seated position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not hypothetical, ” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you wish to be kissed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “Because.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see.” His lips pursed a moment. “Would Benny suffice? Or a footman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth curved in a slow smile that made something flutter in her belly. It was not an outright flip, as was caused by Colin’s dimples, but it was certainly a herald of her new awareness of her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will not kiss you today,” he said. “I want you to think upon it further. If you feel the same when next we meet, I will kiss you then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia wrinkled her nose. “If you have no taste for me, simply say so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, my hotheaded princess,” he soothed, his hand catching hers, his thumb stroking the back. “You jump to conclusions just as you jump into trouble—with both feet. I will catch you, fair Amelia. I look forward to catching you. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” she breathed, blinking at the suggestive undertone to his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia was awakened by the knock that came to her bedchamber door. She lay curled in a ball, her eyes closed, her sleep-foggy mind praying that she could drift back into sleep and rejoin her vivid dreams. Dreams that reminded her of the rare connection she had with Ware and how precious that bond was to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the knocking came again, more insistent. Harsh reality intruded, and she mourned the loss of her nocturnal reminiscences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amelia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria. The one person in the household that she could not ignore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalling out in a sleep-husky voice, Amelia struggled to a seated position and watched as the portal swung open and her sister stepped into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, poppet,” Maria said, gliding toward her with an elegance she had long envied. “Sorry to wake you. It is late morning, however, so I did wait. Sadly, the length of my patience is probably not as long as you would like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do so love that gown on you,” Amelia replied, admiring the cream-colored muslin and its appeal next to Maria’s olive skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.” Maria took a seat on the slipper chair near the window. “Did you have a good evening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisions of Ware, dashing in evening attire, filled Amelia’s mind. Last night had been one in an endless string of nights spent at balls and routs. Except last evening had been marginally different. She was different. Ware was different. The awareness between them had changed, and she knew instinctively that it would never be the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pressing forward, maneuvering expertly, forcing her to see their situation in cold, hard facts. After an entire childhood filled with falsehoods and evasions, she was normally grateful for his candor. In this instance, however, it served only to increase her feelings of guilt and confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a lovely evening,” she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm . . .” The sound was clearly skeptical. “You have been melancholy of late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you are here to talk about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord Ware almost kissed you on the terrace yesterday afternoon, and yet last night you did not appear any more eager to see him than usual. How could I not ask you about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing her eyes, Amelia’s head dropped back onto the pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you would share your burdens with me,” Maria coaxed, “perhaps I could help. I should like to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening her eyes, Amelia looked up at the satin lining of her canopy and remembered an earlier time. Her room was decorated in various shades of blue, from pale to dark, just as her childhood bedchamber had been. She’d made the choice consciously, an external declaration of her decision to pick up where her relationship with her sister had been cruelly severed. Her father had stolen years from them, but in this room she felt as if she reclaimed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is nothing to help me with, Maria. There is nothing to mend or alter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What of your masked admirer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will not be seeing him again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pregnant pause, then, “The last you spoke of him was not with such finality in your tone. You saw him a second time, did you not? He sought you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia turned her head to meet her sister’s gaze. “I lured him to me, and he was angry at me for doing so. He intends to leave Town now, to keep his distance and to prevent me from reaching out to him again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He shows a care for your reputation by this action, but you are upset by it.” Confusion filled Maria’s dark eyes. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing up her hands, Amelia said, “Because I do not want him to go! I want to know him, and it pains me greatly that I will not be given that chance. I am distressing Ware and you, yet I cannot seem to set aside my fascination nor can I ignore how weary I am of being left behind. I had enough of such treatment with my father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amelia . . .” Maria held out a hand to her. “What is it about this man that has captured you so? Is he comely? No . . . don’t become angry. I simply wish to understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia sighed. Lack of sleep and inability to eat were taking their toll. She could not fight the feeling that Montoya was slipping away, that every moment when she did nothing took him farther from her. It frustrated her and made her snappish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wore the mask again,” she said finally. “I’ve no notion of what he looks like beneath it, but I do not care. I am moved by the way he talks to me, the way he touches me, the way he kisses me. There is reverence in his handling of me, Maria. Longing. Desire. I do not believe such depth of affection can be feigned. Not the way he expresses it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Maria looked away, lost in thought. Dark ringlets swung around her bared shoulders and betrayed how unsettled she felt. “How can he feel such things for you after only a few moments’ acquaintance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He says I remind him of a lover lost to him, but in truth I sense he wants me for myself in addition to that.” Amelia’s fingertips plucked at the edge of her bed linens. “He originally approached me because of her, but when he came again it was for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can you be certain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am certain of nothing, and now I suppose I never will be.” She looked toward the open door to her boudoir, afraid her features would reveal too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he is departing.” Maria’s voice softened. “Did he say why or where he intends to travel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He says he is in danger of some sort. Deadly danger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From St. John? Or someone else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia’s hands fisted into the counterpane. “He has nothing to do with your husband. He said as much and I believe him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh,” Maria soothed, standing again. “I know you are distraught, but do not vent your frustration on me. I want to help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How?” Amelia challenged. “Will you help me find him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrozen with disbelief, Amelia stared at her sibling. “Truly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” Maria’s shoulders went back, a sure sign of her determination. “St. John’s men look for him, but we have an advantage. You are the only person to manage close proximity to this man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia was speechless for a moment. She had not expected anyone to champion her desire to pursue Montoya, and she could not have selected a better person to help her than Maria, who was afraid of nothing and well versed in finding things that did not wish to be found. “Ware searches for him, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poor Count Montoya,” Maria said, sitting on the edge of the bed beside her and collecting her hands. “I pity him. He espies a pretty woman and because of it, becomes hunted from all sides. St. John will seek him in a criminal’s fashion. Ware will seek him in a peer’s fashion. So you and I must seek Montoya in a woman’s fashion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And how would that be?” Amelia asked, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By shopping, of course.” Maria smiled, and the entire room brightened. “We will visit all the purveyors of masks that we can find and see if any recall the count. If he always covers his face, he must procure a great many of the things. If not, perhaps it was a recent purchase and he left an indelible impression. It is not much, but it’s a start. We will have to take care, of course. If he is in danger, finding him will bring that danger to us. You must trust me and listen to me implicitly. Agreed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Amelia’s lower lip quivered, and she bit it to hide the betraying movement. Her hands tightened on her sister’s. “Thank you, Maria. Thank you so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria caught her close and kissed her forehead. “I will always be here to help you, poppet. Always.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quiet declaration gave Amelia strength, and she clung to it as she slipped from the bed and began to prepare for the day ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a leisurely pace to the pedestrians, carts, and carriages that traveled down the street. The day was sunny and comfortably warm, the air cleansed from a brief spate of early morning rain. Colin, however, was far from relaxed. Something about the day did not sit well with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should not worry so much,” Jacques said. “She will be fine. No one has connected you to your past or to Miss Benbridge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin smiled ruefully. “Am I so transparent?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oui. In your unguarded moments.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring out the carriage window, Colin noted the many people going about their daily business. For his part, his business this afternoon was leaving Town. His carriage was presently wending its way toward the road that would lead them to Bristol. Their trunks were loaded and their account with the rental property was settled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remained unsettled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeling that he was leaving his heart behind was worse than before. His mortality was something he began to feel more keenly each day. Life was finite, and the thought that the entirety of his would be spent without Amelia in it was too painful to bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have never shared a carriage with her,” he said, his gloved fingers wrapping around the window ledge. “I have never sat at a table with her and shared a meal. Everything I have done these last years was in pursuit of a higher station, one that would afford me the privilege to enjoy all the facets of her life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacques’s dark eyes watched him from beneath the rim of his hat. He sat on the opposite squab, his compact body as relaxed as Colin had ever seen it, but still thrumming with energy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-passion-for-him-georgian-3/page-13.html","bookId":2660,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:07 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:07 AM"}
