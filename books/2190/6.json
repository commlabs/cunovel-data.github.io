{"id":100619,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eDinner was a trial. Despite my bellowed statement that I would not allow myself to go mad, I was worried about the disintegration of a formerly sound, if not terribly brilliant, mind. As I saw it, life was offering me two paths: Either I could believe in vampires and live happily ever after, or I could go not-so-quietly insane and have myself locked up. Given those choices, there was really no contest. I took a deep mental breath and told my skeptical self that I was only doing this for sanity\u0027s sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would believe in vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring dinner neither Christian nor Raphael made mention of the episode in the hall, a fact that left me wondering uneasily if they were humoring me in order to keep me from going off the deep end again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not like the feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on, have a little din-din. Tell you what, it\u0027ll be my treat,\" Roxy pleaded with Raphael a few minutes later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you. I told you I\u0027ve already eaten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but surely you could put away a little something extra? You\u0027re a big guy, I\u0027m sure there\u0027s room in there for a little pork and sauerkraut, eh?\" Roxy grinned at him, nudging me under the table with her toes. I gave her the one-eyebrow. \"Yes? You wanted something?\" lift, as perfected by the man sitting across the table from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about dessert? The strudel here is really good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you. I don\u0027t want anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roxy, leave him alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Appetizer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glass of wine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t drink wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roxy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t sit here and eat my stuffed pork and dumplings if he\u0027s not going to eat anything!\" Roxy declared, frowning at Christian in a meaningful manner until he obediently transferred his attention to the menu. She turned back to Raphael and was going to bait him further, but I made the squinty eyes to end all squinty eyes at her, and for what was probably the first time in her life, she backed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geez, you guys don\u0027t have to look at me like that, I was just expressing a polite interest. Wasn\u0027t I expressing a polite interest, Joy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you were being obnoxious and pushy. You deserve to be snapped at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure, you take his side. No surprise there, considering you almost had your tongue down his throat a few minutes ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ROXY!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, here comes the waitress. Has everyone but Stretch here decided what they want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI prayed for an earthquake to open the earth up at my feet and swallow me whole. From the martyred look on Raphael\u0027s face, he was praying the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, do you live around here?\" Roxy asked Christian once we had placed our orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, his fingers tracing the rim of his wineglass. \"I do. About a kilometer west of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? What do you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roxanne!\" I slapped at her hand as she was about to snag the last bit of bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not polite to grill people. I told you almost everyone but Americans find it invasive to question them about their life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned her pixie grin at him. \"Sorry; didn\u0027t mean to be rude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled as he took the piece of bread she offered. Roxy turned to me with her eyebrows lowered. \"Am I allowed to talk about myself, or is that also rude?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot Raphael a \"what can I do with her?\" look. He lifted both eyebrows in return in a manner that seemed to suggest a gag might be effective. I was forced to agree he had a point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian laughed at Roxy\u0027s question, the warm sound rolling around the room and covering everything in a soft blanket of silk. \"I\u0027m not in the least bit offended by your questions, although I would much rather hear about what brings two such lovely women to a small corner of the Czech Republic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wild goose chase,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy ignored me. \"Have you ever heard of a local author named Dante?\" she asked Raphael and Christian. The former shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian frowned slightly as he toyed with his bread, rubbing crumbs off the crust. \"Yes, I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you might; he lives in this area,\" Roxy continued, digging through her sizeable purse for a copy of the book she was reading. \"He writes the most delicious books about Moravians - vampires, you know - and we\u0027re dying to meet him. The books are fabulous, utterly, utterly fabulous, with mysterious, dark, brooding heroes to die for. You really should read them - not that you\u0027d find the heroes to die for, since you\u0027re men, not unless you\u0027re... \" She glanced up at Christian and Raphael, then back down into her purse. \"You really should read them. There are twelve books out now, and there\u0027s supposed to be another one in a few months. Drat, I must have left the book in my room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian\u0027s brows rose as he looked from Roxy to myself. I gave him a five for effort - he was good, but he couldn\u0027t hold a candle to the Browmaster sitting opposite me. Raphael was leaning back in his chair, his arms crossed, a pained expression on his face. I couldn\u0027t figure out if he was bored with the conversation or the company. He certainly wasn\u0027t contributing much to the conversation. I wondered why, if he was so unhappy, he\u0027d agreed to sit with us; then I wondered why I cared. Just because I was the teensiest bit attracted to the man didn\u0027t mean I had to like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot a look at him from under my lashes. He watched me through half-closed eyes, his expression making blood rush to all sorts of interesting spots on my body. My question as to why he was bothering with us was answered by the interest that flared deep within the glittering slivers of amber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian listened as Roxy recapped the plot of the latest book, continuing to toy with what remained of his bread, looking a bit askance at Roxy\u0027s enthusiasm. Raphael glanced at his watch, which prompted me to shut Roxy up and turn the conversation to something that might interest him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t think they care about the books, Rox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the contrary,\" Raphael spoke up. \"I\u0027m finding it a fascinating look at what women feel are missing from their lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Missing? What do you mean, missing?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed a finger along his jaw, his lips donning an insufferably smug look. \"From what Roxy says, women are the primary readers of these books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they feature male characters who are dominant and aggressive, especially toward women?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re called alpha males, and what of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight smile quirked his lips. \"You needn\u0027t get so defensive; I was merely pointing out that books whose readership is predominantly female, featuring aggressive male characters and including what I assume are numerous scenes of a licentious nature - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Licentious?\" I gasped. How dare he say that about Dante\u0027s fabulous, romantic, sensual, erotic books?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet you\u0027re one of those men who likes to feel superior to women,\" Roxy said suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian turned a laugh into a cough. Raphael and I ignored both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - can only indicate that the books strike a chord with their readers, fulfilling a need, if you will, unmet in their everyday lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, look who has a psychology degree,\" I snorted, and damning the calories, slathered fresh butter on my piece of bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bristol University, 1992,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Sorry.\" I ate crow in the form of my bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\" Roxy shot him a squinty eyed glare. \"I think he\u0027s one of the alpha males he\u0027s so quick to damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell me, then,\" Raphael offered, leaning backward on the back legs of the chair, his hands locked behind his head, \"what it is you both find so attractive in these books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked between him and Christian, wondering if they were just humoring me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" the latter said, brushing bread crumbs from his shirt, and giving me an encouraging grin. I thought something flashed in his eyes, but it was quickly gone. \"I am just as interested as Raphael. Are the men such as you described the type to interest you, personally?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A man like one of Dante\u0027s heroes?\" Roxy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooooh,\" she squealed, \"yes! Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on your life,\" I answered at the same time. \"They\u0027re fun in fiction, but I imagine real alpha males are the absolute pits to live with. They\u0027ve got all those arrogance and domination issues, not to mention being obstinate, pigheaded, and determined to rule everyone\u0027s lives. Alpha males are not what women are looking for in a man.\" I smiled pointedly at Raphael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t listen to her, she\u0027s got no spirit. You have to understand, these heroes aren\u0027t just alpha males, they\u0027re Moravians. Dark Ones. Vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael rolled his eyes. Christian smiled, waiting until the waitress set down our meals before continuing. \"I would have thought most people would find vampirism an experience they would not wish to explore in any depth, let alone consider it an asset in a mate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re dead wrong there,\" Raphael said before Roxy could dispute Christian. \"I\u0027ve been with the GothFaire only four weeks, but they\u0027ve made a small fortune at each of their stops. Some people come for the bands they hire, others come for the novelty of a traveling fair, but most are young people who want to be a part of the Goth community.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goth?\" Christian asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It stands for Gothic, supposedly a society devoted to the dark side of life. Vampires, necromancers, morbid poetry and loud, grating music... anything that can be classified as strange and unusual. From what I\u0027ve seen, the stranger and more unusual a person or thing, the more successful it\u0027ll be at the fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poseurs,\" Roxy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dominic,\" I offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" he agreed with both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not believe that Dominic and company are what they claim, then?\" Christian asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael snorted in the negative, and sat upright again, glancing at his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how about you?\" Christian asked Roxy and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy watched Raphael closely for a minute. \"Well... Dominic might not be a vampire, but I do believe they exist. I\u0027m quite certain that Dante couldn\u0027t have made up the whole race of Moravians based on just a little folklore. There has to be some truth in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. And the lady who refuses to be mad? Are you a skeptic or a believer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blush crept up my cheeks as I told myself not to be annoyed. I had wanted them to stop pussyfooting around me, and Christian had done just that. I met his dark gaze and shrugged, unwilling to commit myself verbally. Despite the decision to do whatever it took to keep my mind from slipping away, I was having difficulty admitting out loud that I believed in something so extreme as vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some people might consider it foolish to view a vampire, these Dark Ones, as a source of entertainment,\" Christian commented to Roxy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if vampires really existed, they\u0027d be right,\" Raphael interrupted. \"You don\u0027t believe that Dominic is a real vampire, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian\u0027s eyes darkened. I wondered if it was easy to do. I made a mental note to practice in front of a mirror to see if I could do it. \"No. I believe he is merely playacting a role.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And not doing a very convincing job of it, either,\" I said wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree, but I\u0027m afraid others are not so clear-sighted. You have not seen the north meadow today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The north meadow? Oh, you mean the big open area beyond the hotel? No, we were off in the other direction today. Why? What\u0027s going on there?\" Roxy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People come to this area every year at this time. The Harvest Festival draws some of them to Brno, others come here for an All Hallow\u0027s Eve celebration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, we heard about that. The GothFaire is sponsoring a festival at Drahansk¨¢ Castle.\" She turned to Raphael for confirmation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at his watch again. \"It\u0027s a festival to celebrate the cult of the dead, as demonstrated by particularly loud forms of music, the overconsumption of alcohol, and the more popular attractions from the fair, all of it amounting to a security nightmare. And speaking of that, I must leave. We are expecting a significant increase in attendees tonight, and as you heard, my presence has been requested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up, nodded to us, and grabbing his jacket, headed out the door without a look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well!\" Roxy sniffed, then gave me a sympathetic look. \"I think you can do better, Joyful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resisted the urge to roll my eyes again. \"Will you give it up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned, then asked Christian if he wanted to join us at the fair that evening. \"It should be fun. There\u0027ll be lots of vampires to look at!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will there?\" he asked with a wry twist to his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure there will. You do believe in vampires, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both looked at him. He was poking at his goulash, but he looked up and gave us another of his nice smiles. \"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio - \u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too weird!\" Roxy interrupted. \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t mean to cut you off, but someone said that to Joy just a few weeks ago, and it seems odd you should repeat it now. Almost like it was a sign!\" She sent me a look that spoke volumes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sent her one that told her she was writing the wrong book. \"Yes, how very strange that an obscure and unknown author like Shakespeare might be quoted twice in a month Just let me make a note of the date and time. I\u0027ll want to include mention of this rare phenomenon in my diary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would be happy to join you at the fair tonight,\" Christian cut in before Roxy could respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fabulous!\" she crowed. \"Now, let me tell you the basic storylines of the twelve Book of Secrets volumes, so you\u0027ll know what to look for in Dark Ones when we\u0027re at the fair. First of all, vampires are always men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his eyebrows at that. \"Really? How interesting. Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy shrugged and stuffed a forkful of pork and cabbage in her mouth. \"Something to do with the manner of their punishment, I think,\" she said indistinctly. \"Anyway, they can\u0027t eat or drink anything but blood - it doesn\u0027t have to be human, though - they can\u0027t tolerate sunlight, of course, and they have great powers of mesmerism. They can also change their forms into animals, and are difficult to kill or wound. A Dark One can\u0027t ever become human again, but once he has completed the Joining with his Beloved, the woman who is his soul mate, he can do a lot more stuff like tolerate a little bit of sunlight. But the best part is that they\u0027re all, without exception, fantastic lovers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped frowning at my salad and gave her an exasperated look. \"Oh, for heaven\u0027s sake, Roxy - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they are!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dark Ones are fictional characters - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damned sexy fictional characters!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this Joining of which you spoke?\" Christian asked, mostly, I suspected, to keep the peace between Roxy and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved her fork at him as she chewed. \"That\u0027s really cool. There are seven steps to a successful Joining.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the small wooden clock on a shelf near the door. \"Roxy, it\u0027s almost six. We really should be going if you want to have maximum play time at the fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This won\u0027t take a minute. Christian\u0027s interested, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fascinated,\" he said, pushing his plate aside. I frowned at it for a minute. It was bare of all except a few pieces of garnish. He ate even faster than Roxy, and if she wasn\u0027t awarded the world\u0027s fastest eater title by the record-keeping people, it wasn\u0027t for lack of trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The seven steps are this: First, the Dark One marks the heroine as his own; second, he protects her from afar; third, he conducts the first exchange - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of body fluids,\" I interrupted. \"Such as blood, saliva, that sort of thing. I know it sounds icky, but I have to admit, the way Dante writes it, it\u0027s really not. Usually the first exchange is a really steamy kiss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - followed by the fourth step, where he entrusts the heroine with his life by giving her the means to destroy him; then there\u0027s the second exchange.\" Roxy wiggled her eyebrows at him. \"I\u0027ll let you guess what sorts of bodily fluids are exchanged there. The sixth step has the Dark One seeking the heroine\u0027s assistance to overcome his darker self, and finally, the last step is the ultimate exchange - their life-blood. The heroine redeems his dark soul by offering herself as a sacrifice so he can live. He doesn\u0027t let her die, of course, but it\u0027s all very romantic!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And utterly fictional,\" I muttered. Roxy didn\u0027t hear me, but Christian did. \"That\u0027s it, Rox, you\u0027re done. Eat your dumpling and let\u0027s get a move on. The fair is about to start, and you\u0027re boring Christian to tears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmm,\" Roxy said with a knowing smile, scarfing down the last of her dumpling. \"The fact that a certain hottie guy will be hanging around there has nothing to do with your desire to check it out, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up and grabbed my dearest friend in the whole wide world and muttered dire threats in her ear if she continued with that thread of conversation. She just stuck her nose in the air, and graciously allowed Christian to pay for our dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ran upstairs to collect our coats since the nights were starting to get cold. As I locked my hotel room behind me, I came to a fast decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rox,\" I said as she toddled out of her room. \"I want to tell you something, but I don\u0027t want you to freak out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me for a moment. \"Well, I\u0027ve seen you naked so I know you\u0027re not really a man. What\u0027s the problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat nervously and tried to think of how to say it without sounding any more deranged than I was feeling. \"You remember last night in the bar, when I got dizzy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, looking impatiently toward the stairs, taking my arm and trying to tug me in that direction. \"Yeah. You said it was because of the beer, not that you had a lot of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I said, reminding myself that she was my oldest and dearest friend, and if she wouldn\u0027t be understanding and supportive in my time of need, no one would, \"that wasn\u0027t exactly the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened and she stopped trying to shove me toward the stairs. \"Oh my God! You don\u0027t mean... Joy, why didn\u0027t you tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know quite how,\" I said miserably, playing with the buttons on my coat. \"It\u0027s not quite something I want everyone to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll say! Geez, this puts a whole new light on things, huh? When are you due?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Due?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The baby. When\u0027s it due? And what are you going to say to Bradley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smacked her on her arm. \"I\u0027m not pregnant, you boob!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" She looked a bit disappointed. \"If it\u0027s not a baby that made you feel faint, what was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a peek down the stairs to make sure no one was hovering just out of sight. \"I\u0027m having, for lack of a better word, visions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Visions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You ever had them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean visions of the Virgin Mary, that kind of vision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not that. My visions are about... a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooooh, now that sounds like my kind of vision! Is he naked? Are you? Are you touching each other? Does he have a really big package?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you drag your mind from the gutter for a moment while I\u0027m explaining to you how I\u0027m going stark, raving mad? Do you think you could do me the common courtesy of being WORRIED about the fact that I\u0027m having visions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she asked, her head tipped in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I gawked at her in disbelief. \"Why? WHY? You ask why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One why, not four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed her ear and peered in it. She tried to squirm away. \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI released her earlobe. \"Looking to see if I can see through to the other side. Did you not hear me? I\u0027m seeing visions! Visions! Strange, unexplained phenomena whereby I\u0027m possessed by the emotions and feelings and sights of someone else. In this case, I\u0027m feeling things from someone who\u0027s... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t bring myself to say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone who\u0027s what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A vampire,\" I mumbled, wishing now I hadn\u0027t brought the subject up. It was far better to go quietly insane on my own than to suffer the embarrassment of admitting I was being used by a creature whose existence I had long and vociferously denied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I couldn\u0027t hear you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A vampire,\" I said a bit more loudly, peeking at her from under lowered lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at me. Twice. \"OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made scrunched-up lips at her. \"OK? Is that it? I tell you - that\u0027s me we\u0027re talking about, the skeptical one - that I\u0027m having visions coming from a real, honest-to-goodness, card-carrying vampire, and all you can say is OK? You\u0027re not going to laugh or make fun of me or tell me I must be imagining it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Idiot!\" she said fondly, grabbing my sleeve and pulling me toward the stairs. \"It\u0027s because I know you that I know you must be going through hell experiencing something that\u0027s way beyond your control. Come on, Christian\u0027s waited long enough. Let\u0027s go see if we can\u0027t find the Dark One who\u0027s giving you all the trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute! You\u0027re not even going to question whether or not I\u0027m really having visions? I thought I was going insane before I decided to believe in them! The least you can do is appreciate how hard this is for me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know it\u0027s hard for you. I know you must be wigging out at it, and squirming with embarrassment because now you have to admit that I was right about vampires all along, but I\u0027ll save my gloating for later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How grateful I am for your tender mercies. That aside, how do you know that the one who is affecting me will be at the fair?\" I asked, following her down the stairs, more than a little befuddled by her quick acceptance of something that still gave me the willies to think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has to be,\" she called back over her shoulder. \"He\u0027s marked you. That\u0027s the first step in the Joining, and everyone knows they can\u0027t Join with you unless they\u0027re physically close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at my hands as we descended the second flight of stairs. \"I\u0027m not marked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what the visions are - his mark. If they\u0027re like what\u0027s described in the books, you\u0027re experiencing things that he sees and feels, basically all his strong emotions. Dark Ones can only do that with their true soul mate, so if he\u0027s projecting to you, that must mean he\u0027s marking you as his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly I thought of Raphael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many visions have you had?\" she asked as we rounded the landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm?\" I pulled my mind from the thoughts it was pursuing. \"Well, the one at Miranda\u0027s was due to the gin, I\u0027m sure, so that leaves me a couple last night in the bar, and one just before we had dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused and turned around to face me. \"You had one before dinner? When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was standing in the hall with Christian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christian?\" She thought for a minute, then shook her head. \"Nope, can\u0027t be; we\u0027ve seen him eat and drink. Hey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes met mine. A chill rippled down my back. I swallowed. \"Raphael.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last vision happened when Christian was kissing my hand. Raphael was standing in the doorway, watching us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool!\" she breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not,\" I snapped, pushing her to get her going. She stood where she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the first visions in the bar came, where was Raphael?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensation of blood flowing down my throat, subduing the hunger howling inside me flashed into mind. \"He was. uh... feeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened until I thought they\u0027d pop out. \"Oh, that is so cool! He shared his feeding with you? Wow! What did it feel like? What did he do? Could you see everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes for a minute and took a couple of deep breaths to rid myself of the remembered images. \"Yes, and I\u0027d really like not to remember it, if you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK.\" She thought for a moment. \"So you had a vision before Raphael came into the bar? Just before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, there\u0027s your answer!\" She started back down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute!\" I hurried after her. Christian was waiting for us at the door. \"Roxy, wait up - what do you mean, there\u0027s my answer? What answer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, Joy\u0027s having a bit of vampire trouble,\" she told Christian in a confidential tone that made me want to die right there on the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot surprisingly, he looked astonished by the news. \"Is she indeed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have to tell everyone?\" I hissed, pinching her arm, flashing a reassuring smile at Christian. He just looked at me with a faintly puzzled frown between his brows, no doubt trying to calculate how much trouble it would be to bundle me away to the local loony bin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s OK, Christian believes in vampires. Remember the \u0027more things in heaven and Earth, Horatio\u0027? Joy\u0027s having visions,\" she added. \"She\u0027s been marked by a Moravian. I was just explaining to her that it must be Raphael, since he refused to eat in front of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" I said, remembering something she\u0027d said that morning. \"You said just this morning that he couldn\u0027t be one because he had a beer at the bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" she said cannily, throwing open the door and charging out into the night. \"But did you actually see him drink the beer? Let\u0027s shake a leg, people. I want to examine Raphael up close. Imagine sitting next to him and not even knowing what he was!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed Christian by the hand and hauled him with me as I ran after Roxy. \"But what did you mean when you said something was the answer to my visions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped just beyond the stretch of graveled area that served as the hotel\u0027s parking lot. \"Think about it. You have visions seeing Raphael approaching the bar - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A man. I didn\u0027t see his face. It could be anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a condescending look. \"Hardly. OK, so you see this man approaching the bar, projecting his thoughts and feelings to you as he gets closer, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot a quick glance at Christian, realized I was still holding his hand, and dropped it with an apologetic moue. \"You must really think I\u0027m nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the contrary, I find this fascinating,\" he said. \"Who knew there were such dark depths to Raphael? He seemed like a perfectly ordinary man to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat set my hackles to rising a bit. \"He\u0027s anything but ordinary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows went up. \"Indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to hear this or not?\" Roxy interrupted. I nodded. \"Where was I? Oh, that\u0027s right. So, you\u0027re having these visions of what Raphael or whoever is seeing and doing as he approaches. Did it get worse just before he came in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again, my skin prickling with the remembered sensation of danger approaching. I frowned for a moment, examining that thought. Why was it that when Raphael approached the bar I felt danger drawing closer, but when he was angry with me earlier tonight I felt perfectly safe with him? I asked Roxy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy,\" she said, making an impatient gesture with her hands. \"He wasn\u0027t aware of you before he saw you, but he was afterwards. A Dark One would never harm their Beloved, you know that as well as I do. To get back to your visions - once he entered the bar and saw you, he must have recognized you for his soul mate, seen that you were picking up this thoughts, and closed them off to keep from distressing you further.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twisted my hands together as I thought it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makes sense, doesn\u0027t it?\" Roxy asked Christian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would appear to, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this evening... \" She shot an appraising glance at Christian. \"Dark Ones are notoriously jealous about their soul mates. I\u0027d suggest that in the future you keep your flirting with Joy to a minimum, unless you want to tangle with a really pissed-off vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a faint smile. \"That would, I admit, be a unique experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Any more questions? No? Good. Let\u0027s go, I want to check out the fair and see how many other vampires are there, and then we\u0027ll corner Raphael and get all the dirt from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will do nothing of the kind,\" I said firmly as I stalked behind her, Christian at my side. \"I\u0027m willing to concede, since the only other explanation is that I\u0027m going quite, quite mad, that I\u0027m having visions, and the visions\u0027 source is a vampire, but we don\u0027t know if it is Raphael or not. The poor man could simply be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hrmph,\" she snorted, slowing down until she was walking on the other side of Christian. \"How likely is it that there\u0027s another Dark One lurking about that you haven\u0027t seen? You said yourself that Dominic is fake, and he\u0027s the only other guy around here who fits the bill, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. Regardless, I don\u0027t want you saying anything to Raphael.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027re being stubborn. There\u0027s no other explanation that fits. What do you think?\" she asked Christian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised both hands in a gesture of neutrality. \"I believe I will leave this discussion to the experts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give you some of the Book of Secrets novels in the morning,\" she said. \"You read them. You\u0027ll see I\u0027m right. I\u0027m always right when it comes to Dark Ones!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes\u0027 walk away from the hotel was a wide, open meadow. The north end of it was given over to the GothFaire, a circle-shaped collection of trailers, small tents and wooden booths, and one large main tent structure at one end where the bands performed. It was strongly reminiscent of a small traveling circus, right down to the smell of stale smoke and popcorn. The south end of the field, empty when we had seen it the morning before, was starting to fill with individuals\u0027 tents, trucks, cars, and portable toilets. Beyond the tent city rose a dark line of trees marking the edge of a forest, through which a turret of Drahansk¨¢ Castle could be seen, the rest hidden by the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the game plan, Rox?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tarot card readings, Kirlian aura photos, palm and rune-stone readings - Arielle is doing those since their palm/ rune-stone reader left - spells and incantations... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds like one of those psychic fairs they set up down at the bingo hall,\" I protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is better. The GothFaire is run by real vampires, so you know everyone working for them must be the real thing, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why settle for imitation vampires when you can have the real thing?\" I teased, looking to Christian for sympathy. He just shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored Roxy\u0027s frown. \"OK, let\u0027s start at the top of your list. Who\u0027s doing the tarot card readings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tanya.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for warning me. I\u0027ll stay away from that booth. What about the aura photos?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done by a couple named Reynaldo and Demeter,\" she answered, reading the fair pamphlet that was pushed in our hands after we paid the admittance fee. \"Bet Reynaldo\u0027s a vampire. Oh, this sounds interesting! There\u0027s a woman who does past-life regressions. At eight, Dominic is doing his Magique Macabre show, and then at ten, the music starts. Tonight there\u0027s two bands - Six Inches of Slime is first, followed at eleven-thirty by a local band named Rychlovka.\" She looked up at Christian. \"What\u0027s that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe choked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That bad, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fear so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" I asked as Christian grabbed my elbow and steered me around a group of teenagers dripping in narrow chains, clunky shoes, and more black vinyl than you could shake a stick at. \"Is it a swear word? If I get really annoyed with Roxy, can I snap out \u0027rychlovka\u0027 at her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"It is not a word of swearing, no. It means to engage in a quick sexual act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rats. I guess I\u0027ll just have to make do with do prdele\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe choked again. I grinned and looked when Roxy pointed to a small black tent with a crowd gathered around it. \"What\u0027s over there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd parted as we approached. One of the vinyl-clad teens was doubled over a bucket. I glanced up to a sign hanging on the tent behind them. \"Piercings. Remind me to avoid this tent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and me both, sister,\" Roxy said with a dark look at the ralphing teen. She turned her attention back to the pamphlet. \"Hey, this sounds like it\u0027ll be right up our alley - a Dungeon Room! Interesting, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a face at her suggestion and continued what I\u0027d been doing ever since we had arrived - scanning the crowds for a tall, handsome man with unnatural amber eyes, and what I feared were even more unnatural dining habits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dungeons, I have found,\" Christian spoke up in a voice that was as smooth as milk chocolate, \"do not in general meet the expectations one has of them. What do you suppose is the attraction in this particular dungeon room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um... let me see if it tells.\" Roxy flipped over the pamphlet. \"It just says \u0027Enter the Shadoworld and fulfill your dark destiny.\u0027 What do you think that means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped peering around the crowds long enough to grin at her. \"I think it means you\u0027d better stay away from it unless you want to experience the sting of the lash on your tender little flesh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have bondage on the brain.\" She tucked the flyer away and clutched Christian\u0027s arm, giving him one of her impish grins. \"I bet Christian isn\u0027t afraid of a little dark destiny. You\u0027ll go with me to the dungeon room, won\u0027t you? Joy, as you can plainly see, is too much of a poop to have a little fun in a dungeon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, go ahead.\" I shooed them toward the blood-red tent that loomed ahead of us. \"I\u0027ll go have Arielle read the runes for me while you\u0027re frolicking in the Merry Widow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy rolled her eyes and pulled Christian toward the red tent. \"That\u0027s Iron Maiden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not frolic in an Iron Maiden,\" Christian protested. \"In it there will be no room for the dancing or the Maypole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy stopped and stared at him for a minute. I giggled. He smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back to me. \"Just remember that you can\u0027t let Raphael take the third step of Joining until I\u0027m there to watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The third step?\" What was she talking about? \"What happened to the second step?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped Christian\u0027s hand and with a big, exaggerated sigh hurried over to where I stood, counting on her fingers as she said, \"The first step is the mark, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. You say that\u0027s the visions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who knows Dante\u0027s books better than anyone else on this whole planet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do,\" I acknowledged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Trust me, the visions are his mark, the first step. The second step is - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protection from afar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. And who was it who grabbed Dominic and slammed him up against the wall with one hand when he was about to bite your wrist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well - that wasn\u0027t protection from afar, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afar, a-near, same difference,\" she shrugged. \"It was protection, and that\u0027s all that matters. And if I hadn\u0027t interrupted you, he\u0027d probably have taken the third step.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory of his body pressed against mine was not one I\u0027d dismissed. I\u0027d carried it around, tucked away in a corner of my mind like a little treasure, something I could bring out and examine in private. I said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just promise me he doesn\u0027t lock lips with you until I\u0027m around to see it, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go. Away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned and dashed back to Christian, grabbing his hand and hauling him to the Dungeon Room tent. He sent me a pitiful look over his shoulder. I blew him a kiss. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-girl-s-guide-to-vampires-dark-ones-1/page-6.html","bookId":2190,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:56 PM"}
