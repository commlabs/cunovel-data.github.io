{"id":88057,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, this was her special turf. She\u0027d spent her life here, right here, in the French Quarter. If there was a story out there, she\u0027d heard it. The history of the city was something she could recite in her sleep. And she loved it. Funny, that made her think of Andy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she\u0027d first met the girl, her friend had been amazed that she still loved living in New Orleans. In fact, she\u0027d burst into laughter when Nikki had urged her to tell her why she was grinning like an imp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just… well, you\u0027re not a drinker. And it seems you always want to go somewhere without crowds… so, why live in and love New Orleans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question had startled Nikki. \"It\u0027s home. It\u0027s all I know. And, okay, so I\u0027m not a big boozer. I love jazz! I love the artists on the street, and the performers… and even the people who pass through!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What on earth do you do during Mardi Gras?\" Andy had demanded, still laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Visit friends in Biloxi,\" she said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true. There were always tourists in New Orleans. She liked tourists. She just didn\u0027t like the melee that came along with Mardi Gras in New Orleans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she thought, yawning and stretching, she would stay in New Orleans for Mardi Gras next year. They all wanted a party. She\u0027d do it—for Andy, and the others, as well, she figured. Julian was Mr. Party himself, a good friend, and she loved him—even if she was ready to clobber him right now. She\u0027d known him her whole life, and he\u0027d taken the job when she\u0027d asked him on Max\u0027s behalf because of her, not because he\u0027d originally thought they could really do something new and special. He was wickedly tall and good looking, and great at this work, even if he was overly dramatic. Didn\u0027t matter—those who went on the ghost walk with him were always thrilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, this year, she\u0027d have a party. Patricia, who had grown up not too far away, in Cajun country, longed to have a really good Mardi Gras party, too. She\u0027d grown up close—but far enough away so that she longed to be part of the real heart of the celebration, too—from the above-the-vomit line, as she called it. Mitch, of course, was from Pittsburgh, and he was dying to get into the dead center of it all. As he had told Patricia, he didn\u0027t care what evils lurked on the street; he wanted to see it all. Of course, he\u0027d prefer a nice party place, but…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan was more like her. He was shy, except with friends, unless he was on, and then, like Julian, he was on. Now, he was madly in love with Patricia, and he was comfortable with their close group of workers. Though Nikki was certain Nathan would just as soon head for Biloxi during Mardi Gras, too, he would want a party because Patricia would want a party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, of course, it would be an important time for them to be working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were doing so well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki felt a real sense of pride—despite her pounding headache. A lot of the time, tourists thought that costumes and makeup on tour guides was just schmaltz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot so with their group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were good. They knew their subject matter. They could answer questions. They didn\u0027t just give a tour—they were an event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd though the whole thing had been created through Max\u0027s plan, vision—and money—Nikki felt as if it were her own dream child finding real fruition. She had been there with Max at the very beginning, when there had been just the two of them, working hard, footing it all over the place by herself. Befriending the concierge staff at the hotels, begging store managers for flyer space. She had been the one to give the free tours to travel agents, thanking God that Max had saved up enough to be able to bring the people in. After the first go, Max had told her to bring Julian in. He hadn\u0027t been convinced that he\u0027d ever really get a substantial income from the enterprise, but he\u0027d been willing to take a chance because she was so impassioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was a total ham.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had begun to thrive, and so, Max had told her to increase the program, and the staff. She had found the others later—they\u0027d had to \"audition,\" bom for historical accuracy, and for their ability to tell a damned good and eerie story without getting into outright lies. No one in their group ever said that such things as vampires, ghosts, or any other metaphysical creature existed. They told the stories that had been told. The legends. They were still known as the \"ghost\" walk, though officially, me company was called \"Myths and Legends of New Orleans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki ran her fingers through her hair, trying to let it dry in the breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA newspaper came flying over the brick wall. The newsboy—late as he was!—had cast it over the brick with amazing accuracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt landed in front of her. Staring down at the headline, she let out a sigh. There were two pictures on the front page. One of the statelier Harold Grant and one of the more charismatic Billy Banks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy Banks,\" she muttered aloud. \"Who the hell votes for a guy named Billy Banks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she leaned down to pick up the paper, she heard the front gate opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it did, she felt a vicious cold sweep through her, as if an arctic blast had suddenly hit her entire bloodstream. Her breath caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sense of foreboding… It was coming true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, remnants of her dream flashing through her mind\u0027s eye like a chaotic movie trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew, though he was in plainclothes, that the man who approached her was a policeman, and that he was about to tell her something terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up, her mouth working, no words coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You—you\u0027re a cop. Something\u0027s happened,\" she finally gasped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer nodded. He cleared his throat. \"I\u0027m Detective Massey, Owen Massey, Miss DuMonde.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki stared at him, hating the wave of knowledge that filled her, muscles constricting as she denied everything rushing into her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no… there\u0027s a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone is… hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here about Miss Ciello, Miss Andrea Ciello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked helpless—big, kind and helpless. Cops like him must have to give people bad news all the time, but it looked as if it had never gotten easy for this guy. \"We were referred to you. A Mrs. Montobello is the one who called us… insisted we go in, swore that Miss Ciello would have come to see her first thing in the morning. She said that you were Miss Ciello\u0027s best friend? I\u0027m sorry, so sorry. I wish there were an easier way to do this. Um… should we go inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happened? Tell me what\u0027s happened!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Talk to me, tell me, what\u0027s happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Overdose, I\u0027m afraid. We believe it was accidental, but you know, we have to go through procedure… The thing is, we need someone to make a formal identification of the body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Body?\" Nikki gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m afraid—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Nikki stared at him in disbelief. No. It had to be an elaborate joke. Andy—vivacious, fun-loving, rowdy Andy—couldn\u0027t be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m truly sorry. It appears that she—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy was clean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure she wanted to be clean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! She was clean.\" Nikki realized that she was backing away from the man, denying everything that he was saying. But it couldn\u0027t be true. \"She was clean. She knew not to touch the stuff. It\u0027s impossible that she did this to herself. It\u0027s impossible that… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut from the way he was looking at her, she knew it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as the dream had been true. She wanted to black out; she wanted the world to go away. Yes, she had always had a sense of the past, of spirits that remained, but never, never, had she felt… seen… anything like…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night. Andy had been dead. Or dying. And she had come to Nikki for help. She had failed her friend somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head again. Her words were fierce. \"Andrea Ciello was off drugs. I know it. If something\u0027s happened to Andy, it was not self-inflicted, and it was not accidental. She was murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurdered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer was staring at her, troubled, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you, she was clean. And if you don\u0027t believe me, I\u0027ll raise a stink in this parish that you won\u0027t believe. She can\u0027t be… oh, God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. This was impossible. She was still dreaming. Imagining this cop just the way she\u0027d imagined Andy last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Miss DuMonde. Look, is there someone I can call? Are your folks here… a sister, brother, friend?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored him, shaking her head, anger keeping her standing. \"She did not overdose. If she had drugs in her system, someone else put them there. I am going to demand an investigation. I want to see a homicide officer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I handle homicide cases,\" he said gently. \"We have to look into any death that\u0027s questionable in any way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" She stared at him anew, heart racing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t a natural death,\" he said. \"So they call us in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time was she killed?\" Nikki managed to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time did she die?\" he countered gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please. Yes, whatever. What time—did she die?\" Nikki gasped out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detective looked wary, as if he wasn\u0027t sure why that information should be so pertinent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ME only had an estimate, but it would have been right around 4:00 a.m.,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out, grasping for a railing… for help… for something that wasn\u0027t there. Too late, the detective realized what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki crashed down on the porch as the world faded before her, Andy\u0027s words suddenly echoing in her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" the taxi driver told Brent as they slowed to a near halt on entering the French Quarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" Brent told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was usually a slow process, maneuvering the tourist-filled streets. Delivery vans could block a narrow byway, and any little snarl could close things off, though in the tight confines of the place—with many streets blocked off for pedestrian traffic only—most people preferred to walk. Still, vehicles were sometimes necessary, and delays were just a fact of life. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-8.html","bookId":2268,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
