You of all people should see the potential of this choice. Isn\u0027t this what you want?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even as I tried to look at the happy ending, I couldn\u0027t escape the horror of this choice. This was the secret I should die to protect. The information I\u0027d been desperate to keep safe no matter what hideous torture I was put through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not the kind of torture I\u0027d expected: a personal crisis of conscience, confused and complicated by love for my human family. Very painful, nevertheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not claim to be an expatriate if I did this. No, I would be purely a traitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot for her, Wanda! Not for her! Mel howled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I wait? Wait until they catch another soul? An innocent soul whom I have no reason to hate? I\u0027ll have to make the decision sometime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot now! Wait! Think about this!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach rolled again, and I had to hunch my body forward and take a deep breath. I just managed not to gag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda?\" Jeb called in concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could do it, Mel. I could justify letting her die if she was one of those innocent souls. I could let them kill her then. I could trust myself to make an objective decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she\u0027s horrible, Wanda! We hate her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExactly. And I can\u0027t trust myself. Look at how I almost didn\u0027t see the answer...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda, you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seeker glared past me, toward Jeb\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, Jeb,\" I gasped. My voice was breathy, strained. I was surprised at how bad it sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seeker\u0027s dark eyes flickered between us, unsure. Then she recoiled from me, cringing into the wall. I recognized the pose-remembered exactly how it felt to hold it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gentle hand came down on my shoulder and spun me around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on with you, hon?\" Jeb asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a minute,\" I told him breathlessly. I looked straight into his faded-denim eyes and told him something that was most definitely not a lie. \"I have one more question. But I really need a minute to myself. Can you... wait for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, we can wait a little while more. Take a breather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and walked as quickly as I could from the prison. My legs were stiff with terror at first, but I found my stride as I moved. By the time I passed Aaron and Brandt, I was almost running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" I heard Aaron whisper to Brandt, his voice bewildered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure where to hide while I thought. My feet, like a shuttle on automatic pilot, took me through the corridors toward my sleeping room. I could only hope that it would be empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dark, barely any light from the stars trickling down through the cracked ceiling. I didn\u0027t see Lily till I tripped over her in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost didn\u0027t recognize her tear-swollen face. She was curled into a tight, tiny ball on the floor in the middle of the passageway. Her eyes were wide, not quite comprehending who I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her wordlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said that life and love go on. But why do they? They shouldn\u0027t. Not anymore. What\u0027s the point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Lily. I\u0027m not sure what the point is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she asked again, not speaking to me anymore. Her glassy eyes looked right through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped carefully past her and hurried to my room. I had my own question that had to be answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my great relief, the room was empty. I threw myself facedown on the mattress where Jamie and I slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027d told Jeb I had one more question, that was the truth. But the question was not for the Seeker. The question was for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question was would I-not could I-do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could save the Seeker\u0027s life. I knew how. It would not endanger any of the lives here. Except my own. I would have to trade that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Melanie tried to be firm through her panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease let me think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the thing, Mel. It\u0027s inevitable anyway. I can see that now. I should have seen it long ago. It\u0027s so obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it isn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered our conversation when Jamie was ill. When we were making up. I\u0027d told her that I wouldn\u0027t erase her and that I was sorry that I couldn\u0027t give her more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t so much a lie as it was an unfinished sentence. I couldn\u0027t give her more than that-and stay alive myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe actual lie had been given to Jared. I\u0027d told him, just seconds later, that I didn\u0027t know how to make myself not exist. In the context of our discussion, it was true. I didn\u0027t know how to fade away, here inside Melanie. But I was surprised I hadn\u0027t heard the obvious lie right then, hadn\u0027t seen in that moment what I was seeing now. Of course I knew how to make myself not exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just that I had never considered that option viable, ultimate betrayal that it was to every soul on this planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the humans knew that I had this answer, the one they had murdered for over and over again, it would cost me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Wanda!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t you want to be free?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn\u0027t ask you for this, she finally said. And I wouldn\u0027t do it for you. And I sure as hell wouldn\u0027t do it for the Seeker!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t have to ask. I think I might have volunteered... eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do you think that? she demanded, her tone close to a sob. It touched me. I expected her to be elated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn part because of them. Jared and Jamie. I can give them the whole world, everything they want. I can give them you. I probably would have realized that... someday. Who knows? Maybe Jared would have asked. You know I wouldn\u0027t have said no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan\u0027s right. You\u0027re too self-sacrificing. You don\u0027t have any limits. You need limits, Wanda!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, Ian, I moaned. A new pain twisted through me, surprisingly close to my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll take the whole world away from him. Everything he wants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would never work with Ian. Not in this body, even though he loves it. It doesn\u0027t love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanda, I... Melanie struggled for words. Still, the joy I expected from her did not come. Again, this touched me. I don\u0027t think I can let you do this. You\u0027re more important than that. In the bigger picture, you are of much more value to them than I am. You can help them; you can save them. I can\u0027t do any of that. You have to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t see any other way, Mel. I wonder how I didn\u0027t see it sooner. It seems so completely obvious. Of course I have to go. Of course I have to give you yourself back. I already knew we souls were wrong to come here. So I don\u0027t have any choice now but to do the right thing, and leave. You all survived without me before; you\u0027ll do it again. You\u0027ve learned so much about the souls from me-you\u0027ll help them. Can\u0027t you see? This is the happy ending. It\u0027s the way they all need the story to finish. I can give them hope. I can give them... not a future. Maybe not that. But as much as I can. Everything I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Wanda, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was crying, becoming incoherent. Her sorrow brought tears to my eyes. I\u0027d no idea that she cared so much for me. Almost as much as I cared for her. I hadn\u0027t realized that we loved each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if Jared had never asked me for this, even if Jared did not exist... Once this path had occurred to me, I would have had to proceed down it. I loved her that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder the success rate for resistant hosts was so low here on Earth. Once we learned to love our human host, what hope did we souls have? We could not exist at the expense of one we loved. Not a soul. A soul could not live that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled myself over and, in the starlight, I looked at my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands were dirty and scratched, but under the surface blemishes, they were beautiful. The skin was a pretty sun-browned color; even bleached in the pale light, it was pretty. The nails were chewed short but still healthy and smooth, with little half moons of white at the bases. I fluttered my fingers, watching the muscles pull the bones in graceful patterns. I let them dance above me, where they became black fluid shapes against the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran them through my hair. It was almost to my shoulders now. Mel would like that. After a few weeks of shampoo in hotel showers and Health vitamins, it was glossy and soft again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretched my arms out as far as they would go, tugging against the tendons until some of my joints cracked. My arms felt strong. They could pull me up a mountainside, they could carry a heavy load, they could plow a field. But they were also soft. They could hold a child, they could comfort a friend, they could love... but that was not for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, and tears welled out of the corners of my eyes and rolled down my temples into my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tensed the muscles in my legs, felt their ready strength and speed. I wanted to run, to have an open field that I could race across just to see how fast I could go. I wanted to do this barefoot, so I could feel the earth beneath my feet. I wanted to feel the wind fly through my hair. I wanted it to rain, so that I could smell it in the air as I ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet flexed and pointed slowly, to the rhythm of my breathing. In and out. Flex and point. It felt nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI traced my face with my fingertips. They were warm on my skin, skin that was smooth and pretty. I was glad I was giving Melanie her face back the way it had been. I closed my eyes and stroked my eyelids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d lived in so many bodies, but never one I loved like this. Never one that I craved in this way. Of course, this would be the one I\u0027d have to give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe irony made me laugh, and I concentrated on the feel of the air that popped in little bubbles from my chest and up through my throat. Laughter was like a fresh breeze-it cleaned its way through the body, making everything feel good. Did other species have such a simple healer? I couldn\u0027t remember one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touched my lips and remembered how it felt to kiss Jared, and how it felt to kiss Ian. Not everyone got to kiss so many other beautiful bodies. I\u0027d had more than some, even in this short time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just so short! Maybe a year now, I wasn\u0027t completely sure. Just one quick revolution of a blue green planet around an unexceptional yellow star. The shortest life of any I\u0027d ever lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shortest, the most important, the most heartbreaking of lives. The life that would forever define me. The life that had finally tied me to one star, to one planet, to one small family of strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little more time... would that be so wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Mel whispered. Just take a little more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou never know how much time you\u0027ll have, I whispered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I did. I knew exactly how much time I had. I couldn\u0027t take any more time. My time was up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going anyway. I had to do the right thing, be my true self, with what time I had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh that seemed to come all the way from the soles of my feet and the palms of my hands, I got up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAaron and Brandt wouldn\u0027t wait forever. And now I had a few more questions that I needed answered. This time, the questions were for Doc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe caves were full of sad, cast-down eyes. It was easy enough to slip unobtrusively past them all. No one cared what I was doing right now, except maybe Jeb, Brandt, and Aaron, and they weren\u0027t here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have an open, rainy field, but at least I had the long south tunnel. It was too dark to run flat out the way I wanted, but I kept up a steady jog. It felt good as my muscles warmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expected I would find Doc already there, but I\u0027d wait if I had to. He would be alone. Poor Doc, that was usually the case now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc had been sleeping alone in his hospital since the night we\u0027d saved Jamie\u0027s life. Sharon had taken her things from their room and moved them to her mother\u0027s, and Doc wouldn\u0027t sleep in the empty room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a great hatred. Sharon would rather kill her own happiness, and Doc\u0027s, too, than forgive him for helping me heal Jamie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharon and Maggie were barely a presence in the caves anymore. They looked past everyone now, the way they used to look past only me. I wondered if that would change when I was gone, or if they were both so rigid in their grudge that it would be too late for them to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat an extraordinarily stupid way to waste time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time ever, the south tunnel felt short. Before I thought I\u0027d gone halfway, I could see Doc\u0027s light glowing dimly from the rough arch ahead. He was home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowed myself to a walk before I interrupted him. I didn\u0027t want to scare him, to make him think there was an emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still startled when I appeared, a little breathless, in the stone doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jumped up from behind his desk. The book he was reading fell out of his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda? Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Doc,\" I reassured him. \"Everything\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does someone need me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just me.\" I gave him a weak smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked around his desk to meet me, his eyes wide with curiosity. He paused half a step away and raised one eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis long face was gentle, the opposite of alarming. It was hard to remember how he\u0027d looked like a monster to me before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a man of your word,\" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and opened his mouth to speak, but I held one hand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one will ever test that more than I will test it now,\" I warned him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, eyes confused and wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, felt it expand my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know how to do what you\u0027ve been ending so many lives to discover. I know how to take the souls from your bodies without harm to either. Of course I know that. We all have to, in case of an emergency. I even performed the emergency procedure once, when I was a Bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, waiting for his response. It took him a long moment, and his eyes grew wilder every second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you telling me this?\" he finally gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I... I am going to give you the knowledge you need.\" I held up my hand again. \"But only if you will give me what I want in return. I\u0027m warning you right now, it won\u0027t be any easier for you to give me what I want than it will be for me to give you what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was fiercer than I\u0027d ever seen it. \"Name your terms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t kill them-the souls you remove. You must give me your word-your promise, your oath, your vow-that you will give them safe conduct on to another life. This means some danger; you will have to have cryotanks, and you will have to get those souls onto shuttles off-planet. You have to send them to another world to live. But they won\u0027t be able to hurt you. By the time they reach their next planet, your grandchildren will be dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould my conditions mitigate my guilt in this? Only if Doc could be trusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was thinking very hard as I explained. I watched his face to see what he would make of my demand. He didn\u0027t look angry, but his eyes were still wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want us to kill the Seeker?\" he guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer his question because he wouldn\u0027t understand the answer; I did want them to kill her. That was the whole problem. Instead, I explained further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll be the first, the test. I want to make sure, while I\u0027m still here, that you\u0027re going to follow through. I will do the separation myself. When she is safe, I\u0027ll teach you how it\u0027s done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kidnapped souls. The same as before. I can\u0027t guarantee you that the human minds will come back. I don\u0027t know if the erased can return. We\u0027ll see with the Seeker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc blinked, processing something. \"What do you mean, while you are still here? Are you leaving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, waiting for the realization to hit. He stared back, uncomprehending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you realize what I\u0027m giving you?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, comprehension slammed home in his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spoke quickly, before he could. \"There\u0027s something else I\u0027m going to ask you for, Doc. I don\u0027t want to... I won\u0027t be shipped off to another planet. This is my planet, it truly is. And yet, there\u0027s really no place for me here. So... I know it might... offend some of the others. Don\u0027t tell them if you think they won\u0027t allow it. Lie if you have to. But I\u0027d like to be buried by Walt and Wes. Can you do that for me? I won\u0027t take up much space.\" I smiled weakly again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Melanie was howling. No, no, no, no...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Wanda,\" Doc objected, too, with a shocked expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Doc,\" I whispered, wincing against the protest in my head, which was getting louder. \"I don\u0027t think Wes or Walt will mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I meant! I can\u0027t kill you, Wanda. Ugh! I\u0027m so sick of death, so sick of killing my friends.\" Doc\u0027s voice caught in a sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand on his thin arm, rubbed it. \"People die here. It happens.\" Kyle had said something to that effect. Funny that I should quote Kyle of all people twice in one night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Jared and Jamie?\" Doc asked in a choked voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll have Melanie. They\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough my teeth. \"Better off without me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc shook his head, wiping at his eyes. \"I need to think about this, Wanda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have long. They won\u0027t wait forever before they kill the Seeker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mean about that part. I agree to those terms. But I don\u0027t think I can kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all or none, Doc. You have to decide right now. And...\" I realized I had one more demand. \"And you can\u0027t tell anyone else about the last part of our agreement. No one. Those are my terms, take them or leave them. Do you want to know how to remove a soul from a human body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc shook his head again. \"Let me think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already know the answer, Doc. This is what you\u0027ve been searching for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just kept shaking his head slowly back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored that symbol of denial because we both knew his choice was made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get Jared,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll make a quick raid for cryotanks. Hold off the others. Tell them... tell them the truth. Tell them I\u0027m going to help you get the Seeker out of that body.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-51.html","bookId":2029,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM"}
