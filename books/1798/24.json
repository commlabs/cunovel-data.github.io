Only you,” he says earnestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we just met…” Shit. Yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m always three steps ahead. It’s how I’m so good at my job, and I find with you I try to be even further ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what to say to that, so I just look down at the dress. It’s a simple navy-blue halter dress. I own a few like it. Checking the tag, I see that not only is it my size but it’s from my favorite store. I find I’m inclined to believe him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Again, don’t thank me for taking care of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a habit. And it’s the polite thing to do,” I counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright. How about when you want to thank me, you do it by telling me you’re mine or how much you want me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start laughing because that’s ridiculous, but the look on his face says he’s not joking. It makes me laugh even harder, and his brow furrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cracks a smile at me and lunges at me, scattering the clothes to the floor. I try to dodge him, but he’s quicker and he throws me onto the bed. I go to scramble away, still laughing, but again he’s much faster than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis starts tickling me, making me laugh even harder, my whole body shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, I can’t take anymore!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe keeps tickling me as both of us roll around and I try to get away from him. A clearly impossible task. I can’t remember the last time I laughed so hard. Maybe never. Definitely not since I lost my grandma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m yours! Totally yours! I swear it!” I finally scream, and he stops instantly. His big arms wrap around my body. It’s then I notice how we’re both naked again, his towel having been lost in his tickle attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kiss me,” I say breathlessly. And he does, his mouth coming down on mine. After just a second, he pulls away too quickly, jumping off the bed and placing a good amount of distance between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop trying to seduce me, little fox.” He leans down, picking up the clothes he dropped. I take the chance to roll to my side, propping my head in my hand to enjoy the view. His tattoos cover not only his arms but most of his chest, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like the view?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think anyone would.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not asking anyone. Don’t care what anyone thinks but you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like is putting it mildly.” I use the same words he used for me earlier, making him smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s really good, baby, because this is the only naked man you’ll have for the rest of your life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again I’m struck speechless. The man can’t go five minutes without reminding me I’m his and I’m going nowhere. He’s definitely making sure I know by the end of the weekend I’m his. Hell, I might already be there. There’s no reason for him to put on some show. I’m here and not going anywhere until he asks, and I’m starting to think he won’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now I’m going to get dressed in the other room and start your breakfast, because I’m about to pounce on your sweet ass and I’ll never get you fed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks out the room, giving me his ass to watch as he exits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll onto my back, looking up at the ceiling of the warehouse that has been turned into an apartment. Maybe it’s a condo. I’m not really sure what it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost feel like I’m dreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot wanting to lie here and start second-guessing stuff, I pull myself from the bed and slip on the dress. I look around and spot my bag in the corner of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you, Harper. That might be the first time I actually mean it when it comes to her. I pull my stuff out and use the bathroom to get ready for the day. I put on some light make-up, brush my teeth, and pull my hair into a ponytail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop and study myself in the mirror. Even after getting ready, I still look well loved. My lips are a little swollen, and I swear I’m almost glowing. I can still feel the marks Sean’s beard left on the insides of my thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder Harper was always doing the sex, because this is amazing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the smell of bacon, I make my way through the warehouse slowly, taking it in as I go, wanting to learn more about Sean because I don’t really know much. Except that he’s crazy good with his mouth. In all ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere isn’t much to the place. Everything is really bare and furnished with just the essentials. The walls are brick and stark. There are no decorations of any kind—no paintings, no photos, no ornaments. Simple black furniture and nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many pancakes, baby?” I pull my eyes over to the kitchen where Sean is watching me. He’s got on a pair of jeans but has yet to put on a shirt. His body is really a piece of art. He’s broadly built, but it looks natural. It doesn’t seem like he spends hours in the gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A few should be good.” He goes to pouring the batter into the skillet before flipping the bacon. I move towards him, taking a seat at the breakfast bar. It looks like the area that should be the dining room is also empty. No table or anything. Just the breakfast bar to eat at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kind of bare around here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a simple man.” He turns to look at me from the stove. “The new place you can do up however you like. I seem to want a home now. This is just a place I sleep. I didn’t need or want more from it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“New place? You’re moving?” I don’t ask about him wanting me to decorate his place. I’ll leave that one for now. Or why he suddenly wants a home and not just a place to lay his head. The way he says it made it pretty clear I was the reason for that. It makes my insides warm, but I don’t want to read too much into it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thief-breeding-3/page-24.html","bookId":1798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:25 PM"}
