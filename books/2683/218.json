Another young man keeps shouting \"Mom Mom Mom\" until part of the fuselage flies backward, pinning him to his seat and ripping him in half, but he just goes into shock and doesn\u0027t die until the plane smashes haphazardly into the forest below and the dying comes in waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the business section everyone is soaked with blood, someone\u0027s head is completely encased with intestines that flew out of what\u0027s left of the woman sitting two rows in front of him and people are screaming and crying uncontrollably, wailing with grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dying are lashed with jet fuel as it starts spraying into the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne row is sprayed with the blood and viscera of the passengers in the row before them, who have been sliced in two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother row is decapitated by a huge sheet of flying aluminum, and blood keeps whirling throughout the cabin everywhere, mixing in with the jet fuel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fuel unleashes something, forces the passengers to comprehend a simple fact: that they have to let people go-mothers and sons, parents and children, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives-and that dying is inevitable in what could be a matter of seconds. They realize there is no hope. But understanding this horrible death just stretches the seconds out longer as they try to prepare for it-people still alive being flung around the aircraft falling to earth, screaming and vomiting and crying involuntarily, bodies contorted while they brace themselves, heads bowed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why me?\" someone wonders uselessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA leg is caught in a tangle of metal and wires and it waves wildly in the air as the plane continues to drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the three Camden graduates aboard the 747-Amanda Taylor (\u002786), Stephanie Meyers (\u002787) and Susan Goldman (\u002786)-Amanda is killed first when she\u0027s struck by a beam that crashes through the ceiling of the plane, her son reaching out to her as he\u0027s lifted out of his seat into the air, his arms outstretched as his head mercifully smashes against an overhead bin in the craft, killing him instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan Goldman, who has cervical cancer, is partly thankful as she braces herself but changes her mind as she\u0027s sprayed with burning jet fuel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane ignites and a huge wave of people die by inhaling flames, their mouths and throats and lungs charred black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some, a minute of falling while still conscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnto a forest situated just seventy miles outside Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soft sounds of bodies imploding, torn apart on impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA massive section of the fuselage lands and because of an emergency backup system, all the lights in the plane continue flickering as a hail of glowing ash rains down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bodies lie clustered in clumps. Some-but very few-of the passengers have no marks on them, even though all their bones have been broken. Some passengers have been crushed to half or a third or even a quarter of their normal size. One man has been so compressed he resembles some kind of human bag, a shape with a vague head attached to it, the face pushed in and stark white. Other passengers have been mutilated by shrapnel, some so mangled that men and women become indistinguishable, all of them naked, their clothes blown off on the downward fall, some of them flash-burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the smell of rot is everywhere-coming off dismembered feet and arms and legs and torsos propped upright, off piles of intestines and crushed skulls, and the heads that are intact have screams etched across their faces. And the trees that don\u0027t burn will have to be felled to extract airplane pieces and to recover the body parts that ornament them, yellow strings of fatty tissue draped over branches, a macabre tinsel. Stephanie Meyers is still strapped in her seat, which hangs from one of those trees, her eyeballs burned out of their sockets. And since a cargo of party confetti and gold glitter-two tons of it-were being transported to America, millions of tiny dots of purple and green and pink and orange paper cascade over the carnage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what makes up the forest now: thousands of steel rivets, the unbroken door of the plane, a row of cabin windows, huge sheets of insulation, life jackets, giant clumps of wiring, rows of empty seat cushions-belts still fastened-shredded and covered with blood and matted with viscera, and some of the seat backs have passengers\u0027 impressions burned into them. Dogs and cats lie crushed in their kennels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason the majority of passengers on this flight were under thirty, and the debris reflects this: cell phones and laptops and Ray-Ban sunglasses and baseball caps and pairs of Rollerblades tied together and camcorders and mangled guitars and hundreds of CDs and fashion magazines (including the YouthQuake with Victor Ward on the cover) and entire wardrobes of Calvin Klein and Armani and Ralph Lauren hang from burning trees and there\u0027s a teddy bear soaked with blood and a Bible and various Nintendo games along with rolls of toilet paper and shoulder bags and engagement rings and pens and belts whipped off waists and Prada purses still clasped and boxes of Calvin Klein boxer-briefs and so many clothes from the Gap contaminated with blood and other body fluids and everything reeks of aviation fuel. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-218.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
