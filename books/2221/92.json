In exchange for her guilty plea, the federal prosecutor had offered Karen twenty-seven years and agreed to drop twenty-three other felony charges including a RICO beef, and he expected the judge to honor the deal.

I said, “If I hear any more about it, I’ll put a hit on you. Maybe save a few bucks and do it myself.” He was watching Regis and Kelly at the time, so I didn’t know if he was paying attention until Chopper called me a couple of days later at the St. Paul Hotel and said that the contract had been lifted, “with prejudice,” he said, although I doubt that’s the term DuWayne used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNina wanted to go out and celebrate.
