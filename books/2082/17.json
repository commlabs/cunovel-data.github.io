She jumped for the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good, tall loblolly pine, whose drooping lower branches didn\u0027t look as if they could support a kitten. But Keller didn\u0027t need support. As she leaped, she changed, pushing it as fast as she could. She reached the tree with four paws full of lethal claws extended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she ran straight up the vertical surface. Her claws sank into the clean, cinnamon trunk, and she shot up like a rocket. When she got high enough to be obscured by the dull-green needles on the droopy branches, she launched herself into the air again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a desperate move, betting everything on one blind spring. But it was all she could think of. She could never take the dragon in a fair fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was betting on her claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the wild, a panther could shear the head off a deer with a single swipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller was going for the horns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came down right on target. The dragon made the mistake of looking up at her, maybe thinking that she was trying to get behind it, to land on its back again and kill it. Or maybe thinking that she might see the pale face of an innocent girl and hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever it thought, it was a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller was already slashing as she landed. A single deadly swipe with all her power behind it. Her claws peeled the forehead off the creature in a spray of blood and flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screaming roar almost burst her eardrums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the sound she\u0027d heard before in the mall, a sound so deep in pitch that she felt it as much as heard it. It shook her bones, and it reverberated in every tree and in the red clay of the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was another mistake, although Keller didn\u0027t know it at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same instant as she heard the roar, she felt the pain. The dark power crackled through her like a whiplash and tore her own involuntary scream from her. It was worse than the first time she\u0027d felt it, ten times worse, maybe more. The dragon was much stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it followed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a real whip, it flashed across the clearing after her. It hit her again as she hit the ground, and Keller screamed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to scrabble away, but the pain made her weak, and she fell over on her side. And then the black energy hit her right shoulder-exactly where it had hit the first time in the mall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller saw white light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she was falling in darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer last thought was, I didn\u0027t get it. I couldn\u0027t have. It still has power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana, I\u0027m sorry...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped feeling anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurts...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was looking up at the dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had dropped Iliana; Keller couldn\u0027t see where. And it was staring down at her in malevolent fury, obviously waiting for her to wake up so she could feel it when it killed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he killed her. He\u0027d taken on the shape he\u0027d been wearing in the beginning. A young man with clean, handsome features and a nicely muscled if compact body. Black hair that shed rainbow colors under the moonlight and looked as fine and soft as her own fur. And those obsidian eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to look away from those eyes. They seemed to capture her gaze and suck her in. They were so much more like stones than eyes, silver-black, shiny stones that seemed to reflect all light out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she managed to drag her gaze upward, she felt a thrill of hope. His forehead was a bleeding ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had gotten him. Her slash had carved a nice hamburger-sized piece out of his scalp. Somewhere on the ground in the clearing were two little stubby horns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut only two; there were three left on his head. He must have turned at the last instant. Keller would have cursed if she had a human throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027re you feeling?\" the dragon said, and leered at her form under the gory mess of his scalp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller tried to snarl at him and realized that she did have a human throat. She must have collapsed back into her half-and-half form, and she was too weak to change back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Having trouble?\" the dragon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller croaked, \"You should never have come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong,\" the dragon said. \"I like the modern world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have stayed asleep. Who woke you up?\" She was buying time, of course, to try and regain some strength. But she also truly wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon laughed. \"Someone,\" he said. \"Someone you\u0027ll never know. A witch who isn\u0027t a witch. We made our own alliance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller didn\u0027t understand, and her brain was too fuzzy to deal with it. But just at that moment, she noticed something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovement behind the dragon. The figures that had been lying on the ground were stirring. And they were doing it stealthily, in ways that showed they were awake and with their wits about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were alive. She could see Galen\u0027s head lift, with moonlight shining on his hair as he looked at her. She could see Winnie turn toward Iliana and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebegin to crawl. She could see Nissa\u0027s shoulders hump and then fall back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when they were asked, they would all say the same thing had brought them to awareness: a deep rumbling sound that vibrated in their bones. The dragon\u0027s roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, at least, three of them would say that. Galen would always say that all he heard was Keller\u0027s scream and his eyes came open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surge of hope she felt made Keller\u0027s heart beat hard and wiped away the pain-for the moment, at least. But she was terrified of giving the dragon some clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t dare look at Galen any longer. She stared at the dragon\u0027s black stone eyes and thought with all her strength, Get away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet away, take the Jeep, take Diana. He may not be able to follow you. Run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your time\u0027s over,\" she told the dragon out loud. \"The shapeshifters don\u0027t want you anymore. Everything has changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s changing again,\" the dragon said. \"The end of the world is coming, and the beginning of a new one. It\u0027s time for everything that\u0027s sleeping to wake back up again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller had a horrified vision of hundreds of dragons being dug up and brought back to life. But there was something going on in the clearing that was even more horrifying to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen wasn\u0027t getting away. He was slithering on his stomach toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Winnie, the idiot, was beside Diana nowbut\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe wasn\u0027t dragging her to the Jeep. She seemed to be whispering to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller felt a hot wave of utter desperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat can I do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the dragon sees them, they\u0027re all dead. There\u0027s nothing any of them can do against him. Galen\u0027s not a warrior-he can\u0027t change. Nissa looks too hurt to move. Winnie\u0027s orange fire won\u0027t even singe the dragon. And Diana will get swatted like a butterfly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey can\u0027t do anything. I have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so tired and hurt, and her claws were much less lethal than in her full panther form. But she had to do it, and she had to do it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go back where you came from!\" she shouted. She bunched her muscles and jumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight for him. Straight on. That was what took him by surprise, the sheer insanity of the attack. He threw the black energy at her, but he couldn\u0027t stop her leap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer claws ripped into his forehead again, and then she fell back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon\u0027s scream split the heavens. Dizzy with pain and shock, Keller stared at him, hoping desperately...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she\u0027d taken only one horn off. He still had two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thrashed around in wounded fury, then threw the dark power at her again. Keller shuddered and lost her balance. She crashed to the ground and lay there, limp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keller!\" The scream was full of such raw anguish\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat it hurt Keller\u0027s throat to hear it. It made her heart throb hard and then fall in sick dismay. Galen, no, she thought. Don\u0027t bother with me. You have to get Iliana away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keller!\" he screamed again, and then he was beside her, holding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No . ? .\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t say more than that. She looked at him pleadingly with the eyes of a dumb beast. If he died, too, it would make her own death meaningless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon was still screaming, both hands to his forehead. He seemed to be too angry to attack. \"Keller, hang on. Please, you have to hang on.\" Galen was dripping tears on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run...\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he did the most gallant thing she had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already holding her, his shaky hand stroking the hair off her face, brushing one of her tufted ears. Now, suddenly, he gripped her hard, and his expression changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw tightened, and a white line showed around his mouth. And his eyes... seemed to darken and glow red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late, Keller realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was taking her impression. Learning her shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. You were meant to be something gentle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something was a little off. Maybe it was the fact that he had to hurry when he took the impression, or some extra twist from his own genes. Because, instead of becoming a soot-black panther, he became a gleaming golden leopard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same animal. Different colors. This leopard was the dark rich gold of Galen\u0027s hair, and its eyes were the incredible green of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was marked with perfect black rosettes, each with an even darker gold center. His body was sleek and supple and almost seven feet long with the tail. He was a big leopard, at least a hundred and sixty pounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd before Keller had time to think, he was in motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good spring. Untutored but full of the real killer instinct. The coughing yell he let out as he jumped was the kind a cat makes when its fury is too great to hold in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon whirled to face him. But it was too late. Once again, the crackling dark power hit but couldn\u0027t stop the rush. The dragon\u0027s human body couldn\u0027t fend off a hundred and sixty pounds of solid feline muscle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller saw Galen swipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon bellowed, clapping a hand to his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Keller wanted to cheer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t. She didn\u0027t have the strength left. But her heart was singing inside her with sheer pride. You did it. Oh, Galen, my prince, you did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw his body falling, struck by the black energy. She saw it hit the ground and lie still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was sorry that they were both going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edie. But with the dragon dead, too, and Iliana alive, there would still be hope. There would be people to carry on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she looked at the dragon, and time stopped, and her heart turned to ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still had a horn left. The one right in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hadn\u0027t done it after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still had power. He was going to kill them now, and Iliana, too. And neither she nor Galen could do anything to stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noises the dragon was making were beyond description. He seemed to be out of his mind in pain and fury. And then Keller realized that it was more than that. He was screaming in sheer blood-lust-and he was changing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo strange-she hadn\u0027t even thought about the dragon changing before. But she could take on most animals. She knew to go for the juncture between head and neck for rhinos, the belly for a lion. But this... what it was shifting into...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t believe it, Keller thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked more like a moth being born than a shapeshifter changing. It split its human skin like a chrysalis. More of the yellowish liquid she had seen on Jaime\u0027s cheek oozed from the splits. And what was revealed underneath was hard and greenish-yellow, flat, smooth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScaly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell was the smell from the basement Sickly-sweet, pungent, an odor to make your stomach lurch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowerful back legs bunched, and the figure grew and stood against the moonlit sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her mind, Keller saw a scene from the past. Iliana, her violet eyes huge, saying, \"He can turn into a dragon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Keller\u0027s scornful answer, \"No, of course not. Don\u0027t be silly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrong, Keller thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt actually looked more like velociraptor than a dragon. Too big-it was more than fifteen feet long, counting the powerful tail. But it had the same look of alien intelligence, the same reptilian snout, the same saberlike hind claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not a mindless animal, Keller thought. It\u0027s smart. It even has things like hands on its forelegs; It\u0027s where evolution took a different turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it had power. Maybe more power this way than in its human form. Keller could feel its mind even at this distance, the terrible ancient core of hatred and malice, the endless thirst for blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt opened its mouth, and for an instant Keller expected to see fire. But what came out was a roar that showed huge spiky teeth-and a flood of black energy. The dark power crackled around it like an aura of lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing-no shapeshifter, no witch, no vampire-could stand against this creature. Keller knew that absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when she saw Iliana getting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStay down, you idiot! Keller thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIliana stood straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no point, don\u0027t attract its attention...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Azhdeha!\" Iliana shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the monster turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere they were, the maiden and the dragon, face to face. Iliana looked twice as small as ever before in contrast to this giant. Her silver-gold hair was blowing loose in the wind, and her dress shimmered around her. She was so delicate, so graceful-and so fragile, standing there like a lily swaying on its stalk. I can\u0027t watch, Keller thought. I can\u0027t see this. Please...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Azhdeha!\" Iliana said, and her voice was sweet but ringing and stern. \"Hashteher! Tiamat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a spell, Keller thought. Winnie taught her a spell? When they were lying there, whispering together? But what kind of spell would Winnie know against dragons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poisonous Serpent! Cold-blooded Biter! Rasta-ban! Anguis!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, they\u0027re names, Keller realized slowly. Its names. Dragon names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a witch and the daughter of a witch. Mine was the hand that took your power; mine was the hand that buried you in silence. Hecate was the most ancient of my mothers. Hecate\u0027s hand is my hand now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinnie couldn\u0027t have taught her that. Nobody could have taught her that. No witch alive today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller could see Winnie\u0027s pale face watching in surprise from beyond Iliana, her eyes and mouth dark O\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine is the hand that sends you back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s palms were cupped now, and orange fire crackled between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller\u0027s heart plummeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolden-orange fire. Witch fire. It was impressive, from a girl who\u0027d never been trained, but it wasn\u0027t nearly enough. It was about as dangerous to the dragon as a firefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard Winnie\u0027s voice in the silence, small and frightened but determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aim for the horn!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon threw back its head and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was what it looked like, anyway. What came out was a roar like all the other roars and a belch of black energy that fountained skyward. But in her head, Keller heard maniacal laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it swung its head back down and pointed the horn straight at Iliana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDie! it said. The word wasn\u0027t spoken but sent on a cold wave of pure energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine is the power of the ages\" Iliana shouted back. \"Mine is the power-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golden flare in her palms was changing, blazing white, blinding hot...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-OF THE END OF THE WORLD!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething like a supernova was born between her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tight shot up and out, exploding. It was impossible to look at. And it was no longer white but dazzling, lightning-brilliant blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wild Power had awakened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it, Keller thought I knew it all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller couldn\u0027t see what happened to the dragon;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe light was simply too bright. While it flared around her, she was bathed in radiance that seemed to shine through her, humming inside her and lighting up her bones. She tried to lift her own hand and saw nothing but a vague rainbow shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she heard the dragon\u0027s scream. Not low like the roar but high and squealing, a sound like icicles driving into her ears. It went up and up, higher in pitch until even Keller couldn\u0027t track it. And then there was a thin sound like distant glass shattering, and then there was no sound at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were shooting stars in the blue-white light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the second time that evening, Keller fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boss! Please, Boss, hurry. Wake up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller blinked open her eyes. Galen was holding her. He was human. So was she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Winnie and Nissa were trying to drag both of them somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller gazed up into those gold-green eyes. The exact color of a leopard\u0027s, she thought. Only leopards don\u0027t cry, and his were brimming with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted a languorous hand and stroked his cheek. He cupped his own hand over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller couldn\u0027t think. There were no words in her mind. But she was glad to be here with him, for this last moment in the moonlight. It had all been worth it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boss, please!\" Winnie was almost crying, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me die in peace,\" Keller said, although she didn\u0027t realize she was saying it aloud until she heard the words. Then she added, \"Don\u0027t you cry, Winfrith. You did a good job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boss, you\u0027re not dying! The blue fire did something-it healed us. We\u0027re all okay. But it\u0027s almost midnight!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller bunked. She blinked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body didn\u0027t hurt anymore. She\u0027d assumed it was the blessed numbness that comes just before death. But now she realized that it wasn\u0027t. Her blood was running in her veins; her muscles felt firm and strong. She didn\u0027t even have a headache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared beyond Winnie to the girl in white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana was still slight and childlike, almost fairy-like of figure. But something had changed about her. At first, Keller thought she looked as distant and beautiful as a star, but then she smiled and wasn\u0027t distant at all. She was simply more beautiful than the dreams of mortals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd really shining with her own light. It pooled around her in soft, silvery radiance. Keller had never seen a Wild Power do that before, not on any of the tapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she\u0027s not just a Wild Power, the voice in her head whispered. She\u0027s the Witch Child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Goddess alone knows all that she\u0027s meant to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Keller felt so awed that it was almost like unhappiness. But then Winnie\u0027s message finally sank in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snapped her head up. \"Midnight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" Winnie said frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller bolted upright. \"Nissa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here, Boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller felt a flood of relief. Nissa was the one who had seemed closest to death on the ground there. But now she was standing on her own two feet, looking cool and imperturbable, even though her shirt was bloody and in rags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nissa, can you drive that Jeep? Can you figure out how to get to Charlotte?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so. Boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller had never been so grateful to hear that calm voice in her life. She jumped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s go!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-witchlight-night-world-9/page-17.html","bookId":2082,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:28 PM"}
