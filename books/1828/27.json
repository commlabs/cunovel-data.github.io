They’ll be here promptly at seven forty-five.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The party starts at seven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, that’s right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ava wants to be late?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fashionably late,” Claire explained. “That’s what she told me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it’s her party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mentioned that to her, dear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shouldn’t she be on time? And Annie’s hosting the party. She certainly should be here to welcome guests.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ava has two sisters. You can welcome guests until Annie gets here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aha,” Ellie said. Of course. Now she could see the plan. Those vicious rumors would go away if Ellie greeted the guests and welcomed them to the party. Ellie would be letting everyone know that she approved of Ava and John. Oh yes, Ava had it all figured out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aha, what?” her mother asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to let it go, she decided. No more resentment. No more anger or embarrassment. Ava and John belonged together, and it was time for Ellie to be happy for them. She was never going to have a great relationship with her sister because they were so different, but she was okay with that. And she would try to get along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tonight has to be perfect for Ava,” Claire said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie knew her mother’s comment was a warning. “Why are you frowning at me? I’m not going to do anything to ruin her perfect evening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY – SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pattersons weren’t pleasant people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Hershey and Clark arrived at the Sullivan house late in the afternoon, Max gave them instructions and made Ellie promise she would stay with them, then walked the few blocks to the Patterson home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe couple opened the door together, but neither invited Max to come inside. Resentment etched Mr. Patterson’s face, and anger radiated from Mrs. Patterson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax showed them his badge and said, “My name is Agent Daniels, and I’m with the FBI.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you people leave us alone?” Mr. Patterson demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to talk to you about your son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe couple edged their way out onto the porch, and Mr. Patterson pulled the door closed behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it you want with him this time?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First of all, I want to know where he is,” Max said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” Mrs. Patterson asked in a gravelly voice. “So you can harass him again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or do you want to lock him away again?” Mr. Patterson asked. He folded his arms across his chest and glared at Max. “Evan hasn’t done anything wrong, and I know the law. You can’t touch him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was a good boy until she came along,” Mrs. Patterson said. Only the slightest hint of disappointment flashed across her face before the anger took over again. “We had such high hopes for him. He was going to make something of himself. He was so smart and clever. All the teachers told us so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She ruined his life, getting the police involved and all. He didn’t mean any harm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax wanted to argue, to remind them that Ellie was eleven years old the first time their son attacked her, but he knew it was useless to point out the facts. They had already twisted them to fit their agenda, and nothing he could say would change their minds. They wanted to believe their son was a victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not here to talk about the past,” Max said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t know where Evan is. We haven’t seen him in months,” Mr. Patterson insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we did know, we wouldn’t tell you,” his wife muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your son tried to purchase a gun yesterday,” Max told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t believe it,” Mrs. Patterson scoffed. “You FBI agents always lie.” She pulled a pack of cigarettes out of her pocket and elbowed her husband for his lighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did that woman call you and tell you the lie about a gun so you would come here and harass us?” Mr. Patterson demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We know she’s back in town. We read it in the paper. She’s behind this.” Mrs. Patterson lit a cigarette and inhaled. “She won’t rest until she’s destroyed our boy.” Smoke billowed out of her mouth as she spoke. “She ought to be the one locked up is what I think. I hope she gets what she deserves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax was through being diplomatic. “I’m putting both of you on notice. If your son gets hold of a gun, and you do nothing to stop him, you’re as responsible as he is if someone gets hurt. I’ll lock you up, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey gave no response to his threat, but as he was walking down their porch steps, he heard their front door slam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY – SEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClark and Hershey were in the apartment with Ellie. Max was unprepared for what he saw when he walked in. Hershey was shirtless and perched on the arm of the sofa while Ellie appeared to be rubbing his side. Clark was at the coffee table using Ellie’s laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the…,” Max began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re back,” Ellie said. She patted Hershey’s shoulder. “Okay, you can put your shirt on. It’s scar tissue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure?” Hershey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure. It’s all good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie went to Max and almost kissed him before she realized what she was doing. She took a step back and asked, “What were the Pattersons like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They won’t ever win parents of the year,” he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClark closed the laptop. “I talked to your friend Sheriff Spike Bennett,” he said. “Strange name, but a nice guy,” he continued. “He wanted you to know there’s a gun shop close to a town called Lipton, and the owner isn’t real reputable. Spike’s been trying to shut him down, but so far no luck. He said that for the right amount of money Patterson could get anything he wanted. Bennett’s on his way there now to talk to the owner, find out if Patterson came around yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think he’d tell him if he had?” Hershey asked the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patterson might not know about this gun store,” Ellie suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bennett wants to warn him, just the same. After he’s finished in Lipton, Bennett will come here to help with surveillance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t have to worry about anything tonight, Ellie,” Hershey assured. He buttoned his shirt and tucked it in his pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie checked the time. “I need to get ready,” she said. “Thanks for babysitting me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth agents, Max noticed, were smiling like idiots at her, but as long as they did their jobs, he didn’t care if they were infatuated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does it seem a little cold in here?” Clark asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie’s laughter followed her into the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes later she was ready for the party. Max had put on a suit and tie and was tugging on it when she walked out. She looked stunning. She wore a pale pink dress and high-heeled sandals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do I look all right?” she asked. “Max?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook himself out of his stupor. “Yes, you look fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFine? Ellie knew he wasn’t one to embellish… but fine? “Thanks,” she said. She’d spent a long time curling her hair just so, and she’d even put on makeup. All that for fine?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look nice,” she said. “But your tie is crooked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed the room and stood in front of him while she adjusted the knot in his striped tie. Her perfume enveloped him, and all Max wanted to do was tear her dress off and make love to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate ties,” he said instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d think you’d be used to them,” she replied. “Don’t you wear a suit and tie every day in Honolulu?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, we wear khaki shorts, no shirts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “Where do you put your badge and gun?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Waistband of our shorts… or swim trunks. We have to be prepared for anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do the female agents wear in Honolulu?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bikinis,” he answered with a straight face. “We don’t get a whole lot of work done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not nervous about tonight, so you can stop trying to put me at ease.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed his cheek. “Okay, I am a little nervous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I could think of something to take your mind off tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me a few minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie’s cell phone rang. She didn’t recognize the number and almost didn’t answer it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to find out who it is,” Max insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe answered the same way she had for years. “Dr. Sullivan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice on the phone was deep. “No, I’m not going to the Colts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie’s hands were still shaking from talking to Simon Daniels, the most spectacular quarterback of all time. Oh God, had she told him that? She couldn’t remember what she’d said for the first minute or two, but she knew she’d gushed, then she had recovered and grilled him on the upcoming season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turned out that Simon was a bit of a hypochondriac, and for the next half hour it was quid pro quo. He answered a question she posed, and she then answered one of his. Some of his questions were hilarious, but she didn’t laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, that particular disease comes from a parasite found only in the waters of the Amazon, and, no, it isn’t contagious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw Max roll his eyes, and she shook her head at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax finally took the phone from her when she held it out to him and said, “Simon wants to talk to his white brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I carry a gun now,” he reminded his brother. “So stop calling me that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie listened to the conversation and was shocked at the insults Max was hurling, but then she decided he was giving as good as he was getting. Brothers were so different from sisters. She doubted they whined the way Ava did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh Lord, the party. She was supposed to be at the house fifteen minutes ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she walked down the steps from the apartment, she was glad to see the weather was cooperating. Dark clouds hung overhead, and the air was stifling hot and muggy, but it wasn’t raining. She thought it silly to plan a party outside this time of year, but she wouldn’t share her opinion with Ava or her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClark and Hershey were checking the backyards on either side of the house and behind it. It was six o’clock when Ellie and Max walked into the kitchen. The house was dressed up with flowers everywhere and candles ready to be lit. Even the worn furniture in the living room looked brand-new because of the roses on the coffee table. Her parents and her aunts were upstairs getting dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax was being sweet. He gave her shoulder a supportive squeeze and went to the refrigerator to get her a glass of milk. The guests would be arriving soon, and she was ready. She took a couple of steps across the living room and stopped to look out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there he was… Evan Patterson… pacing on the sidewalk in front of her house. She froze, and so did he, and for at least two or three seconds they stared at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he smiled, and she ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s here. He’s here.” She couldn’t get her voice above a whisper, but Max understood what she was trying to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Front,” she whispered. “He’s in front.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax grabbed her and pulled her to the hall closet. He pushed her inside and said, “You stay here until I tell you it’s okay to come out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw him draw his gun as the door was slamming shut. Ellie was shaking violently now and couldn’t catch her breath, hyperventilating even as she was sinking to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger came like a shot of adrenaline. She wanted to go after Patterson, to hit him and kick him, to hurt him the way he’d hurt her. She realized she was having crazy thoughts, but she didn’t care. She would rather be furious than terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for the door handle and came to her senses. She strained to hear any noise, but the only sound was the running water from the showers upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe careful, Max. He’s mean and dangerous and cunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed she waited an hour, but she knew her mind was playing tricks. It should be hot in the closet, she thought, but she was shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax finally opened the door. She threw herself into his arms. “Did you get him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he answered. He could feel her trembling and hugged her. “Clark and Hershey are still looking, but Patterson vanished. Are you sure…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to push herself away from him. He wouldn’t let her. “Okay, you’re sure it was him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. He was wearing black pants and a white shirt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where were his hands?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t see them. Behind his back, I guess, or in his pockets. He smiled at me, Max.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll get him,” he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then what? What can you do? It isn’t illegal to walk in front of my house. I don’t have a restraining order anymore, and that didn’t help anyway. So far, Patterson hasn’t done anything wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he’s gotten hold of a gun, I can take him in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going to have to find him first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellie, what are you doing in the closet?” Her father asked the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax pulled her into the hall and draped his arm around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daddy, the thing is…” She was trying to think of a gentle way of telling him about Patterson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax was blunt. “Patterson was out front on the sidewalk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile on her father’s face vanished, and anxiety took its place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad, this is a good thing. We have three agents here, and if Patterson will try something, they can get him and lock him up.” She didn’t mention the possibility that Patterson might have a gun. “They’ve got this covered. I saw him, but he left before I could tell Max. He’ll come back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we should cancel the party,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to make light of the situation. “Are you kidding? I’m more afraid of Ava than Patterson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should I tell your mother?” he asked, and before she could answer, he shook his head and said, “No, we won’t worry her.” He turned to Max. “If that maniac comes back, you’ll get him. In the meantime, you watch out for my daughter.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ideal-man-buchanan-renard-9/page-27.html","bookId":1828,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:24 PM"}
