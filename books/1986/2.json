He\u0027d somehow managed to find a few blankets and a pillow last night when he\u0027d returned from his two a.m. booty call. He reeked of whiskey and sex. I didn\u0027t allow him to sleep next to me when he\u0027d been out screwing some nameless chick, crazy boy. I resisted the urge to reach down and brush the long black hair out of his eyes. I needed to leave and if I woke him up he\u0027d stop me. My sister was expecting me to keep my niece Larissa today. I was still furious with her but Larissa was a baby and she needed me. She couldn\u0027t help the fact her mommy was a selfish brat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the quilt off the bed as I stood up and gently covered Cage\u0027s half naked body. He\u0027d stripped down to his boxers last night in his attempt to get rid of his smoke, whiskey, and cheap women infested clothing. Didn\u0027t matter he still smelled like all those things. The ridiculously chiseled body of his was always a golden brown. His mother had been one hundred percent Indian and it was obvious in his features. The intense blue eyes of his had to be the only thing his dad gave him genetically and physically. That was one of the many bonds Cage and I shared, absent fathers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy suitcase held the only three clean outfits I currently had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dirty clothes were piled up over in the corner of Cage\u0027s room in a plastic laundry basket. I really needed to make time to do the laundry. Grabbing a pair of jeans and a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurricane\u0027s baseball \" t-shirt Cage had given me from my meager supply of clothing, I dressed quickly and quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I\u0027d brushed my hair, I closed my suitcase and threw my clothing from last night into the dirty clothes basket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently closing the bedroom door behind me so I didn\u0027t wake him, I turned and headed for the fridge. I needed some coffee and I wanted to leave some ready for Cage when he woke up. Lord knows he\u0027d need it after his late night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you left last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun around to see Marcus Hardy sitting at the kitchen table with a newspaper and a cup of coffee already in his hands. I really wish he wasn\u0027t so dang gorgeous. Marcus Hardy wasn\u0027t in my league or even my atmosphere. How Cage had landed a Hardy for a roommate, I had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreston must be really tight with Marcus which seemed odd since Preston grew up much like Cage and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, no, that was Cage that left last night.\" Marcus frowned that disapproving frown I\u0027d seen last night again. He really didn\u0027t get Cage and me at all. I wasn\u0027t sure if he was judging me or Cage but it annoyed me. Even though he had the prettiest green eyes I\u0027d ever seen on a guy in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cage isn\u0027t here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"No, he\u0027s back. He had a um, call last night and he went out. He got back a few hours ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he left you here while he went... out\" I sighed and reached for a coffee cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to make me some eggs and toast. You want some?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat hadn\u0027t been the response I\u0027d expected. I was sure he was going to beat this thing with Cage and me into the ground. Instead, he was offering to fix me breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks, I\u0027ve got to go keep my niece today.\" I held up the coffee mug in my hand, \"I take mugs full of coffee with me when I leave but I always bring them back.\" Marcus shrugged, \"No worries. They aren\u0027t mine anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I bought them for Cage when he got this place.\" Marcus stood up and walked over to the fridge and began getting eggs and butter out. If I was honest with myself I really wanted to stand here and watch him cook. Then eat breakfast with him and see if I could make him smile. I felt sure he had a really nice smile. Those green eyes would probably twinkle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re sure you can\u0027t stay. My cooking is pretty damn impressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus reached over to open the drawer beside me. The clean soap smell mixed with coffee and something else that reminded me of warm summer days met my nose. I fought the urge to grab his shirt and take a deeper whiff. He\u0027d think I was crazy. I\u0027d always thought the way Cage smelled when he came home from celebrating a victory game was the best smell in the world. But Cage\u0027s sweat, beer, and cigarettes couldn\u0027t compete with clean Marcus Hardy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I needed to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, okay, I gotta run. Thanks again and I\u0027ll take you up on breakfast another time. I\u0027ve got to get to my sister\u0027s place before she comes over here with my niece in tow.\" Marcus glanced up and a small frown puckered his brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed concerned. If the guy only knew this was the least of my problems. I wondered what he would think if he knew I actually had nowhere to live. My sister\u0027s couch and Cage\u0027s bed were the only options I had for now. Somehow I knew he\u0027d want to fix that and it warmed me. Shaking my head from my illusions of Marcus, I stepped around him and his yummy goodness then headed for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna be okay?\" He called as my hand touched the handle. A smile tugged at my lips. I was right. He did care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then guys like Marcus wanted to save the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep,\" I replied glancing back over my shoulder to flash him a smile before stepping outside and heading to my reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the HELL have you been? No wait don\u0027t tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve been in Cage York\u0027s bed again. You know you have no right judging me when you go sleeping with that male whore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit the inside of my cheek to keep from screaming. My sister was so uninvolved in my life she didn\u0027t have a clue how off track she was. Yes, Cage was probably considered a male whore but he did pick really hot sexy females to screw around with. He had pretty high standards. Which never ceased to amuse me that people thought I was one of his many conquests. I didn\u0027t fit the profile, at all. For starters he kept me around. He never kept a girl around after he slept with her. Second, I wasn\u0027t nearly tall enough, I was red headed, and my hips were too big, and my chest too real. Cage had a thing for fake boobs. Strange but true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, my sister was the walking persona of the kind of girl Cage went after. Granted she had red hair too, but hers was naturally curly and she was tall and thin. Red hair looked better on her than it did me. She made red sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe, not so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here now. Just go and stop cursing and yelling in front of Larissa. It took me an entire week to get her to stop saying s-h-i-t when she dropped things\" If I wasn\u0027t so worried about the fact it might become a permanent word in her vocabulary I would\u0027ve found it funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would sit in her high chair and drop one cheerio at a time. Each time one bounced on the cracked linoleum she\u0027d yell \"SHIT\" and clap her hands and do it again. This was all thanks to my lovely sister yelling \"shit\" every time Larissa dropped her food onto the floor. So, my niece had decided to make a game of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever, it was funny. I gotta go. Call Janet Hall, the lady with the sponge roll ers always in her yellow hair that lives three houses down and ask her if she can watch Larissa tomorrow. You\u0027ve got class tomorrow, right.\" I nodded, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated leaving Larissa with the cat lady. She\u0027d come home with several scratches from the thousands of cats in that house last time she stayed there, not to mention the place smelled like cat poo. But I couldn\u0027t miss a class or make less than a B in any of my courses or I\u0027d lose my scholarship. I needed that scholarship. Faulkner was a junior college and that was all the college I would get. Once my scholarship was up I wouldn\u0027t be furthering my education. Unless I could manage a student loan and considering I didn\u0027t even have a home that seemed unlikely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027m gone. Don\u0027t call my cell while I\u0027m at work. If you have any problems just figure them out.\" And she was gone. No kiss goodbye to Larissa. I hated her for that if nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother died of cancer when I was twelve leaving me and my sister alone in the world. Tawny had been eighteen and she\u0027d taken custody of me and luckily the house was paid for thanks to Mom\u0027s frugal budgeting over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house had been left to Tawny along with the meager amount of money in the bank. She\u0027d gotten her GED\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einstead of finishing her senior year and managed to get a job to pay the bills. Once I was old enough to work I got an after school job to help out. Then Larissa came along a little over a year ago and everything got harder. Tawny told me she couldn\u0027t support me any longer and I needed to get my own place. I couldn\u0027t afford my own place on a waitress\u0027s income. So, she decided that if I took care of Larissa for her while she worked she\u0027d let me stay a night free of rent in return. Problem is she doesn\u0027t need me to keep Larissa every day and when I don\u0027t keep Larissa she doesn\u0027t let me stay the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds harsh but the truth is I am more than positive Larissa\u0027s dad comes around those nights and she doesn\u0027t want me to know who he is. If it wasn\u0027t for her secret of who Larissa\u0027s daddy is, I am pretty sure she\u0027d let me stay. But I get booted for a guy. At first I went to the Methodist church because they have a homeless shelter but when Cage found out I was going there because Tawny wasn\u0027t letting me stay at home anymore he flipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I go to his place instead. I tried to fight him on it just because of his crazy notion we\u0027re going to get married but I need him. Even if he is possessive and insane at times, he takes care of me. No one else ever has. He likes knowing he has the ability to take care of someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Cage\u0027s grandmother passed away she left him everything she had saved and tucked inside her mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCage had never even met the woman because his mom had run away from home when she was sixteen and never gone back. It had been a surprise when Cage received a check for over two hundred thousand dollars. The first thing Cage did with the money was buy his apartment. He figured it was a good investment and he wanted some security. The rest of the money he put in the bank and only draws the interest. He\u0027s been trying to get me to move in with him ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lowlow out,\" Larissa demanded as she banged her small pudgy fist on the tray of her highchair. Lately she\u0027d gone from calling me Mama to Lowlow. It infuriated Tawny when she called me Mama. I\u0027d had to work on breaking her of that habit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027ll get you out but first let\u0027s wash the banana off your hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did Low leave,\" Cage grumbled as he stepped out of the bedroom door an hour after Will ow had left. I could smell the whiskey on his breath from across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow\u0027d she sleep near that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About an hour ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and pulled his cell phone out of his pocket. I tried to appear as if I was focused on the screen of my lap top instead of curious about what he was going to say to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey baby, why\u0027d you leave without waking me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw come on. You know I\u0027d wake up for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I shouldn\u0027t have left you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I shouldn\u0027t have. I thought you were sleeping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to come back here tonight and please take the key. I keep leaving it out for you. I don\u0027t like you having to stay with her and God help me if I find out you\u0027re going back to that damn shelter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come get you myself if you don\u0027t get your ass over here tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a game tonight. You want to come? I promise to leave with you after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay fine. But come here. If you need rest so badly before class tomorrow then get your sexy ass over here and go to bed. I promise not to stink tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCage chuckled and hung up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That girl\u0027s gonna drive me nuts, I swear.\" I glanced up from my computer screen. Cage was pouring himself a cup of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she get some coffee before she left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, she did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and leaned back against the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She look upset or tired?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked defeated but I didn\u0027t want to tell him that. Not because I was worried about him but I didn\u0027t think she\u0027d want me to point out that observation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seemed fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the part of his phone conversation where he\u0027d brought up a shelter. My insides cringed at the thoughts of Will ow sleeping at a shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you mean about her going to a shelter?\" Cage cursed and shook his head, \"That sister of hers is mean as hell. She\u0027s basically kicked Low out. I didn\u0027t know about it at first. I found out she was sleeping at a church in town that had some kind of homeless shelter. I was so fucking furious I could\u0027ve killed her sister with my bare hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where does she live then?\" I had a feeling I wasn\u0027t going to like this answer but I needed to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the days she keeps her niece her sister lets her stay the night. The rest of the time she comes here. I tried to move her into the room you\u0027re staying in several times but she refuses. Says she can\u0027t handle my life style full time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only reason I didn\u0027t press it is because I\u0027d end up losing her. She\u0027d see what a chicken shit I really am and I\u0027d lose her. I can\u0027t lose her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy was really screwed up. How did he think he was really in love with Will ow if he couldn\u0027t even stop screwing every chick with a pair of long legs and fake tits in order to take care of her and keep her safe?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" I replied even though I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCage chuckled and sat his coffee cup down. \"Naw, I doubt you see at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t respond because he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knock on the door startled me even though I\u0027d been anticipating it for hours. Ever since Cage told me to expect Will ow around seven tonight, I\u0027d been surprisingly anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d have Will ow to myself. Even though I knew it wasn\u0027t wise I was looking forward to it. She fascinated me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey Marcus,\" she smiled up at me as I opened the door wide and stood back so she could step inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope I\u0027m not interrupting your night. You can just ignore me and go about whatever you were doing. I\u0027ll even hide out in Cage\u0027s room if you prefer privacy or anything.\" No way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, uh, I actually need some company. I\u0027ve been working on getting my online courses set up. I need a break and an actual conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe beamed and both dimples flashed at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh good! I brought a DVD I rented from the Red Box and some supplies for a homemade pizza.\" She held up the large canvas shopping tote in her hand. Clinched in her other hand was the handle on the old suitcase. My stomach twisted at the thought of her having to carry her things around with her. And the fact such a small suitcase held all she owned. My sister\u0027s swimsuit collection wouldn\u0027t even fit in that thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How good are you at chopping veggies?\" I pushed up my sleeves and flexed my arm, \"I\u0027ve actually had some pretty good experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed making me feel like I\u0027d just moved a mountain instead of agreeing to chop vegetables for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed her into the kitchen and enjoyed the view of her backside. Tonight she hadn\u0027t covered those incredible legs with jeans. A pair of khaki shorts and a snug red tank top showcased her flawless peaches and cream skin. And that hair of hers was hanging down her back free of its pony tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silky waves seemed almost unreal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I know there is a decent knife in one of these drawers because I brought one over a couple weeks ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou go on a scavenger hunt for it and a cutting board and I\u0027ll get the veggies washed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started looking for the knife while attempting to keep the goofy grin off my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old is your niece?\" I was determined to find out more about her tonight. The girl was an enigma. She glanced back over her shoulder and smiled at me, \"She turned one last month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened a drawer to find the missing knife wedged between two koozies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Found it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh good. Here, start slicing up the mushrooms,\" she said nodding her head toward the mushrooms lying on the towel still damp from her cleaning them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, how do you like living with Cage? I mean you two are absolutely nothing alike from what I can tell.\" What did she mean by that exactly? Not that I was upset she didn\u0027t think I was a player but she obviously held Cage in some sort of high regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a nice guy. Rarely here. It\u0027s been easy to find quiet time for my online classes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cage can\u0027t stay put long. He needs to be social. He\u0027s always been that way. When we were kids he was always on the go. So many nights he snuck in my window because he\u0027d stayed out too late and his mom had locked him out.\" I couldn\u0027t comprehend a parent locking their kid out of the house because they\u0027d missed curfew. My parents were always standing at the door pacing ready to unleash their punishment if I came home late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop frowning,\" she chuckled and nudged my side with her elbow. \"I can practically see your thoughts. You\u0027re friends with Preston so you know the kind of home life he had. Well most of the kids in our neighborhood had the same kind.\" I forced a smile and focused all my attention on the vegetables in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, yeah, I mean I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made absolutely no sense. Will ow let out a soft laugh and began mixing up the pizza dough. We worked in silence and I tried hard to focus on the vegetables I was supposed to be chopping up while she kneaded and rolled supposed to be chopping up while she kneaded and rolled out the dough. Her arms were slender but the small muscle that flexed as she pushed and pulled on the dough was literally mesmerizing. What was wrong with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, did you come home because you were tired of college life or do you have some other big plans that explain your sudden change in location?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t the first person to ask me this question. I\u0027d been nailed with questions from all my friends who knew I loved life in Tuscaloosa. They also knew I had been looking forward to some space from the girl who had gotten under my skin this past summer. However, Will ow was the first person I really wanted to tell the truth to, but it was too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Family stuff brought me home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI prepared myself for her to press further like Preston had but she just nodded and reached over to scoop a handful of the mushrooms I\u0027d chopped and began sprinkling them onto the pizza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Family sure can screw things up can\u0027t they,\" her defeated tone tugged at me. Pulling her into my arms and promising her everything would be okay wasn\u0027t the best idea since I\u0027d probably freak her out. Instead, I just nodded and reached over to sprinkle onions on the pizza just so my arm could brush against hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was one of the best pizzas I\u0027ve ever eaten,\" I admitted after helping Will ow clean up our mess in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We make a good team,\" she said throwing me a grin over her shoulder as she put the DVD into the player.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down in the straight back chair leaving the sofa available for her. There was enough room for both of us on it but I didn\u0027t want her to feel uncomfortable with my sitting beside her. Will ow turned around and frowned at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t bite Marcus. You can come sit on the comfy old couch with me. That chair is incredibly uncomfortable.\" Just the opening I needed. I jumped up and sat down on the end of the couch and stretched my legs out in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to tell me twice. I was just being polite.\" Will ow chuckled and brought a blanket over to the sofa with her. She didn\u0027t sit at the opposite end which surprised me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead she sat down next to me just far enough away that our bodies didn\u0027t touch and held up the blanket, \"Wanna share?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I wasn\u0027t the least bit cold but an offer to get under a blanket with Will ow wasn\u0027t something I was going to pass up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alright,\" she announced as she spread the cover out over both of us, \"here we go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark room was ill uminated by the television screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warmth from Will ow\u0027s body was so tempting. I wanted to close the distance and run my fingers through her hair. I\u0027d been dying to see if it was as soft as it looked from the moment I\u0027d opened the door last night to see her standing there in tears. As if reading my mind she scooted over toward me and laid her head on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you don\u0027t mind but I\u0027m a cuddler when I watch movies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost choked on my words. \"Uh, no I don\u0027t mind.\" Even though she\u0027d closed the distance I forced my arm to remain on the back of the sofa and not find its way to her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t even get a romantic comedy. I thought about you when I rented it and you don\u0027t appear to be a romantic comedy type of guy. I went for Sci-Fi instead.\" With her snuggled up against me on the couch I would watch the damn Princess Diaries I abhorred since my sister had forced me to watch it over and over when she was little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sci-fi is good,\" I assured her knowing I wouldn\u0027t be able to focus on anything with the sweet smell that reminded me of honeysuckles wafting up from her hair. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-2.html","bookId":1986,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:58 AM"}
