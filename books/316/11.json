{"id":16711,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11 Interrogations","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; CNN broke the story first.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was glad it hit the news before I had to leave for school, anxious to hear how thehumans would phrase the account, and what amount of attention it would garner.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Luckily, it was a heavy news day. There was an earthquake in South America and apolitical kidnapping in the Middle East. So it ended up only earning a few seconds, \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ea fewsentences, and one grainy picture.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Alonzo Calderas Wallace, suspected serial rapist and murderer wanted in thestates of Texas and Oklahoma, was apprehended last night in Portland, Oregon thanks \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003etoan anonymous tip. Wallace was found unconscious in an alley early this morning, just afew yards from a police station. Officials are unable to tell us at this time \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewhether he willbe extradited to Houston or Oklahoma City to stand trial.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The picture was unclear, a mug shot, and he’d had a thick beard at the time of thephotograph. Even if Bella saw it, she would probably not recognize him. I hoped \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eshewouldn’t; it would make her afraid needlessly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“The coverage here in town will be light. It’s too far away to be considered oflocal interest,” Alice told me. “It was a good call to have Carlisle take him out \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eof state.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I nodded. Bella didn’t watch much TV regardless, and I’d never seen her fatherwatching anything besides sports channels.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I’d done what I could. This monster no longer hunted, and I was not a murderer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Not recently, anyway. I’d been right to trust Carlisle, as much as I still wished themonster had not gotten off quite so easily. I caught myself hoping he would be \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eextraditedto Texas, where the death penalty was so popular…No. That didn’t matter. I would put this behind me, and concentrate on what wasmost important.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I’d left Bella’s room less than an hour ago. I was already aching to see her again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Alice, do you mind—”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She cut me off. “Rosalie will drive. She’ll act pissed, but you know she’ll enjoythe excuse to show off her car.” Alice trilled a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; I grinned at her. “See you at school.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Alice sighed, and my grin became a grimace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I know, I know, she thought. Not yet. I’ll wait until you’re ready for Bella toknow me. You should know, though, this isn’t just me being selfish. Bella’s going \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eto likeme, too.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I didn’t answer her as I hurried out the door. That was a different way of viewingthe situation. Would Bella want to know Alice? To have a vampire for a \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003egirlfriend?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Knowing Bella…that idea probably wouldn’t bother her in the slightest.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I frowned to myself. What Bella wanted and what was best for Bella were twovery separate things.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I started to feel uneasy as I parked my car in Bella’s driveway. The human adagesaid that things looked different in the morning—that things changed when you \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eslept onthem. Would I look different to Bella in the weak light of a foggy day? More sinister orless sinister than I had in the blackness of night? Had the truth sunk \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ein while she slept?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Would she finally be afraid?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her dreams had been peaceful, though, last night. When she’d spoken my name,time and time again, she’d smiled. More than once she’d murmured a plea for me to \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003estay.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Would that mean nothing today?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I waited nervously, listening to the sounds of her inside the house—the fast,stumbling footsteps on the stairs, the sharp rip of a foil wrapper, the contents of \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003etherefrigerator crashing against each other when the door slammed. It sounded like she wasin a hurry. Anxious to get to school? The thought made me smile, hopeful \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eagain.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I looked at the clock. I supposed that—taking in account the velocity her decrepittruck must limit her to—she was running a little late.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella rushed out of the house, her book bag sliding off her shoulder, her haircoiled into a messy twist that was already coming apart on the nape of her neck. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThethick green sweater she wore was not enough to keep her thin shoulders from hunchingagainst the cold fog.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The long sweater was too big for her, unflattering. It masked her slender figure,turning all her delicate curves and soft lines into a shapeless jumble. I \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eappreciated thisalmost as much as I wished that she had worn something more like the soft blue blouse\u0026nbsp; she’d worn last night…the fabric had clung to her skin in such \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ean appealing way, cut lowenough to reveal the mesmerizing way her collar bones curled away from the hollowbeneath her throat. The blue had flowed like water along the \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003esubtle shape of her body…It was better—essential—that I kept my thoughts far, far away from that shape, soI was grateful to the unbecoming sweater she wore. I couldn\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e’t afford to make mistakes,and it would be a monumental mistake to dwell on the strange hungers that thoughts ofher lips…her skin…her body…were shaking loose inside \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eof me. Hungers that hadevaded me for a hundred years. But I could not allow myself to think of touching her,because that was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I would break her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella turned away from the door, in such a hurry that she nearly ran right by mycar without noticing it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Then she skidded to a stop, her knees locking like a startled colt’s. Her bag slidfurther down her arm, and her eyes flew wide as they focused on the car.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I got out, taking no care to move at human speed, and opened the passenger doorfor her. I would not try to deceive her anymore—when we were alone, at least, I \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewouldbe myself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She looked up at me, startled again as I seemingly materialized out of the fog.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　And then the surprise in her eyes changed to something else, and I was no longer afraid—or hopeful—that her feelings for me had changed in the course of the \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003enight. Warmth,wonder, fascination, all swimming in the melted chocolate of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Do you want to ride with me today?” I asked. Unlike dinner last night, I wouldlet her choose. From now on, it must always be her choice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yes, thank you,” she murmured, climbing into my car without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Would it ever cease to thrill me, that I was the one she was saying yes to? Idoubted it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I flashed around the car, eager to join her. She showed no sign of being shockedby my sudden reappearance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The happiness I felt when she sat beside me this way had no precedent. As muchas I enjoyed the love and companionship of my family, despite the various \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eentertainmentsand distractions the world had to offer, I had never been happy like this. Even knowing\u0026nbsp; that it was wrong, that this couldn’t possibly end well, could \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003enot keep the smile from myface for long.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　My jacket was folded over the headrest of her seat. I saw her eyeing it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I brought the jacket for you,” I told her. This was my excuse, had I needed toprovide one, for showing up uninvited this morning. It was cold. She had no jacket.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Surely this was an acceptable form of chivalry. “I didn’t want you to get sick orsomething.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’m not quite that delicate,” she said, staring at my chest rather than my face, asif she were hesitant to meet my eyes. But she put the coat on before I had to \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eresort tocommanding or coaxing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Aren’t you?” I muttered to myself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She stared out at the road as I accelerated toward the school. I could only standthe silence for a few seconds. I had to know what her thoughts were this morning. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSomuch had changed between us since the last time the sun was up.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What, no twenty questions today?” I asked, keeping it light again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She smiled, seeming glad that I’d broached the subject. “Do my questions botheryou?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Not as much as your reactions do,” I told her honestly, smiling in response to hersmile.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her mouth turned down. “Do I react badly?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“No, that’s the problem. You take everything so coolly—it’s unnatural.” Not onescream so far. How could that be? “It makes me wonder what you’re really \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethinking.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Of course, everything she did or didn’t do made me wonder that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I always tell you what I’m really thinking.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You edit.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her teeth pressed into her lip again. She didn’t seem to notice when she didthis—it was an unconscious response to tension. “Not very much.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Just those words were enough to have my curiosity raging. What did shepurposefully keep from me?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Enough to drive me insane,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She hesitated, and then whispered, “You don’t want to hear it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; I had to think for a moment, run through our entire conversation last night, wordfor word, before I made the connection. Perhaps it took so much concentration \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ebecause Icouldn’t imagine anything that I wouldn’t want her to say to me. And then—because thetone of her voice was the same as last night; there was suddenly pain \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethere again—Iremembered. Once, I had asked her not to speak her thoughts. Never say that, I’d all butsnarled at her. I had made her cry…Was this what she kept from \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eme? The depth of her feelings about me? That mybeing a monster didn’t matter to her, and that she thought it was too late for her to changeher mind?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was unable to speak, because the joy and pain were too strong for words, theconflict between them too wild to allow for a coherent response. It was silent in the \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ecarexcept for the steady rhythms of her heart and lungs.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Where’s the rest of your family?” she asked suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I took a deep breath—registering the scent in the car with true pain for the firsttime; I was getting used to this, I realized with satisfaction—and forced myself \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eto becasual again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“They took Rosalie’s car.” I parked in the open spot next to the car in question. Ihid my smile as I watched her eyes widen. “Ostentatious, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Um, wow. If she has that, why does she ride with you?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Rosalie would have enjoyed Bella’s reaction…if she were being objective aboutBella, which probably wouldn’t happen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Like I said, it’s ostentatious. We try to blend in.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You don’t succeed,” she told me, and then she laughed a carefree laugh.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The blithe, wholly untroubled sound of her laughter warmed my hollow chesteven as it made my head swim with doubt.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“So why did Rosalie drive today if it’s more conspicuous?” she wondered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Hadn’t you noticed? I’m breaking all the rules now.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　My answer should have been mildly frightening—so, of course, Bella smiled at it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She didn’t wait for me to open her door, just like last night. I had to feignnormality here at school—so I couldn’t move fast enough to prevent this—but she \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewasjust going to have to get used to being treated with more courtesy, and get used to it soon.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; I walked as close to her as I dared, watching carefully for any sign that myproximity upset her. Twice her hand twitched toward me and then she would snatch \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eitback. It looked like she wanted to touch me… My breath sped.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Why do you have cars like that at all? If you’re looking for privacy?” she askedas we walked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“An indulgence,” I admitted. “We all like to drive fast.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Figures,” she mumbled, her tone sour.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She didn’t look up to see my answering grin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Nuh-uh! I don’t believe this! How the hell did Bella pull this off? I don’t get it!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Why?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jessica’s mental boggling interrupted my thoughts. She was waiting for Bella,taking refuge from the rain under the edge of the cafeteria’s roof, with Bella’s \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewinterjacket over her arm. Her eyes were wide with disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella noticed her, too, in the next moment. A faint pink touched her cheek whenBella registered Jessica’s expression. The thoughts in Jessica’s head were fairly \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eclear onher face.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Hey, Jessica. Thanks for remembering,” Bella greeted her. She reached out forthe jacket and Jessica handed it to her wordlessly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I should be polite to Bella’s friends, whether they were good friends or not.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Good morning, Jessica.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Whoa…Jessica’s eyes popped even wider. It was strange and amusing…and, honestly, abit embarrassing…to realize how much being near Bella had softened me. It \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eseemed likeno one was afraid of me any more. If Emmett found out about this, he would be laughingfor the next century.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Er…hi,” Jessica mumbled, and her eyes flashed to Bella’s face, full ofsignificance. “I guess I’ll see you in Trig.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　You are so going to spill. I’m not taking no for an answer. Details. I have tohave details! Edward freaking CULLEN!! Life is so unfair.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella’s mouth twitched. “Yeah, I’ll see you then.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; Jessica’s thoughts ran wild as she hurried to her first class, peeking back at usnow and then.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The whole story. I’m not accepting anything less. Did they plan to meet up lastnight? Are they dating? How long? How could she keep this a secret? Why would \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eshewant to? It can’t be a casual thing—she has to be seriously into him. Is there any otheroption? I will find out. I can’t stand not knowing. I wonder if she’s \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003emade out with him?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Oh, swoon… Jessica’s thoughts were suddenly disjointed, and she let wordless fantasiesswirl through her head. I winced at her speculations, and not just because \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eshe’d replacedBella with herself in the mental pictures.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It couldn’t be like that. And yet I…I wanted…I resisted making the admission, even to myself. How many wrong ways would Iwant Bella in? Which one would end up \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ekilling her?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I shook my head, and tried to lighten up.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What are you going to tell her?” I asked Bella.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Hey!” she whispered fiercely. “I thought you couldn’t read my mind!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I can’t.” I stared at her, surprised, trying to make sense of her words. Ah—wemust have been thinking the same thing at the same time. Hmm…I rather liked \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethat.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“However,” I told her, “I can read hers—she’ll be waiting to ambush you in class.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella groaned, and then let the jacket slide off her shoulders. I didn’t realize thatshe was giving it back at first—I wouldn’t have asked for it; I would rather \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eshe kept it…atoken—so I was too slow to offer her my help. She handed me the jacket, and put herarms through her own, without looking up to see that my hands were \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eextended to assist. Ifrowned at that, and then controlled my expression before she noticed it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“So, what are you going to tell her?” I pressed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“A little help? What does she want to know?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I smiled, and shook my head. I wanted to hear what she was thinking without aprompt. “That’s not fair.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her eyes tightened. “No, you not sharing what you know—now that’s unfair.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Right—she didn’t like double standards.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; We got to the door of her class—where I would have to leave her; I wondered idlyif Ms. Cope would be more accommodating about a switch in the schedule of my \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEnglishclass… I made myself focus. I could be fair.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“She wants to know if we’re secretly dating,” I said slowly. “And she wants toknow how you feel about me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her eyes were wide—not startled, but ingenious now. They were open to me,readable. She was playing innocent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yikes,” she murmured. “What should I say?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Hmmm.” She always tried to make me give away more than she did. I ponderedhow to respond.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　A wayward strand of her hair, slightly damp from the fog, draped across hershoulder and curled around where her collar bone was hidden by the ridiculous sweater.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It drew my eyes…pulled them across the other hidden lines…I reached for it carefully, not touching her skin—the morning was chill enoughwithout my touch—and \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003etwisted it back into place in her untidy bun so that it wouldn’tdistract me again. I remembered when Mike Newton had touched her hair, and my jawflexed at the memory. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe had flinched away from him then. Her reaction now wasnothing the same; instead, there was a slight widening of her eyes, a rush of blood underher skin, and a \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003esudden, uneven thumping of her heart.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I tried to hide my smile as I answered her question.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I suppose you could say yes to the first…if you don’t mind—,” her choice,always her choice, “—it’s easier than any other explanation.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I don’t mind,” she whispered. Her heart had not found its normal rhythm yet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“And as for her other question…” I couldn’t hide my smile now. “Well, I’ll belistening to hear the answer to that one myself.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Let Bella consider that. I held back my laugh as shock crossed her face.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I turned quickly, before she could ask for any more answers. I had a difficult timenot giving her whatever she asked for. And I wanted to hear her thoughts, not \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003emine.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’ll see you at lunch,” I called back to her over my shoulder, an excuse to checkthat she was still staring after me, wide-eyed. Her mouth was hanging open. I \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eturnedaway again, and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; As I paced away, I was vaguely aware of the shocked and speculative thoughtsthat swirled around me—eyes bouncing back and forth between Bella’s face and \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003emyretreating figure. I paid them little attention. I couldn’t concentrate. It was hard enoughto keep my feet moving at an acceptable speed as I crossed the soggy grass \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eto my nextclass. I wanted to run—really run, so fast that I would disappear, so fast that it wouldfeel like I was flying. Part of me was flying already.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I put the jacket on when I got to class, letting her fragrance swim thick around me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I would burn now—let the scent desensitize me—and then it would be easier to ignore itlater, when I was with her again at lunch…It was a good thing that my \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eteachers no longer bothered to call on me. Todaymight have been the day that they would have caught me out, unprepared and answerless.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　My mind was in so many places this morning; only my body was in the classroom.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Of course I was watching Bella. That was becoming natural—as automatic asbreathing. I heard her conversation with a demoralized Mike Newton. She quicklydirected \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethe conversation to Jessica, and I grinned so wide that Rob Sawyer, who sat atthe desk to my right, flinched visibly and slid deeper into his seat, away from me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Ugh. Creepy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Well, I hadn’t lost it entirely.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was also monitoring Jessica loosely, watching her refine her questions for Bella.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I could barely wait for fourth period, ten times as eager and anxious as the curious humangirl who wanted fresh gossip.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　And I was also listening to Angela Weber.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I had not forgotten the gratitude I felt to her—for thinking nothing but kind thingstoward Bella in the first place, and then for her help last night. So I waited \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethrough themorning, looking for something that she wanted. I assumed it would be an easy; like anyother human, there must be some bauble or toy she wanted particularly. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSeveral,probably. I would deliver something anonymously and call us even.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　But Angela proved almost as unaccommodating as Bella with her thoughts. Shewas oddly content for a teenager. Happy. Perhaps this was the reason for her \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eunusualkindness—she was one of those rare people who had what they wanted and wanted whatthey had. If she wasn’t paying attention to her teachers and her notes, she \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewas thinking\u0026nbsp; of the twin little brothers she was taking to the beach this weekend—anticipating theirexcitement with an almost maternal pleasure. She cared for them \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eoften, but was notresentful of this fact… It was very sweet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　But not really helpful to me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　There had to be something she wanted. I would just have to keep looking. Butlater. It was time for Bella’s trig class with Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I wasn’t watching where I was going as I made my way to English. Jessica wasalready in her seat, both her feet tapping impatiently against the floor as she waited \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eforBella to arrive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Conversely, once I settled into my assigned seat in the classroom, I becameutterly still. I had to remind myself to fidget now and then. To keep up the charade. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eItwas difficult, my thoughts were so focused on Jessica’s. I hoped she would pay attention,really try to read Bella’s face for me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jessica’s tapping intensified when Bella walked into the room.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She looks…glum. Why? Maybe there’s nothing going on with Edward Cullen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　That would be a disappointment. Except…then he’s still available… If he’s suddenlyinterested in dating, I don’t mind helping out with that…Bella’s face didn\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e’t look glum, it looked reluctant. She was worried—she knew Iwould hear all of this. I smiled to myself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Tell me everything!” Jess demanded while Bella was still removing her jacket tohang it on the back of her seat. She was moving with deliberation, unwilling.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Ugh, she’s so slow. Let’s get to the juicy stuff!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What do you want to know?” Bella stalled as she took her seat.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What happened last night?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“He bought me dinner, and then he drove me home.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　And then? C’mon, there has to be more than that! She’s lying anyway, I knowthat. I’m going to call her on it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“How did you get home so fast?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I watched Bella roll her eyes at the suspicious Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“He drives like a maniac. It was terrifying.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; She smiled a tiny smile, and I laughed out loud, interrupting Mr. Mason’sannouncements. I tried to turn the laugh into a cough, but no one was fooled. Mr. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMasonshot me an irritated look, but I didn’t even bother to listen to the thought behind it. I washearing Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Huh. She sounds like she’s telling the truth. Why is she making me pull this outof her, word by word? I would be bragging at the top of my lungs if it were me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Was it like a date—did you tell him to meet you there?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jessica watched surprise cross Bella’s expression, and was disappointed at howgenuine it seemed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“No—I was very surprised to see him there,” Bella told her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　What is going on?? “But he picked you up for school today?” There has to bemore to the story.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yes—that was a surprise, too. He noticed I didn’t have a jacket last night.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　That’s not very much fun, Jessica thought, disappointed again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was tired of her line of questioning—I wanted to hear something I didn’t alreadyknow. I hoped she wasn’t so dissatisfied that she would skip the questions I \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewas waitingfor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“So are you going out again?” Jessica demanded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“He offered to drive me to Seattle Saturday because he thinks my truck isn’t up toit—does that count?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Hmm. He sure is going out of his way to…well, take care of her, sort of. Theremust be something there on his side, if not on hers. How could THAT be? Bella’s \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ecrazy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yes,” Jessica answered Bella’s question.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Well, then,” Bella concluded. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Wow…Edward Cullen.” Whether she likes him or not, this is major.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I know,” Bella sighed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The tone of her voice encouraged Jessica. Finally—she sounds like she gets it!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She must realize…“Wait!” Jessica said, suddenly remembering her most vital question. “Has hekissed you?” Please say yes. And then describe every second!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; “No,” Bella mumbled, and then she looked down at her hands, her face falling.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“It’s not like that.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Damn. I wish… Ha. Looks like she does to.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I frowned. Bella did look upset about something, but it couldn’t bedisappointment like Jessica assumed. She couldn’t want that. Not knowing what sheknew. She \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ecouldn’t want to be that close to my teeth. For all she knew, I had fangs.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Do you think Saturday…?” Jessica prodded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella looked even more frustrated as she said, “I really doubt it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Yeah, she does wish. That sucks for her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Was it because I was watching all this through the filter of Jessica’s perceptionsthat it seemed like Jessica was right?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　For a half-second I was distracted by the idea, the impossibility, of what it wouldbe like to try to kiss her. My lips to her lips, cold stone to warm, yielding \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003esilk…And then she dies.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I shook my head, wincing, and made myself pay attention.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What did you talk about?” Did you talk to him, or did you make him drag everyounce of information out of you like this?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I smiled ruefully. Jessica wasn’t far off.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I don’t know, Jess, lots of stuff. We talked about the English essay a little.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　A very little. I smiled wider.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Oh, c’MON. “Please, Bella! Give me some details.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella deliberated for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Well…okay, I’ve got one. You should have seen the waitress flirting with him—it was over the top. But he didn’t pay any attention to her at all.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　What a strange detail to share. I was surprised Bella had even noticed. It seemeda very inconsequential thing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Interesting… “That’s a good sign. Was she pretty?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Hmm. Jessica thought more of it that I did. Must be a female thing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Very,” Bella told her. “And probably nineteen or twenty.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; Jessica was momentarily distracted by a memory of Mike on her date Mondaynight—Mike being a little too friendly with a waitress who Jessica did not consider \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eprettyat all. She shoved the memory away and returned, stifling her irritation, to her quest fordetails.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Even better. He must like you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I think so,” Bella said slowly, and I was on the edge of my seat, my body rigidlystill. “But it’s hard to tell. He’s always so cryptic.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I must not have been as transparently obvious and out of control as I’d thought.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Still…observant as she was… How could she not realize that I was in love with her? Isifted through our conversation, almost surprised that I hadn’t said the \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewords out loud. Ithad felt like that knowledge had been the subtext of every word between us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Wow. How do you sit there across from a male model and make conversation?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I don’t know how you’re brave enough to be alone with him,” Jessica said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Shock flashed across Bella’s face. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Weird reaction. What does she think I meant? “He’s so…” What’s the rightword? “Intimidating. I wouldn’t know what to say to him.” I couldn’t even \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003espeakEnglish to him today, and all he said was good morning. I must have sounded like suchan idiot.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella smiled. “I do have some trouble with incoherency when I’m around him.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She must be trying to make Jessica feel better. She was almost unnaturally self-possessed when we were together.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Oh well,” Jessica sighed. “He is unbelievably gorgeous.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella’s face was suddenly colder. Her eyes flashed the same way they did whenshe resented some injustice. Jessica didn’t process the change in her expression.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“There’s a lot more to him than that,” Bella snapped.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Oooh. Now we’re getting somewhere. “Really? Like what?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella gnawed her lip for a moment. “I can’t explain it right,” she finally said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“But he’s even more unbelievable behind the face.” She looked away from Jessica, hereyes slightly unfocused as if she was staring at something very far away.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The feeling I felt now was loosely similar to how it felt when Carlisle or Esmepraised me beyond what I deserved. Similar, but more intense, more consuming.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; Sell stupid somewhere else—there’s nothing better than that face! Unless it’s hisbody. Swoon. “Is that possible?” Jessica giggled.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella didn’t turn. She continued to stare into the distance, ignoring Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　A normal person would be gloating. Maybe if I keep the questions simple. Ha ha.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Like I’m talking to a kindergartener. “So you like him, then?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was rigid again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella didn’t look at Jessica. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I mean, do you really like him?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Look at that blush!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“How much do you like him?” Jessica demanded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The English room could have gone up in flames and I wouldn’t have noticed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella’s face was bright red now—I could almost feel the heat from the mentalpicture.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Too much,” she whispered. “More than he likes me. But I don’t see how I canhelp that.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Shoot! What did Mr. Varner just ask? “Um—which number, Mr. Varner?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It was good that Jessica could no longer quiz Bella. I needed a minute.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　What on earth was that girl thinking now? More than he likes me? How did shecome up with that? But I don’t see how I can help that? What was that supposed tomean? \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t fit a rational explanation to the words. They were practically senseless.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It seemed I couldn’t take anything for granted. Obvious things, things that madeperfect sense, somehow got twisted up and turned backwards in that bizarre brain of \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ehers.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　More than he likes me? Maybe I shouldn’t rule out the institution just yet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I glared at the clock, gritting my teeth. How could mere minutes feel soimpossibly long to an immortal? Where was my perspective?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　My jaw was tight throughout Mr. Varner’s entire trigonometry lesson. I heardmore of that than the lecture in my own class. Bella and Jessica didn’t speak again, \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ebutJessica peeked at Bella several times, and once her face was brilliant scarlet again for noapparent reason.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; Lunch couldn’t come fast enough.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I wasn’t sure if Jessica would get some of the answers I was waiting for when theclass was over, but Bella was quicker than she was.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　As soon as the bell sounded, Bella turned to Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“In English, Mike asked me if you said anything about Monday night,” Bella said,a smile pulling at the corners of her lips. I understood this for what is was—\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eoffence asthe best defense.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Mike asked about me? Joy made Jessica’s mind suddenly unguarded, softer,without its usual snide edge. “You’re kidding! What did you say?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I told him you said you had a lot of fun—and he looked pleased.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Tell me exactly what he said, and your exact answer!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　That was all I was going to get from Jessica today, clearly. Bella was smiling likeshe was thinking the same thing. Like she’d won the round.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Well, lunch would be another story. I would have better success with gettinganswers out of her than Jessica, I would make sure of that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I could hardly bear to check in occasionally with Jessica through the fourth hour.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I had no patience for her obsessive thoughts of Mike Newton. I’d had more than enoughof him in the last two weeks. He was lucky to be alive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I moved apathetically through gym class with Alice, the way we always movedwhen it came to physical activity with humans. She was my teammate, naturally. It wasthe \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003efirst day of badminton. I sighed with boredom, swinging the racket in slow motion totap the birdie back to the other side. Lauren Mallory was on the other team; she \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003emissed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Alice was twirling her racket like a baton, staring at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　We all hated gym, Emmett especially. Throwing games was an affront to hispersonal philosophy. Gym seemed worse today than usual—I felt just as irritated asEmmett \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ealways did.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Before my head could explode with impatience, Coach Clapp called the gamesand sent us out early. I was ridiculously grateful that he’d skipped breakfast—a \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003efreshattempt to diet—and the consequent hunger had him in a hurry to leave campus to find agreasy lunch somewhere. He promised himself he would start over tomorrow...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　This gave me enough time to get to the math building before Bella’s class ended.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; Enjoy yourself, Alice thought as she headed off to meet Jasper. Just a few daysmore to be patient. I suppose you won’t say hi to Bella for me, will you?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I shook my head, exasperated. Were all psychics so smug?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　FYI, it’s going to be sunny on both sides of the sound this weekend. You mightwant to rearrange your plans.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I sighed as I continued in the opposite direction. Smug, but definitely useful.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I leaned against the wall by the door, waiting. I was close enough that I couldhear Jessica’s voice through the bricks as well as her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You’re not sitting with us today, are you?” She looks all…lit up. I bet there’stons she didn’t tell me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I don’t think so,” Bella answered, oddly unsure.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Hadn’t I promised to spend lunch with her? What was she thinking?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They came out of the class together, and both girls’ eyes widened when they sawme. But I could only hear Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Nice. Wow. Oh, yeah, there’s more going on here than she’s telling me. MaybeI’ll call her tonight… Or maybe I shouldn’t encourage her. Huh. I hope he moves \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003epasther in a hurry. Mike is cute but…wow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“See you later, Bella.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella walked toward me, pausing a step away, still unsure. Her skin was pinkacross her cheekbones.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I knew her well enough now to be sure that there was no fear behind herhesitation. Apparently, this was about some gulf she imagined between her feelings andmine. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMore than he likes me. Absurd!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Hello,” I said, my voice a tad curt.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her face got brighter. “Hi.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She didn’t seem inclined to say anything else, so I led the way to the cafeteria andshe walked silently beside me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The jacket had worked—her scent was not the blow it usually was. It was just anintensification of the pain I already felt. I could ignore it more easily than I \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eonce wouldhave believed possible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; Bella was restless as we waited in line, toying absently with the zipper on herjacket and shifting nervously from foot to foot. She glanced at me often, but \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewhenevershe met my gaze, she looked down as if she were embarrassed. Was this because somany people were staring at us? Maybe she could hear the loud whispers—the \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003egossipwas verbal as well as mental today.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Or maybe she realized, from my expression, that she was in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She didn’t say anything until I was assembling her lunch. I didn’t know what sheliked—not yet—so I grabbed one of everything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What are you doing?” she hissed in a low voice. “You’re not getting all that forme?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I shook my head, and shoved the tray up to the register. “Half is for me, ofcourse.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She raised one eyebrow skeptically, but said nothing more as I paid for the foodand escorted her to the table we’d sat at last week before her disastrous \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eexperience withblood typing. It seemed like much more than a few days. Everything was different now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She sat across from me again. I pushed the tray toward her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Take whatever you want,” I encouraged.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She picked up an apple and twisted it in her hands, a speculative look on her face.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’m curious.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　What a surprise.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What would you do if someone dared you to eat food?” she continued in a lowvoice that wouldn’t carry to human ears. Immortal ears were another matter, if those \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eearswere paying attention. I probably should have mentioned something to them earlier…“You’re always curious,” I complained. Oh well. It wasn’t like I hadn’t had \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003etoeat before. It was part of the charade. An unpleasant part.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I reached for the closest thing, and held her eyes while I bite off a small bite ofwhatever it was. Without looking, I couldn’t tell. It was as slimy and chunky \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eandrepulsive as any other human food. I chewed swiftly and swallowed, trying to keep thegrimace off my face. The gob of food moved slowly and uncomfortably down my \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethroat.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I sighed as I thought of how I would have to choke it back up later. Disgusting.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella’s expression was shocked. Impressed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; I wanted to roll my eyes. Of course we would have perfected such deceptions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“If someone dared you to eat dirt, you could, couldn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her nose wrinkled and she smiled. “I did once…on a dare. It wasn’t so bad.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I laughed. “I suppose I’m not surprised.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They look cozy, don’t they? Good body language. I’ll give Bella my take later.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He’s leaning toward her just the way he should, if he’s interested. He looks interested.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He looks…perfect. Jessica sighed. Yum.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I met Jessica’s curious eyes, and she looked away nervously, giggling to the girlnext to her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Hmmm. Probably better to stick to Mike. Reality, not fantasy…“Jessica’s analyzing everything I do,” I informed Bella. “She’ll break it down foryou later.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I pushed the plate of food back towards her—pizza, I realized—wondering howbest to begin. My former frustration flared as the words repeated in my head: More \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethanhe likes me. But I don’t see how I can help that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She took a bite from the same slice of pizza. It amazed me how trusting she was.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Of course, she didn’t know I was poisonous—not that sharing food would hurt her. Still,I expected her to treat me differently. As something other. She never did—\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eat least, notin a negative way…I would start off gently.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“So the waitress was pretty, was she?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She raised the eyebrow again. “You really didn’t notice?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　As if any woman could hope to capture my attention from Bella. Absurd, again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“No. I wasn’t paying attention. I had a lot on my mind.” Not the least of whichhad been the soft cling of her thin blouse…Good thing she’d worn that ugly \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003esweater today.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Poor girl,” Bella said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She liked that I hadn’t found the waitress interesting in any way. I couldunderstand that. How many times had I imagined crippling Mike Newton in the biologyroom?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; She couldn’t honestly believe that her human feelings, the fruition of seventeenshort mortal years, could be stronger than the immortal passions that had been \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ebuildingup in me for a century.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Something you said to Jessica…” I couldn’t keep my voice casual. “Well, itbothers me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She was immediately on the defensive. “I’m not surprised you heard somethingyou didn’t like. You know what they say about eavesdroppers.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Eavesdroppers never hear good of themselves, that was the saying.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I warned you I would be listening,” I reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“And I warned you that you didn’t want to know everything I was thinking.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Ah, she was thinking of when I’d made her cry. Remorse made my voice thicker.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You did. You aren’t precisely right, though. I do want to know what you’re thinking—everything. I just wish…that you wouldn’t be thinking some things.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　More half-lies. I knew I shouldn’t want her to care about me. But I did. Ofcourse I did.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“That’s quite a distinction,” she grumbled, scowling at me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“But that’s not really the point at the moment.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Then what is?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She leaned toward me, her hand cupped lightly around her throat. It drew myeye—distracted me. How soft that skin must feel…Focus, I commanded myself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Do you truly believe that you care more for me than I do for you?” I asked. Thequestion sounded ridiculous to me, like the words were scrambled.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her eyes were wide, her breathing stopped. Then she looked away, blinkingquickly. Her breath came in a low gasp.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You’re doing it again,” she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Dazzling me,” she admitted, meeting my eyes warily.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Oh.” Hmm. I wasn’t quite sure what to do about that. Nor was I sure that Ididn’t want to dazzle her. I was still thrilled that I could. But it wasn’t helping \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003etheprogression of the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; “It’s not your fault.” She sighed. “You can’t help it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Are you going to answer my question?” I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She stared at the table. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　That was all she said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yes, you are going to answer, or yes, you really think that?” I asked impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yes, I really think that,” she said without looking up. There was a faintundertone of sadness in her voice. She blushed again, and her teeth moved \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eunconsciouslyto worry her lip.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Abruptly, I realized that this was very hard for her to admit, because she trulybelieved it. And I was no better than that coward, Mike, asking for her to confirm \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eherfeelings before I’d confirmed my own. It didn’t matter that I felt I’d make my sideabundantly clear. It hadn’t gotten through to her, and so I had no excuse.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You’re wrong,” I promised. She must hear the tenderness in my voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella looked up to me, her eyes opaque, giving nothing away. “You can’t knowthat,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She thought that I was underestimating her feelings because I couldn’t hear herthoughts. But, in truth, the problem was that she was underestimating mine.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What makes you think so?” I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She stared back at me, the furrow between her brows, biting her lips. For themillionth time, I wished desperately that I could just hear her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was about to beg her to tell me what thought she was struggling with, but sheheld up a finger to keep me from speaking.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Let me think,” she requested.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　As long as she was simply organizing her thoughts, I could be patient.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Or I could pretend to be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She pressed her hands together, twining and untwining her slender fingers. Shewas watching her hands as if they belonged to someone else while she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Well, aside from the obvious,” she murmured. “Sometimes… I can’t be sure—Idon’t know how to read minds—but sometimes it seems like you’re trying to \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003esaygoodbye when you’re saying something else.” She didn’t look up.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; She’d caught that, had she? Did she realize that it was only weakness andselfishness that kept me here? Did she think less of me for that?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Perceptive,” I breathed, and then watched in horror as pain twisted herexpression. I hurried to contradict her assumption. “That’s exactly why you’re \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewrong,though—” I began, and then I paused, remembering the first words of her explanation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They bothered me, though I wasn’t sure I understood exactly. “What do you mean, ‘theobvious’?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Well, look at me,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was looking. All I ever did was look at her. What did she mean?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’m absolutely ordinary,” she explained. “Well, except for the bad things like allthe near death experiences and being so clumsy that I’m almost disabled. And \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003elook atyou.” She fanned the air toward me, like she was making some point so obvious itwasn’t worth spelling out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She thought she was ordinary? She thought that I was somehow preferable toher? In whose estimation? Silly, narrow-minded, blind humans like Jessica or Ms.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Cope? How could she not realize that she was the most beautiful…most exquisite…Those words weren’t even enough.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　And she had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You don’t see yourself very clearly, you know,” I told her. “I’ll admit you’redead-on about the bad things…” I laughed humorlessly. I did not find the evil \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003efate whohaunted her comical. The clumsiness, however, was sort of funny. Endearing. Wouldshe believe me if I told her she was beautiful, inside and out? Perhaps she \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewould findcorroboration more persuasive. “But you didn’t hear what every human male wasthinking on your first day.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Ah, the hope, the thrill, the eagerness of those thoughts. The speed with whichthey’d turned to impossible fantasies. Impossible, because she wanted none of them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was the one she said yes to.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　My smile must have been smug.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her face was blank with surprise. “I don’t believe it,” she mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Trust me just this once—you are the opposite of ordinary.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her existence alone was excuse enough to justify the creation of the entire world.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; She wasn’t used to compliments, I could see that. Another thing she would justhave to get used to. She flushed, and changed the subject. “But I’m not \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003esayinggoodbye.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Don’t you see? That’s what proves me right. I care the most, because if I can doit…” Would I ever be unselfish enough to do the right thing? I shook my head \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eindespair. I would have to find the strength. She deserved a life. Not what Alice had seencoming for her. “If leaving is the right thing to do…” And it had to be the \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eright thing,didn’t it? There was no reckless angel. Bella didn’t belong with me. “Then I’ll hurtmyself to keep from hurting you, to keep you safe.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　As I said the words, I willed them to be true.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She glared at me. Somehow, my words had angered her. “And you don’t think Iwould do the same?” she demanded furiously.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　So furious—so soft and so fragile. How could she ever hurt anyone? “You’dnever have to make the choice,” I told her, depressed anew by the wide \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003edifferencebetween us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She stared at me, concern replacing the anger in her eyes and bringing out thelittle pucker between them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　There was something truly wrong with the order of the universe if someone sogood and so breakable did not merit a guardian angel to keep her out of trouble.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Well, I thought with dark humor, at least she has a guardian vampire.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I smiled. How I loved my excuse to stay. “Of course, keeping you safe isbeginning to feel like a full-time occupation that requires my constant presence.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She smiled, too. “No one has tried to do away with me today,” she said lightly,and then her face turned speculative for half a second before her eyes went opaque \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eagain.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yet,” I added dryly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yet,” she agreed to my surprise. I’d expected her to deny any need forprotection.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　How could he? That selfish jackass! How could he do this to us? Rosalie’spiercing mental shriek broke through my concentration.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Easy, Rose,” I heard Emmett whisper from across the cafeteria. His arm wasaround her shoulders, holding her tight into his side—restraining her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; Sorry, Edward, Alice thought guiltily. She could tell Bella knew too much fromyour conversation…and, well, it would have been worse if I hadn’t told her the \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003etruth rightaway. Trust me on that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I winced at the mental picture that followed, at what would have happened if I’dtold Rosalie that Bella knew I was a vampire at home, where Rosalie didn’t have a \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003efa.adeto keep up. I’d have to hide my Aston Martin somewhere out of state if she didn’t calmdown by the time school was over. The sight of my favorite car, mangled \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eand burning,was upsetting—though I knew I’d earned the retribution.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jasper was not much happier.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I’d deal with the others later. I only had so much time allotted to be to be withBella, and I wasn’t going to waste it. And hearing Alice had reminded me that I \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ehadsome business to attend to.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I have another question for you,” I said, tuning out Rosalie’s mental hysterics.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Shoot,” Bella said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Do you really need to go to Seattle this Saturday, or was that just an excuse toget out of saying no to all your admirers?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She grimaced at me. “You know, I haven’t forgiven you for the Tyler thing yet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It’s your fault that he’s deluded himself into thinking I’m going to prom with him.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Oh, he would have found a chance to ask you without me—I just really wantedto watch your face.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I laughed now, remembering her aghast expression. Nothing I’d ever told herabout my own dark story had ever made her look so horrified. The truth didn’t \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003efrightenher. She wanted to be with me. Mind-boggling.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“If I’d asked you, would you have turned me down?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Probably not,” she said. “But I would have cancelled later—faked an illness or asprained ankle.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　How strange. “Why would you do that?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She shook her head, as if she was disappointed that I did not understand at once.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You’ve never seen me in gym, I guess, but I would have thought that you wouldunderstand.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; Ah. “Are you referring to the fact that you can’t walk across a flat, stable surfacewithout finding something to trip over?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Obviously.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“That wouldn’t be a problem. It’s all in the leading.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　For a brief fraction of a second, I was overwhelmed by the idea of holding her inmy arms at a dance—where she would surely wear something pretty and delicate \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eratherthan this hideous sweater.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　With perfect clarity, I remembered how her body had felt under mine after I’dthrown her out of the way of the oncoming van. Stronger than the panic or \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethedesperation or the chagrin, I could remember that sensation. She’d been so warm and sosoft, fitting easily into my own stone shape…I wrenched myself back from the \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ememory.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“But you never told me—” I said quickly, preventing her from arguing with meabout her clumsiness, as she clearly intended to do. “Are you resolved on going \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003etoSeattle, or do you mind if we do something different?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Devious—giving her a choice without giving her the option of getting away fromme for the day. Hardly fair of me. But I had made her a promise last night…and I \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003elikedthe idea of fulfilling it—almost as much as that idea terrified me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The sun would be shining Saturday. I could show her the real me, if I was braveenough to endure her horror and disgust. I knew just the place to take such a risk…\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I’m open to alternatives,” Bella said. “But I do have a favor to ask.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　A qualified yes. What would she want from me?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Can I drive?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Was this her idea of humor? “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Well, mostly because when I told Charlie I was going to Seattle, he specificallyasked if I was going alone and, at the time, I was. If he asked again, I probably \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewouldn’tlie, but I don’t think he will ask again, and leaving my truck at home would just bring upthe subject unnecessarily. And also, because your driving frightens \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eme.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; I rolled my eyes at her. “Of all the things about me that could frighten you, youworry about my driving.” Truly, her brain worked backwards. I shook my \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ehead,disgusted.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward, Alice called urgently.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Suddenly I was staring into a bright circle of sunlight, caught up in one of Alice’svisions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It was a place I knew well, the place I’d just considered taking Bella—a littlemeadow where no one ever went beside myself. A quiet, pretty place where I \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ecouldcount on being alone—far enough from any trail or human habitation that even my mindcould have peace and quiet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Alice recognized it, too, because she had seen me there not so long ago in anothervision—one of those flickering, indistinct visions that Alice had shown me the \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003emorningI’d saved Bella from the van.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　In that flickering vision, I hadn’t been alone. And now it was clear—Bella waswith me there. So I was brave enough. She stared at me, rainbows dancing across \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eherface, her eyes fathomless.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It’s the same place, Alice thought, her mind full of a horror that did not match thevision. Tension, perhaps, but horror? What did she mean, the same place?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　And then I saw it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward! Alice protested shrilly. I love her, Edward!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I shut her out viciously.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She didn’t love Bella the way I did. Her vision was impossible. Wrong. She wasblinded somehow, seeing impossibilities.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Not even a half a second had passed. Bella was looking curiously at my face,waiting for me to approve her request. Had she seen the flash of dread, or had it been \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003etooquick for her?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I focused on her, on our unfinished conversation, pushing Alice and her flawed,lying visions far from my thoughts. They didn’t deserve my attention.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I wasn’t able to keep up the playful tone of our banter, though.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Won’t you want to tell your father that you’re spending the day with me?” Iasked, darkness seeping into my voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; I shoved at the visions again, trying to push them farther away, to keep them fromflickering through my head.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“With Charlie, less is always more,” Bella said, certain of this fact. “Where arewe going, anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Alice was wrong. Dead wrong. There was no chance of that. And it was just anold vision, invalid now. Things had changed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“The weather will be nice,” I told her slowly, fighting the panic and indecision.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Alice was wrong. I would continue as if I hadn’t heard or seen anything. “So I’ll bestaying out of the public eye…and you can stay with me, if you’d like to.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella caught the significance at once; her eyes were bright and eager. “Andyou’ll show me what you meant, about the sun?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Maybe, like so many times before, her reaction would be the opposite of what Iexpected. I smiled at that possibility, struggling to return to the lighter moment. “\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　But…” She hadn’t said yes. “If you don’t want to be…alone with me, I’d still rather youdidn’t go to Seattle by yourself. I shudder to think of the trouble \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eyou could find in a citythat size.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her lips pressed together; she was offended.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Phoenix is three times bigger than Seattle—just in population. In physicalsize—”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“But apparently your number wasn’t up in Phoenix,” I said, cutting off herjustifications. “So I’d rather you stayed with me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She could stay forever and it would not be long enough.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I shouldn’t think that way. We didn’t have forever. The passing seconds countedmore than they ever had before; each second changed her while I remained untouched.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“As it happens, I don’t mind being alone with you,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　No—because her instincts were backwards.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I know.” I sighed. “You should tell Charlie, though.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Why in the world would I do that?” she asked, sounding horrified.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I glared at her, the visions I couldn’t quite manage to repress swirling sickeninglythrough my head.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; “To give me some small incentive to bring you back,” I hissed. She should giveme that much—one witness to compel me to be cautious.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Why had Alice forced this knowledge on me now?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Bella swallowed loudly, and stared at me for a long moment. What did she see?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I think I’ll take my chances,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Ugh! Did she get some thrill out of risking her life? Some shot of adrenaline shecraved?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I scowled at Alice, who met my glare with a warning glance. Beside her, Rosaliewas glowering furiously, but I couldn’t have cared less. Let her destroy the car. It \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewasjust a toy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Let’s talk about something else,” Bella suggested suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I looked back at her, wondering how she could be so oblivious to what reallymattered. Why wouldn’t she see me for the monster I was?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What do you want to talk about?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her eyes darted to the left and then the right, as if checking to make sure therewere no eavesdroppers. She must be planning to introduce another myth-related \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003etopic.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her eyes froze for a second and her body stiffened, and then she looked back to me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Why did you go to that Goat Rocks place last weekend…to hunt? Charlie said itwasn’t a good place to hike, because of bears.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　So oblivious. I stared at her, raising one eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Bears?” she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I smiled wryly, watching that sink in. Would this make her take me seriously?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Would anything?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She pulled her expression together. “You know, bears are not in season,” she saidseverely, narrowing her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She lost control over her face again for a moment. Her lips fell open.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Bears?” she said again, a tentative question this time rather than a gasp of shock.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Grizzly is Emmett’s favorite.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I watched her eyes, seeing this settle in.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; “Hmm,” she murmured. She took a bite of the pizza, looking down. She chewedthoughtfully, and then took a drink.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“So,” she said, finally looking up. “What’s your favorite?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I supposed I should have expected something like that, but I hadn’t. Bella wasalways interesting, at the very least.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Mountain lion,” I answered brusquely.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Ah,” she said in a neutral tone. Her heartbeat continued steady and even, as ifwe were discussing a favorite restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Fine, then. If she wanted to act like this was nothing unusual…“Of course, we have to be careful not to impact the environment with injudicioushunting,” I told \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eher, my voice detached and clinical. “We try to focus on areas with anoverpopulation of predators—ranging as far away as we need. There’s always plenty ofdeer and \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eelk here, and they’ll do, but where’s the fun in that?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She listened with a politely interested expression, as if I were a teacher giving alecture. I had to smile.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Where indeed,” she murmured calmly, taking another bite of pizza.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Early spring is Emmett’s favorite bear season,” I said, continuing with thelecture. “They’re just coming out of hibernation, so they’re more irritable.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Seventy years later, and he still hadn’t gotten over losing that first match.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Nothing more fun than an irritated grizzly bear,” Bella agreed, noddingsolemnly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I couldn’t hold back a chuckle as I shook my head at her illogical calm. It had tobe put on. “Tell me what you’re really thinking, please.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’m trying to picture it—but I can’t,” she said, the crease appearing between hereyes. “How to you hunt a bear without weapons?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Oh, we have weapons,” I told her, and then flashed her a wide smile. I expectedher to recoil, but she was very still, watching me. “Just not the kind they \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003econsider whenwriting hunting laws. If you’ve ever seen a bear attack on television, you should be ableto visualize Emmett hunting.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She glanced toward the table where the others sat, and shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\u0026nbsp; Finally. And then I laughed at myself, because I knew part of me was wishingshe would stay oblivious.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her dark eyes were wide and deep as she stared at me now. “Are you like a bear,too?” she asked in an almost-whisper.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“More like the lion, or so they tell me,” I told her, striving to sound detachedagain. “Perhaps our preferences are indicative.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her lips pulled up a tiny bit at the corners. “Perhaps,” she repeated. And then herhead leaned to the side, and curiosity was suddenly clear in her eyes. “Is \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethat something Imight get to see?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I didn’t need pictures from Alice to illustrate this horror—my imagination wasquite enough.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Absolutely not,” I snarled at her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She jerked away from me, her eyes bewildered and frightened.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I leaned back, too, wanting to put space between us. She was never going to see,was she? She wouldn’t do one thing to help me keep her alive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Too scary for me?” she asked, her voice even. Her heart, however, was stillmoving in double time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“If that were it, I would take you out tonight,” I retorted through my teeth. “Youneed a healthy dose of fear. Nothing could be more beneficial for you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Then why?” she demanded, undeterred.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I glared at her blackly, waiting for her to be afraid. I was afraid. I could imagineonly too clearly having Bella near when I hunted…Her eyes remained curious, \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eimpatient, nothing more. She waited for her answer,not giving in.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　But our hour was up.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Later,” I snapped, and I rose to my feet. “We’re going to be late.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She looked around herself, disoriented, like she’d forgotten we were at lunch.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Like she’d forgotten we were even at school—surprised that we were not alone i\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/160/6112.html","bookId":316,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:58:09 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:58:09 AM"}
