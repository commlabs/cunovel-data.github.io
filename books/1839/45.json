She couldn’t think of a logical reason to give the inquisitive man. And so she gave him an illogical one. “Because my mama’s coming. That is why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay nodded, then turned to repeat her explanation to the MacBain soldier seated next to him. “Her mama’s coming. M’lady wants everything to be just so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MacBain soldier nodded. “Aye, she does,” he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna turned her attention to the table so the men wouldn’t see her smile. She wanted to laugh over Lindsay’s naïveté but didn’t dare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinner was a wonderful success by her measure. Calum and Leila started out as stiff as boards, but by the time the meal was finished they were talking to each other in low whispers. She was straining to hear what they were talking about when Gabriel realized what she was doing and pulled her closer to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There will be a wedding soon,” Gabriel remarked with a nod in Calum’s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna smiled. “Yes,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mention of marriage turned her thoughts to Clare. The MacKay woman needed a husband, and in Johanna’s estimation, there were several fine possibilities sitting at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keith? Have you—” Johanna began, thinking to ask him if he’d considered his future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeith wouldn’t let her finish her question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been waiting for you to bring that up,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened in surprise. “You have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was my duty to tell your husband, m’lady. I tried to keep your promise, even felt a bit relieved because I felt responsible for the Maclaurin women and their offense was mine, but I didn’t get through the full day without realizing my first loyalty belonged to the MacBain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna had never seen a grown man blush until now. Keith was turning red with embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind, m’lady.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t about to let the matter drop. “Exactly what did you tell my husband?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel answered her. “He explained about the names, Johanna, and how Glynis came up with . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn’t let him finish. “She was most contrite, husband. You mustn’t take issue with her. Promise me you won’t talk to her about this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Gabriel had already had a talk with Glynis, he felt it safe to give his wife his promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, satisifed. “I wondered where you’d heard I was being called a coward,” she said then. She turned her frown to Keith. “It never entered my mind, however, that you would tell my husband. I believed someone else had overheard Glynis and then went to his laird with the tale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was his duty to tell me,” Gabriel announced. “You will thank him, wife, not sanction him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It all came out in the wash,” Johanna announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What in thunder does that mean?” Gabriel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s giving us another lesson, Laird,” Keith explained with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see,” Gabriel replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nay, Laird, you won’t see. None of your wife’s lessons make any sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna would have explained what she’d meant by her remark, but Alex drew her full attention when he came running into the hall. She saw the frightened look on his face and immediately stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex circled the table and hurled himself into her arms. He buried his face in her plaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened, Alex?” she asked, her concern apparent in her voice. “Did you have a bad dream?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s something under the bed. I heard it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel rolled his eyes in exasperation. He reached over to pull his son away from Johanna. Alex wouldn’t let go until his father ordered him to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sleeping on a mat on the floor, Alex,” Gabriel said. “It isn’t possible for anything to get underneath.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Papa,” Alex argued. “I got in your bed. It’s under there. It might get me if I close my eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alex ...” his father began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d better go up with him and look under the bed, husband. It’s the only way he’ll be convinced. Besides, there might really be something under there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is,” Alex insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel let out a loud sigh before complying with his family’s wishes. He stood up, lifted his son into his arms, and walked out of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna took her seat again. She smiled at Keith. She was thrilled to have his attention without Gabriel. Her husband would certainly interfere in the discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Children,” Johanna drawled out. “They’re such a joy. When you get married and have a family of your own, you’ll understand what I’m saying. You are going to get married someday, aren’t you, Keith?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, m’lady,” he answered. “Next summer as a matter of fact. Bridgid MacCoy has agreed to become my wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t quite hide her disappointment. She turned her gaze down the table and settled on Michael as a possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her staring at him. He smiled. She nodded. “Children,” she began again. “They’re wonderful, aren’t they, Michael?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you say so, m’lady.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I do say,” she replied. “When you get married, you’ll understand. You do plan to marry someday, don’t you, Michael?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eventually,” he answered with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you anyone in mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you matchmaking, m’lady?” Keith asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would you think that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll marry Helen when I’m ready,” Michael interjected. “I’ve told her I will, and she agreed to wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna frowned. The possibilities were becoming a bit limited. She turned to Niall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Children ...” she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is matchmaking,” Keith announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as though he’d just shouted the alarm that they were under siege. The soldiers literally jumped from their stools. They bowed to Johanna and left the room in the space of a single minute. She didn’t even have enough time to order them back into their seats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the soldiers already spoken for remained. And Father MacKechnie, of course, but then he wasn’t a viable possibility either, for priests couldn’t marry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel came back to an almost empty hall. He looked around him in puzzlement, shrugged, and then sat down again to finish his supper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?” she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked sheepish. “There was something under the bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, for she believed he was jesting with her. Then he explained, “Dumfries crawled underneath.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeila and Calum both stood up. Leila bowed to her laird. “Thank you for giving me the honor of dining with you,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel nodded. Leila blushed. “Thank you, too, m’lady.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s dark,” Calum announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t have anything more to add. Johanna tried not to smile. “Perhaps you should escort Leila home,” she suggested, “if it’s dark, Calum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier nodded. “As you wish, m’lady.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalum motioned for Leila to walk ahead of him. Johanna turned back to her husband. Keith caught her attention then. The look of surprise on his face indicated he’d only just realized a romance was budding between Leila and Calum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly grinned. He stood up, bowed to his laird, and then called out, “Wait up, Calum. I’ll walk with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna could hear the laughter in his voice. Calum wasn’t amused by Keith’s offer. “You don’t need to . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, but I want to,” he said. He hurried to catch up with the couple. “It’s dark outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeila kept walking. Calum tried to shove Keith aside. The soldier wouldn’t be shoved, however. They bickered back and forth as they left the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder if those two will ever learn to get along,” Johanna remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather MacKechnie was feeling lonely. He picked up his goblet and moved to take Keith’s. place at the other table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just a bit of good-hearted rivalry between two commanders,” the priest remarked. “Laird, that was a fine speech you gave tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it was,” Johanna agreed. “I would like to ask you something, though,” she added. “Why did you wait so long? Why didn’t you give your speech a month ago or two months ago? You would have saved me quite a lot of aggravation, husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel leaned back in his chair. “They weren’t ready then, Johanna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But they were ready tonight,” the priest interjected with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still puzzled. “What made them ready tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not what,” the priest said, “but who, lass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t understand. Gabriel nodded. A warm glint had come into his eyes. “You made them ready to accept the change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did I do that?” she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s begging for compliments,” Gabriel told the priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It appears she is,” Father MacKechine bantered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m begging to understand,” she countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was your quiet defiance,” Gabriel finally explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still didn’t know what he was talking about. The priest seemed to understand, however, for he nodded several times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Explain my quiet defiance to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel laughed. “You will never make me believe you couldn’t keep track of which plaid to wear on which day,” he said. “You forgot on purpose, didn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gabriel, no one forgets on purpose,” she argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You put no importance on keeping track,” the priest said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. “That is true,” she admitted. “I thought it was nonsense, but I . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quiet defiance,” Gabriel repeated. “ ’Twas the reason you learned to read,” he added. “Isn’t that so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but that was different,” she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it isn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna let out a sigh. She knew she shouldn’t let her husband believe she’d deliberately worn the wrong plaids just to make the men realize how foolish they were behaving in their determination to maintain their separation from each other. It wouldn’t be honorable to accept praise for something she hadn’t done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not so clever,” she remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, you are,” her husband said. “You convinced Laird MacKay to wait another couple of weeks before taking his daughter home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clare isn’t up to a long journey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you stopped me from telling MacKay none of my men touched his daughter. I know you were deliberately stalling so that Clare could stay here, and I did keep silent,” he added. “But when MacKay comes back, I will have to tell him the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so will she,” Johanna said. “She’ll be strong enough by then.” And hopefully married, Johanna thought to herself, if she could find a suitable possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel could prove helpful. “Husband? I find it honorable indeed that you have such faith in your soldiers. To know without a doubt that none of them would ever have touched Clare . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did you get that notion?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From you,” she replied, puzzled by his question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, Johanna, you can’t believe my men wouldn’t take what was offered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you defended them and led me to believe none had touched her,” she argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked exasperated. “We are talking about two different issues,” he explained. “I don’t believe any of my men would refuse the opportunity to bed a willing woman,” he said. “However, I also believe that if he did touch her, he wouldn’t leave her there. He would bring her home with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is also the fact that the soldier would certainly admit he’d bedded the lass. He wouldn’t lie to his laird,” Father MacKechnie added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel nodded. “And that, you see, is the real issue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t see, but she didn’t want to argue with her husband. In her opinion, he was making the issue far more complicated than it needed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather MacKechnie stood up to take his leave. He once again praised Gabriel for his cunning and forceful speech, then turned to bow to Johanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do realize, lass, that you saved the Maclaurins from certain exile? You used your wiles to get their cooperation,” he explained. “You gained their affection, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna was humbled by the priest’s opinion. She whispered her thank you for his kind words, even as she thought that tomorrow she would have to straighten out his opinion. Gabriel was the reason the Maclaurins were cooperating. Surely the priest would realize that fact soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather MacKechnie left the hall. Johanna and Gabriel continued to sit at the table. They were finally all alone. She was suddenly feeling embarrassed and shy, for the praise she’d received was overwhelming her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will make Father understand the truth tomorrow,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What truth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That you are the reason the Maclaurins are finally cooperating.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel stood up and pulled Johanna to her feet. “You’re going to have to learn to accept a compliment when it’s given to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But the truth . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn’t let her finish. He nudged her chin up so she would look at him and then said, “The truth is simple to understand, lass. You became the Maclaurins’ saving grace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought that was the most wonderful thing Gabriel had ever said to her. Tears filled her eyes. She didn’t think she was going to cry, however. She wasn’t so undisciplined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Gabriel made her forget all about being dignified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And mine, Johanna. You’re my saving grace as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel left the holding the following morning. He was evasive about his mission. Johanna immediately became suspicious and demanded to know if her husband planned to do any stealing. He took exception to her question, of course, and an argument resulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have given you my word I won’t steal,” he muttered. “You’d best learn not to insult me with such accusations, woman.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/saving-grace/page-45.html","bookId":1839,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:03 AM"}
