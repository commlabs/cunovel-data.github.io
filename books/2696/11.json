Three miracles. So don’t ever think we’re lookin’ at you with anything besides love, admiration and lust. It’s humbling what this body can still do to me every time I look at you or touch it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Same here, querida. Mr. Smooth said it all right for a change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChassie closed her eyes...overwhelmed by her love for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor gathered her against his chest. “Hey. No cryin’ allowed. Why don’t we all just stay right here and nap for a little longer? There’s no reason to get up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds good. So we don’t have any big plans for tonight?” she asked with a yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We do have a few movies left to watch,” Trevor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right, we didn’t make it through the first one before we were all on each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You say that like it’s a bad thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not. But, man, it’s been a few years since we’ve gone at it this hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdgard kissed her eyelids. “So you’d probably better rest up, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning Chassie had managed to shampoo her hair and shave before she was joined in the big shower by both her men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, we’ve been talkin’,” Trevor started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze zeroed in on their crotches, one at a time. “Looks like you’ve been doin’ more than talkin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdgard poured body wash in his hands and created lather. Then he began soaping the front side of her body, starting at her collarbones. His soft, sure lips moved from the tip of her chin up the side of her jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer entire body became a mass of gooseflesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Trevor’s body was snugged up behind hers, his mouth on her ear. “We had plans for you this morning before we have to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But this will work too,” Edgard murmured in her other ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So just relax and let us take care of you.” Trevor’s mouth skated along the arch of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChassie sighed and closed her eyes. She loved everything about the three of them being together, but when they double-teamed her like this, focused entirely on her pleasure, well, it reminded her of how lucky she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlippery hands caressed her body, front and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love how your skin smells. Not only because you use this honey, goat’s milk, and lavender body wash.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is pretty cool that Sky Blue uses so much of our goat milk in their products. I never thought I could make such a good living selling—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really, Chass? We’re all three nekkid together in this shower and you’re talking business?” Trevor admonished with mock outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “I’m sorry. I surrender to you both completely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good choice,” Edgard whispered, sending goose bumps cascading down her body. “Close your eyes. Let us take care of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery touch, every kiss, sent her deeper into that fuzzy white void where they owned her completely. She trusted them with everything she had, with everything she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hands on the wall, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor entered her from behind, angling her slightly forward as she braced herself against the shower wall. His hands continued that constant stroking as he slid in and out of her pussy; his mouth busy teasing the back of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Edgard dropped to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer knees nearly buckled when his tongue began tracing her slit, top to bottom, circling her clit. “Oh God this feels so good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Trevor pulled out and paused, she felt Edgard’s tongue licking the head of Trevor’s cock, then switching to swirl his tongue around the opening to her sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor growled against her nape, slowing down so Edgard could tease them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChassie started to drift, the steam from the shower returning her to that hazy state, Trevor sending her to another plane with his mouth, his hands and his cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Edgard zigzagged his tongue back up her slit, her belly performed a slow, delicious roll. He spread the fleshy skin covering her clit and settled his mouth there until she came against his flickering tongue and sucking lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body still was quaking when Edgard stood and pulled her against him. Mashed between two wet, hard male bodies caused her sex to clench around Trevor’s hard shaft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdgard and Trevor shared a long, sexy kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Edgard pulled away, Trevor growled, “She tastes good on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChassie curled her hands around Edgard’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to fuck you, Chass,” he said against her lips. “With Trev. Right here, right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor pulled out of her body and backed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she lodged a protest, Edgard said, “Jump up. Legs around my waist.” Grabbing her butt cheeks, he gave her a boost. Then they were indulging in those drugging kisses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChassie threaded her hands through Edgard’s dark hair, holding him close and tight enough to feel his heart pounding against hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cool and slippery finger circled her anus as a warm mouth sucked the droplets of water from her shoulder. Then the slick digit pressed against the opening and slipped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor’s breaths were short and choppy across her skin as he worked more lube into her ass, using two fingers. “Ready to take both of us, sweetheart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Always.” A tingle of anticipation unfurled low in her belly as they aligned their cocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men released a hiss of pleasure when the tips of their cocks rubbed together. They pushed inside her with a simultaneous thrust. She moaned, loving that immediate feeling of fullness with a sharp bite of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You feel so good, Chassie,” Trevor murmured in her ear. “Tight and hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Warm and wet,” Edgard added in her other ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor moved and Edgard countered the move. Slow, slow, slow and then four rapid-fire thrusts as he bottomed out in her ass. Edgard would keep the same maddeningly steady pace...and then jackhammer into her pussy like a man possessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChassie’s entire body was awash in sensation. Inside. Outside. Hands, mouths, cocks. Teeth on her skin. Fingers pinching her nipples. The muscular heat of Trevor’s body behind her. The grinding thrusts of Edgard’s pelvis against her clit. She was suspended between them. Bent to their will. Their bodies working in tandem and in opposition to make her fly apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdgard kissed her. Then Trevor angled her head to kiss her. Then three mouths met and it shouldn’t have worked, but it did. It was erotic as hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, baby, I know it’s right there,” Edgard panted. “I can feel your body vibrating. You know how this goes. We don’t come until you come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what’ll get her there.” Trevor grabbed a fistful of her wet hair and pulled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sharp sting on her scalp and Trevor’s mouth sucking on the spot below her ear was like a jolt of electricity. She arched and cried out, “Harder. Faster. So close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of their heavy breathing bounced off the shower walls as their cocks powered into her, creating the most amazing friction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChassie drew one breath before she unraveled. Her cunt spasmed around Edgard’s cock and her anal muscles clamped down on Trevor’s shaft. The throbbing pulses so intense she held her breath. As the last twinge faded, twin grunts echoed. Trevor’s pelvis slammed into her butt as he spilled heat in her ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdgard’s cock remained buried deep, his hips bumping short jabs as he came in hot spurts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor rested his forehead on her right shoulder and Edgard rested his forehead on her left shoulder. Her pulse still raced and her body quaked from aftershocks when she kissed Trevor’s temple and then Edgard’s. “That was...spectacular. Thank you.” She whispered, “I love you,” to each man, nuzzling ears and necks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey lifted their heads and looked at each other with cocky grins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I definitely think we need to build a shower like this at home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRough Road: Chapter Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days after returning to Sundance, Chassie was cleaning Max up after lunch, when the phone rang. Caller ID said, Moorcroft Elem. She answered quickly. “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mrs. Glanzer? This is Patricia Donkle. I’m the school counselor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened to Westin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was involved in an altercation on the playground. He hit another student.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes. “Where is Westin now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s in my office. I’ve called the parents of the other student who was involved. School policy is a face-to-face meeting. How soon can you be here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fifteen or twenty minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Just check in at the front office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChassie hung up. Max had stopped pounding on his high chair tray and looked ready to crash since it was close to his naptime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor and Sophia bounded in, Sophia chattering a million miles an hour, Edgard bringing up the rear. So it wasn’t a surprise that Edgard noticed her distress first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chassie, what’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The school called. Westin has been involved in a playground incident. So the counselor has asked me to come to the school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just now?” Trevor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” Her mind raced. “So if you’ll get Max down for his nap, I’ll go—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. We’ll all go.” Edgard spoke to Sophia. “Can you get Max’s coat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” She skipped off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now you wanna tell us what’s really goin’ on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you everything I know. The other kid’s parents will be there.” She lifted Max out of the high chair. “Wouldn’t it be easier if one of us stayed here with the younger kids?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which one of us stays?” Trevor demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We all go,” Trevor reiterated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ride into town was quiet—even Sophia and Max were subdued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey traipsed into the school and signed in at the office before being directed down a long hallway. A heavyset woman, probably mid-fifties, exited the office marked Counselor. “Hi, Mrs. Glanzer?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/short-rides-rough-riders-14-5/page-11.html","bookId":2696,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:19 AM"}
