{"id":12356,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER 8","content":"\u0026nbsp;On Venus there was the thick, soupy atmosphere and the verdant tropical jungles. On Mars, the rusty desert and the ruins of an eon-old civilization. But on Mercury you knew at once that you trod upon an alien world. At perihelion, the sun swelled to almost four times its size as seen from Earth, and because Mercury\u0027s tenuous atmosphere had boiled off into space half a billion years ago, the sky was black. The sun had lost its spherical shape, too. Great solar prominences licked out at the blackness, and the visible corona seemed to swell and pulse. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Underfoot, Steve could feel the crunchy ground powdering beneath his asbestos boots with every step. And far off toward the horizon, a jagged ridge of blood-red mountains bit at the black sky like festering, toothless gums.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before long, Teejay\u0027s voice sang in Steve\u0027s earphones. \"Over here, you boys.\" And Steve could see her crouching, shapeless in the loose asbestos suit, off to his left. The sun\u0027s heat had parched a long, snaking crack in the surface and Steve lumbered over to it clumsily, letting his shadow fall across the crevice. \"Those stone worms are umbra-tropic,\" he called, and waited.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t wonder,\" said Teejay, looking up at the sun through the smoked goggles of her helmet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The stone worms, Steve knew, were attracted by darkness—hence they generally dwelled in the deepest crevices, although a man\u0027s shadow might bring them to the surface. He\u0027d never seen a stone worm, but he\u0027d read about them and seen their pictures.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ll see something very unlovely,\" Teejay predicated. \"The stone worm isn\u0027t a carbon-basic animal, but a silicate creature with a sodium-silicon-nitrogen economy. It\u0027s about four feet long and kind of like some ghastly white slug. It—hey, Stedman, get on your toes!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The worm was coming.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It poked its head up out of the crevice first, and then the slug-like body followed, curling quite instinctively until the whole thing lay in Steve\u0027s shadow. Four feet long and a foot across at the middle, it looked like the product of nightmare. The head was one huge, lidless, glassy eye—with a purple-lipped mouth where the pupil should have been! The mouth opened and shut like that of a fish, but when Steve lifted the monster by its middle and brought it out into the sun, the lips puckered completely shut and the white slug began to thrash dangerously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But under the influence of the sun\u0027s heat it soon subsided. Trouble was, Steve thought vaguely as they made their way back toward Furnacetown with the quiescent monster, the sun\u0027s heat did not subside. Probably, it was his imagination, but the sun had seemed to become, if anything, stronger. He looked at the others, but they merely walked forward, completely unconcerned. Maybe he\u0027d tired himself subduing the stone worm, for he knew that might seem to intensify the heat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Inside his asbestos suit, Steve began to sweat. It did not start slowly, but all at once the perspiration streamed down his face and body.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was then that his left leg began to burn. Down below the knee it was, a knife-edged burning sensation which became worse with each passing second. Someone had heated a knife white-hot, had applied its sharp point to the nerve-endings of his leg—and then twisted. It felt like that.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Screaming hoarsely, Steve fell, watched through burning eyes as the stone worm commenced crawling laboriously away. It was LeClarc who went after the worm and retrieved it, but Teejay knelt at Steve\u0027s side and, surprisingly, real concern was in her voice when it came over the radio.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What\u0027s the trouble, Stedman?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Steve gritted. \"I\u0027m hot all over—and my leg feels like it\u0027s on fire. Yeah, right there—ow!—go easy!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Teejay frowned or at least Steve guessed she frowned by the way she spoke. \"There\u0027s nothing much we can do about it, Stedman. Seems to be a hole—just a pinprick, but a hole—in the asbestos. It\u0027s a wonder you weren\u0027t screaming bloody murder before this. How\u0027s the air?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was getting hard to breathe, Steve realized, but dimly, for his senses were receding into a fog of half-consciousness. Something hissed in his ears and he knew Teejay had turned the outside dial of his air-pump all the way over. It made him feel momentarily better, but the pain still cut into his leg.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ve got the worm,\" said LeClarc. \"But what happened to him?\" He asked the question innocently—too innocently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Teejay didn\u0027t answer. Instead: \"Can you walk, Stedman?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I—I don\u0027t think so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I\u0027ll carry you. But remember this: if we get you back all right, you can thank the twenty-second century feminist movement. Can you picture an old-fashioned gal slinging a man over her shoulder and toting him away to safety like a sack of grain? Here we go.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And she got her arms under Steve\u0027s shoulder, tugging him upright and swinging him across her back in a fireman\u0027s carry. He felt in no mood to question her motive, but he could sense the triumph in her as if she had said, \"See, I\u0027m as strong as a man, and don\u0027t you forget it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In spite of himself, he couldn\u0027t help responding to the unspoken challenge. \"Sure,\" he said, \"I can thank the feminist movement, but more than that I can thank Mercury\u0027s light gravity, Teejay. We\u0027re lucky I don\u0027t weigh more than fifty pounds here.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n An hour later they arrived back at Furnacetown, but by then Steve was unconscious from the pain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2816/77848.html","bookId":499,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:38:30 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:38:30 AM"}
