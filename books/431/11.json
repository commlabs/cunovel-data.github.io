So the next morning, in order to satisfy his mind that all was right, he rowed across to the same place where he had landed Ben, and fastening his boat, went up to the farmhouse.

He was so busily occupied that he did not hear the noise of Robert\u0027s entrance into the room above, or he would at once have gone upstairs.
