There\u0027s no artwork on the bare white walls. The place isn\u0027t like my house back in Paradise-it\u0027s too plain and too unused, like he just comes here to sleep and that\u0027s it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You divorced?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna stop asking questions? I think I liked you better on the ride here, when you didn\u0027t talk at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Damon makes a surprisingly good dinner of chicken and rice that reminds me of my mom\u0027s cooking, he heads down a narrow hall to bed. It\u0027s quiet in the house. I\u0027m not used to this much silence. At Rio\u0027s place, there were always people partying or coming in and out at all hours. I didn\u0027t mind, because I don\u0027t sleep much anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn the light off although I know I\u0027m not going to get much sleep tonight. It\u0027ll be like usual ... every fifteen minutes I\u0027ll wake up and stare at the ceiling and pray for sleep to come. It does, but in such short spurts I wonder what it\u0027d be like to get a full night\u0027s sleep with no interruptions. That hasn\u0027t happened for years ... since before the accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning I\u0027m eating some healthy whole-grain type of cereal when Damon walks into the kitchen. I can\u0027t help but ask, \"Why did you help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I think you\u0027re a good kid,\" he says, his back to me as he stands in front of the stove and fries some eggs. \"You just have to make better choices.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the late afternoon, we throw our bags in the car. Damon stops off at the Redwood community center, where a big white van is waiting for us. He gets summoned into the building and tells me to hang by the van and introduce myself to the rest of the group. There\u0027s two other guys and three girls standing there waiting with their baggage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen one of the girls moves aside and I get a glimpse of the person she was shielding, my entire body goes numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewatch my protein bar fall onto the blacktop in slow motion, and the bite in my mouth tastes like dust. What is Caleb doing here? Where has he been the past eight months? He left town without a trace after our brief and crazy relationship. Why didn\u0027t he try to reach me, or at least give me a sign that he\u0027s alive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s got those same blue eyes, that same chiseled face, and those same lean muscles peeking out of his T-shirt. He\u0027s real, and live, and walking right toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t look away, even though I desperately want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lets out a slow breath and says, \"This is kinda awkward, huh.\" His voice sounds familiar but different. It\u0027s got an edge to it that wasn\u0027t there the last time we saw each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I manage to squeak out. Umm ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027ve you been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t answer that question. It\u0027s too fake. If he cared how I\u0027ve been, he would have figured out a way to see me or talk to me. He left me before Christmas, before New Year\u0027s, before Valentine\u0027s Day, before my birthday, before prom and graduation. Before I got the news I\u0027d have a permanent limp for the rest of my life without any hope of a full recovery. \"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs. \"I was asking myself that same question this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the other guys standing with us, the one with long curly hair that falls in his face, farts. What\u0027s worse is that he makes a big show of moaning and pushing it out, like a little kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dude, do you mind?\" Caleb asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" the guy says, unfazed. \"I had to let it rip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let it rip when you\u0027re alone, man. Don\u0027t be a fuckin\u0027 prick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you, the fart police?\" the guy says, stepping toward Caleb. Caleb stands tall, as if he\u0027s been in a lot of fights and isn\u0027t afraid of adding another one to his tally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is unreal. I can\u0027t feel my toes because I\u0027m in shock, and Caleb and this guy are going to get into a fight over ... farting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool it, guys,\" bellows a rough voice. A tall black guy with a clipboard points to me. \"Maggie, can I have a word with you for a minute? In private.\" He points to Caleb. \"You too, Becker. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow the guy away from the van, painfully aware that Caleb is following close behind. I\u0027m tempted to turn around and demand to know where he\u0027s been, but I don\u0027t even know if I could get the words out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy stops at a picnic table and drops his clipboard on it. He introduces himself to me as Damon Manning, the senior leader and chaperone of our group, then looks pained as he says, \"Obviously, you two can\u0027t be on this trip together. Maggie, I had no idea my assistant put you in as the replacement after Heather dropped out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drop out,\" Caleb offers eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell you will, Becker. You\u0027ve got no choice but to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means Damon expects me to drop out. If I was the old Maggie, the one who was afraid of the least bit of conflict or confrontation, I\u0027d drop out in a heartbeat. But I\u0027m stronger now, and I don\u0027t back down from anything. Even Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to Damon with determination. \"I\u0027m not dropping out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, I\u0027m sorry but it\u0027s not going to work with both of you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving,\" I interrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon rubs a hand over his bald head and sighs. I can tell he\u0027s wavering ... at least a little bit. What can I say to convince him I don\u0027t have to quit the trip just because Caleb happens to be on it? Truth is, being with Caleb will be a challenge-a huge one I hadn\u0027t expected. But I decide I\u0027m going to prove it to myself and to him that I\u0027ve moved on. I don\u0027t let the past dictate my life anymore. We\u0027re both eighteen now, both considered adults in the eyes of the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a bad idea,\" Damon chimes in. \"A really bad idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I talk to Caleb alone?\" I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon looks from me to Caleb. \"Okay. You\u0027ve got five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Damon walks away, I swallow hard and force myself to face Caleb. He looks worn out, but at the same time a fierce strength radiates from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to think he was everything I wanted and needed. If I had Caleb Becker at my side, my life would be okay. And it was, for a little while at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been eight months,\" I say in a small voice. Thinking of how much I\u0027ve missed him makes my eyes well up. I blink and pray my tears don\u0027t fall. Not now, when I have to stay strong. I say something, anything, so I don\u0027t lose it. \"You missed graduation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed a lot of things,\" he says, then slowly starts to reach out his hand before he shoves both hands in his pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I probably look pathetic. I feel pathetic. But I\u0027m sick of feeling sorry for myself. I\u0027ve had to move on. I\u0027ve gotten stronger every day. I can\u0027t get sucked back into the soap opera of Caleb\u0027s life. I won\u0027t let that happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the big white van that\u0027s supposed to take us on a four-week trip together. We\u0027re going to share our stories publicly, hoping to prevent others from experiencing what happened to us. I bite my lip at the irony. How can we do that, when the truth of Caleb\u0027s and my accident is still buried?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kick at some loose pebbles of tar on the blacktop. \"He said you have no choice but to go on this trip. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArms folded, Caleb leans against the picnic table and sighs. \"Okay, here\u0027s the deal. Big surprise: I got myself in trouble again. It\u0027s either this program, or I go to jail. The ball\u0027s in your court, Maggie. You want me to quit, I will. I\u0027ll take the consequences.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing I want is Caleb back in jail. I\u0027m afraid to ask for details of how he got into trouble, so I don\u0027t. If he wants to tell me, he will. But I know he won\u0027t because he doesn\u0027t know how to trust anyone, least of all me. I might have been a part of his life once, but now I\u0027m not. I\u0027m a stranger to him, and he\u0027s a stranger to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only four weeks,\" I tell him. \"I think we can handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four weeks stuck in a van together, and then you never have to see me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes when he says that. He shouldn\u0027t disappear again. His sister needs him, and his mother struggles every day with her prescription drug addiction. \"After the trip, you should go back to Paradise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not gonna happen, so get that thought out of your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgetting my sadness and gathering courage, I stand up straight and look him in the eye. \"You know what I think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the tough and stoic Caleb Becker takes the easy way out.\" There, I said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My life is a lot of things, Maggie, but easy isn\u0027t one of them,\" he says. He clears his throat. \"And if you think seeing you right now is a piece of cake for me, guess again...\" His voice trails off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe this was fate giving us a second chance at saying goodbye. You know, before we both go our separate ways again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That must be what it is,\" he says sarcastically. \"So you\u0027re absolutely cool with going on this trip together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat and look over at the van. \"I\u0027m cool with it as long as you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing himself away from the table, he walks away from me and heads over to Damon. They talk for a second, then Caleb tosses his duffle in the back of the van and climbs inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb said you worked it out,\" Damon says to me when I limp over to the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only four weeks. It\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon looks about as convinced as I feel, but I assure him the past is behind us and we\u0027ll get beyond it. I really hope I\u0027m not lying to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the van, the two girls who I met this morning are sitting in the front seat. The girl named Erin has a pierced nose and lip and has tattoos running up and down her bare arm. She\u0027s reading a book while leaning against the window. The other girl, Trish, has long, really shiny blonde hair and could definitely pass for one of the popular cheerleaders back in Paradise. She has dark makeup on her eyes and wears light pink lipstick. It looks good on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI purposely avoid even glancing at the rear benchI\u0027m not going to look where he\u0027s sitting-and slide next to Matt on the middle bench. I know Matt from physical therapy, since his appointments are usually after mine on Wednesday nights. Matt lost three quarters of his left arm, and his right arm is scarred, but I\u0027m not sure exactly what happened. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll find out once we share our stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt gives me a friendly but reserved smile. \"I didn\u0027t know you\u0027d be here,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a last-minute thing,\" I tell him, eyeing Trish and Erin in the seat in front of us and wondering if Caleb will decide to ditch the trip at the very last second. Part of me wants him to leave, but the other part wants him to stay so I can prove to myself that I\u0027m truly over him, that the pain that lingered after he left is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy pulse quickens when I hear Caleb shifting in his seat behind us. It\u0027s not a good sign that I\u0027m hyper-aware of his every movement. I\u0027m probably in for four weeks of real torture-maybe even worse than the year of physical therapy after the accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever mind how I felt when Caleb abandoned me. In the weeks and months after he left town, I prayed that he\u0027d come back. I used to keep my light on at night, so if he came back he\u0027d see it as a sign that I was waiting for him. He lived next door, so I would gaze out my window for hours on end, hoping to see the light on in his room. My fantasy was that he would tell me he made a huge mistake by leaving Paradise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he never did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, I realized I had relied on him too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon gets into the driver\u0027s seat and turns around. \"Well, guys, this is it. Our first stop is a camp-based summer school for teens. We\u0027ll be sleeping in cabins at their campground tonight, and you\u0027ll be expected to share your stories with them. Tomorrow we\u0027ll leave and head to our second gig. But right now, take a second to introduce yourselves while we\u0027re waiting for Lenny. As y\u0027all know, I\u0027m Damon Manning and I\u0027m your chaperone.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-2.html","bookId":2772,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:05 PM"}
