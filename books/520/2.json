I travelled yesterday for four hours in a train. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s a funny sensation, isn\u0027t it? I never rode in one before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e College is the biggest, most bewildering place--I get lost whenever\n\u003cbr\u003e I leave my room. I will write you a description later when I\u0027m\n\u003cbr\u003e feeling less muddled; also I will tell you about my lessons. \n\u003cbr\u003e Classes don\u0027t begin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night. \n\u003cbr\u003e But I wanted to write a letter first just to get acquainted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It seems queer to be writing letters to somebody you don\u0027t know. \n\u003cbr\u003e It seems queer for me to be writing letters at all--I\u0027ve never\n\u003cbr\u003e written more than three or four in my life, so please overlook it\n\u003cbr\u003e if these are not a model kind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before leaving yesterday morning, Mrs. Lippett and I had a very\n\u003cbr\u003e serious talk. She told me how to behave all the rest of my life,\n\u003cbr\u003e and especially how to behave towards the kind gentleman who is doing\n\u003cbr\u003e so much for me. I must take care to be Very Respectful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But how can one be very respectful to a person who\n\u003cbr\u003e wishes to be called John Smith? Why couldn\u0027t you\n\u003cbr\u003e have picked out a name with a little personality? \n\u003cbr\u003e I might as well write letters to Dear Hitching-Post or Dear Clothes-Prop.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I have been thinking about you a great deal this summer; having\n\u003cbr\u003e somebody take an interest in me after all these years makes me\n\u003cbr\u003e feel as though I had found a sort of family. It seems as though I\n\u003cbr\u003e belonged to somebody now, and it\u0027s a very comfortable sensation. \n\u003cbr\u003e I must say, however, that when I think about you, my imagination\n\u003cbr\u003e has very little to work upon. There are just three things that\n\u003cbr\u003e I know:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I. You are tall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e II. You are rich.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e III. You hate girls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I suppose I might call you Dear Mr. Girl-Hater. Only that\u0027s rather\n\u003cbr\u003e insulting to me. Or Dear Mr. Rich-Man, but that\u0027s insulting\n\u003cbr\u003e to you, as though money were the only important thing about you. \n\u003cbr\u003e Besides, being rich is such a very external quality. Maybe you\n\u003cbr\u003e won\u0027t stay rich all your life; lots of very clever men get smashed\n\u003cbr\u003e up in Wall Street. But at least you will stay tall all your life! \n\u003cbr\u003e So I\u0027ve decided to call you Dear Daddy-Long-Legs. I hope you won\u0027t mind. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s just a private pet name we won\u0027t tell Mrs. Lippett.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The ten o\u0027clock bell is going to ring in two minutes. Our day is\n\u003cbr\u003e divided into sections by bells. We eat and sleep and study by bells. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s very enlivening; I feel like a fire horse all of the time. \n\u003cbr\u003e There it goes! Lights out. Good night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Observe with what precision I obey rules--due to my training\n\u003cbr\u003e in the John Grier Home.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours most respectfully,\n\u003cbr\u003e Jerusha Abbott\n\u003cbr\u003e To Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 1st October\n\u003cbr\u003e Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I love college and I love you for sending me--I\u0027m very, very happy,\n\u003cbr\u003e and so excited every moment of the time that I can scarcely sleep. \n\u003cbr\u003e You can\u0027t imagine how different it is from the John Grier Home. \n\u003cbr\u003e I never dreamed there was such a place in the world. I\u0027m feeling\n\u003cbr\u003e sorry for everybody who isn\u0027t a girl and who can\u0027t come here; I am\n\u003cbr\u003e sure the college you attended when you were a boy couldn\u0027t have been\n\u003cbr\u003e so nice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My room is up in a tower that used to be the contagious ward\n\u003cbr\u003e before they built the new infirmary. There are three other girls\n\u003cbr\u003e on the same floor of the tower--a Senior who wears spectacles\n\u003cbr\u003e and is always asking us please to be a little more quiet, and two\n\u003cbr\u003e Freshmen named Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton. \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie has red hair and a turn-up nose and is quite friendly;\n\u003cbr\u003e Julia comes from one of the first families in New York and hasn\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e noticed me yet. They room together and the Senior and I have singles. \n\u003cbr\u003e Usually Freshmen can\u0027t get singles; they are very scarce, but I got\n\u003cbr\u003e one without even asking. I suppose the registrar didn\u0027t think it would\n\u003cbr\u003e be right to ask a properly brought-up girl to room with a foundling. \n\u003cbr\u003e You see there are advantages!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My room is on the north-west corner with two windows and a view. \n\u003cbr\u003e After you\u0027ve lived in a ward for eighteen years with twenty\n\u003cbr\u003e room-mates, it is restful to be alone. This is the first chance\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve ever had to get acquainted with Jerusha Abbott. I think I\u0027m\n\u003cbr\u003e going to like her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do you think you are?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tuesday\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They are organizing the Freshman basket-ball team and there\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e just a chance that I shall get in it. I\u0027m little of course,\n\u003cbr\u003e but terribly quick and wiry and tough. While the others are hopping\n\u003cbr\u003e about in the air, I can dodge under their feet and grab the ball. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s loads of fun practising--out in the athletic field in the\n\u003cbr\u003e afternoon with the trees all red and yellow and the air full of\n\u003cbr\u003e the smell of burning leaves, and everybody laughing and shouting. \n\u003cbr\u003e These are the happiest girls I ever saw--and I am the happiest\n\u003cbr\u003e of all!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I meant to write a long letter and tell you all the things I\u0027m learning\n\u003cbr\u003e (Mrs. Lippett said you wanted to know), but 7th hour has just rung,\n\u003cbr\u003e and in ten minutes I\u0027m due at the athletic field in gymnasium clothes. \n\u003cbr\u003e Don\u0027t you hope I\u0027ll get in the team?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yours always,\n\u003cbr\u003e Jerusha Abbott\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. (9 o\u0027clock.)\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie McBride just poked her head in at my door. This is what\n\u003cbr\u003e she said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `I\u0027m so homesick that I simply can\u0027t stand it. Do you feel that way?\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I smiled a little and said no; I thought I could pull through. \n\u003cbr\u003e At least homesickness is one disease that I\u0027ve escaped! I never heard\n\u003cbr\u003e of anybody being asylum-sick, did you?\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59724.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
