But in recent years the inexplicable malice that once tormented so many has lain as silent as its victims. Until now. A member of the nation\u0027s foremost paranormal forensic team, Jenna Duffy has made a career out of investigating the inexplicable. Yet nothing could prepare her for the string of slayings once again plaguing Lexington House, or for the chief suspect ? a boy barely old enough to drive, much less kill. With the young man\u0027s life on the line, Jenna must team up with attorney Samuel Hall to pinpoint who ? or what ? is taking the lives of those who get too close to the past. But everything they learn brings them closer to the forces of evil stalking this tortured ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-evil-inside-krewe-of-hunters-4.jpg","author":"Heather Graham","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-evil-inside-krewe-of-hunters-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:32 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:16 PM"}
