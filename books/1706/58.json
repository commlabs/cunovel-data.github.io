The first waitman was long dead, the body cooling at his feet, no longer as appetizing as he was before. And those in the crowd who had not tasted glory were clamoring for their piece, for the next opportunity. The women were resting their bats and pipes on their shoulders, talking in small clusters, waiting for the game to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was the next man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSambuca barked an order, and three men ran toward the thatch building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a long, muddy slide down the steep hill, but Evans didn\u0027t mind. He was following Morton, who seemed to know his way around the jungle very well. They fell to the bottom, landing in a shallow running stream, the water pale brown with peat. Morton signaled for him to follow, and ran splashing down the streambed. Morton had lost a lot of weight; his body was trim and fit, his face tight, hard looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans said, \"We thought you were dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk. Just go. They\u0027ll be after us in a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even as he spoke, Evans could hear someone sliding down the hillside after them. He turned and ran down the stream, slipping over wet rocks, falling, getting up and running again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner came down the hillside with the two women right behind him. They banged against gnarled roots and protruding brambles as they slid down, but it was still the fastest way to get away from the village. He could see from the streaks in the mud ahead of him that Morton had gone that way, too. And he was sure that he had no more than a minute\u0027s head start before the alarm was sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came crashing down through the last of the undergrowth to the streambed. They heard gunshots from the village above. So their escape had already been discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bay, Kenner knew, was off to the left. He told the others to go ahead, running in the streambed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you?\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be with you in a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women headed off, moving surprisingly quickly. Kenner eased back to the muddy track, raised his gun, and waited. It was only a few seconds before the first of the rebels came down the slope. He fired three quick bursts. The bodies caught in the gnarled branches. One tumbled all the way to the streambed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men above would expect him to run now. So he waited. Sure enough, in a couple of minutes he heard them starting down again. They were noisyfrightened kids. He fired again, and heard screams. But he didn\u0027t think he\u0027d hit anything. They were just screams of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut from now on, he was sure they would take a different route down. And it would be slower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner turned and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah and Jennifer were moving fast through the water when a bullet whined past Sarah\u0027s ear. \"Hey,\" she shouted. \"It\u0027s us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sorry,\" Morton said, as they caught up to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which way?\" Jennifer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorton pointed downstream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans looked for his watch, but one of the kids had taken it from him. His wrist was bare. But Morton had a watch. \"What time is it?\" Evans asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three-fifteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had less than two hours remaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How far to the bay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe another hour,\" Morton said, \"if we go cross jungle. And we must. Those boys are fearsome trackers. Many times they\u0027ve almost gotten me. They know I\u0027m here, but so far I\u0027ve eluded them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nine days. Seems like nine years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning down a streambed, they crouched low beneath overhanging branches. Evans\u0027s thighs burned. His knees ached. But somehow it didn\u0027t matter to him. For some reason, the pain felt like an affirmation. He didn\u0027t care about the heat or the bugs or the leeches that he knew were all over his ankles and legs. He was just glad to be alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We turn here,\" Morton said. He left the streambed, dashing off to the right, scrambling over big boulders, and then crashing into dense, waist-high ferns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any snakes in here?\" Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, plenty,\" Morton said. \"But I don\u0027t worry about them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you worry about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plenti pukpuk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crocodiles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he plunged onward, vanishing into dense foliage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner stopped in the middle of the river. Something was wrong. Until now, he had seen signs of previous runners in the stream. Bits of mud on rocks, wet finger marks or shoe prints, or disturbed algae. But for the last few minutes, nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others had left the stream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d missed where.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorton would make sure of that, he thought. Morton would know a good place to leave the river where their exit wouldn\u0027t be noticed. Probably somewhere with ferns and swampy, marshy grass between boulders on riverbanksgrass that would be spongy underfoot and would spring back at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner had missed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around and headed upstream, moving slowly. He knew that if he didn\u0027t find their tracks, he couldn\u0027t leave the river. He would be sure to get lost. And if he stayed in the river too long, the kids would find him. And they\u0027d kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 83\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRESOLUTION\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:02 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one hour left, now. Morton crouched among the mangroves and rocks near the center of Resolution Bay. The others were clustered around him. The water lapped softly against the sand, a few feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is what I know,\" he said, speaking low. \"The submarine tender is hidden under a camouflage tarp at the east end of the bay. You can\u0027t see it from here. They have been sending the submarine down every day for a week. The sub has limited battery power, so it can stay at depth for only an hour at a time. But it seems pretty clear they are placing a kind of cone-shaped explosive that depends on accurately timed detonation\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They had them in Antarctica,\" Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then you know. Here, they\u0027re intended to trigger an underwater avalanche. Judging how long the sub stays down, I figure they are placing them at about the ninety-meter level, which happens to be the most efficient level for tsunami-causing avalanches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the tents up here?\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems they\u0027re taking no chances. Either they don\u0027t have enough cone explosives or they don\u0027t trust them to do the job, because they have placed something called hypersonic cavitation generators in the tents. They\u0027re big pieces of equipment about the size of a small truck. Diesel powered, make a lot of noise when they fire them up to test them, which they\u0027ve been doing for days. They moved the tents several times, just a foot or two each time, so I assume there\u0027s some critical issue about placement. Maybe they\u0027re focusing the beams, or whatever it is those things generate. I\u0027m not entirely clear about what they do. But apparently they\u0027re important for creating the landslide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah said, \"And what do we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no way we can stop them,\" Morton said. \"We are only fourfive, if Kenner makes it, which he doesn\u0027t seem to be doing. There are thirteen of them. Seven on the ship and six on shore. All armed with automatic weapons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we have Sanjong,\" Evans said. \"Don\u0027t forget him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Nepali guy? I\u0027m sure the rebels got him. There were gunshots about an hour ago along the ridge where they first found you. I was a few yards below, just before they picked you up. I tried to signal you by coughing, but amp;\" He shrugged, turned back to the beach. \"Anyway. Assuming the three cavitation generators are meant to work together to create some effect on the underwater slope, I figure our best chance is to take one of the generators outor maybe two of them. That would disrupt their plan or at least weaken the effect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer said, \"Can we cut the power supply?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorton shook his head. \"They\u0027re self-powered. Diesel attached to the main units.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Battery ignition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Solar panels. They\u0027re autonomous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we have to take out the guys running the units.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And they\u0027ve been alerted to our presence. As you can see, there\u0027s one standing outside each tent, guarding it, and they\u0027ve got a sentry somewhere up on that ridge.\" He pointed to the western slope. \"We can\u0027t see where he is, but I assume he is watching the whole bay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So? Big deal. Let him watch,\" Jennifer said. \"I say we just take out all these guys in the tents, and trash the machines. We\u0027ve got enough weapons here to do the job, and\" She paused. She had removed the magazine from her rifle; it was empty. \"Better check your loads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment of fumbling. They were all shaking their heads. Evans had four rounds. Sarah had two. Morton\u0027s rifle had none. \"Those guys had practically no ammo amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we don\u0027t either.\" Jennifer took a long breath. \"This is going to be a little tougher without weapons.\" She edged forward and looked out on the beach, squinting in the bright light. \"There\u0027s ten yards between the jungle and those tents. Open beach, no cover. If we charge the tents we\u0027ll never make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about a distraction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what it could be. There\u0027s one guy outside each tent and one guy inside. They both armed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorton nodded. \"Automatic weapons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not good,\" she said. \"Not good at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner splashed down the river, looking hard left and right. He had not gone more than a hundred yards when he saw the faint imprint of a wet hand on a boulder. The damp print had almost dried. He looked more closely. He saw the grass at the edge of the stream had been trampled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was where they had left the stream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set out, heading toward the bay. Morton obviously knew his way around. This was another streambed, but much smaller. Kenner noticed with some unease that it sloped downward fairly steeply. That was a bad sign. But it was a passable route through the jungle. Somewhere up ahead, he heard the barking of a dog. It sounded like the dog was hoarse, or sick, or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner hurried ahead, ducking beneath the branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to get to the others, before it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorton heard the barking and frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" Jennifer said. \"The rebels chasing us with dogs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. That\u0027s not a dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t really sound like a dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not. They\u0027ve learned a trick in this part of the world. They bark like a dog, and then when the dogs come out, they eat them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who does?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crocs. That\u0027s a crocodile you hear. Somewhere behind us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut on the beach, they heard the sudden rumbling of automobile engines. Peering forward through the mangroves, they saw three jeeps coming from the east side of the bay, rumbling across the sand toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this?\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve been practicing this,\" Morton said. \"All week. Watch. One stops at each tent. See? Tent one amp;tent two amp;tent three. They all stop. They all keep the motors running. All pointed west.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s west?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a dirt track, goes up the hill about a hundred yards and then dead-ends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something used to be up there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They cut the road themselves. First thing they did when they got here.\" Morton looked toward the eastern curve of the bay. \"Usually by this time, the ship has pulled out, and moved into deep water. But it\u0027s not doing it yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-oh,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027ve forgotten something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been worried about this tsunami wave heading toward the California coast. But a landslide would suck water downward, right? And then it would rise back up again. But that\u0027s kind of like dropping this pebble into this ditch.\" He dropped a pebble into a muddy puddle at their feet. \"And the wave the pebble generates amp;is circular.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It goes in all directions amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no,\" Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes. All directions, including back to this coast. The tsunami will hit here, too. And fast. How far offshore is the Solomon Trench?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorton shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe two miles. I really don\u0027t know, Peter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If these waves travel five hundred miles an hour,\" Evans said, \"then that means it gets to this coast in amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-four seconds,\" Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. That\u0027s how much time we have to get out of here, once the undersea landslide begins. Twenty-four seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sudden chugging rumble, they heard the first diesel generator come to life. Then the second, then the third. All three were running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorton glanced at his watch. \"This is it,\" he said. \"They\u0027ve started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now they heard an electronic whine, faint at first but rapidly building to a deep electronic hum. It filled the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those\u0027re the cavitators,\" Morton said. \"Kicking in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer slung her rifle over her shoulder. \"Let\u0027s get ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanjong slid silently from the branches of the overhanging tree, onto the deck of the AV Scorpion. The forty-foot ship must have a very shallow draft, because it was pulled up close to the peninsula on the eastern side, so that the huge jungle trees overhung it. The ship couldn\u0027t really be seen from the beach; Sanjong had only realized that it was there when he heard the crackle of radios coming from the jungle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crouched in the stern, hiding behind the winch that raised the submarine, listening. He heard voices from all sides, it seemed like. He guessed that there were six or seven men onboard. But what he wanted was to find the timing detonators. He guessed that they were in the pilot-house, but he couldn\u0027t be sure. And between his hiding place and the pilothouse was a long expanse of open deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the mini-sub hanging above him. It was bright blue, about seven feet long, with a bubble canopy, now raised. The sub was raised and lowered into the water by the winch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the winch amp; He looked for the control panel. He knew it had to be nearby because the operator would have to be able to see the submarine as it was lowered. Finally he saw it: a closed metal box on the other side of the ship. He crept over, opened the box, and looked at the buttons. There were six, marked with arrows in all directions. Like a big keypad. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-58.html","bookId":1706,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM"}
