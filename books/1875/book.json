I run out the front door of my house sobbing. I don\u0027t know what I think or what I need. I just know that I want Trystan, but when I get to his house, something\u0027s wrong. When Trystan pulls the door open, it seems like he is going to walk out, which is strange since he\u0027s not wearing a shirt and his hair is damp. I glance at his face - his blue eyes are wild. They\u0027re too big, like he has no idea what to do, like I\u0027m the last person he expected on his doorstep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shattered-the-secret-life-of-trystan-scott-4.jpg","author":"H.M.
