He no longer felt afraid of him, but began to look forward with pleasant anticipations to his journey West, and the life that was to open before him in Milwaukie. It was a relief to think that he would not now be obliged to take care of himself, but would have some one both able and willing to supply his wants, and provide him with a comfortable home. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He felt glad again that he was going to school. He remembered how anxious his poor mother had been that he should receive a good education, and now his grandfather had promised to send him to the best school in Milwaukie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next morning after their meeting, Mr. Bates took Mark to a large clothing establishment, and had him fitted out with new clothes in the most liberal manner. He even bought him a silver watch, of which Mark felt very proud.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now, Mark,\" said his grandfather, \"if there is any one that was kind to you when you were a poor match boy, I should like to do something to show my gratitude for their kindness. Can you think of any one?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" said Mark; \"there\u0027s Ben Gibson.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And who is Ben Gibson?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He blacks boots down on Nassau Street. When I ran away from Mother Watson, who treated me so badly, he stood by me, and prevented her from getting hold of me again.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is there any one besides?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" said Mark, after a pause; \"there is Mrs. Flanagan. She lives in the same tenement-house where I used to. When I was almost starved she used to give me something to eat, though she was poor herself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think we will call and see her first,\" said Mr. Bates. \"I am going to let you give her a hundred dollars.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She will be delighted,\" said Mark, his eyes sparkling with joy. \"It will seem a fortune to her. Let us go at once.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well,\" said his grandfather. \"Afterwards we will try to find your friend Ben.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I forgot to mention that Mr. Bates was stopping at the Fifth Avenue Hotel.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They took the University Place cars, which landed them at the junction of Barclay Street and Broadway. From thence it was but a short distance to Vandewater Street, where Mark lived when first introduced to the reader.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They climbed the broken staircase, and paused in front of Mrs. Flanagan\u0027s door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mark knocked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Flanagan opened the door, and stared with some surprise at her visitors.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t you know me, Mrs. Flanagan?\" asked Mark.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why, surely it isn\u0027t Mark, the little match boy?\" said Mrs. Flanagan, amazed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, it is. So you didn\u0027t know me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And it\u0027s rale delighted I am to see you lookin\u0027 so fine. And who is this gentleman?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is my grandfather, Mrs. Flanagan. I\u0027m going out West to live with him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Flanagan dropped a courtesy to Mr. Bates, who said, \"My good woman, Mark tells me that you were kind to him when he stood in need of kindness.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And did he say that?\" said Mrs. Flanagan, her face beaming with pleasure. \"Shure it was little I did for him, bein\u0027 poor myself; but that little he was heartily welcome to, and I\u0027m delighted to think he\u0027s turned out so lucky. The ould woman trated him very bad. I used to feel as if I\u0027d like to break her ould bones for her.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mark and I both want to thank you for your kindness to him, and he has a small gift to give you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Here it is,\" said Mark, drawing from his pocket a neat pocket-book, containing a roll of bills. \"You\u0027ll find a hundred dollars inside, Mrs. Flanagan,\" he said. \"I hope they will help you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A hundred dollars!\" ejaculated Mrs. Flanagan, hardly believing her ears. \"Does this good gentleman give me a hundred dollars!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No it is Mark\u0027s gift to you,\" said Mr. Bates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s rich I am with so much money,\" said the good woman. \"May the saints bless you both! Now I can buy some clothes for the childer, and have plenty left beside. This is a happy day entirely. But won\u0027t you step in, and rest yourselves a bit? It\u0027s a poor room, but—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you, Mrs. Flanagan,\" said Mr. Bates, \"but we are in haste this morning. Whenever Mark comes to New York he shall come and see you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They went downstairs, leaving Mrs. Flanagan so excited with her good fortune, that she left her work, and made a series of calls upon her neighbors, in which she detailed Mark\u0027s good fortune and her own.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now we\u0027ll go and find your friend, Ben Gibson,\" said Mr. Bates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think we\u0027ll find him on Nassau Street,\" said Mark.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was right.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In walking down Nassau Street on the east side, Mr. Bates was accosted by Ben himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Shine yer boots?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How are you, Ben?\" said Mark.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben stared in surprise till he recognized his old companion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Blest if it aint Mark,\" he said. \"How you\u0027re gettin on!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ben, this is my grandfather,\" said Mark.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, you\u0027re a lucky chap,\" said Ben, enviously. \"I wish I could find a rich grandfather. I don\u0027t believe I ever had a grandfather.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How are you getting on, my lad?\" inquired Mr. Bates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Middlin\u0027,\" said Ben. \"I haven\u0027t laid by a fortun\u0027 yet.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I suppose not. How do you like blacking boots?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, there\u0027s other things I might like better,\" said Ben,—\"such as bein\u0027 a rich merchant; but that takes rather more capital than blackin\u0027 boots.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I see you are an original,\" said Mr. Bates, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Am I?\" said Ben. \"Well, I\u0027m glad of it, though I didn\u0027t know it before. I hope it aint anything very bad.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mark says you treated him kindly when he lived about the street.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It wasn\u0027t much,\" said Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I want to do something for you. What shall I do?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" said Ben, \"I should like a new brush. This is most worn out.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How would you like to go to Milwaukie with Mark, if I will get you a place there?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you mean it?\" said Ben, incredulously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I haven\u0027t any money to pay for goin\u0027 out there.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will take care of that,\" said Mr. Bates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I\u0027ll go,\" said Ben, \"and I\u0027m much obliged to you. Mark, you\u0027re a brick, and so\u0027s your grandfather. I never expected to have such good luck.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you must begin to make arrangements at once. Mark, here is some money. You may go with Ben, see that he takes a good bath, and then buy him some clothes. I am obliged to leave you to do it, as I must attend to some business in Wall Street. I shall expect to see you both at the Fifth Avenue Hotel at two o\u0027clock.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At two o\u0027clock, Mr. Bates found the two boys awaiting him. There was a great change in Ben\u0027s appearance. He had faithfully submitted to the bath, and bloomed out in a tasteful suit of clothes, selected by Mark. Mark had taken him besides to a barber\u0027s and had his long hair cut. So he now made quite a presentable appearance, though he felt very awkward in his new clothes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It don\u0027t seem natural to be clean,\" he confessed to Mark.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ll get used to it after a while,\" said Mark, laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Maybe I will; but I miss my old clothes. They seemed more comfortable.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next day they were to start. Ben remained at the hotel with his friend Mark, feeling, it must be confessed, a curious sensation at his unusual position.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They went to make a farewell call on Richard Hunter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Hunter,\" said Mr. Bates, \"money will not pay you for the service you have done me, but I shall be glad if you will accept this cheque.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Richard saw that it was a cheque for a thousand dollars.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you for your liberality, Mr. Bates\" he said; \"but I do not deserve it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let me be the judge of that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will accept it on one condition.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Name it, Mr. Hunter.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That you will allow me to give it to the Newsboys\u0027 Lodge, where I once found shelter, and where so many poor boys are now provided for.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will give an equal sum to that institution,\" said Mr. Bates, \"and I thank you for reminding me of it. As for this money, oblige me by keeping it yourself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then,\" said Richard, \"I will keep it as a charity fund, and whenever I have an opportunity of helping along a boy who is struggling upward as I once had to struggle, I will do it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A noble resolution, Mr. Hunter! You have found out the best use of money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mark is now at an excellent school in Milwaukie, pursuing his studies. He is the joy and solace of his grandfather\u0027s life, hitherto sad and lonely, and is winning the commendation of his teachers by his devotion to study. A place was found for Ben Gibson, where he had some advantages of education, and he is likely to do well. He has been persuaded by Mark to leave off smoking,—a habit which he had formed in the streets of New York. The shrewdness which his early experiences taught him will be likely to benefit him in the business career which lies before him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Every year Mark sends a substantial present to Mrs. Flanagan, under his grandfather\u0027s direction, and thus makes the worthy woman\u0027s life much more comfortable and easy. From time to time Mark receives a letter from Richard Hunter, who has not lost his interest in the little match boy who was once his ward.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So the trials of Mark, the Match Boy, as far as they proceeded from poverty and privation, are at an end. He has found a comfortable and even luxurious home, and a relative whose great object in life is to study his happiness. I hope that the record of his struggles will be read with interest by my young readers, and shall hope to meet them all again in the next volume of this series, which will be called:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ROUGH AND READY;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n OR,\n\u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2990/82484.html","bookId":322,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:52:29 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:52:29 AM"}
