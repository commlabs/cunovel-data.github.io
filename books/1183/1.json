He thinks it therefore due to himself to state that he believes there is not a trait in this work for which he has not the authority of his own observation, or the authentic evidence which has been received by Royal Commissions and Parliamentary Committees. But while he hopes he has alleged nothing which is not true, he has found the absolute necessity of suppressing much that is genuine. For so little do we know of the state of our own country that the air of improbability that the whole truth would inevitably throw over these pages, might deter many from their perusal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Grosvenor-Gate, May Day, 1845.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2866/79182.html","bookId":1183,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:01:38 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:01:38 AM"}
