He had to look cool, calm, and most of all, in control. He could not reveal the rage and - yes, he admitted it - fear and uncertainty roiling through his gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man who would knock on the door any minute now could not be allowed to see any of that. Ernst was an actuator, one of the long arms of the Order\u0027s Council of Seven. The man arriving was a tool for that arm ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tool who had acted on his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr had he? That was the unsettling part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed his hands together. Chilly in here. Maybe he should have kept his jacket on. The thick granite walls of the Order\u0027s Lower Manhattan Lodge kept it cool in the summer but made it hard to heat in the winter. And he wasn\u0027t getting any younger. He\u0027d passed sixty years ago. One felt the cold more in one\u0027s seventh decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr was it just his mood?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKris Szeto entered in his beloved black leather jacket. He had black hair, swarthy skin, and always appeared to need a shave, even when he didn\u0027t. He had been living in America for years but maintained a Eurotrash look. His face still exhibited faint reminders of the severe beating he\u0027d sustained two weeks ago. The bruises had cleared but a couple of fresh scars remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wished to see me?\" he said in Eastern Bloc - flavored English as he came to a stop before the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eControl ... keep the voice steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It has come to my attention that Claudiu Ozera is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incident was all over the news. Four men had opened fire on an elderly woman in Central Park this morning. A fifth gunman came to her aid, killing one of her attackers before whisking her away. The dead man had not been identified to the public, but a brother of the Order who was also a member of the NYPD had reported it to the Council. The news came as a shock. Ozera had been assigned to Szeto. Szeto was assigned to Ernst. The Council was in an uproar over it: Why was a member of the Order involved in a public shootout? Why hadn\u0027t the actuator informed them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a very good reason: Ernst had known nothing about it. But he was about to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Most unfortunate. An unforeseen circumstance.\" Szeto\u0027s tone was flat, matter-of-fact, as if explaining a spilled quart of milk. \"My team engaged target as instructed - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs instructed? Ernst let it pass for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - and fire many times, make many hits, but she does not go down. Then other man appears, firing. He kills Claudiu and wounds Filip. I am watching from side. Since Lady is not going down, I order retreat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIce shot through Ernst\u0027s veins. No ... it couldn\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Lady\u0027 ... do you mean the Lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she cannot be hurt by bullets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know this. But if the One wishes to have her shot, then I must shoot her, yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIce was fire compared to the interstellar cold exploding within him now. He couldn\u0027t help himself -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The One? How would you know what the One wishes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto\u0027s bland expression finally changed. \"He came to me and told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You idiot! That was not the One. You\u0027ve been duped!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto\u0027s face darkened. \"I know the One. Is my mother not his housekeeper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Yes, she was. The connection had slipped Ernst\u0027s mind. Women weren\u0027t allowed in the Order, of course, but the Order supplied the One with staff, and traditionally any woman supplied would be related to a brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the One knows better than all of us that the Lady can\u0027t be shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto shrugged. \"He tells me shoot Lady, I shoot. I do not question the One.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one questioned the One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Why is it you do not know of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst had been dreading the question, but was prepared for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have been out of town on Council business. Most likely he did not want to wait until I returned. The One is not known for his patience. And since he knows you are my right-hand man, he went directly to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto nodded slowly as he stared at Ernst. \"Yes. That must be it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst hoped Szeto swallowed the lie. He hadn\u0027t been anywhere but here and home in his apartment. The One could have contacted him any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he hadn\u0027t. He had bypassed Ernst the actuator and gone straight to Szeto the enforcer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe One had been furious when the Internet meltdown Ernst had engineered failed to remove the Lady. Had he given up on Ernst because of that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a breath and looked at Szeto. \"I have not spoken to the One recently. Did he say why he thought bullets might harm the Lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He tells me where she will be and when, and says to gun her down. So that is what I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. And no effect, I assume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the man who came to her defense? Was he a bodyguard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We observed before we acted. She was walking alone, no sign of anyone following. And besides, Lady does not need bodyguard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, of course she doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m not thinking straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could he with his world turning upside down?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you recognize him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto shook his head. \"He was wearing hat and had pistol held before face. And I was helping Filip escape. But he took Claudiu\u0027s gun. We have seen this happen before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes ... last summer, when Max and Josef were gunned down at the hospital, and just a couple of weeks ago when Fournier was killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it\u0027s the same man who was protecting Louise Myers and Edward Connell? That would mean he has collected three of your guns in the course of killing half a dozen of your men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst put the slightest emphasis on each your.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto spoke through clenched teeth. \"If it is same man, I want him. The Myers woman can lead me to him...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the One says she is to be left alone. Remember that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember. But no matter. I will find him, I will catch up to him one day, and then he will curse his mother for giving him birth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, well, good luck on that. Now, if you don\u0027t mind...\" He shuffled assorted random papers on his desk. \"I have some of the Council\u0027s business to attend to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSzeto left without another word. As soon as the door closed behind him, Ernst shot from his seat and began pacing his office. He could not sit still, not after what he\u0027d just heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBypassed! The One had bypassed not only him but the High Council as well, and gone straight to one of the Order\u0027s enforcers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemory of Ernst\u0027s last encounter with the One, here, on this very spot, flashed through his brain. He could still feel the pressure of the One\u0027s hand on his throat as he\u0027d lifted him off the floor, the heat of his breath as he\u0027d spoken so close to his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou still might prove useful, otherwise ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise what he hadn\u0027t said. He hadn\u0027t had to. Ernst hadn\u0027t been able to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At last I can take direct action. I may call on you and your Order for minor logistical support, but now that I am free to act, I will take matters into my own hands. I will finish this myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he\u0027d hurled Ernst across the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst rubbed his throat. The bruises had faded away only recently, but the fear hadn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may call on you and your Order for minor logistical support ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he hadn\u0027t called on Ernst. He\u0027d called on Szeto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave I been marginalized?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe possibility brought a surge of bile. Like his father before him, he had devoted his entire life to the Order, to helping the Otherness become ascendant in this world. The Otherness would bring about the Change, and elevate its loyal helpers to allow them not only to survive unscathed in the remade world but to oversee it as well. To be Movers among the Moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father hadn\u0027t lived to see the Change, but Ernst fully expected to. He could sense its imminence. And the One would choose those who would be part of the Change rather than merely subject to it. Ernst had fully expected to be among the chosen ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had failed the One and the One had turned against him. No ... not against him. Simply discarded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to find a way back into his good graces. If he couldn\u0027t, it meant all his years in the Order had been wasted. After the Change he would be just another face in the hordes of oppressed humanity ... looking up to the likes of Szeto for mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. He would die first. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-5.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
