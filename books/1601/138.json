He carried it with him, turned to its slumbering position, as Lanfear had taught him. It made no dome now, but he could make one when he wished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanfear had all but given it to him. What did that mean? Why did she taunt him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ripped at a hunk of dried meat. Was Faile safe? If the Shadow discovered what she was doing . . . Well, he wished he could at least check on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a long drink from his waterskin, then searched outward for the wolves. There were hundreds of them up here, in the Borderlands. Perhaps thousands. He gave those nearby a greeting, sending his scent mixed with his image. The dozen replies that came were not words, but his mind understood them as such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung Bull! This from a wolf named White Eyes. The Last Hunt is here. Will you lead us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany asked this, lately, and Perrin couldn’t figure out how to interpret it. Why do you need me to lead you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will be by your call’ White Eyes replied. By your howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t understand what you mean, Perrin sent. Can you not hunt on your own?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot this prey, Young Bull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin shook his head. A response like others he’d received. White Eyes, he sent. Have you seen Slayer? The killer of wolves? Has he stalked you here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin sent it out broadly, and some of the other wolves replied. They knew of Slayer. His image and scent had been passed among many wolves, much as had Perrin\u0027s own. None had seen him recently, but time was an odd thing to wolves; Perrin wasn’t certain how recent their \"recently\" really was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin took a bite of dried meat, and caught himself growling softly. He stifled that. He had come to a peace with the wolf inside of him, but that didn’t mean he intended to let it start tracking mud into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung Bull, another wolf sent. Turn Bow, an aged female pack leader. Moonhunter walks the dreams again. She seeks you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you, he sent back. I know this. I will avoid her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvoid the moon? Turn Bow sent back. A difficult thing, Young Bull. Difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had the right of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Heartseeker just now, sent Steps, a black-furred youth. She wears a new scent, but it is her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther wolves sent agreement. Heartseeker was in the wolf dream. Some had seen her to the east, but others said that she had been seen to the south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what of Slayer? Where was the man, if not hunting wolves? Perrin caught himself growling again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeartseeker. That must be one of the Forsaken, though he didn’t recognize the images they sent of her. She was ancient, and so were the memories of wolves, but often the things they remembered were fragments of fragments that their ancestors had seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any news?\" Gaul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another one of the Forsaken is here\", Perrin said with a grunt. \"Doing something to the east\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it involve us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Forsaken always involve us\", Perrin said, standing. He reached down, touched Gaul on the shoulder and shifted them in the direction Steps had indicated. The position wasn’t exact, but once Perrin arrived, he found some wolves who had seen Heartseeker on their way to the Borderlands the day before. They sent Perrin eager greetings, asking if he was going to lead them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rebuffed their questions, pinpointing where Heartseeker had been spotted. It was Merrilor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin shifted there. A strange mist hung over the landscape here. Tall trees, the ones Rand had grown, reflected here, and their lofty tops poked out of the mist above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTents dotted the landscape, like the tops of mushrooms. Aiel tents were plentiful, and between them cook fires glowed in the mist. This camp had been here long enough to manifest in the wolf dream, though tent flaps changed places and bedrolls vanished, flickering in the insubstantial way of this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin led Gaul between the neat rows of tents and horseless horse pickets. They both froze as they heard a sound. Someone muttering. Perrin used the trick he’d seen Lanfear use, creating a pocket of. . . something around himself that was invisible, but which stopped sound. It was strange, but he did it by creating a barrier with no air in it. Why would that make the sound stop?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Gaul crept forward to the canvas of a tent. That of the man Rodel Ituralde, one of the great captains, judging by the banner. Inside, a woman in trousers picked through documents on a table. They kept vanishing in her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin didn’t recognize her, though she was painfully homely. That certainly wasn’t what he’d have expected from one of the Forsaken; not that large forehead, bulbous nose, uneven eyes or thinning hair. He didn’t recognize her curses, though he grasped the meaning from her tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaul looked at him, and Perrin reached for his hammer, but hesitated. Attacking Slayer was one thing, but one of the Forsaken? He was confident of his ability to resist weaves here in the wolf dream. But still . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman cursed again as the paper she was reading vanished. Then she looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin’s reaction was immediate. He created a paper-thin wall between her and him, her side painted with an exact replica of the landscape behind him, his side transparent. She looked right at him, but didn’t see him, and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him, Gaul let out a very soft breath of relief. How did I do that? Perrin thought. It wasn’t something he had practiced; it had merely seemed right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeartseeker—this had to be she—waved her fingers, and the tent split in half above her, the canvas flaps hanging down. She rose through the air, moving toward the black tempest above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin whispered to Gaul, \"Wait here and watch for danger\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaul nodded. Perrin cautiously followed Heartseeker, lifting himself into the air with a thought. He tried to form another wall between himself and her, but it was too difficult to keep the right image displayed while moving. Instead, he kept his distance and put a blank brownish-green wall between him and the Forsaken, hoping that if she happened to glance down, she’d pass over the small oddity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to move more quickly, and Perrin forced himself to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced down, and was rewarded with the stomach-churning sight of Merrilor’s landscape dwindling below. Then it grew dark and vanished into blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn’t pass through the clouds. As the ground faded away, so did the clouds, and they entered someplace black. Pinpricks of light appeared all around Perrin. The woman above stopped and hung in the air for a few moments before streaking away to the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin followed again, coloring himself—his skin, his clothing, everything—black to hide. The woman approached one of the pinpricks of light until it expanded and dominated \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-138.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
