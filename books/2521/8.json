Now get back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuffed my things in my locker and made my way to the cafeteria. Along the way I ran into Mackenzie. I was as happy to see her now as I’d been at the club but still grabbed her by the arm to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at my fingers, curled her red lips in distaste and jerked away. But she didn’t walk off, as per usual, and I was grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want?” she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a sweet, sweet girl. “Where’s Cole?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What am I? His keeper?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just tell me where he is,” I gritted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean gone?” He’d left without saying goodbye? Again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there more than one meaning for the word?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t punch her. You can’t afford a suspension. “What’s the deal with Veronica? She and Cole are on such great terms, I’m curious about how long they’ve known each other.” I should be discussing this with Cole, and only with Cole, but curiosity—and maybe a little anger—urged me onward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cole dated her before me. I’ve heard rumors, but I’m not one hundred percent sure why they broke up. He never said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep it together. Something about her tone... She knew something she wasn’t telling me. “When he broke up with you, how did he do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me as if I were a bug under a microscope—already dissected, ready to be sold for parts. Finally she averted her gaze, but not before I caught a glimmer of pity. “It was a few weeks after Bronx and I moved into his guesthouse, and a few months before you showed up. He got me alone, sat me down and told me we were over. I was absolutely blindsided. Even the day before, we were pretty into each other. Or so I thought.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlindsided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto each other one day, but not the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep. It. Together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat sidled up beside me, saying, “There you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would help me, despite her problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, well. Hello, Ally Kat.” Mackenzie smiled with saccharine sweetness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two had never been friends, and probably never would be. Mackenzie, so protective of “her” boys, had tried to ruin Kat’s relationship with Frosty a time or ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Love Button,” Kat replied, using the same tenor of falseness. Then she turned to me, putting her back to Mackenzie, as if the girl were of no consequence. Her cheeks were colorless, and her lips chapped from being chewed. “I’m blowing lunch and my last few hours and taking off. I’ll pick you up for tonight’s game. And I know you want to spend a few minutes explaining why you can’t go, but I’ll save you the time since there’s no way you can win this argument. You’re going and that’s final.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth, but she kissed my cheek and bounded off before I could get out a single word. “What if I have to, I don’t know, help Cole?” I called. A few slayers had to patrol the streets nearly every night, just in case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never turned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t. You haven’t been put on rotation,” Mackenzie said, and bounded off in the other direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole still hadn’t added me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling, I entered the lunchroom and headed toward the table I shared with Reeve and the slayers. Halfway there, I slammed into a brick wall. Or rather, a brick wall that went by the name of Justin Silverstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Move,” I commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig brown puppy-dog eyes peered down at me, beseeching. “Why would I? I’m right where I want to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s odd, considering your location might just get your testicles knocked into your throat.” I wasn’t falling for his innocent act. Not again. He’d once used me for information to feed to Anima. He might even have helped them bomb my house. No telling what he’d do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me a chance to explain my side of things, Ali. Please. I had nothing to do with—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Save it.” I took a step to the side, intending to brush past him, then stopped as a thought occurred to me. “First, answer a question for me. Did you talk to Cole on the phone last Saturday night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn emotionless mask descended—the same one Cole had been donning lately. “No. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was to be believed, I’d dreamed their conversation. My mind really was a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch me as I don’t discuss that with you.” I marched to the table and sat with more of a slam than I’d intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did Justin want?” Frosty asked, looking ready to commit murder on my behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To chat about old times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBronx ran his tongue over his teeth. It was his way of telling me he would be at Frosty’s side, inflicting major damage on the boy. With his spiked hair now dyed an electric blue rather than green, and the piercings in his eyebrow and lip—and, okay, the tattoo peeking from under the collar of his shirt—he didn’t have to say anything to scare the crap out of most people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrosty crossed his arms over his chest. “Want me to break his face?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s sweet of you to offer,” I replied, liking that I had such fierce protectors, “but if there’s going to be any face-breaking, I’m going to be the one to do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, if you change your mind...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll let you know.” I picked at the lunch I’d packed—a bagel with cream cheese—and wondered where Cole had gone, what he was doing and if this day could get any worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a stupid question, I told myself later that evening. Of course the day could get worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy five, a cold front had swept into Birmingham, and by eight I felt like a Popsicle despite my winter wear. I huddled on the stadium bleachers between Kat and Reeve. Neither girl seemed to notice the frigid temperatures. They were too busy bouncing up and down and celebrating. The Tigers had just scored their first touchdown of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the second quarter kicked off, Kat said, “So, get this. I’m, like, way more mad at Frosty than ever before. I may not ever forgive him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” I asked. She was paler than she’d been at school, and despite her excitement over the game, her eyes were a little glassy. “What’d he do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last night he kissed some skank—right in my front yard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Kat. I’m so sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That snake!” Reeve exclaimed. “He deserves to die a thousand painful deaths.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat nodded, saying, “And that’s not even the worst part. He put her on the back of his unicorn and rode off into the rainbow. He’s never taken me to a rainbow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. “What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dream last night,” she said easily, then sipped her hot chocolate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your dream.” Reeve shook her head. “You’re more mad at him than ever because of a dream?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey! I always behave myself in dreams,” she said. “He should, too. And if he can’t, he needs to apologize with more than my favorite flowers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He actually brought you flowers?” Stunned, I blinked at her. “For what he did in a dream?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yeah. Wouldn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, I couldn’t get Cole to say more than seven words to me. In real life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin suddenly plopped into the seat in front of me and though he grinned at me, he didn’t look me in the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this a nightmare?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pretty brunette eased beside him, and she wasn’t one of the girls from the club. She wrapped a possessive arm around his shoulders. A clear warning to me and my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a girlfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned at the girl, removed her arm. O-kay. Maybe not a girlfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali Bell,” he said with a nod of greeting. “It’s good to see you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t shaved since the last time I’d seen him, and golden stubble now covered his jaw. Heart pounding unsteadily, I jerked my gaze to just over his shoulder, just in case he accidentally glanced up. “Uh, hi,” I replied. “What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I came to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, I remember you,” Kat interjected. “From—” she caught herself before she admitted something she shouldn’t and finished with a limp “—somewhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve stiffened, as if she knew Kat was hiding something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should,” Gavin said. “I’m unforgettable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What a strange coincidence,” Kat replied, fluffing her hair. “I am, too. So, are you a new member of the Asher High student body?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe maybe/maybe-not-girlfriend snorted. “Does he look like he’s in high school, kid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer disdain irked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin, I’d discovered, had graduated last year. He was nineteen, not that much older than me, but he looked about thirty. The finest of lines branched from his eyes—either laugh lines, scowl lines or both. With slayers, you couldn’t be sure. Most of the guys were as mean as rattlesnakes, but they were also quite warped in the humor department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hillary,” Gavin admonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Belinda,” the girl corrected tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever. I wanted one night, you wanted two. I agreed to give you the second night if you promised to behave. You’re not behaving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed her lips together and remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you kidding me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was casually discussing sex with a woman he’d called by the wrong name. I had no words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since no one is willing to make introductions,” Reeve said to break up the tenser-by-the-second silence, “I’ll do it. I’m Reeve Ankh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin looked her over with unabashed interest. “You the one dating Bronx?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not dating, no. We’re not even on friendly terms anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught the bitterness in her tone. She had no idea her father had threatened to pull his support from the slayers if one of the boys made a play for her. Every day Bronx had to choose between the girl he wanted and the friends he was determined to protect. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-zombie-glass-white-rabbit-chronicles-2/page-8.html","bookId":2521,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:05 PM"}
