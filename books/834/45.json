Far as the eye could see nothing was visible but the cold sea on the one hand, and the long, flat stretch of a great marsh, blackened here and there by leafless tree, upon the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘They are late,’ said Forster impatiently. ‘If he should take flight after all.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I think he will come. But you are shaking like a leaf.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Do you think I am afraid?’ asked Forster with a strange smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sutherland knew better, and shook his head sadly. But Forster’s agitation, caused mainly by the mental strain of the last few days, filled him with deep concern.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A few minutes later three figures emerged on the open space of sand. These were Gavrolles, the Chevalier, his second, carrying a case of duelling pistols, and a little baldheaded man, carrying another case filled with surgical instruments.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Chevalier led Sutherland apart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘These are the weapons. Do they meet with your approbation?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sutherland examined the pistols, and nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Will you load them, monsieur, or shall I?’ asked the Chevalier, still politely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sutherland undertook the operation, while the Chevalier watched him keenly. The pistols loaded, Gavrolles took one, Forster the other, and they moved to their places. It was arranged that the Chevalier and Sutherland should simultaneously count ten, and then utter the word “Fire,” which should be the signal for the duellists to discharge their weapons.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sutherland placed his man in position. So little did Forster know of how to protect himself, so clumsy was his exposure of his vital parts, that the surgeon in attendance uttered an exclamation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Mon Dieu!’ he cried. ‘It is not like a duel—but an assassination!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Trembling with fear for Forster, who seemed quite helpless, Sutherland made one last appeal for him to withdraw, but the appeal was altogether useless.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Well, then, since it must be, cover your man well, and aim low. The moment the word is given, raise your aim and fire; don’t lose an instant, or he will anticipate you. You understand?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Yes.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The seconds moved away, while Gavrolles and Forster faced each other. On the face of the Frenchman there was a curious blending of self-confidence, malignity, and nervous anticipation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sun rose coldly over the damp sands, but the air was still dank and cold, and the seconds, in slow monotonous voices, began simultaneously to count.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One—two—three—four—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten—‘fire!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before the last word was half pronounced, Gavrolles had raised his weapon, covered his opponent with lightning rapidity, and fired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the very moment he was about to raise his pistol in the air, Forster felt his arm suddenly grow powerless, while the weapon dropped from his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sutherland and the little surgeon simultaneously uttered an exclamation. The former reached his friend just in time to catch him in his arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘He is wounded!’ he cried. ‘I call you all to witness, it is a murder, not a duel.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Swift as thought, the surgeon placed Forster on the ground, stripped off his coat, and cutting away a portion of his shirt, which was saturated with blood, disclosed an ugly wound in the shoulder. Forster, who had scarcely lost consciousness, opened his eyes with a twinge of pain, as the surgeon began to probe the wound for the bullet. It was the work of a moment; for the lead, after striking and partially fracturing the bone, had embedded itself in the fleshy part of the arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘It is not so bad as I feared,’ said the surgeon; ‘but it was not fairly done.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘It was most foully done,’ cried Sutherland, springing up and facing Gavrolles, who had approached and stood very pale, looking on. ‘Monsieur Gavrolles, it is now my turn. You shall fight me!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I shall do nothing of the kind,’ returned the Frenchman, turning on his heel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘But you shall!’ Sutherland exclaimed, seizing him by the arm and whirling him savagely round. ‘If you do not, I will shoot you like a dog.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he spoke he stooped and picked up Forster’s undischarged pistol, and covered Gavrolles, who cowered and shook like a leaf.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I repeat, my friend has fallen by foul play. You fired too soon—ah I I know the old device of scoundrels like yourself. I demand satisfaction.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here the Chevalier thought it time to interfere.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘If that is so, I am at your service.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘All in good time, but my business is first with the assassin. I appeal to you as his second and a man of honour. Was it a fair duel?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Chevalier scowled and looked uneasily from one to another.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘It was a mistake, doubtless,’ he said; ‘your principal was so slow.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘It was no mistake; it was a ruse. He shall fight me—by God he shall!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Chevalier turned to Gavrolles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘What do you say?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gavrolles shrugged his shoulders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘The man is mad—I have no quarrel with him—nevertheless, if he wishes to be served like his companion——’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘No, it is impossible,’ said the Chevalier. ‘An affair of honour must be conducted according to the code. Even if my friend consented to this preposterous arrangement, you would have to be properly represented, and, there being no second present, I decline, on my friend’s account.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But here the little surgeon, who had carefully drest Forster’s wound, and placed him carefully and comfortably in a sitting posture against a large fragment of stone, leapt up in excitement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Pardon, monsieur! I am here, and I will act as the English monsieur’s second.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘You?’ exclaimed the Chevalier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Yes, Beauvoisin, I! I saw it all, and I repeat—it was not a duel, but an assassination.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Monsieur, take care!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Do you take care, Beauvoisin!’ screamed the little man fiercely. ‘I refuse to be a party to a cheat, either with pistols or cards.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e More high words ensued, and the two combatants seemed likely to fly at each other’s throats, when Gavrolles, who saw Sutherland still ready to fire upon him if he attempted to leave the ground, seized his second angrily by the arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘It is enough—I will fight the scoundrel. If he falls he will have himself to blame.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So at last it was arranged. Gavrolles’ pistol was reloaded, while Sutherland still retained the weapon undischarged by Forster. The ground was measured; the men took their places, and the seconds stood aside, ready to give the signal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was arranged this time that ‘three’ only should be counted, and the moment the last number was given the men were to fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sutherland stood cold and collected; Gavrolles, this time, shook violently, and seemed to lose his self-possession.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Stop!’ he cried, just as the second prepared to count.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘No! It is infamous! I will not fight again.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he threw down his pistol.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘A coward,’ said Sutherland; ‘I thought so!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the fire-eating Chevalier now walked over, lifted the weapon, and handed it back to his principal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘On the contrary, you must fight now,’ he said grimly. ‘If not, I shall proclaim you to be what the Englishman calls you, a coward.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With one fierce glare into his friend’s face, Gavrolles snatched the pistol, uttered an execration, and again took his stand facing Sutherland.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Chevalier walked back to his place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘One—two—three!’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before the last number was uttered, Gavrolles had raised his pistol; but Sutherland, who had watched him keenly, was as quick as he. The weapons were discharged simultaneously, and one sharp report rang out in the air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sutherland stood unscathed, though the bullet had almost grazed his brow. Gavrolles, with a stifled scream, threw up his arms, and fell forward on his face—shot through the heart.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1856/53807.html","bookId":834,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:42:08 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:42:08 AM"}
