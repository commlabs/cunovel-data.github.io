{"id":31623,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII SKIPPY’S WISDOM","content":"Skippy got the most out of his commandeered kicker. He opened it wide and raced her down the river and the closer he got to the bay the more apprehensive did he feel about Big Joe’s flight. He tried not to attach any special significance to his good friend’s shouts, but he could not help remembering Tully’s earlier veiled threats about Skinner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His fears grew as he chugged out into the bay and something urged him on still faster. Then he spied the glistening hull of the beautiful Apollyon, her anchor lights gleaming like stars against the night and a single light amidships.\n\u003cbr\u003e 187\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Funny, the boy thought, how much it seemed like that night when he and his father had come for the showdown with the older Flint. Now there was to be no showdown, but he must warn Skinner against Big Joe’s sudden maniacal fury. Queer that he should go to such trouble for a man who had given them no quarter in anything. But he was not thinking of doing Skinner a good turn beyond that it might prevent Big Joe from killing the Flint agent and being sent to jail.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He approached the yacht with his old feeling of awe. The deck was almost dark as he scrambled aboard but up forward he saw the rotund form of the second mate asleep and snoring in a luxurious swing. The boy could not help remember a very solemn resolve that night long ago, when the mate had sworn to be more faithful to his duties during his night watches.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With silent tread, he hurried along the deck and stopped before the lighted cabin amidships. Once, twice, he knocked softly, and waited.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Come in!” Marty Skinner’s cold voice commanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Skippy stepped in, his heart bounding. He was thinking of the last time he had been in this room and closed the door, determined he would not be driven out again until he had had his say.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well?” Skinner snapped but this time he did not order Skippy out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You seen Big Joe Tully?” Skippy asked bravely. “He been here yet?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What d’ye mean—yet? I have no business with Tully and I haven’t any with you that I know of.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 188\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re wrong both times Mister Skinner. ’Cause if you don’t listen to me Big Joe’ll be comin’ here an’ he’ll try gettin’ you an’ he’s so mad he’ll probably kill you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Skinner was all interest now. “He’s mad and he may kill me and you come to warn me. That’s funny.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No it ain’t funny. I wouldn’t care much what happened to you Mister Skinner you been so hard on me’n Pop an’ everybody, but I ain’t gonna see Big Joe get in a jam an’ maybe go to jail for life on accounta you. I’m tippin’ you off so’s Big Joe won’t have no chance gettin’ jammed. Maybe after that blowin’ up of the barges tonight, which they say you ordered done, an’ what happened to that guy Beasell I oughta let....”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Blowing up barges? Beasell? What d’ye mean, boy? What happened?”\n\u003cbr\u003e 189\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, Beasell come an’ ordered us outa the Basin by sundown tomorrow, sayin’ it was your orders, an’ if we can’t get the barges out they’ll be blowed up. Some time after he left me’n Joe I go for a boat ride. When I come back I see Beasell in a boat all battered an’ lookin’ as if he’s dead. So I goes to call Joe an’ while he’s gettin’ his shoes on I comes out again an’ I just got near the rail when there’s an explosion an’ I’m tossed in the water. I swim till I find a boat an’ climb in. I see Big Joe on deck an’ he’s yellin’ that I’m lost an’ acts like he’s gonna get you when he jumps in his kicker an’ races off without hearin’ me. So I come right here to beat him to it an’ keep him outa trouble, see?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Skinner did not seem interested in the explosion. While he appeared callous as to the suffering and death that came in its wake he wanted to know more about Beasell. “D’ye think he’s really dead?” he asked anxiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Looked like that to me,” answered Skippy, “an’ if he wasn’t he probably was blowed apart or burnt up.” He wondered at the look of satisfaction that appeared on Skinner’s face. “But you better be beatin’ it Mister Skinner or Big Joe’ll be here an’ takin’ you apart if he don’t kill you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, if Big Joe comes here looking for trouble he’ll get it—and plenty.” Skinner reached under his left arm and pulling out a pistol laid it on the table before him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Skippy heard footsteps and turned as if to shout a warning.\n\u003cbr\u003e 190\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Quiet you!” Skinner ordered as he picked up the pistol and leveled it at the door. Skippy with visions of his beloved Big Joe shot dead in his tracks as he opened the door wished from the bottom of his heart that he had not tried to warn Skinner. All he had done was bait the trap for Big Joe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stood there, a bit to the side of the desk, his knees shaking and, while his brain was active, he was so terror stricken that he could not open his mouth to warn Big Joe of his impending fate. He closed his eyes and said a little prayer as he heard the door creak a bit on its hinges. Why hadn’t he left the door open when he came into Skinner’s cabin, why....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A few tense seconds that seemed as so many hours to Skippy and then he heard the voice of Inspector Jones: “Now that’s hardly the nice way to welcome a police officer, Mr. Skinner. I like your extended hand but not with a gun in it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Skippy looked up to see Inspector Jones advancing into the room and this time a policeman’s uniform was a most welcome sight to him. He breathed thanks that the visitor was not Big Joe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll just tuck the hardware away, Inspector, and give you the hand.” Skinner smiled and did so. “I thought you were Big Joe Tully coming in to get me. The boy here warned me Joe was on the warpath so I was all set to welcome him and beat him to the draw.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 191\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So I could see,” the Inspector commented. “Heard about the burning of the barges in the Basin and what happened to poor Beasell?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “This boy told me there was an explosion and that some one slugged Beasell. Tell me is he—is he—dead?” The question sounded to Skippy as if Skinner was hoping the answer would be yes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Inspector Jones looked sharply at Skinner. “Yes. He is,” he answered simply and again looked up sharply as Skinner sighed as if in relief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Beasell was in my confidence. He knew my business and I trusted him,” Skinner spoke as if to himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sure, I know you did,” the Inspector agreed and there was that in his words which made Skippy feel as if there was something behind them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And how did you know that, may I ask, Inspector?” Skinner seemed a bit ill at ease.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I talked to him before he died. We picked him up in a boat when we went to the fire. He had been badly beaten but before he died he regained consciousness. He talked plenty, too.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What did he say? Tell who beat him up?” Skinner was plainly anxious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, strange to say he didn’t.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well then...?”\n\u003cbr\u003e 192\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Just this.” Inspector Jones whipped out his gun. “Put ’em up Skinner and keep ’em up. I’m arresting you and I’m going to charge you with the murder of Josiah Flint.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why—why—that’s—that’s ridiculous, Inspector. You can’t make a charge like that stand up on the ravings of a dying man.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I didn’t tell you that Beasell made any such charges. But I’m tellin’ you now that he made a dying statement that he was in the kicker off the yacht when Skippy and his father came along, that he had been there some time, and hearing you and Flint quarreling, he watched through the porthole, saw you two struggling after Flint charged you with cheating him—saw you shoot the old man in the back when you twisted him around as he tried to snatch the gun you drew in your anger. He also saw you sit old Flint up again, scatter papers all over the place and take what money there was in his desk. Beasell’s blackmailed you plenty since, threatening to turn you in.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But—but——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And that isn’t all,” the Inspector went on relentlessly. “Buck Flint has been giving you a free hand and staying away, but he’s had accountants working on your books and he’s got plenty of evidence as to how you’ve ben cheating him and how you cheated the old man.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 193\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No jury will ever convict me on evidence like that.” Skinner seemed to have regained his composure. “Beasell was only a cheap crook anyway and he’s dead, too. Stealing money isn’t murder.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Guess you’re right on those points,” the Inspector mused and Skinner started to lower his hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not so fast, not so fast there! Keep ’em up! There’s one bet you overlooked, Skinner, and I’m going to call it right now.” Still keeping Skinner covered the Inspector moved closer and pulled the gun out of the man’s shoulder holster. “I’ve got a hunch that our ballistic expert will find a groove in the barrel of your gun which will prove the bullet which killed old Flint was fired by you. The gun never was found, you remember, but the bullet with a peculiar mark was and it’s still right down at headquarters.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Skinner slumped into a chair at that, but Skippy looked quickly from his dejected figure as he heard a familiar bark. He turned to the door and there in the arms of a policeman was his beloved Mugs.\n\u003cbr\u003e 194\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mugs! Mugs!” he cried out overjoyed. And then, as if in afterthought, “See anythin’ of Big Joe, officer? Gee, if he’d only come along now, ’cause I know my Pop’s gonna be free soon, everythin’d be just grand. Gee, but I’m happy. I’m....”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stopped suddenly frightened at something he saw in the policeman’s face. “What—what—what’s wrong? Tell me,” he demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m in a tough spot, kid, but I know you got plenty guts, so here goes point blank. Big Joe went back to your barge figgering you might have found your way back there. We see him and tell him you’re safe. Then he hears the dog barkin’, goes into the flames after him and saves him.” He paused, gulped, then went on: “He was burned bad, Big Joe was. Fulla smoke, too. Well, anyways ... he kicked off.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a silence, which was finally broken by Skippy’s sobs. At a motion from Inspector Jones the policeman, who had brought Mugs and the sad news about Big Joe, handcuffed Skinner and took him out of the cabin, softly closing the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was far in the night before Inspector Jones had Skippy sufficiently comforted so that the boy fell asleep. Then the Inspector bundled him up, carried him to the police launch and that night Skippy and Mugs slept at the Inspector’s home.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1707/50291.html","bookId":1149,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:31:31 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:31:31 AM"}
