They took the long way around through the parking lots to the main building, as if brisk motion through chill fall air would rid them of the stink of paint and death. They rode the elevator four floors underground in silence. Walked through the narrow corridor and spilled into the seminar room and found Julia Lamarr sitting alone at the table, looking up at the silent television screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re supposed to be out of here,\" Blake said to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any conclusions?\" she asked quietly. \"From Stavely? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake shook his head. \"Later. You should have gone home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I told you. I can\u0027t go home. I need to be on top of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re exhausted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saying I\u0027m not effective?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake sighed. \"Julia, give me a break. I\u0027ve got to organize. You collapse with exhaustion, you\u0027re no good to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not going to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was an order, you realize that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLamarr waved a hand, like a gesture of refusal. Harper stared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was an order,\" Blake said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I ignored it,\" Lamarr said. \"So what are you going to do? We need to work. We\u0027ve got three weeks to catch this guy. That\u0027s not a lot of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shook his head. \"That\u0027s plenty of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarper turned her stare on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we talk about his motive, right now,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence. Lamarr stiffened in her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think his motive is clear,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was ice in her voice. Reacher turned to face her, softening his expression, trying to defer to the fact that her family had been wiped out in the space of two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t to me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLamarr turned to Blake, appealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t start arguing this all over again,\" she said. \"Not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve done this work already,\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, people,\" Blake called. \"Just relax. We\u0027ve got three weeks, and we\u0027re not going to waste any of it arguing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to waste all of it, if you keep on like this,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was suddenly tension in the air. Lamarr stared down at the table. Blake was silent. Then he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got three minutes, Reacher,\" he said. \"Tell us what\u0027s on your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong about his motive,\" Reacher said. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s on my mind. It\u0027s keeping you away from looking in the right places.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve done this work already,\" Lamarr said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we need to do it over,\" Reacher said, gently. \"Because we won\u0027t find the guy if we\u0027re looking in the wrong places. That stands to reason, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we need this?\" Lamarr said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two minutes and thirty seconds,\" Blake said. \"Give us what you\u0027ve got. Reacher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher took a breath. \"This is a very smart guy, right? Very, very smart. Smart in a very particular way. He\u0027s committed four homicides, bizarre, elaborate scenarios, and he hasn\u0027t left the slightest shred of evidence behind. He\u0027s only made one mistake, by leaving one box open. And that was a fairly trivial mistake, because it\u0027s not getting us anywhere. So we\u0027ve got a guy who\u0027s successfully handled a thousand decisions, a thousand details, under urgent and stressful conditions. He\u0027s killed four women and so far we don\u0027t even know how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" Blake said. \"What\u0027s your point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His intelligence,\" Reacher said. \"It\u0027s a specific type. It\u0027s practical, efficient, real-world. He\u0027s got his feet on the ground. He\u0027s a planner, and he\u0027s pragmatic. He\u0027s a problem solver. He\u0027s intensely rational. He deals with reality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" Blake said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So let me ask you a question. You got a problem with black people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just answer the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good or bad as anybody, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Good or bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about women? Good or bad as anybody, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded. \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what if some guy is saying to you that black people are no good, or women are no good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say he\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d say he\u0027s wrong, and you\u0027d know he\u0027s wrong, because deep down you know what the truth of the matter is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded again. \"Sure. So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s my experience, too. Racists are fundamentally wrong. Sexists, too. No room for argument about it. Fundamentally, it\u0027s a completely irrational position to hold. So think about it. Any guy who gets in a big tantrum about this harassment issue is a guy who\u0027s wrong. Any guy who blames the victims is very wrong. And any guy who goes around looking for revenge against the victims is very wrong. He\u0027s got a screw loose. His brain doesn\u0027t function right. He\u0027s not rational. He\u0027s not dealing with reality. He\u0027s can\u0027t be. Deep down, he\u0027s some kind of an idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But our guy isn\u0027t an idiot. We just agreed he\u0027s very smart. Not eccentric smart, not lunatic smart, but real-world smart, rational and pragmatic and practical. He\u0027s dealing with reality. We just agreed on that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he\u0027s not motivated by anger at these women. He can\u0027t be. It\u0027s not possible. You can\u0027t be real-world smart and real-world dumb, all at the same time. You can\u0027t be rational and irrational. You can\u0027t deal with reality and simultaneously not deal with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know what his motive is,\" Lamarr said. \"What else could it be? The target group is too exact for it to be anything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shook his head. \"Like it or not, the way you\u0027re describing his motive, you\u0027re calling him deranged. But a deranged guy couldn\u0027t commit these crimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLamarr clamped her teeth. Reacher heard them click and grind. He watched her. She shook her head. Her thin hair moved with it, stiff, like it was full of lacquer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s his real motive, smart guy?\" she asked, her voice low and quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know? You better be kidding. You question my expertise and you don\u0027t know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be something simple. It always is, right? Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the simple thing is the correct thing. Maybe doesn\u0027t work like that for you guys down here, but that\u0027s how it works out there in the real world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody said a word. Then the door opened and Poulton walked into the silence, small and sandy with a faint smile hanging there under his mustache. The smile disappeared as soon as the atmosphere hit him. He sat down quietly next to Lamarr and pulled a stack of paper in front of him, defensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded toward Reacher. \"Smart guy here is challenging Julia\u0027s reading of the motive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s wrong about the motive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smart guy is about to tell us. You\u0027re just in time for the expert seminar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the screwdriver?\" Reacher asked. \"Any conclusions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoulton\u0027s smile came back. \"Either that screwdriver or an identical one was used to lever the lids off. The marks match perfectly. But what\u0027s all this about the motive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher took a breath and looked around the faces opposite him. Blake, hostile. Lamarr, white and tense. Harper, curious. Poulton, blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, smart guy, we\u0027re listening,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be something simple,\" Reacher said again. \"Something simple and obvious. And common. And lucrative enough to be worth protecting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s protecting something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"That\u0027s my guess. I think maybe he\u0027s eliminating witnesses to something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Witnesses to what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some kind of a racket, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of a racket?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shrugged. \"Something big, something systematic, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inside the Army?\" Lamarr asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" he said. \"A big systematic racket, inside the Army. What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence again. Then Lamarr buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders started moving. She started rocking back and forward in her chair. Reacher stared at her. She was sobbing, like her heart was breaking. He realized it a moment later than he should have, because she was doing it absolutely silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia?\" Blake called. \"You OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took her hands away from her face. Gestured helplessly with her hands, yes, no, wait. Her face was white and contorted and anguished. Her eyes were closed. The room was silent. Just the rasp of her breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be sorry,\" Blake said. \"It\u0027s the stress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, wildly. \"No, I made a terrible mistake. Because I think Reacher\u0027s right. He\u0027s got to be. So I was wrong, all along. I screwed up. I missed it. I should have seen it before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it now,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her head and stared at him. \"Don\u0027t worry about it? Don\u0027t you see? All the time we wasted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter,\" Blake said, limply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared on at him. \"Of course it matters. Don\u0027t you see? My sister died because I wasted all this time. It\u0027s my fault. I killed her. Because I was wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence again. Blake stared at her, helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to take time out,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. Wiped her eyes. \"No, no, I need to work. I already wasted too much time. So now I need to think. I need to play catch-up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should go home. Take a couple of days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher watched her. She was collapsed in her chair like she had taken a savage beating. Her face was blotched red and white. Her breathing was shallow, and her eyes were blank and vacant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need rest,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stirred and shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe later,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence again. Then she hauled herself upright in her chair and fought to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe later I\u0027ll rest,\" she said. \"But first I work. First, we all work. We\u0027ve got to think. We\u0027ve got to think about the Army.

That\u0027s James Cozo\u0027s business, in New York. I know you stole their money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They had handguns,\" Reacher said. \"M9 Berettas, with the serial numbers filed off. What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were illegally obtained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"From the Army. M9 Berettas are military-issue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake looked blank. \"So what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So if this is some Army guy protecting a racket, the racket most likely involves theft, and if the stakes are high enough for killing people, the theft most likely involves weapons, because that\u0027s where the money is. And these women were all in a position where they could have witnessed weapons theft. They were right there in the chain, transporting and testing and warehousing weapons, all day long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence.

They weren\u0027t harassment victims and witnesses. They were harassment victims because they were witnesses.

A million to one, minimum. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A billion to one,\" Poulton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLamarr stared at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think, for God\u0027s sake,\" she said. \"Surely he\u0027s not saying he saw the same racket that\u0027s killing our women.

Right, Reacher?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" he said. \"The restaurant thing set me thinking along those lines, is all, in general terms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence again. Blake colored red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are hundreds of rackets?\" he said. \"So how does that help us? Hundreds of rackets, hundreds of Army people involved, how are we going to find the right one? Needle in a damn haystack. It\u0027ll take three years. We\u0027ve got three weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about the paint?\" Poulton asked. \"If he\u0027s eliminating witnesses, he\u0027d walk up and shoot them in the head, silenced.22. He wouldn\u0027t mess with all this other stuff. All this ritual is classic serial homicide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" he said. \"Your perception of the motive is defined by the manner of the killings. Think about it. If they had all got a silenced.22 in the head, what would you have thought?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoulton said nothing. But there was doubt in his eyes. Blake sat forward and put his hands on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d have called them executions,\" he said. \"Wouldn\u0027t have altered our assessment of the motive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, be honest with me,\" Reacher said. \"I think you\u0027d have been a little more open-minded. You\u0027d have cast your net a little wider. Sure, you\u0027d have considered the harassment angle, but you\u0027d have considered other things too. More ordinary things. Bullets to the head, I think you\u0027d have considered more routine reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake sat there, hesitant and silent. Which was the same thing as a confession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullets to the head are kind of normal, right?\" Reacher said. \"In your line of work? So you\u0027d have looked at normal reasons too. Like eliminating witnesses to a crime. Bullets to the head, I think right now you\u0027d be all over the Army scams, looking for some efficient enforcer. But the guy deflected you by dressing it up with all this bizarre bullshit. He hid his true motive. He smoke-screened it. He camouflaged it. He pushed you into this weird psychological arena. He manipulated you, because he\u0027s very smart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake was still silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that you needed much manipulation,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is just speculation,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded. \"Of course it is. I told you, it\u0027s only half an idea. But that\u0027s what you do down here, right? You sit here all day long wearing the seat out of your pants, speculating about half-ideas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s bullshit,\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher nodded again. \"Yes, maybe it is. But maybe it isn\u0027t. Maybe it\u0027s some Army guy making big bucks out of some scam these women knew about. And he\u0027s hiding behind this harassment issue, by dressing it up like a psychodrama. He knew you\u0027d jump right on it. He knew he could make you look in the wrong place. Because he\u0027s very smart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your call,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia?\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence continued. Then Lamarr nodded, slowly. \"It\u0027s a viable scenario. Maybe more than viable. It\u0027s possible he could be exactly right. Possible enough that I think we should check it out, maximum effort, immediately. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we shouldn\u0027t waste any more time,\" Lamarr whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s wrong,\" Poulton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was riffing through paper, and his voice was loud and joyful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caroline Cooke makes him wrong,\" he said. \"She was in War Plans at NATO. High-level office work. She was never anywhere near weapons or warehouses or quartermasters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher said nothing. Then the silence was broken by the door. It opened up and Stavely hurried into the room, big and busy and intrusive. He was dressed in a white lab coat, and his wrists were smeared green where the paint had lapped up above his gloves. Lamarr stared at the marks and went whiter than his coat. She stared for a long moment and then closed her eyes and swayed like she was about to faint. She gripped the tabletop in front of her, thumbs underneath, pale fingers above, spread outward with the thin tendons standing out like quivering wires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go home now,\" she said, quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached down and gathered up her bag. Threaded the strap onto her shoulder and pushed back her chair and stood up. Walked slowly and unsteadily to the door, her eyes fixed on the remnants of her sister\u0027s last moments of life daubed across Stavely\u0027s stained wrists. Her head turned as she walked to keep them in view. Then she wrenched her gaze away and opened the door. Passed through it and let it close silently behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Blake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know how he kills them,\" Stavely said. \"Except there\u0027s a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What problem?\" Blake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s impossible.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/running-blind-jack-reacher-4/page-19.html","bookId":2342,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:26 AM"}
