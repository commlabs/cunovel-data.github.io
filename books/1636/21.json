Plasma bolts impacted, squirting through the holes, and igniting the vessels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another round,\" Voro commanded. \"Burn them to ashes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore plasma impacted and the doomed vessels spun toward the Halo structure, captured by its gravity.

The aft hatch was lowered, jammed open because a plasma shot had melted the hydraulics. Fred watched the jets chum the water behind them, happy to be above the water instead of under it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last two weeks Blue Team had been deployed on numerous zero-gee ops to repel the Covenant ships in orbit over the Earth. They had then been dispatched to Mount Erebus in the Antartic where they neutralized a Covenant excavation with a HAVOK tactical nuke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had then redeployed off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula for a swim. Covenant forces had been searching the seafloor for something. What precisely—a holy relic, a geological sample—no one knew, and it didn\u0027t matter. What mat-lered was when they got what they wanted, the Covenant then his-lorically glassed the planet to remove any human \"infestation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue Team had stopped both operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred looked over the ocean and wondered how long they could keep the Covenant at bay in space. His gaze dropped to the corrugated floor of the Pelican. It had lived up to its nickname \"blood tray\"… stained with splashes of congealed dark red. Good soldiers had died today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his heads-up display the TACMAP showed the edge of Cuba ahead. Fred exhaled and cleared his mind. They were close to their third target: the Centennial Orbital Elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been scattered reports that the Covenant had invaded the facility… before all contact with COE Control had been lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred stood and stretched. Linda and Will rose as well, sensing their brief downtime was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda opened one of the crates they had obtained from Base Segundo Terra near Mexico City. Within was a new SRS99C sniper rifle. She dissembled it, cleaned each part, applied graphite lubricant, and reassembled the gun with mechanical precision. She then examined the Oracle N-variant scope that had accompanied the rifle, and made microadjustments with a fine set of screwdrivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam tore into the box of ammunition and loaded magazines, sorting them by frag and AP types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred opened an \"egg carrier\" box and divided up fragmentation and concussion grenades into three satchels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found an ONI datapad and turned it on. It had new Covenant-English translation matrices and the latest ONI intrusion and counterintrusion software. Updates courtesy of Cor-tana. He tossed it into his bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the cockpit. Sergeant Laura \"Smokes\" Tanner flew, while her Crew Chief, Corporal Jim Higgins, fiddled with the COM, trying to filter though the reports of the action in space and on the ground. Tanner popped a black bubble and continued to chew the contraband tobacco gum so popular with NCO fliers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So then,\" Tanner said to Higgins, \"In Amber Clad goes after the damned Covenant battleship as it did an in-atmosphere Slipspace jump! Flattened New Mombassa. I don\u0027t know what those split-chinned freaks were after, but they sure didn\u0027t stick around after they found it—that\u0027s all I heard. CENTCOM channels are dropping off line. That can\u0027t be good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred looked to Linda and Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda made a short lateral cut with her hand, the \"stay cool\" gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey couldn\u0027t worry about the larger strategic picture. They had to stay focused on their part. Secure the orbital elevator, and win this war one battle at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred spied the Cuban coast ahead: surf and white sands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pelican screamed over jungle tangle. Fifty kilometers in the distance a line stretched from ground to clouds: the UNSC Centennial Orbital Elevator, or as the locals called it: Tallo Negro del Maiz, the \"stalk of black corn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was two hundred years old, antiquated but one of the few surviving OEs capable of heavy lifting on Earth. In the last two weeks, nuclear devices slated for conversion to peaceful purposes had been transported to Cuba. Recent actions had depleted the UNSC nuclear stockpile, and these older, low-yield bombs were all they had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Tanner continued, \"So then the Covenant fleet really starts to tear into the orbital defenses. It\u0027s getting ugly up there. Major skirmishes with the Second, Seventh, and Sixteenth Fleets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"… Just as long as the plasma doesn\u0027t start dropping,\" Hig-gins replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner stopped chewing her gum. \"Multiple silhouettes ahead. Banshee fliers. Whoa—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe craned her head, looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred moved to the cockpit and followed her gaze. Up the orbital elevator, past a whisper haze of clouds, a pair of dots— each a kilometer-and-a-half-long Covenant ship—orbited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are they doing up there?\" Tanner whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovenant orbital support complicated this mission. Ground forces might have aerial support, heavy armor, or artillery But Covenant didn\u0027t need the stalk to transport an invasion force. They\u0027d just land their ships or use grav beams. Why were they here? Blue Team would have to move in closer before he could discern their motives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred studied the radar images. \"There\u0027s a hole in the Banshee patrol pattern.\" He tapped the far edge of the screen. \"Put us down here. We\u0027ll go in by foot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your call,\" Tanner said dubiously. She pushed the throttle and the Pelican accelerated, dropping so it now decapitated palm trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make ready for hot drop, Spartans.\" She spun the Pelican around and sank into the jungle. \"Call if you need a lift. Blue Team. Good hunting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred, Linda, and Will grabbed their gear and jumped out the back, six meters to the sandy ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pelican roared away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred pointed northeast and they moved silently though the tropical brush, and entered the shadow of Tallo Negro del Maiz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half kilometer from the elevator complex, the jungle had been cleared and replaced by concrete, asphalt, and warehouses. Towering freight container cranes stood instead of coconut trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred heard the dull pounding steps of a Covenant Scarab attack platform. He spotted the lumbering behemoth as it crashed through a warehouse, tearing steel walls like tissue paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trouble,\" he muttered over TEAMCOM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Opportunity,\" Will countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda kept her comments to herself and methodically wrapped the barrel of her new sniper rifle with brown and green rags. She lay in the scrub, powered on her Oracle scope, and sighted down its length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"UNSC personnel down,\" she reported. \"Thermals cold. All dead. Making out six—no, a dozen Covenant moving in groups of four… carrying cargo pods. Not Elites. Brutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred paused, remembering the gorillalike creatures from their op on Unyielding Hierophant. A single Brute had wrestled John in his MJOLNIR armor… and almost won. Not as bad as facing Covenant Hunters, but Hunters only came two at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they going?\" Fred asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifted her sight. \"Elevator. They\u0027ve got an ascent car half full.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Switch to neutron detector,\" Fred suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda twisted a dial on the Oracle scope. \"Cargo pods are hot,\" she confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nukes?\" Will said. \"Covenant don\u0027t use nukes. They have an edict about using \u0027heretic\u0027 weapons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. Fred had seen Elites, their weapons depleted of charge, die rather than touch fully loaded UNSC assault rifles at their feet. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-21.html","bookId":1636,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM"}
