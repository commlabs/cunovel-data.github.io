It was a strategy that Xuang Fang had begun to unfold with the 2nd Heaven, and had then entrusted to Mythdragon to fully carry out. However, the price to pay was a steep one: the wrath of the entirety of the 33 Heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly if the plan resulted in a grand victory could it have potentially been accepted. But now... Xuan Fang would never see any such victory; he was moments away from perishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After I die… the true deluge will come!” Xuan Fang’s laughter rang out, filled with madness. Since he had already sacrificed the 2nd Heaven and the other land masses in a deadly attack, he didn’t object to sending everything else to crush the Mountain and Sea Realm at his hour of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the only way left that he could deal an unprecedentedly critical blow to the Mountain and Sea Realm, and thus, buy a chance for the 17th Heavens and beyond to gain victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This... is all that I can do,” he said. He waved his sleeve, sending the land masses down toward the Mountain and Sea Realm, surrounded by millions upon millions of Outsiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, Xuan Fang closed his eyes, whereupon a Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering power of detonation was unleashed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOOOMMMMMM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan Fang exploded. This was not a partial Paragon self-detonation like what had occurred with Mythdragon’s clone. This was a full and complete Paragon self-detonation. His cultivation base had not dropped, and although he had sustained injuries, he still had the full cultivation base of a Paragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was even able to add his own Essence into the explosion. The starry sky was set aflame, the Heavens shook, and the entire Mountain and Sea Realm vibrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power of the self-detonation did not just blast about wildly. Instead, Xuan Fang managed to direct the power of the blast into a propelling force which sent the Heavenly land masses down toward the Mountain and Sea Realm with indescribable speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the Mountain and Sea Realm had prepared to be battered by Heavenly land masses, this barrage was unlike anything that had happened before. This time, the land masses were being propelled by the force of Xuan Fang’s self-detonation, making them like deadly blades that stabbed down with incredible force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe war was now erupting with unprecedented intensity!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooms echoed out continuously. The starry sky trembled, and the lands quaked. Upon the land mass closest to the Mountain and Sea Realm, the seas evaporated and the mountains crumbled. The entire mass of land crumbled and then burst into pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Three Great Daoist Societies attacked in unison, drawing upon their most profound Daoist scriptures, unleashing their most shocking Daoist magics. The Immortal Ancient Daoist Rite spared no cost to summon numerous Dao projections to fight against the incoming land masses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sublime Flow Sword Grotto formed a majestic sword formation of 1,080,000 flying swords, which whistled up to meet the land masses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nine Seas God World had sustained the most casualties of all, and yet called upon equally terrifying resources. Countless Sea Dragons flew out, along with innumerable cultivators. Numerous God World gates appeared which, upon opening, unleashed one giant after another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giants then linked arms, forming a huge wall that braced for the impact of the land masses of the various Heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disciples of the three Doyens also put everything on the line, joining forces to unleash a shocking attack with their magical items!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParagon Sea Dream’s face was pale white, and blood was oozing out of her mouth. Ignoring any negative effect it would have on her already serious wounds, she flew out toward the land masses and began to attack them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Paragon puppet was now under Meng Hao’s control, and it also launched forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there were Meng Hao and Ksitigarbha. As of this moment, they were doing everything they could to block the incoming land masses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe land masses of the various Heavens were being blasted apart. And yet, the fragments and rubble continued to shoot down at incredible speed, piercing into the Mountain and Sea Realm. Wherever they passed, mass destruction was wreaked. Cultivators were smashed to death like ants beneath mighty hands of destruction. Miserable screams rang out constantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVast hosts of cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm joined forces, unleashing a sea of magical techniques that rose to meet the land masses. And yet... there was nothing they could do to stop the onslaught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOOOMMMMMM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA massive remnant of one of the land masses, despite being broken and in ruins, was still mighty enough to evaporate the Third Sea, and even slam into the Third Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mountain began to crumble!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sea was destroyed!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight arrows shot out from Meng Hao’s location, slamming into the various Heavenly land masses, bashing them to pieces. However, there was only so much he could do. Even with the added efforts of the Three Great Daoist Societies, Paragon Sea Dream, and everyone else, only about seventy percent of the land masses could be destroyed, which wasn’t enough to save that Mountain and Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, the Third Mountain was in a state of complete collapse. The Mountain and Sea Realm was in chaos. Countless cultivators couldn’t hold back from screaming in agony as they watched the Third Mountain crumble into rubble. Tears streamed down cheeks, especially among the cultivators who were originally from the Third Mountain and Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir home... was gone....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Xuanwu turtle atop the Third Mountain died an agonizing death. The Third Mountain vanished, and the sound of its destruction rang in the ears of the Mountain and Sea cultivators. More and more of them began to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext was the destruction of the Fourth Sea!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt transformed into nothing more than a mist. Then came the Fourth Mountain.... The Fourth Mountain and Sea represented reincarnation, and the underworld. But now, it was shattering into nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenceforth, there would be no sun or moon in the Mountain and Sea Realm. Nor would there be any reincarnation....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore people began to weep, and yet, those tears led to even more unswerving determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apocalyptic rubble of the various land masses incinerated the Fifth Sea before it finally came to a stop. Xuan Fang had resorted to self-detonation, ending his own life, and yet unleashing an unprecedented level of damage and destruction onto the Mountains and Seas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe number of cultivators who died was impossible to count....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the Mountain and Sea Realm had gone all out with its power to block the attack; had it not, then the destruction would not have stopped at the base of the Fifth Mountain!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mountain and Sea Realm would have sustained even more severe casualties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that the bombardment of the Heavenly land masses had ended, the army of Outsiders poured in. The war had reached a fever pitch with such rapidity that people had almost no time to consider how to react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCultivators and Outsiders alike were unable to process it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, the fighting did not stop. The millions upon millions of Outsiders were met by countless Mountain and Sea cultivators, whose tears flowed as they fought back against the onslaught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParagons attacked. Dao Realm experts attacked. Imperial Lords held back no divine abilities. As soon as the two sides met, blood flowed. Everything was stained with red, and the starry sky glowed with crimson light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flames of war raged in front of the Fifth Mountain. Blood flowed like seawater, and the din of slaughter rang out constantly. By this point, the Paragon-level fighters were limited in what they could do. After all, the Outsiders were many... but there were also Mountain and Sea cultivators on the battlefield, and it could be difficult to distinguish between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the Outsiders attacked with complete insanity, ensuring that the fighting was close and fierce. The battlefield soon turned into a vast sea of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was there on the battlefield, and wherever he went, death followed. His eyes were crimson as he glared at the surrounding Outsiders, and by this point, he had no need to unleash magical techniques to carry out slaughter. He transformed into a sea of blood that washed over them and absorbed their life force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSea Dream was there, as was the Paragon puppet. Both of them were using similar tactics as Meng Hao to unleash the power of Paragons to dispatch the Outsider Imperial Lords, which were now all dead. The Mountain and Sea cultivators fought with madness, and the Outsiders with complete viciousness. The slaughter being carried out was shocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen those on the front lines grew exhausted, there were others behind them to who were happy to continue the fight. The battle stretched on outside of the Fifth Mountain, and it was hard to say when it would end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe number of Outsiders was dropping at a horrific rate. With the Three Great Daoist Societies, the Doyen disciples, and the combined power of all the other Mountain and Sea cultivators, they ensured that, despite facing millions upon millions of Outsiders, their superior position made them like a grindstone that crushed all of the Outsiders who charged the Fifth Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire time, the 17th through 33rd Heavens looked on reticently. They did not interfere in any way, but simply watched, observing the tactics and methods of the Mountain and Sea Realm, committing them to memory and using augury in order to prepare ways to deal with and neutralize them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, the fighting ended. A vast sea of blood now existed outside the Fifth Mountain. The bedraggled remnants of the Outsider army began to fall back, and the Mountain and Sea Realm cultivators let them go, too exhausted to pursue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s vision was fading, and his cultivation base was drying up. He bit the tip of his tongue to regain some clarity, then looked down to find his clothing so soaked with blood that it was sticking to his body. It felt disgusting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up into the starry sky for a moment before sitting down cross-legged and closing his eyes to focus on healing. When he did that, the sound of the weeping of the Mountain and Sea cultivators drifted into his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wept for their homes. They wept for their friends and family who had fallen in battle. They wept because of the grief which filled their hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitterness washed over Meng Hao as he realized that the war wasn’t over. And yet, despite all odds, the Mountain and Sea Realm... had eked out another victory!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had survived against the 1st Heaven’s onslaught, resisted the 2nd through 6th Heavens, and blocked the 7th through 16th Heavens. The price they had paid was immense. Four entire Mountains and Seas had been destroyed, and countless cultivators had died. The sun and moon had been lost. And yet... they had still come out victorious!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite all that, little joy could be found in the hearts of the fighters. Everyone was exhausted. Xu Qing, many members of the Fang Clan, and other faces familiar to Meng Hao had all participated in the battle. Now that the fighting had stopped for the moment, everyone was lost in their own thoughts and feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they looked up into the starry sky, it was with mixed emotions. Everyone knew that the war wasn’t even half over. Soon, they would face... the 17th through 33rd Heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be... the final battle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final battle for the Mountain and Sea Realm! The enemy would be prepared to counter the techniques they had used in the fighting thus far. Furthermore... even more powerful Paragons would be coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne side would be wiped out, or the other would!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy means of Xu Qing, Paragon Sea Dream sent orders out into the various Mountains and Seas regarding how to rest and reorganize. The sea of blood outside the Fifth Mountain was filled with restrictive spells, as was the Fifth Mountain. The Mountain and Sea Realm sprang into action. Most cultivators buried their tears and focused on carrying out the tasks assigned to the various sects and clans by Paragon Sea Dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fang Clan was completely mobilized, as were all of the Mountain and Sea Lords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that Meng Hao received a request from Paragon Sea Dream....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The 33 Hells... should be opened. Meng Hao... I will pick 33 Chosen from the Mountain and Sea Realm to go with you into the 33 Hells and acquire the legacies therein!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You must become stronger! Furthermore, the 33 Chosen I select must search within the 33 Hells for their own personal... Dao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is there that Paragon Nine Seals... left incredible good fortune behind for the later generation of the Mountain and Sea Realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and the Chosen will have ten months. After ten months pass, the 17th through 33rd Heavens will descend, and the final battle for the Mountain and Sea Realm will begin....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1372\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1374\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1373","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
