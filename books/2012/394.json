He could have delivered such slaughter as to break every kingdom, every empire in his path .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he barely used them at all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKellanved – is it possible? Did even you quail at the carnage these creatures promised? Did you see for yourself how victory could destroy you, destroy the entire Malazan Empire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods below, I think you did .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou took command of the T’lan Imass – to keep them off the field of battle, to keep them out of human wars .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I see why .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still held his heavy sword, but had no strength left to even so much as lift it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battle lust was fading – something was assaulting it, tearing it down, away from his eyes, and all at once the redness of his vision fragmented, vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he heard Kalyth’s voice. ‘ Gesler. There is another Kolansii army on the high inland road. They are fast-marching – we must guard our flank .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Guard our flank? With what?’ He angled his mount round, lurched as it staggered. ‘Ah, shit, my Ve’Gath’s finished.’ He pulled his boots from the scale stirrups, slid down from the beast’s slathered back. Landing, his knees buckled and he fell to one side. Fighting to regain his breath, he stared up at the strange – and strangely crowded – sky. ‘All right. Listen, Kalyth. Draw the K’ell back and send them over there, all of them. Tell Sag’Churok – I’m sending him the T’lan Imass.’ He forced himself to his feet. ‘Did you hear all that?’ He flinched as his Ve’Gath fell over, legs flailing, half its guts hanging out in thick ropes. He saw the life empty from its eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Yes. Gu’Rull says you must hurry. There is little time .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That damned rhizan’s finally come back, has it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Gu’Rull says there is a storm coming, Gesler. He says you called it .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Like Hood I have!’ He looked around, but Stormy was nowhere to be seen. A storm? What’s she going on about? Whatever it is, it’s probably that red-bearded bastard’s fault .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCursing, the Mortal Sword set off to find Onos T’oolan. His forearms, he saw with faint alarm, were sweating beads of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnos T’oolan cut diagonally in a downward chop, through the torso of the Kolansii opposite him, dragging his blade free as he stepped over the crumpling body. An axe head slammed into his ribs on his left side, bounced off, and he turned and slashed through his attacker’s neck, watched the head roll off the shoulders. Two more strides and he was atop the fourth berm, his warriors coming up alongside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking down into the trench, he stared at a mass of upturned faces – all twisted with inhuman hatred – and weapons lifted as he prepared to descend into the press.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘First Sword!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnos T’oolan paused, stepped back and turned round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Malazan named Gesler was stumbling towards him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gesler,’ said Onos T’oolan, ‘there are but two more tiers left – and the number of enemy in those positions is sorely diminished. We shall prevail. Draw your Ve’Gath into our wake—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘First Sword – we are about to be flanked to the west. I have sent what remains of my K’ell Hunters there, but they are not enough.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnos T’oolan lowered his sword. ‘I understand.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We will push on here without you,’ Gesler said. ‘You’ve split the defences in two, and when all is said and done, the Ve’Gath can out-climb and out-run humans – we will fight to the foot of the stairs. We will assault the Spire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Akhrast Korvalain is wounded now, Mortal Sword. Tellann is awake – Olar Ethil is near. It seems that this shall be a day of ancient powers. Malazan, beware the voice of the Pure who awaits you atop the Spire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man revealed red-stained teeth. ‘Once I get up there, she won’t have time to get a single damned word out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I wish you success, Mortal Sword. Tell the K’Chain Che’Malle, we are honoured to have fought at their side this day.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnos T’oolan reached out to his followers, and as one they fell to dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Reverence could hear the grinding ascent of the ice against the Spire off to her left, while before her she saw the K’Chain Che’Malle carve their way ever closer to the base of the stairs. The T’lan Imass had vanished, but she knew where they were going – and High Watered Festian will have to face them. He will have to find a way to encircle them, to win past and strike the K’Chain Che’Malle . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-394.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
