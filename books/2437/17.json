He let no one in to witness his sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had thought he would be cold, but strangely was not. He had thought the darkness and the shadows would bother him, but the night had felt like an old friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the dawn spreading in the east, he sought out Bodrogk and his lady. They had found a sheltered place to light a fire, and now reclined in each other\u0027s arms, watching the sun rise. Their faces greeted him with something of sadness, but also with a great resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It doesn\u0027t have to be,\u0027 he said. The choice is yours.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Our world is two thousand years in the past,\u0027 Bodrogk answered. \u0027Since then... we\u0027ve prayed for peace a thousand times. You have the power, Necroscope.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry nodded, uttered his esoteric farewell and watched their dust mingle as a breeze came up to blow them away...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now he was ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to the ruins and set Faethor free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? that father of vampires raged. And am I your last resort, Harry Keogh? Do you enlist my aid now, when all else has failed you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nothing has failed,\u0027 Harry told him. And then, even by his standards, he did a strange thing. He deliberately lied to a dead man. \u0027Janos is crippled, dying,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaethor\u0027s fury knew no bounds. Without me? You brought him down without me? He doesn\u0027t know I had a hand in it? I want to feel the dog\u0027s pain! He crashed out of Harry\u0027s mind and discovered Janos - dead!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstonished, Faethor knew the truth, but of course Harry had known it before him. He triggered Wellesley\u0027s talent to shut Faethor out. \u0027I told you I\u0027d be rid of you,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFool! Faethor raged. I\u0027ll be back in, never fear. Only relax your guard by the smallest fraction, and we\u0027ll be one again, Necroscope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We had a bargain,\u0027 Harry was reasonable. \u0027I\u0027ve played my part. Go back to your place in Ploiesti, Faethor.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to the cold earth, after I\u0027ve known your warmth? Never! Don\u0027t you know what has happened? Janos made no great error when he read the future. He knew that a master vampire - the greatest of them all - would go down from this place when all was done. I am that vampire, Harry, in your body!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Men shouldn\u0027t read the future,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027for it\u0027s a devious thing. And now I have to be on my way.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere you go, I go!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry shrugged and opened a M\u0026amp;ouml;bius door. \u0027Remember Dragosani?\u0027 he said. And he stepped through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaethor shuddered but went in with him. Dragosani was a fool, he blustered. You don\u0027t shake me off so lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s still time,\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027I can still take you to Ploiesti.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo hell with Ploiesti!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry opened a past-time door and launched himself through it, and Faethor clung to him like the grim death he was. You won\u0027t shake me loose, Necroscope!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey gazed on the past of all Mankind, their myriad neon life-threads dwindling away to a bright blue origin. And now Faethor moaned: Where are you taking me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027To see what has been,\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027See, see there? That red thread among the blue? Indeed, a scarlet thread... yours, Faethor. And do you see where it stops? That\u0027s where Ladislau Giresci took your head the night your house was bombed. That\u0027s where your life-thread stopped, and you\u0027d have been wise to stop with it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake... take me out of here! Faethor gasped and gurgled, and clung like an incorporeal leech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry returned to the M\u0026amp;ouml;bius Continuum and chose a future-time door, where now the billions of blue life-threads wove out and away forever, speeding into a dazzling, ever-expanding future. He drifted out among them, and was quickly drawn along the timestream. And: \u0027This thread you see unwinding out of me,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s my future.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd mine, said Faethor doggedly, steadier now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But see, it\u0027s tinged with red,\u0027 Harry ignored him. \u0027Do you see that, Faethor?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esee it, fool. The red is me, proof that I\u0027m part of you always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wrong,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027I can go back because my thread is unbroken. Because I have a past, I can reel myself in. But your past was finished back in Ploiesti. You have no thread, no lifeline, Faethor.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? the other\u0027s nightmare voice was a croak. Then -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The master of the M\u0026amp;ouml;bius Continuum brought himself to an abrupt halt, but the spirit of Faethor Ferenczy shot on into the future. Harry! he cried out in his terror. Don\u0027t do this!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But it\u0027s done,\u0027 the Necroscope called after him. \u0027You have no flesh, no past, nothing, Faethor. Except the longest, loneliest, emptiest future any creature ever suffered. Goodbye!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eH-H-Harry!... Haaarry!... Haaaarrry!... HAAAAAAAAAA-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Harry closed the door and shut him off. Always. Except that before the door slammed shut he looked again at the blue thread unwinding out of himself. And saw that it was still tinged red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen should never try to read the future. For it\u0027s a devious thing ... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iv-deadspeak-necroscope-4/page-17.html","bookId":2437,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:48 PM"}
