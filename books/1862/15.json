Visionsof kittens impaled by tiny stakes in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t Tiggy on the front porch. It was Ash. He was lying flat in the purple twilight, little moths\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efluttering around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette felt a violent wrench in her chest.For a moment everything seemed suspended-and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echanged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Ash were dead-if Ash had been killed ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings would never be all right. She would neverbe all right. It would be like the night with the moonand\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estars gone. Nothing that anybody could do wouldmake up for it. Mary-Lynnette didn\u0027t know why-itdidn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emake any sense-but she suddenly knew it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t breathe and her arms and legs felt strange. Floaty. Out of her control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Ash moved. He lifted his head and pushed up with his arms and looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette could breathe again, but she still felt dizzy. \"Are you hurt?\" she asked stupidly. She didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edare touch him. In her present state one blast of electricity could fry her circuits forever. She\u0027d meltlike\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe Wicked Witch of the West.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fell in thishole, \"he said. \"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s right, Mary-Lynnette thought; the footsteps hadended with more of a crash than a thud. Not like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe footsteps of last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that meant something ...if only she couldfollow the thought to the end... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Having problems, Ash?\"Kestrel\u0027s voice saidsweetly, and then Kestrel herself appeared out of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe shadows, looking like an angel with her golden hair and her lovely clean features. Jade was behind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher, holding Tiggy in her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was up in a tree,\" Jade said, kissing the kitten\u0027s head. \"I had to talk him down.\" Her eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere emerald in the porch light, and she seemed to float rather than walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh was getting up, shaking himself. Like his sisters, he looked uncannily beautiful after a feeding,with a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esort of weird moonlight glow in his eyes. Mary-Lynnette\u0027s thought was long gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on in,\" she said resignedly. \"And help figure out who killed your aunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that Ash was indisputably all right,she wanted to forget what she\u0027d been feeling a minuteago. Or at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleast not to think about what it meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat it means, the little voice inside her head said sweetly, is that you\u0027re in big trouble, girl. Ha ha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s the story?\" Kestrel said briskly as they all sat around the kitchen table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The story is that there is no story,\"MaryLynnette said. She stared at her paper in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look-what if we start at the beginning? We don\u0027t know who did it, but we do know some things about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan nodded encouragingly. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First: the goat. Whoever killed the goat had to bestrong, because poking those toothpicks\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough hidewouldn\u0027t have been easy. And whoever killed the goat had to know how your uncle Hodge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas killed, because the goat was killed in the same way. And they had to have some reason for putting a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblack irisin the goat\u0027s mouth-either because they knew Ashbelonged to the Black Iris Club, or because\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey be longed to the Black Iris Club themself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or because they thought a black iris would represent all lamia, or all Night People,\" Ash said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHisvoice was muffled-he was bent over, rubbing hisankle. \"That\u0027s a common mistake Outsiders make.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery good, Mary-Lynnette thought in spite of herself. She said, \"Okay. And they had access to two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edifferent kinds of small stakes-which isn\u0027t sayingmuch, because you can buy both kinds in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they must have had some reason to hate Mrs. B., or to hate vampires,\" Mark said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Otherwise, why kill her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette gave him a patient look. \"I hadn\u0027t gotten to Mrs. B. yet. But we can do her now. First,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhoever killed Mrs. B. obviously knew she was a vampire, because they staked her. And, second ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eum...second . . .\" Her voice trailed off. She couldn\u0027t think of anything to go second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-240 \"Second, they probably killed her on impulse,\" Ash said, in a surprisingly calm and analytical\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evoice.\"You said she was stabbed with a picket from the fence, and if they\u0027d been planning on doing it,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey\u0027d probably have brought their own stake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Verygood.\" This time Mary-Lynnette said it out loud. She couldn\u0027t help it. She met Ash\u0027s eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand saw something that startled her. He looked as if itmattered to him that she thought he was smart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she thought. Well, well. Here we are, probably for the first time, justtalking to each other. Not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earguing, not being sarcastic, just talking. It\u0027s nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was surprisingly nice. And the strange thing was, she knew Ash thought so, too. They understood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeach other. Over the table, Ash gave her a barely perceptible nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey kept talking. Mary-Lynnette lost track of timeas they sat and argued and brainstormed. Finally she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked up at the clock and realized with a shock that it was near midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do wehave to keep thinking?\" Mark said pathetically. \"I\u0027m tired.\" He was almost lying on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etable. So was Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know how you feel, Mary-Lynnette thought. Mybrain is stalled. I feel ... extremely stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow, I don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to solve the murder tonight,\" Kestrel said. Her eyes were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclosed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right. The problem was that MaryLynnette didn\u0027t feel like going to bed, either. Shedidn\u0027t want\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto lie down and relax-there was a rest lessness inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want ... what do I want? she thought. I want ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there weren\u0027t a psychopathic goat killer lurkingaround here, I\u0027d go out and look at the stars,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh said, as if it were the most natural thing inthe world, \"I\u0027ll go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel and Jade looked at their brother in disbelief. Rowan bent her head, not quite hiding a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette said, \"Um ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Ash said. \"I don\u0027t think the goat killeris lurking out there everyminutelooking for people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto skewer. And if anything does happen, I can handle it.\" He stopped, looked guilty, then bland. \"I mean\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe can handle it, because there\u0027ll be two of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose but no cigar, buddy, Mary-Lynnette thought. Still, there was a certain basic truth to what he was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaying. He was strong and fast, and she had the feeling he knew how to fight dirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if she\u0027d never seen him do it, she thoughtsuddenly. All those times she\u0027d gone after him, shining light\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein his eyes, kicking him in the shins-and he\u0027d never once tried to retaliate. She didn\u0027t think it had even\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoccurred to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him and said, \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" Mark said. \"Look ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be fine,\" Mary-Lynnette told him. \"We won\u0027t go far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette drove. She didn\u0027t know exactly where she was going, only that she didn\u0027t want to go to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher hill. Too many weird memories. Despite what she\u0027d told Mark, she found herself taking the car\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efarther and farther. Out to where Hazel Green Creek and Beavercreek almost came together and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eland between them was a good imitation of a rain forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this the best place to look at - stars?\" Ash saiddoubtfully when they got out of the station\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-if you\u0027re looking straight up,\" MaryLynnette said. She faced eastward and tilted her head\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efar back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See the brightest star up there? That\u0027s Vega, the queen star of summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. She\u0027s been higher in the sky every nightthis summer,\" Ash said without emphasis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette glanced at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"When you\u0027re out so much at night,you get to recognize the stars,\" he said. \"Even if you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t know their names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette looked back up at Vega. She swallowed. \"Can you--can you see something small and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebright below her-something ring-shaped?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing that looks like a ghost doughnut?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette smiled, but only with her lips.\"That\u0027s the Ring Nebula. I can see that with my telescope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel him looking at her, and she heardhim take a breath as if he were going to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then he let the breath out again and looked back up at the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the perfect moment for him to mention something about how Vampires See It Better. And if he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad, Mary-Lynnette would have turned on him and rejected him with righteous anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut since hedidn\u0027t,she felt a different kind of anger welling up. A spring of contrariness, as if shewere the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary in the nursery rhyme. What, so you\u0027ve decided I\u0027m not good enough to be a vampire or something?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what did I really bring you out here for, to the most isolated place I could find? Only for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estarwatching? I don\u0027tthink so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t even know who I am anymore, she remembered with a sort of fatalistic gloom. I have the feeling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m about to surprise myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you getting a crick in your neck?\" Ashsaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette rolled her head from side to side slightly to limber the muscles. \"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could rub it for you?\" He made the offer from several feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette snorted and gave him a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon, a waning crescent, was rising above thecedars to the east. Mary-Lynnette said, \"You want to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etake a walk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked and Mary-Lynnette thought. About how it would be to see the Ring Nebula with herown\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes, or the Veil Nebula without a filter. She could feel a longing for them so strong it was like a cable\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eattached to her chest, pulling her upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course,that was nothing new. She\u0027d felt it lots of times before, and usually she\u0027d ended up buying\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanother book on astronomy, another lens for her telescope. Anything to bring her closer to what she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now I have a whole new temptation. Something bigger and scarier than I ever imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if I could be-more than I am now? Thesame . person, but with sharper senses? A Mary-Lynnette\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho couldreally belong to the night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d already discovered she wasn\u0027t exactly whoshe\u0027d always thought. She was more violent-she\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekicked Ash, hadn\u0027t she? Repeatedly. And she\u0027d admired the purity of Kestrel\u0027s fierceness. She\u0027d seenthe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elogic in the kill-or-be-killed philosophy. She\u0027d dreamed about the joy of hunting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else did it take to be a Night Person?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something I\u0027ve been wanting to say toyou,\" Ash said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hm.\"Do I want to encourage him or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what Ash said was \"Can we stop fightingnow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette thought and then said seriously, \"Idon\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey kept walking. The cedars towered around them like pillars in a giant ruined temple. A dark temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd underneath, the stillness was so enormous that Mary-Lynnette felt as if she were walkingon the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bent and picked a ghostly wildflower that wasgrowing out of the moss. Death camas. Ash bent and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epicked up a broken-off yew branch lying at the footof a twisted tree. They didn\u0027t look at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked, with a few feet of space between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, somebody told me this would happen,\" Ash said, as if carrying on some entirely\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edifferent conversation they\u0027d been having.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you\u0027d come to a hick town and chase agoat killer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That someday I\u0027d care for someone - and itwould hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette kept onwalking. She didn\u0027t slow or speed up. It was only her heart that was suddenly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeating hard-in a mixture of dismay and exhilara tion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God-whatever was going to happen washappening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not like anybody I\u0027ve ever met,\" Ash said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that feeling is mutual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh stripped some of the papery purple bark offhis yew stick. \"And, you see, it\u0027s difficult becausewhat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve always thought about humans-what I wasalways raised to think ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you\u0027ve always thought,\" MaryLynnette said sharply. Thinking,vermin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" Ash continued doggedly, \"the thing is andI know this is going to sound strange-that I seem\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto love you sort of desperately.\" He pulled more bark off his stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette didn\u0027t look at him. She couldn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve done everything I could to get rid of the feeling, but it just won\u0027t go. At first I thought if I left\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriar Creek, I\u0027d forget it. But now I know that wasinsane. Wherever I go, it\u0027s going with me.

So I have to think of something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette suddenly felt extremely contrary. \"Sorry,\" she said coldly. \"But I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not very\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflattering to have somebody tell you that they love you against their will, against their reason, and even-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Against their character,\" Ash finished for her, bleakly. \"Yeah, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette stopped walking. She stared at him.\"You havenot readPrideand Prejudice, \" she said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Jane Austen was a human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her inscrutably and said, \"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood point.Scary point. How could she really knowwho in human history had been human? Whatabout\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalileo? Newton?

He followed.\"So now can I tell you how, um, ardently I loveand\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadmire you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother quote. \"I thought your sisters said youpartiedall the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh understood. \"I do,\" he said defensively. \"Butthe morning after partying you have to stay in bed. And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eif you\u0027re in bed you might as well read something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After all, weare soulmates,\" Ash said. \"I can\u0027t becompletely stupid or I\u0027d be completely wrong\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette thought about that. And about thefact that Ash sounded almost-humble. Which he had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecertainly never sounded before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Ash ...I don\u0027t know.

I think we could be sort offairly compatible if . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If?\" Mary-Lynnette said as the silence dragged on.\"Well, if you could bring yourself to kiss me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kissyou?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know it\u0027s a radical concept. I was pretty sure you wouldn\u0027t go for it.\" He whacked at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanother tree. \"Of course humanshave been doing it for thousands of years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching him sideways, Mary-Lynnette said, \"Would you kiss a three-hundred-pound gorilla?\" He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblinked twice. \"Oh, thank you.\"\"I didn\u0027t mean you looked like one.\"\"Don\u0027t tell me, let me guess.

It looks to me as ifI\u0027d have to become a vampire just to deal with youon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ean equal level.\" Ash said, \"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHewasofferingher theyew branch.Mary Lynnette stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to give me your stick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a stick, it\u0027s the way to deal withme onan equal level.\" He put one end of the branch\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagainstthe base of his throat, and Mary-Lynnette saw that it was sharp.She reached out to take the other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eend and found the stick was surprisingly hard and heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh was looking straight at her. It was too dark to see what color his eyes were, but his expression was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunexpectedly sober.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One good push would do it,\" he said. \"First here and then in the heart. You could eliminate the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eproblem of me from your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette pushed, but gently. He took a step back. And another. She backed him up against a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etree, holding the stick to his neck like a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I actually meant only if you were really serious,\"Ash said as he came up short against the cedar\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebare trunk. But he didn\u0027t make a move to defend himself.\"And the truth is that you don\u0027t even need a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espear like that. A pencil in the right place would do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette narrowed her eyes at him, swirlingthe yew stick over his body like a fencer getting the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she removed it. She dropped it to the ground. \"You really have changed,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh said simply, \"I\u0027ve changed so much in the lastfew days that I don\u0027t even recognize myself in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emirror.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you didn\u0027t kill your aunt.\"\"You\u0027re just now figuring that out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I always wondered just a bit. All right, I\u0027ll kiss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a little awkward, lining up to get the position right. Mary-Lynnette had never kissed a boy before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut once she started she found it was simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd... now she saw what the electric feeling ofbeing soulmates was for. All the sensations she\u0027d felt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen touching his hand, only intensified. And not unpleasant. It was only unpleasant if you were afraidof\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, Ash pulled away. \"There. Yousee,\"he said shakily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette took a few deep breaths. \"I supposethat\u0027s what it feels like to fall into a black hole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean-it was interesting.\" Singular, shethought. Different from anything she\u0027d ever felt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebefore. And she had the feeling thatshe would be different from now on, that she could never go back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eandbe the same person she had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo who am I now? Somebody fierce, I think.Somebody who\u0027d enjoy running through the dark ness,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderneath stars bright as miniature suns, and maybe even hunt deer. Somebody who can laugh atdeath\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe way the sisters do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll discover a supernova and I\u0027ll hiss when somebody threatens me. I\u0027ll be beautiful and scary and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edangerous and of course I\u0027ll kiss Ash a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was giddy, almost soaring with exhilaration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve always loved the night, she thought. And I\u0027ll finally belong to it completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary-Lynnette?\" Ash said hesitantly. \"Did you likeit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked and looked at him. Focused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to turn me into a vampire,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t feel like a jellyfish sting this time. It wasquick and almost pleasant like pressure being released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Ash\u0027s lips were on her neck, and that wasdefinitely pleasant. Warmth radiated from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette found herself stroking the back of his neck and realized that his hair was soft,as nice to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etouch as cat\u0027s fur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his mind...was every color of the spectrum. Crimson and gold, jade and emerald and deep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evioletblue. A tangled thorn-forest of iridescent colors that changed from second to second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette wasdazzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd half frightened. There was darkness in among those gemlike colors. Things Ash had done in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epast ... things she could sense he was ashamed of now. But shame didn\u0027t change the acts themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it doesn\u0027t-but I\u0027ll make up for them, somehow.You\u0027ll see; I\u0027ll find away....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0027s telepathy, Mary-Lynnette thought. She couldfeel Ash as he said the words, feel that hemeant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem with desperate earnestness-and feel that there was a lot to make up for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t care. I\u0027m going to be a creature of darkness,too. I\u0027ll do what\u0027s in my nature, with no regrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ash started to lift his head, she tightened her grip, trying to keep him there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t tempt me,\" Ash said out loud, hisvoice husky, his breath warm on her neck. \"If I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etake too much, it will make you seriously weak.I mean it, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let him go. He picked up the yew stick and made a small cut at the base of his throat, tilting his head\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback like a guy shaving his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette realized he\u0027d never done this before. With a feeling that was. almost awe, she put her lips\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m drinking blood. I\u0027m a hunter already--sort of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I\u0027m drinking blood and liking it-maybe because it doesn\u0027ttastelike blood Not like copper and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efear. It tastes weird and magic and old as the stars. When Ash gently detached her, she swayed on her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d better go home,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? I\u0027m okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to get dizzier-and weaker. And ifwe\u0027re going to finish changingyou into a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"if\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,when. But before we do, we need to talk. I need to explain it all to you; we have to figure out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe details. Andyouneed to rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette knew he was right. She wanted to stay here, alone with Ash in the dark cathedral of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforest-but shedidfeel weak. Languid. Apparently it was hard work becoming a creature of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed back the way they had come. Mary-Lynnette could feel the change inside herself-it was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estronger than when she\u0027d exchanged blood with the three girls. She felt simultaneously weak and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehypersensitive. As if every pore were open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moonlight seemed much brighter. She couldsee colors dearly-the pale green of drooping cedar\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboughs, the eerie purple of parrot-beak wildflowersgrowing out of the moss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the forest wasn\u0027t silent anymore. She could hear faint uncanny sounds like the soft seething of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneedles in the wind, and her own footsteps on moist and fungus-ridden twigs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can even smell better, she thought. This place smells like incense cedar, and decomposing plants,and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething really wild-feral, like something from the zoo. And something hot ...burny ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMechanical. It stung her nostrils. She stopped and looked at Ash in alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatisthat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0He\u0027d stopped, too. \"Smells like rubber and oil....\" \"Oh, God, thecar, \" Mary-Lynnette said. They\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked at each other for a moment, then simultane ously turned, breaking into a run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the car. White smoke billowed from under the closed hood. Mary-Lynnette started to go closer,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut Ash pulled her back to the side of the road.\"I just want to open the hood-\" \"No. Look. There.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette looked-and gasped. Tiny tongues of flame were darting underneath the smoke. licking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout of the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claudine always said this would happen,\" shesaid grimly as Ash pulled her back farther, \"Only I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink she meant it would happen with me in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to have to walk home,\" Ash said.\"Unless maybe somebody sees the fire....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a chance,\" Mary-Lynnette said. And that\u0027swhat you get for taking a boy out to the most\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eisolated place in Oregon, her inner voice said triumphantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose you could turn into a bat or something and fly back,\" she suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, I flunked shapeshifting.
