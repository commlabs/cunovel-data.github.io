{"id":806,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 2 Disaster for Gabriel Oak","content":"Young Farmer Oak was in love. He waited for the girl\u0027s regular visits to the sick cow just as impatiently as his dog waited to be fed. He discovered that her name was Bathsheba Everdene，and that she lived with her aunt，Mrs Hurst. His head was so full of her that he could think of nothing else.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I\u0027ll make her my wife，’he declared to himself，‘or I\u0027ll never be able to concentrate on work again！’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When she stopped coming to feed the sick cow，he had to find a reason for visiting her. So he took a young lamb，whose mother had died，and carried it in a basket across the fields to Mrs Hurst\u0027s house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I\u0027ve brought a lamb for Miss Everdene，’he told Bathshe－ba\u0027s aunt. ‘Girls usually like looking after lambs. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Thank you，Mr Oak，’replied Mrs Hurst，‘but Bathsheba is only a visitor here. I don\u0027t know if she\u0027ll keep it. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘To tell you the truth，Mrs Hurst，the lamb isn\u0027t my real reason for coming. I want to ask Miss Everdene if she\u0027d like to be married. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Really？’asked Mrs Hurst，looking closely at him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Yes Because if she would，I\u0027d like to marry her. Do you know if she has any other young men courting her at the moment？’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Oh yes，a lot of young men，’said Mrs Hurst. ‘You see，Farmer Oak，she\u0027s so handsome，and so well-educated too. Of course,I haven\u0027t actually seen any of her young men，but she must have at least ten or twelve！’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘That\u0027s unfortunate，’said Farmer Oak，staring sadly at the floor. ‘I\u0027m just a very ordinary man，and my only chance was being the first to ask to marry her. Well，that was all I came for. I\u0027d better go home now， Mrs Hurst. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had gone halfway across the first field when he heard a cry behind him. He turned，and saw a girl running after him. It was Bathsheba. Gabriel blushed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Farmer Oak，’she called breathlessly，‘I want to say——my aunt made a mistake when she told you I had a lot of young men courting me. In fact，I haven\u0027t got any，and I\u0027ve never had any. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I am glad to hear that！’said Gabriel，with a wide smile，holding out his hand to take hers. But she pulled her hand away quickly. ‘I have a nice comfortable little farm，’he added，a little less confidently. ‘And when we are married，I\u0027m sure I can work twice as hard as I do now，and earn more. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stretched out his arm towards her. Bathsheba moved rapidly behind a tree to avoid him. ‘But，Farmer Oak，’she said in surprise，‘I never said I was going to marry you. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Well！’said Gabriel，disappointed. ‘To run after me like this， and then say you don\u0027t want me！’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I only wanted to explain that my aunt was wrong，’she answered eagerly. ‘Anyway，I had to run to catch up with you，so I didn\u0027t have time to decide whetherl wanted to marry or not. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Just think for a minute or two，’replied Gabriel hopefully. ‘I\u0027ll wait a while， Miss Everdene. Will you marry me？ Do，Bathsheba. I love you very much！’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I\u0027ll try to think，’she answered. ‘Give me time，’and she looked away from him at the distant hills.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I can make you happy，’he said to the back of her head ‘You shall have a piano，and I\u0027ll practise the flute to play with you in the evenings. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Yes，I\u0027d like that. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘And at home by the fire，whenever you look up，there I\u0027ll be，and whenever I look up， there you\u0027ll be. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Wait，let me think！’She was silent for a while，and then turned to him. ‘No，’she said，‘I don\u0027t want to marry you. It\u0027d be nice to have a wedding，but having a husband——well，he\u0027d always be there. As you say，whenever I looked up，there he\u0027d be. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Of course he would——it would be me. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘that\u0027s the problem. I wouldn\u0027t mind being a bride，if I could be one without having a husband. But as a woman can\u0027t be a bride alone，I won\u0027t marry，at least not yet. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘What a silly thing for a girl to say！’ cried Gabriel. And then he said softly，‘But darling，think again！’He moved round the tree to reach her. ‘Why won\u0027t you have me？’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Because I don\u0027t love you，’she replied， moving away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘But I love you——and I\u0027m happy to be liked，if that\u0027s all you feel for me. ’He spoke more seriously than he had ever spoken before. ‘Only one thing is certain in this life——I shall love you，and want you，and keep on wanting you until I die. ’His feelings were plain to see in his honest face，and his large brown hands were trembling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘It seems wrong not to accept you when you feel so strongly，’she replied unhappily. ‘I wish I hadn\u0027t run after you！But we wouldn\u0027t be happy together，Mr Oak. I\u0027m too independent. I need a husband who can keep me in order， and I\u0027m sure you wouldn\u0027t be able to do that. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gabriel looked hopelessly away and did not reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘And，Mr Oak，’she continued in a clear voice，‘I\u0027m so poor that my aunt has to provide a home for me. You\u0027re just starting your farming business. It would be much more sensi-ble for you to marry a woman with money. Then you could buy more sheep and improve your farm. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘That\u0027s just what I\u0027d been thinking！’ answered Gabriel in surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What common sense she had，he thought admiringly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Well then，why did you ask to marry me？’she said angrily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I can\u0027t do what I think would be——sensible. I must do what my heart tells me. ’He did not see the trap she had set for him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Now you\u0027ve confessed that marrying me wouldn\u0027t be sen－sible， Mr Oak. Do you think I\u0027ll marry you after that？’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Don\u0027t mistake my meaning like that，’he cried，‘just because I\u0027m honest enough to tell you the truth！I know you\u0027d be a good wife for me. You speak like a lady，everyone says so，and your uncle at Weatherbury has a large farm，I\u0027ve heard. May I visit you in the evenings，or will you come for a walk with me on Sundays？You don\u0027t have to decide at once. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘No，no，I cannot. Don\u0027t insist，don\u0027t. I don\u0027t love you，so it would be foolish, ’she said with a laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No man likes to see his feelings laughed at，so Gabriel Oak said，turning away，‘Very well，then I won\u0027t ask you again. ’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gabriel did not see Bathsheba again and two days later he heard that she had left the area， and was now in Weatherbury，a village twenty miles away. Her departure did not stop Gabriel from loving her. In fact he loved her even more deeply now that they were apart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next night，before going to bed，Gabriel called his two dogs to come into the house for the night. His old dog，George，obeyed the call，but the younger one was missing. Gabriel was having difficulty training this young dog，which，although enthusiastic，still did not understand a sheep dog\u0027s duties. He did not worry about the dog\u0027s absence，but went to bed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Very early in the morning he was woken by the sound of sheep bells，ringing violently. Shepherds know every sound that sheep bells make，and Gabriel immediately realized that his sheep were running fast. He jumped out of bed，threw on his clothes and ran up Norcombe Hill，to his fields near the chalk-pit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were his fifty sheep with their lambs，all safe，in one field. But in the other field，the two hundred pregnant sheep had completely disappeared. He noticed a broken gate，and felt sure the sheep had gone through it. There was no sign of them in the next field，but ahead of him at the top of the hill he saw the young dog，looking black against the morning sky. It was standing quite still，staring down into the chalk-pit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gabriel felt sick as he realized the horrible truth. He hurried up the hill to the edge of the chalk-pit，and looked down into it. In the deep pit lay his dead and dying sheep，two hundred of them，which would have produced two hundred more in the next few weeks. The young，untrained dog must have chased them up to the edge of the pit，where they fell to their death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His first feeling was pity for those gentle sheep and their unborn lambs. Then he thought of himself. All his savings，which he had worked so hard for in the last ten years，had been spent on renting the farm. Now his hopes of being an independent farmer were destroyed. He covered his face with his hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After a while he looked up. ‘Thank God I\u0027m not married to Bathsheba，’he thought. ‘What would she have done，mar－ried to a husband as poor as I shall be！’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The young dog was shot the next day. Gabriel sold all his farm tools to pay what he owed for the sheep. He was no longer a farmer，just an ordinary man who owned the clothes he was wearing and nothing more. Now he had to find work where he could，on other men\u0027s farms.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/1015/30539.html","bookId":29,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:36:27 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:36:27 AM"}
