Xo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my office, sitting at my desk pretending to work on a script, I\u0027m really watching Rain, who has just shown up, and she\u0027s tan and pacing the floor, holding a glass of ice with some tequila in it, chatting casually about how crazy her mother is and her younger stepbrother who\u0027s in the military and when she falls onto the lounge chair in the corner of the office it takes all the strength I have to get up and walk over to her and not say anything about Julian. She looks up at me and keeps talking, only lightly distracted, but when I don\u0027t answer a question she touches her knee against mine and then I reach for her arm and pull her off the chair and when she reminds me about the reservation at Dan Tana\u0027s I tell her, \"I want to f**k you first,\" and start pulling her toward the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" she says. \"I\u0027m hungry.

I just want to chill.\" She strokes my face and then kisses me lightly on the lips and then she pulls her arm away and walks out of the office. I follow her through the living room and into the kitchen, where she heads for the tequila bottle and does another shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was in San Diego?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was in San Diego?\" I ask again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother.
