Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No,\" I say, waving her off. \"Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look nice today,\" she says before leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s right, but I\u0027m not saying anything - just staring across the office at the George Stubbs painting that hangs on the wall, wondering if I should move it, thinking maybe it\u0027s too close to the Aiwa AM/FM stereo receiver and the dual cassette recorder and the semiautomatic belt-drive turntable, the graphic equalizer, the matching bookshelf speakers, all in twilight blue to match the color scheme of the office. The Stubbs painting should probably go over the life-size Doberman that\u0027s in the corner ($700 at Beauty and the Beast in Trump Tower) or maybe it would look better over the Pacrizinni antique table that sits next to the Doberman. I get up and move all these sporting magazines from the forties - they cost me thirty bucks apiece -\u0026nbsp; that I bought at Funchies, Bunkers, Gaks and Gleeks, and then I lift the Stubbs painting off the wall and balance it on the table then sit back at my desk and fiddle with the pencils I keep in a vintage German beer stein I got from Man-tiques. The Stubbs looks good in either place. A reproduction Black Forest umbrella stand ($675 at Hubert des Forges) sits in an other corner without, I\u0027m just noticing, any umbrellas in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a Paul Butterfield tape in the cassette player, sit back at the desk and flip through last week\u0027s Sports Illustrated, but can\u0027t concentrate. I keep thinking about that damn tanning bed Van Patten has and I\u0027m moved to pick up the phone and buzz jean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" she answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jean. Listen, keep your eyes open for a tanning bed, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asks - incredulously, I\u0027m sure, but she\u0027s still probably smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know. A tanning bed,\" I repeat casually. \"For a... tan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay..., \" she says hesitantly. \"Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, oh shit, yeah. Remind me to return the videotapes I rented last night back to the store.\" I start to open and close the sterling silver cigar holder that sits by the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything else?\" she asks, and then, flirtatiously, \"How about that Perrier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. That sounds good. And Jean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she says, and I\u0027m relieved by her patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m crazy?\" I ask. \"I mean for wanting a tanning bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a pause and then, \"Well, it is a little unusual,\" she admits, and I can tell she is choosing her words very carefully. \"But no, of course not. I mean how else are you going to keep up that devilishly handsome skin tone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good girl,\" I say before hanging up. I have a great secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe comes into the office five minutes later with the Perrier, a wedge of lime and the Ransom file, which she did not need to bring, and I am vaguely touched by her almost total devotion to me. I can\u0027t help but be flattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a table at Camols at twelve-thirty,\" she announces as she pours the Perrier into a glass tumbler. \"Nonsmoking section.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t wear that outfit again,\" I say, looking her over quickly. \"Thanks for the Ransom file.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um...\" She stalls, about to hand me the Perrier, and asks, \"What? I didn\u0027t hear you,\" before setting the drink on my desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said,\" and I repeat myself calmly, grinning, \"do not wear that outfit again. Wear a dress. A skirt or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stands there only a little stunned, and after she looks down at herself, she smiles like some kind of cretin. \"You don\u0027t like this, I take it,\" she says humbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" I say, sipping my Perrier. \"You\u0027re prettier than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thanks, Patrick,\" she says sarcastically, though I bet tomorrow she\u0027ll be wearing a dress. The phone on her desk rings. I tell her I\u0027m not here. She turns to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And high heels,\" I mention. \"I like high heels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head good-naturedly as she exits, shutting my door behind her. I take out a Panasonic pocket watch with a three-inch diagonal color TV and an AM/FM radio and try to find something to watch, hopefully Jeopardy!, before turning to my computer terminal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealth Club\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe health club I belong to, Xclusive, is private and located four blocks from my apartment on the Upper West Side. In the two years since I signed up as a member, it has been remodeled three times and though they carry the latest weight machines (Nautilus, Universal, Keiser) they have a vast array of free weights which I like to use also. The club has ten courts for tennis and racquetball, aerobics classes, four aerobic dance studios, two swimming pools, Lifecycles, a Gravitron machine, rowing machines, treadmills, cross-country skiing machines, one-on-one training, cardiovascular evaluations, personalized programs, massage, sauna and steam rooms, a sun deck, tanning booths and a cafe with a juice bar, all of it designed by J. J. Vogel, who designed the new Norman Prager club, Petty\u0027s. Membership runs five thousand dollars annually. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-28.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
