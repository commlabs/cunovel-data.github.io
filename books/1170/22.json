{"id":37911,"no":22,"title":"Chapter XXII Gr?l’s Case","content":"On the following day, being alone all day, I walked out, shaking at first, but with a step growing rapidly assured. Not far from the cave I passed a clear pool, and saw my face amid the branches leaning over it. A pretty cavalier, I thought, to go a-wooing. A little further on I came to a secluded cabin, where a young woman bent over the wash-tub in the sunny doorway. I went up and saluted her courteously. The alarm died from her face, and compassion melted there instead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have been long wounded, in the woods,” I said. “Give me, I pray you, the charity of a cup of milk, and lend me your scissors and a glass.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At this the compassion ran away in laughter, and she cried merrily:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sit here on the stoop, monsieur, till I get them for you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Plainly,” thought I, “you have not husband or brother in the chapel at Grand Pré!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 157On her return she answered as it were straight to my thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My man’s in the woods!” she said, with pride. “And he’s all safe. They didn’t catch him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You may well thank God for that, madame!” said I gravely, drinking the milk with relish and setting myself assiduously to my toilet. My hair of course I could do little with,—I was no barber’s apprentice. The long, straight, lustreless black locks hung down over my collar, framing lugubriously a face to scare hunger from a feast. But there was enough of it to be persuaded into covering the patches and scars.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My beard, however, proved interesting. With infinite pains I trimmed it to a courtly point, and decided it would pass muster. It was not unlike my uncle’s—and the Sieur de Briart was ever, in my eyes, an example of all that was to be admired. The success of my efforts was attested by the woman’s growing respect. She now recognized me for a gentleman, and brought me a dish of curds, and bustled with civilities till I went.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I arrived back at the cave in such good fettle that I felt another day would see me ripe for any venture. But I was tired, and slept so soundly that I knew not when my host came in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the morning he was there, getting ready a savory breakfast. When I proposed my enterprise for the day, he said, very wisely:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 158“If you think you’re fit to-day, perhaps you may almost be so to-morrow. Wait. Don’t bungle a great matter by a little haste!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So I curbed my chafing eagerness, and waited. He rested at home all day, and we talked much. What was said, however, was for the most part not pertinent to this record. Only one short reach of the conversation lives in my memory—but that is etched with fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It came in this way. One question had led to another, till at last I asked:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why do you so hate La Garne?” and was abashed at my boldness in asking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sprang up and left the cave; and left me cursing my stupidity. It was an hour ere he came back, but he was calm, and seated himself as if nothing had happened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I had thought,” said he, in an even voice, “that if I were to speak of that the walls of this cave would cry out upon me for vengeance delayed. But I have considered, and a little I will tell you. You must know; for the hour will come when you will help me in my vengeance, and you might weaken, for you do not comprehend the mad sweetness of hate. You are born for a great happiness or a great sorrow, and either destiny may make one blunt to hate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I was a poor gentleman of Blois, part fop, part fantastical scholar, a dabbler in magic, and a lover 159of women. My nature pulled two ways. I was alone in the world, save for a little sister, beautiful, just come to womanhood, whom I loved as daughter and sister both. She thought me the wonderful among men. It chanced that at last I knew another love. A woman, the wife of a witless pantaloon of the neighbourhood, ensnared all my wits, till I saw life only in her eyes. Her husband came upon us in her garden—and for his reproaches I beat him cruelly. But he, though not a man, was not all fool. For loving his wife he could not punish me—I being stronger and more popular than he; but he knew that for theft the law would hang a man. He hid a treasure of jewels, and with a nice cunning fixed the crime upon me. It was clear as daylight, so that almost myself believed myself guilty. In a foul, reeking cell in the city wall I awaited judgment and the penalty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A confession makes the work of the judges easier, and as I would not confess I was to be tortured—when the Court was ready; all in good time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “At Blois was a young blade renowned no less for his conquests of women than for his ill-favoured face. His ugliness prevailed where the beauty of other men found virtue an impregnable wall against it. He courted my sister. She repulsed him. It got about and shamed him. Then (I this while in prison, and she helpless) he laid 160a public wager with his fellows that he would have her innocence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He told her I was to be tortured. After a time he told her he could save me from that extremity. This thought worked for a time upon her lonely anguish. Then he swore he would save me—but at a price.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “At last the price was paid. He won his wager. On the day that I was tortured she killed herself before the judges. He, astonished, fled to Italy, hid in a monastery, and dedicated himself to the missions of the New World.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The judges were, after all, men. They said the evidence against me was insufficient. They set me free, as an avenger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have not been in haste. The man has grown more evil year by year; so I have waited. I will not send him to his account till the score is full. The deepest hell must be ready, and gape for him. Meanwhile, his soul has dwelt all these years alone with fear. He is a brave man, but he knows I wait—he knows not for what; and he sweats and is afraid!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He told the story simply, quietly; but there was madness in his voice. The unspeakable thing choked me. I got up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is enough!” said I. “I will not fail you when you need me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But I went out into the air for a little.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1685/49634.html","bookId":1170,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 8:19:42 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 8:19:42 AM"}
