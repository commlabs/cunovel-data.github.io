All of the lands... were like they were before!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the ancient saying, when one man achieves the Dao, all those beneath him will also ascend. That was exactly what was happening with the Seal the Heavens Hex. From within death, life appeared!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds filled the first continent as everything was restored. As that happened, Planet Vast Expanse was shaken, as were all of the lands that filled the starry sky of Allheaven. All worlds, all realms, all the dust, everything was vibrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll cultivators, all species, all forms of life, everything that existed trembled in shock and astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJin Yunshan gasped, and Sha Jiudong was left shivering. Bai Wuchen’s eyes went wide with amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sect Leader’s jaw dropped, and all of the other 9-Essences cultivators were battered by waves of shock. Each of them felt compelled to drop to their knees and kowtow to the first continent. It was almost as if something were being born there... that surpassed the Vast Expanse itself!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first location where Meng Hao had acquired a copper mirror shard, the enormous basilisk lizard with the peak 9-Essences battle prowess was currently sleeping. Suddenly, it trembled and looked up, astonishment shining in its eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Ice-Fire Realm, the Icemountain Giant and the Flamephoenix could feel the fluctuations rolling out through the starry sky of Allheaven, and were suddenly struck with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flourishing Immortal God Continent was a certain sect that held the most prominent position among all of the other sects. It was a powerful sect, and within that sect was a disciple by the name of Dao-Heaven, a new Chosen within the sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was currently sitting there cross-legged in meditation. For years, he his heart had been filled with various questions and speculations. And yet, he had never been able to prove whether or not they were right. In fact, the ideas in his head seemed almost too fantastic to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as of this moment, the entire Immortal God Continent suddenly trembled. Every entity in those lands stopped what they were doing and looked up. Mortals, cultivators, and even the animals, all suddenly seemed to lack the energy to even move. The entire world went completely still and quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for Dao-Heaven. He could move. A tremor ran through him as he suddenly sensed a familiar aura. A smile broke out on his face, and tears began to stream down his cheeks. Finally, he threw his head back and laughed uproariously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDao-Heaven, of course, was the former Echelon cultivator of the First Mountain and Sea!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA similar scene played out on the Devil Realm Continent. It was the same in the 33 Heavens above the Mountain and Sea Butterfly. Outside the 33 Heavens, sitting there on guard, was the monkey Dao Fang, whose heart suddenly trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all of the starry sky of Allheaven, things were shaking, and rumbling like thunder could be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the will of Allheaven seemed to cause everything to shake with its rage. It roared in fury, as well as... terror!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was terrified, because it could sense that a new aura had appeared within the starry sky. It was a new power, a Dao... that superseded the Heavenly Dao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Dao could be called... the Seal the Heavens Dao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seal the Heavens Dao was boundlessly domineering. It refused to allow anyone to offend it. It refused to allow any other will to change it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt… could make the Heavens open their eyes, and could make the Heavens close their eyes. If I want the Heavens’ eyes closed, they won’t dare to refuse!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I want, the Heavens shall NOT lack! What I don’t want, had BETTER not exist in the Heavens!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack on Planet Vast Expanse, on the first continent, everyone was resurrected. However... Yan’er remained frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter making the final knife cut, Little Treasure flicked his sleeve, and the statue and knife flew over toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, his eyes were different. Before, they had no pupils, but now they did. He looked around at the world, and saw light. Of course, he didn\u0027t care about the world. He slowly looked down at his wife, and smiled. This was the first time he had ever seen her appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was ugly, her face covered with scars and wounds. But to Little Treasure, she was the most beautiful thing in existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knelt down and wrapped his arms around her, smiling contentedly. Eventually, he closed his eyes, and his aura vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis soul flew out. It, along with the souls of all the other reincarnations, became a beam of light that shot toward the statue in Meng Hao’s hand. The light entered the statue, which then glowed brightly. It was now truly complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wooden statue was Meng Hao’s Ninth Hex. Once he absorbed it, he could... combine the Nine Hexes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, he felt no joy. It was hard to pinpoint exactly what emotions he felt as he looked down at Little Treasure’s corpse, which was gradually transforming into motes of light that floated through the air and merged into Meng Hao. After all, he had been part of Meng Hao to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao knew that Little Treasure could have refused to cooperate. Meng Hao was the true self, and he was the clone, a part that had essentially been cut out from Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t like being controlled, didn\u0027t like others being in charge of his destiny. And yet, in the end, he chose to complete the Ninth Hex, and to help Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Meng Hao knew that he did it, not for him, but... for Yan’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ninth reincarnation of his clone loved Yan’er much more than Meng Hao’s true self did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stood there in the cave for a long, long time. Eventually, the motes of light that were Little Treasure merged fully into Meng Hao. All traces of the clone’s existence had been wiped out, except for the sculpting knife and the wooden statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao sighed. Yan’er’s body was also transforming into motes of light that gradually began to fade away. Her soul hovered there, complete and whole, just in front of Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was looking at her fading corpse, and the empty spot next to it, where another person had been laying moments ago. Some time passed, after which she turned and looked at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should I call you the Ninth Paragon?” she asked softly. “Or Master. Or... Little Treasure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao extended his right hand, within which were two soul strands. One was the strand which had been fused with Han Bei. The other contained memories of a previous life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two soul strands merged together into one, becoming a beautiful stream of light that flowed over to Yan’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is a part of your soul,” Meng Hao said quietly. “If you absorb it, your soul will be complete, and you’ll remember everything from the past. You will remember... who exactly I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan’er looked quietly at the beautiful light, a calm smile slowly growing on her face. “What happened to Perfect?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s in the Ninth Sect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan’er nodded and looked off into the distance. Some more time passed before she spoke again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This ninth reincarnation was enough for me. What need is there of past memories? Now that I think about it, I\u0027m sure that there are many regrets within those memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I know is that you are my Master, and that I lived a good life.” She closed her eyes for a moment, and when she opened them again, they were bright and clear. She waved her finger at the soul light, the light which contained the memories of her past life. The light faded away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, she clasped hands and bowed to Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This life is over. Master, I won’t interfere in your world any more. Thank you for caring for me throughout the years.” She looked at Meng Hao one last time, then turned away. In front of her, a reincarnation vortex appeared. Just as she was about to step in, she stopped in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You promised to tell me the rest of the story of Chu Yuyan. But, I already know what happens.” She smiled and took a deep breath. She had long since come to the conclusion that she herself was the second half of Chu Yuyan’s story. Apparently, she had finally chosen to free herself from all burdens. What she had just said was no lie; she was content. Looking free and at ease, she waved at Meng Hao and then stepped into reincarnation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her, spending an eternity with the one she loved wasn’t necessary. She was happy with one lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stood quietly in the cave, eyes somewhat blank. The Ninth Hex was complete, but he didn\u0027t feel happy at all. In fact, melancholy gripped at his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some time passed, he shook his head and buried his feelings deep inside. He walked out of the cave and felt the soft breeze on his face. It lifted his hair and rustled his garments, almost as if it were taking away the bad memories with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of determination appeared on his face, and his eyes began to shine. His cultivation over the past thousand years, and all of the things he had experienced, had forged him into something even harder than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face looked young, but if you looked closely, there was something about him that could only be seen on someone who had existed for many years, and seen many things. There were even some faint wrinkles visible around the corners of his eyes. He did nothing to conceal the changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s time to go back....” He thought, looking up at the blue sky and the white clouds. Off in the distance was a red beam of light flying toward him. It was the mastiff, who landed in front of him and looked up quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked the mastiff\u0027s fur, and the light in his eyes grew more incisive than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After I absorb the Ninth Hex and ensure that it\u0027s complete, I can combine the Nine Hexes and extinguish the bronze lamp. Then I will Transcend. And after that... we can go home!” Although he didn’t speak very loudly, it was as if his voice merged with Heaven and Earth and spread out through the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the world of the Mountain and Sea Butterfly, a faint voice could suddenly be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m coming back!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 1525: Goodbye, Yan’er\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1524\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1526\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1525","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
