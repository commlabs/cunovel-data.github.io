He had grilled chicken and corn for lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t been kidding when he said all he ever ate was grilled chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did Jere tell you what he wants you and Steven to wear for the wedding?” I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad shook his head, looking confused. “I thought guys just wore suits for weddings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yeah, but you guys are his best men, so you’re all dressing alike. Khaki shorts and white-linen button-down shirts. He didn’t tell you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the first I’m hearing about linen shirts. Or being a best man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. “Jeremiah needs to get on the ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course you’re his best man. You and Steven both are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can there be two best men? ‘Best’ implies only one.” Biting into his corn on the cob, he said, “Let Steven be it, I don’t care.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! You’re Jeremiah’s brother. You have to be his best man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone rang as I was explaining to him what being the best man entailed. I didn’t recognize the number, but since the wedding planning had gotten under way, I’d been getting a lot of those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this Isabel?” I didn’t recognize the voice. She sounded older, like someone my mother’s age. Whoever she was, she had a thick Boston accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “Um, this is she. I mean, her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My name is Denise Coletti, I’m calling from Adam Fisher’s office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh … hello. It’s nice to meet you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, hello. I just need you to okay a few things for your wedding. I’ve selected a catering service called Elegantly Yours; they do events around the area. They’re doing this very last-minute for us; this caterer books months in advance for parties. Is this all right with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaintly, I said, “Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad looked at me quizzically, and I mouthed, Denise Coletti. His eyes widened, and he gestured for me to give him the phone. I waved his hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Denise Coletti said, “Now, how many people are you expecting?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty, if everyone can come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Adam told me more like forty. I’ll check with him.” I could hear her typing. “So probably four to five appetizers a person. Do we want a vegetarian option for the meal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think Jeremiah and I have any vegetarian friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. Are you going to want to go and do a tast-ing? I think you probably should.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wonderful. I’ll book you for next week, then. Now for seating arrangements. Do you want two or three long tables or five round tables?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um …” I hadn’t even thought of tables. And what was she talking about, forty? I was wishing I had Taylor next to me to tell me what to do. “Can I get back to you on that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenise let out a little sigh, and I knew I had said the wrong thing. “Sure, but be as quick as you can so I can give them the go-ahead. That’s all for now. I’ll be touching base with you again later this week. Oh, and congratulations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you very much, Denise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to me, Conrad called out, “Hi, Denise!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, “Is that Connie? Tell him hello from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Denise says hello,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she said mazol tov, and we hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” Conrad asked me. He had a corn kernel stuck on his cheek. “Why is Denise calling you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my phone down and said, “Um, apparently, your 184 · jenny han\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edad’s secretary is our wedding planner now. And we’re inviting forty people instead of twenty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlandly, he said, “That’s good news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is that good news?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It means my dad is okay with you guys getting married. And he’s paying for it.” Conrad started to cut his chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh. Wow.” I stood up. “I’d better call Jere. Wait, it’s the middle of the day. He’s still at work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI probably should have felt relieved that someone else was taking over, but instead I just felt overwhelmed. This wedding was getting a lot bigger than I had imagined it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we were renting tables? It was all too much, too sudden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross from me, Conrad was buttering another ear of corn. I looked down at my plate. I wasn’t hungry anymore. I felt sick to my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eat,” Conrad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a small bite of chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t get to talk to Jeremiah until later that evening. But the person I really wanted to talk to was my mother. She would have known how to configure the tables and where to seat everyone. Denise wasn’t the one I wanted to swoop in and tell me what to do, and not Mr. Fisher either, or even Susannah. I only wanted my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t really hit me how hard of a time Belly was having until I heard her on the phone with Taylor later that week. She had her door open, and I was brushing my teeth in the hall bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard her say, “Taylor, I really appreciate what your mom is trying to do, but I promise you, it’s okay… . I know, but it would just feel too weird with all the adults from the neighborhood at my wedding shower and then my mom not being there… .” I heard her sigh and say,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I know. Okay. Tell your mom thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her door then, and I was pretty sure I heard her start to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to my room, lay down on my bed, and stared up at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelly hadn’t let on to me how sad she was about her mom. She was an upbeat kind of person, naturally cheerful, like Jere. If there was a bright side, Belly would find it. Hearing her cry, it shook me up. I knew I should stay out of it. That was the smart thing to do. She didn’t need me looking out for her. She was a big girl. Besides, what could I do for her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was definitely staying out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, I got up early to see Laurel. It was still dark out when I left. I called her on the way and asked if she could meet for breakfast. Laurel was surprised, but she didn’t ask questions; she said she’d meet me at a diner off the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess Laurel had always been special to me. Ever since I was a kid, I just liked being near her. I liked the way you could be quiet around her, and with her. She didn’t talk down to kids. She treated us like equals. After my mom died and I transferred to Stanford, I started calling Laurel every once in a while. I still liked talking to her, and I liked that she reminded me of my mom without it hurting too much. It was like a link to home. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-33.html","bookId":2725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM"}
