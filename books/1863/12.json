She could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eonly imagine what Iona must be thinking as they shepherded her to the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came out on the roof into slanting afternoon sunlight. Jez gave Iona\u0027s shoulder a little squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See-there\u0027s the garden.\" She nodded toward a potted palm and three wooden barrels with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emiscellaneous wilted leaves in them. Iona glanced that way, then gave Jez a sober look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not getting enough water,\" she said as quietly as she said everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, it didn\u0027t rain enough this summer,\" Morgead said. \"You want to fix that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona just looked seriously at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, what I mean is, you\u0027ve got the Power, right? So if you just want to show us right now, anything\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou want, be my guest. It\u0027ll make things a lot simpler. Make it rain, why don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona looked right at him. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just saying that there\u0027s no reason for you to get hurt here. We just want to see you do something like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat you did the night of the fire. Anything. Just show us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez watched him. There was something incongruous about the scene: Morgead in his high boots and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleather jacket, iron-muscled, sleek, sinewy, on one knee in front of this harmless-looking kid in pink\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epants. And the kid just looking back at him with her sad and distant eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you\u0027re crazy,\" Iona said softly. Her pigtails moved as she shook her head. A pink ribbon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efluttered loosely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember the fire?\" Jez said from behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Course.\" The kid turned slowly around. \"I was scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t get hurt. The fire got close to you and then you did something. And then the fire went\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was scared, and then the fire went away. But I didn\u0027t do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Morgead said. He stood. \"Maybe if you can\u0027t tell us, you can show us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Jez could say anything, he was picking up the little girl up and carrying her. He had to step\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover a line of debris that stretched like a diagonal wall from one side of the roof to the other. It was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomposed of telephone books, splintery logs, old clothes, and other odds and ends, and it formed a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebarrier, blocking off a corner of the roof from the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put Iona in the triangle beyond the debris. Then he stepped back over the wall, leaving her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona didn\u0027t say anything, didn\u0027t try to follow him back out of the triangle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez stood tensely. The kid\u0027s a Wild Power, she told herself. She\u0027s already survived worse than this. And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eno matter what happens, she\u0027s not going to get hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI promised her that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she would have liked to be telepathic again just for a few minutes, just to tell the kid one more time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enot to be scared. She especially wanted to as Val and Raven poured gasoline on the wall of debris. Iona\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewatched them do it with huge sober eyes, still not moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Pierce lit a match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. The flames leaped up yellow and blue. Not the bright orange they would have been at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut hot. They spread fast and Jez could feel the heat from where she was standing, ten feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid was closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still didn\u0027t say anything, didn\u0027t try to jump over the flames while they were low. In a few moments\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey were high enough that she couldn\u0027t jump through them without setting herself on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, Jez thought, knowing the kid couldn\u0027t hear her. Now, do it! Come on, Iona. Put the fire out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona just looked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was standing absolutely still, with her little hands curled into fists at her sides. A small and lonely\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efigure, with the late afternoon sun making a soft red halo around her head and the hot wind from the fire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erippling her pink-trimmed shirt. She faced the flames dead-on, but not aggressively, not as if she were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplanning to fight them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn; this is wrong, Jez thought. Her own hands were clenched into fists so tightly that her nails were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebiting into her palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I\u0027m concerned,\" Pierce said softly from just behind her. \"I have a concern here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez glanced at him quickly. Pierce didn\u0027t talk a lot, and he always seemed the coldest of the group-aside\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom Morgead, of course, who could be colder than anyone. Now Jez wondered. Could he, who never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed to be moved by pity, actually be the most sensitive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worried about this fire. I know nobody can look down on us, but it\u0027s making a lot of smoke. What if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone of the other tenants comes up to investigate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez almost hit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not my home, she thought, and felt the part of her that had sighed and felt loved and understood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewither away. These are not my people. I don\u0027t belong with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Pierce wasn\u0027t worth hitting. She turned her back on him to look at Iona again. She was dimly aware\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof Morgead telling him to shut up, that other tenants were the least of their worries, but most of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eattention was focused on the kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, kid! she thought. Then she said it out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Iona! Put out the fire. You can do it! Just do what you did before!\" She tried to catch the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echild\u0027s eye, but Iona was looking at the flames. She seemed to be trembling now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, come on!\" Morgead said brusquely. \"Let\u0027s get this over with, kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaven leaned forward, her long front hair ruffling in the wind. \"Do you remember what you did that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enight?\" she shouted seriously. \"Think!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona looked at her and spoke for the first time. \"I didn\u0027t do anything!\" Her voice, so composed before,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas edging on tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire was full-blown now, loud as a roaring wind, sending little bits of burning debris into the air. One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efloated down to rest at Iona\u0027s foot and she stepped backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s got to be scared, Jez told herself. That\u0027s the whole point of this test. If she\u0027s not scared, she\u0027ll never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe able to find her Power. And we\u0027re talking about saving the world, here. We\u0027re not just torturing this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekid for fun.... It\u0027s still wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought burst out from some deep part of her. Jez had seen a lot of horrible things as a vampire and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea vampire hunter, but suddenly she knew she couldn\u0027t watch any more of this. I\u0027m going to call it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Morgead. He was standing tensely, arms folded over his chest, green eyes fixed on Iona\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas if he could will her into doing what he wanted. Raven and Val were beside him, Raven expressionless\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunder her fall of dark hair; Val frowning with his big hands on his hips. Thistle was a step or so behind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s time to stop,\" Jez said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead\u0027s head whipped around to look at her. \"No. We\u0027ve gotten this far; it would be stupid to have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto start all over again. Would that be any nicer to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said, it\u0027s time to stop. What do you have to put out the fire-or did you even think of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they were talking, Thistle stepped forward. She moved right up to the flames, staring at Iona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better do something fast,\" she shouted. \"Or you\u0027re going to burn right up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe childish, taunting tone caught Jez\u0027s attention, but Morgead was talking to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s going to put it out any minute now. She just has to be frightened enough-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morgead, she\u0027s absolutely terrified already! Look at her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead turned. Iona\u0027s clenched fists were now raised to chest-level; her mouth was slightly open as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe breathed far too fast. And although she wasn\u0027t screaming or crying like a normal kid, Jez could see\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe tremors running through her little body. She looked like a small trapped animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she\u0027s not doing it now, she\u0027s never going to,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez told Morgead flatly. \"It was a stupid idea in the first place, and it\u0027s over!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the change in his green eyes; the flare of anger and then the sudden darkness of defeat. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erealized that he was going to cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before he could say anything, Thistle moved forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re gonna die!\" she shrilled. \"You\u0027re gonna burn up right now!\" And she began kicking flaming\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edebris at Iona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything happened very fast after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe debris came apart in a shower of sparks as it flew toward Iona. Iona\u0027s mouth came open in horror\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas she found fiery garbage swirling around her knees. And then Raven was yelling at Thistle, but Thistle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas already kicking more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second deluge of sparks hit Iona. Jez saw her put up her hands to protect her face, then fling her arms\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout as a piece of burning cloth settled on her sleeve. She saw the sleeve spurt with a tiny flame. She saw\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona cast a frantic look around, searching for a way to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead was dragging Thistle back by her collar. Thistle was still kicking. Sparks were everywhere and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez felt a hot pain on her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Iona\u0027s eyes went enormous and blank and fixed and Jez could see that she\u0027d made some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edecision, she\u0027d found some way to get out of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly not the right one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez saw Iona turn toward the edge of the roof, and she knew in that same instant that she couldn\u0027t get to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe child in time to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there was only one thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez only hoped she would be fast enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe very nearly wasn\u0027t. But there was a two-foot wall at the roof\u0027s perimeter, and it delayed Iona for a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esecond as she scrambled onto it. That gave Jez a second to leap through the fire and catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Iona was on the wall, and then she was launching her small body into empty space. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejumped like a flying squirrel, arms and legs outspread, looking down at the three-story drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez jumped with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez! The telepathic shout followed her, but Jez scarcely heard it. She had no idea who had even said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer entire consciousness was focused on Iona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe some part of her was still hoping that the kid had magic and could make the wind hold her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it didn\u0027t happen and Jez didn\u0027t waste time thinking about it. She hit Iona in midair, grabbing the small\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was something no human could have done. Jez\u0027s vampire muscles instinctively knew how to handle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis, though. They twisted her as she fell, putting her underneath the child in her arms, putting her legs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebelow her like a cat\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut of course Jez didn\u0027t have a vampire\u0027s resistance to injury. She knew perfectly well that when she hit,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe fall would break both her legs. In her weakened state it might well kill her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should save the kid, though, she thought unemotionally as the ground rushed up to meet her. The extra\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eresiliency of Jez\u0027s flesh would act as a cushion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was one thing Jez hadn\u0027t thought of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were discouraged-looking redbud trees planted at regular intervals along the cracked and mossy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esidewalk. None of them had too much in the way of foliage even in late summer, but they certainly had a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elot of little branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez and the kid crashed right into one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez felt pain, but scratching, stabbing pain instead of the slamming agony of hitting the sidewalk. Her legs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere smashing through things that cracked and snapped and poked her. Twigs and branches. She was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeing flipped around as some of the twigs caught on her jeans and others snagged her leather jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery branch she hit decreased her velocity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when she finally crashed out of the tree and hit concrete, it merely knocked the wind out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack dots danced in front of her eyes. Then her vision cleared and she realized that she was lying on her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback with Iona clutched to her stomach. Shiny redbud leaves were floating down all around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddess, she thought. We made it. I don\u0027t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a dark blur and something thudded against the sidewalk beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead. He landed like a cat, bending his knees, but nice a big cat. A three-story jump was pretty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esteep even for a vampire. Jez could see the shock reverberate through him as his legs hit concrete, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen he fell forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat must hurt, she thought with distant sympathy. But the next instant he was up again, he was by her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eside and bending over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" He was yelling it both aloud and telepathically. His dark hair was mussed and flying;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis green eyes were wild. \"Jez!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. It was you who yelled when I jumped, Jez thought. I should have known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked up at him. \"Of course I\u0027m all right,\" she said hazily. She tugged at the kid lying on her. \"Iona!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona stirred. Both her hands were clutching Jez\u0027s jacket in front, but she sat up a little without letting go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a burned patch on her sleeve, but no fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer velvety brown eyes were huge-and misty. She looked sad and confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was really scary,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Jez gulped. She wasn\u0027t any good at talking about emotional things, but right now the words\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espilled out without conscious effort. Tm sorry, Iona; I\u0027m so sorry, I\u0027m so sorry. We shouldn\u0027t have done\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat. It was a very bad thing to do, and I\u0027m really sorry, and we\u0027re going to take you home now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody\u0027s going to hurt you. We\u0027re going to take you back to your mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe velvety eyes were still unhappy. Tired and unhappy and reproachful. Jez had never felt like more of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea monster, not even that night in Muir Woods when she had realized she was hunting her own kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona\u0027s gaze remained steady, but her chin quivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez looked at Morgead. \"Can you erase her memory? I can\u0027t see any reason why she should have to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremember all this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still breathing quickly, his face pale and his pupils dilated. But he looked at Iona and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I can wipe her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she\u0027s not the Wild Power, you know,\" Jez said levelly, as if making a comment about the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead flinched. Then he shoved his hair back with his knuckles, his eyes shutting briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s an extraordinary kid, and I don\u0027t know exactly what she\u0027s going to be-maybe President or some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egreat doctor or botanist or something. Something special, because she\u0027s got that inner light- something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat keeps her from getting mad or mean or hysterical. But that\u0027s got nothing to do with being a Wild\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right! I know, already!\" Morgead yelled, and Jez realized she was babbling. She shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead took a breath and put his hand down. \"She\u0027s not it. I was wrong. I made a bad mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Jez felt calmer now. \"So can you please wipe her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! I\u0027m doing it!\" Morgead put his hands on Iona\u0027s slender shoulders. \"Look, kid, I\u0027m-sorry. I never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought you\u0027d-you know, jump like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona didn\u0027t say anything. If he wanted forgiveness, he wasn\u0027t getting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath and went on. \"This has been a pretty rotten day, hasn\u0027t it? So why don\u0027t you just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforget all about it, and before you know it, you\u0027ll be home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez could feel him reach out with his mind, touching the child\u0027s consciousness with his Power. Iona\u0027s eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshifted, she looked at Jez uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" Jez whispered. \"It won\u0027t hurt.\" She hung on to Iona\u0027s gaze, trying to comfort her as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead\u0027s suggestions took hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t ever have to remember this,\" Morgead said, his voice soothing now. Gentle. \"So why don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou just go to sleep? You can have a little nap... and when you wake up, you\u0027ll be home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIona\u0027s eyelids were closing. At the last possible second she gave Jez a tiny sleepy smile-just the barest\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echange of expression, but it seemed to ease the tightness in Jez\u0027s chest. And then Iona\u0027s lashes were lying\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheavy on her cheeks and her breathing was deep and regular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez sat up and gently put the sleeping child on the sidewalk. She smoothed back one stray pigtail and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewatched the little chest rise and fall a couple of times. Then she looked up at Morgead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, exhaling sharply. \"It was the least I could do.\" Then he gave her an odd glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez thought of it at the same instant. She was the one so concerned about the child-why had she asked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead to wipe her memory?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I can\u0027t do it, she thought dryly. Out loud she said, \"I\u0027m really kind of tired, after everything that\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappened today. I don\u0027t have much Power left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah...\" But his green eyes were slightly narrowed, searching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plus, I hurt.\" Jez stretched, gingerly testing her muscles, feeling every part of her protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe searching look vanished instantly. Morgead leaned forward and began to go over her with light,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexpert fingers, his eyes worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you move everything? What about your legs? Do you feel numb anywhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can move everything, and I only wish I felt numb somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez-I\u0027m sorry.\" He blurted it out as awkwardly as he had to the child. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean ... I mean, this just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehasn\u0027t turned out the way I planned. The kid getting hurt-you getting hurt. It just wasn\u0027t what I had in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid getting hurt? Jez thought. Don\u0027t tell me you care about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no reason for Morgead to lie. And he did look unhappy-probably more unhappy than Jez\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad ever seen him. His eyes were still all pupil, as if he were scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not hurt,\" Jez said. It was all she could think of. She felt dizzy suddenly-uncertain and a little giddy,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas if she were still tumbling off the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are.\" He said it with automatic stubbornness, as if it were one of their arguments. But his hand\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereached out to touch her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one that had been hit by burning debris. It hurt, but Morgead was touching so lightly.... Coolness\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed to flow from his fingers, seeping into the burn and making it feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez gasped. \"Morgead-what are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Giving you some Power. You\u0027re low and you need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving her Power? She\u0027d never heard of such a thing. But he was doing it. She could feel her skin healing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eitself faster, could feel his strength pour into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a strange sensation. It made her shiver inwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morgead...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were fixed on her face. And suddenly they were all Jez could see; the rest of the world was a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblur. All she could hear was the soft catch in his breath; all she could feel was the gentleness of his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were leaning toward each other, or falling. It was that silver thread between them, shortening,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epulling. They had nothing to grab on to but each other. And then Morgead\u0027s arms were around her and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe felt his warm mouth touch hers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-12.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
