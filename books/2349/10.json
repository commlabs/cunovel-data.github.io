I walked past the vacant lot to the diner. Lunch, for one. I ordered the cheeseburger again, and then stepped over to the phone by the door and called the Pentagon. Colonel John James Frazer. Senate Liaison. He answered on the first ring. I asked him, \"What genius decided to classify that plate number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I can\u0027t tell you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever, it was a bad mistake. All it did was confirm the car belongs to a Kelham guy. It was practically a public announcement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had no alternative. We couldn\u0027t put it in the public domain. Journalists would have gotten it five minutes after local law enforcement. We couldn\u0027t allow that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now it sounds like you\u0027re telling me it belonged to a Bravo Company guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not telling you anything. But believe me, we had no choice. The consequences would have been catastrophic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell me you\u0027re kidding,\" I said. \"Because right now you\u0027re making it sound like it was Reed Riley\u0027s own personal vehicle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked, \"Was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t confirm or deny,\" Frazer said. \"And don\u0027t ask again. And don\u0027t use that name again, either. Not on an unsecured line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does the officer in question have an explanation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t comment on that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"This is getting out of control, Frazer. You need to rethink. The cover up is always worse than the crime. You need to stop it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Negative on that, Reacher. There\u0027s a plan in place, and it will stay in place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does the plan include an exclusion zone around Kelham? Maybe for journalists especially?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got circumstantial evidence here of boots on the ground outside of Kelham\u0027s fence. Part of the circumstantial evidence is a corpse. I\u0027m telling you, this thing is out of control now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s the corpse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A scrappy middle-aged guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A journalist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how to recognize a journalist by sight alone. Maybe that\u0027s a skill they teach to the infantry, but they don\u0027t teach it to MPs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No ID on him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t looked yet. The doctor hasn\u0027t finished with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrazer said, \"There is no exclusion zone around Fort Kelham. That would be a major policy shift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And illegal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed. And stupid. And counterproductive. It isn\u0027t happening. It never has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the Marine Corps did it once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Within the last twenty years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Marines. They do all kinds of things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should check it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How? You think they put it in their official history?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it obliquely. Look for an officer who got canned overnight with no other explanation. Maybe a colonel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up with Frazer and ate my burger and drank some coffee and then I set out to do what Garber had ordered me to do mid-morning, which was to return to the wreck and destroy the offending license plate. I turned east on the Kelham road and then north on the railroad ties. I passed by the old water tower. Its elephant\u0027s trunk was made from some kind of black rubberized canvas, gone all perished and patchy with age. The whole thing was swaying a little in a soft southerly breeze. I walked on fifty yards and then stepped off the line and headed for where I had seen the half-buried bumper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe half-buried bumper was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nowhere to be seen. It had been dug up and taken away. The hole its lance-like point had made had been filled with earth, which had been stamped down by boot soles and then tamped flat by the backs of shovels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boot prints were like nothing I had ever seen in the military. But the shovel marks could have been made by GI entrenching tools. It was difficult to be sure. Couldn\u0027t rule it out, couldn\u0027t rule it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked on, deeper into the debris field. It had all been tampered with. It had been sifted, and examined, and turned over, and checked, and evaluated. Almost two hundred linear yards. Maybe a thousand individual fragments had been displaced. No doubt ten times as many smaller items had been eyeballed. A wide area. A big task. A lot of work. Slow and painstaking. Six men, I figured. Maybe eight. I pictured them advancing in a line, under effective command, working with great precision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith military precision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked back the way I had come. I got to the middle of the railroad crossing and saw a car in the east, coming from the direction of Kelham. It was still far away on the straight road. Small to the eye, but not a small car. At first I thought it might be Deveraux coming back after lunch, but it wasn\u0027t. It was a black car, and big, and fast, and smooth. A town car. A limousine. It was right out on the crown of the road, straddling the line, staying well away from the ragged shoulders. It was swaying and wafting and wandering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came off the track on the Kelham side and stood in the middle of the road, feet apart, arms out, big and obvious. I let the car get within a hundred yards and then I crossed my arms above my head and waved the universal distress semaphore. I knew the driver would stop. This was 1997, remember. Four and a half years before the new rules. A long time ago. A much less suspicious world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car slowed and stopped in front of me. I went to my right, around the hood, down the flank, toward the driver\u0027s window, holding back a little, trying to perfect my angle. I wanted to get a look at the passenger. I figured he would be in the back, on the far side, with the front passenger seat scooted forward for leg room. I knew how these things were done. I had been in town cars before. Once or twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver\u0027s window came down. I bent forward from the waist. Took a look. The driver was a big fat guy with the kind of belly that forced his knees wide apart. He was wearing a black chauffeur\u0027s cap and a black jacket and a black tie. He had watery eyes. He said, \"Can we help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I\u0027m sorry. My mistake. I thought you were someone else. But thanks anyway for stopping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" the guy said. \"No problem.\" His window went back up and I stepped aside and the car drove on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe passenger had been male, older than me, gray haired, prosperous, in a fine suit made of wool. There had been a leather briefcase on the seat beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a lawyer, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was facing east, toward the black part of town, and there were things over there that I wanted to see again, so I set off walking in that direction. The road felt good under my feet. I guessed once upon a time during the glory days of the railroad it had been a simple dirt track, but it had been updated since then, almost certainly in the 1950s, almost certainly on the DoD\u0027s dime. The foundation had been dug down, for armor on flat-bed transporters, and the line had been straightened, because if an army engineer sees a ruled line on a map, then a straight road is what appears on the ground. I had walked on many DoD roads. There are a lot of them, all around the world, all built a lifetime ago, during the long and spectacular blaze of American military power and self confidence, when there was nothing we couldn\u0027t or wouldn\u0027t do. I was a product of that era, but not a part of it. I was nostalgic for something I had never experienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I thought about my old pal Stan Lowrey, talking about want ads in the hamburger place near where we were based. Changes were coming, for sure, but I wasn\u0027t unhappy. That straight road through the low Mississippi forest was helping me. The sun was out, and the air was warm. There were miles behind me, and miles ahead, and plenty of time on the clock. I had no ambitions and very few needs. I would be OK, whatever came next. No choice. I would have to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made the same turn Deveraux had made in her car, south on the dirt road between the bar ditches and the slave shacks. Toward Emmeline McClatchy\u0027s place. At walking speed I was seeing different things than from the car. Poverty, mostly, and up close. There were patched clothes on lines, washed so thin they were almost transparent. There were no new cars. There were chickens in some of the yards, and goats, and the occasional pig. There were mangy dogs on chains. There were duct tape and baling wire fixes everywhere, to electric lines, to rain gutters, to plumbing outlets. And I was seeing suspicion too, to a degree. There were barefoot children briefly visible, staring at me, their fingers in their mouths, until they were snatched back out of sight by anxious mothers who wouldn\u0027t meet my eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept on going and passed by Emmeline McClatchy\u0027s place. I didn\u0027t see her. I didn\u0027t see anybody on that stretch of the road. No kids, no adults. Nobody. I passed by the house with the beer signs in the window. I followed the same turns Deveraux had steered me through before, left and right and left, until I found the abandoned work site and its pile of gravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house planned for the lot was small, and its foundation was set at an angle according to ancient practice and wisdom, to take advantage of prevailing breezes and to avoid the full impact of the southwestern sun in the summer. The foundation itself was built of recycled blocks and sand-heavy cement. A sewer pipe and a water line had been roughed in. The corner posts were already weathering. Nothing else had been completed. Money had run out, I supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gravel in the pile was waiting to be made into concrete, I assumed. Maybe the ground floor of the new place was supposed to be a solid slab, not boards. Maybe there were advantages to doing it that way, perhaps related to termites. I had no idea. I had never built a house. I had never had to consider housing-related issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gravel pile itself had spread and settled during the idle months. Weeds were showing through the edges where it was thin. It was knee-high over most of its area, and up close it was about the size of a queen bed. The divots and the pockmarks in its top surface were like a Rorschach test. It was entirely possible to see them as the result of innocent children running and jumping and stomping. It was equally possible to see them as the result of a grown woman being thrown down and raped, in a violent flurry of knees and elbows and backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squatted down and ran a fingertip through the tiny stones. They were surprisingly hard to move. They were packed down tight, and some kind of a dusty residue on them seemed to have mixed with rain or dew to form a weak adhesive. I made a furrow about an inch wide and an inch deep, and then I turned my hand over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed the back of my hand into the pile and held it there for a minute. Then I looked at the result. Small white marks, but no indentations, because there was no real flesh on the back of my hand. So I pulled up my sleeve and pressed the inside of my forearm against the pile. I put the flat of my other hand on it and leaned on it hard. I bounced it up and down a couple of times, and scrabbled it around. Then I looked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result was some small red marks, some small white marks, and a whole lot of dust, dirt, and mud. I spat on my arm and wiped it on my pants and the resulting clean stripe looked both very like and very unlike the small of Janice May Chapman\u0027s back. Another Rorschach test. Inconclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I did come to one minor conclusion. I cleaned up my arm as well as I could, which was not perfectly, and I decided that whatever gravel patch Chapman had been raped on, she had not only dressed afterward, but showered too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked on and found the wider street where Shawna Lindsay had lived. The second victim. The middle class girl, comparatively. Her baby brother was still in his yard. Sixteen years old. The ugly boy. He was just standing there. Doing nothing. Watching the street. Watching me approach. His eyes tracked me all the way. I stepped up on the shoulder and came to a stop face to face with him, with only his low picket fence between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"How\u0027s life, kid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"My mom\u0027s out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good to know,\" I said. \"But that wasn\u0027t what I asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Life\u0027s a bitch,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then you die,\" I said. Which I regretted, instantly. Insensitive, given his family\u0027s recent history. But he took no notice. Which I was glad about. I said, \"I need to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? You earning a whitey merit badge? You need to find a black person to talk with today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in the army,\" I said. \"Which means half my friends are black, and more importantly it means half my bosses are black. I talk to black people all the time, and they talk to me. So don\u0027t give me that ghetto shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was quiet for a second. Then he asked, \"What part of the army are you in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Military Police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a tough job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tougher than tough,\" I said. \"Think about it logically. Any soldier could kick your ass, and I could kick any soldier\u0027s ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For real?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than real,\" I said. \"Real is for other people. Not for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked, \"What do you want to talk about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"My guess is no one ever talked to you about your sister\u0027s death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Normally with a homicide victim, they talk to everyone who knew her. They ask for insights and opinions. They want to know what kinds of things she did, where she went, who she hung with. Did they ever talk to you about that kind of stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"Nobody ever talked to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They should have,\" I said. \"I would have. Because brothers know things about sisters. Especially at the ages you two were. I bet you knew things about Shawna that no one else did. I bet she told you things she couldn\u0027t tell your mom. And I bet you figured out some stuff on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid shuffled in place a little. Bashful, and a little proud. Like saying: Yeah, maybe I did figure some things out. Out loud he said, \"No one ever talks to me about anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m deformed. They think I\u0027m slow, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who says you\u0027re deformed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even your mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t say it, but she thinks it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even your friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any friends. Who would want to be friends with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all wrong,\" I said. \"You\u0027re not deformed. You\u0027re ugly, but you\u0027re not deformed. There\u0027s a difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"That\u0027s what Shawna used to tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pictured the two of them together. Beauty and the beast. A tough life, for both of them. Tough for him, with the endless implied comparisons. Tough for her, with the endless need for tact and patience. I said, \"You should join the army. You\u0027d look like a movie star compared to half the people I know. You should see the guy that sent me here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to join the army,\" he said. \"I talked to someone about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did you talk to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shawna\u0027s last boyfriend,\" he said. \"He was a soldier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e32\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid invited me inside. His mom was out, and there was a pitcher of iced tea in the refrigerator. The house was dim and shuttered. It smelled stale. It was mean and narrow inside, but it had plenty of rooms. An eat-in kitchen, a living room, and what I guessed were three bedrooms in back. Space for two parents and two kids, except I saw no sign of a father, and Shawna was never coming home again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid told me his name was Bruce. We took glasses of tea and sat at the kitchen table. There was an old wall phone next to the refrigerator. Pale yellow plastic. Its cord had been stretched about twelve feet long. There was an old television set on the countertop. Small, but color, with chrome accents on the cabinet. Practically an antique, probably rescued from a trash pile somewhere and polished up like an old Cadillac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp close and personal the kid was no better looking than he had been outside. But if you ignored his head, then the rest of him was in pretty good shape. He was all bone and muscle, broad through the chest and the shoulders, thick in the arms. Deep down he seemed patient and cheerful. I liked him, basically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked me, \"Would they really let me join the army?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The army, I mean. The army itself. Would they let me in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have felony convictions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An arrest record of any kind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then of course they\u0027ll let you in. They\u0027d take you today if you were old enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The others would laugh at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably,\" I said. \"But not for the reason you think. Soldiers aren\u0027t like that. They\u0027d find something else. Something you never even thought of yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could wear my helmet all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if they find one big enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And night vision goggles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe a bomb disposal hood,\" I said. I figured bomb disposal was the coming thing. Small wars and booby traps. But I didn\u0027t say so. Not the kind of message a potential recruit wants to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sipped my tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy asked me, \"Do you watch television?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much,\" I said. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have commercials,\" he said. \"Which means they have to fit an hour\u0027s story into forty-some minutes. So they get right to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think that\u0027s what I should do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I\u0027m saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who do you think killed your sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy took a sip of tea and a serious breath and then he started in on everything he had been thinking about, and everything he had never been asked about. It all came tumbling out, fast, coherent, responsive, and thoughtful. He said, \"Well, her throat was cut, so we need to think about who is trained to do that kind of thing, or experienced with that kind of thing, or both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat kind of thing. His sister\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked, \"So who fits the bill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soldiers,\" he said. \"Especially here. And ex-soldiers, especially here. Fort Kelham is field training for special ops guys. They know those skills. And hunters. And most people in town, to be honest. Including me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You? Are you a hunter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I have to eat. People keep pigs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think pigs commit suicide? We cut their throats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve done that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dozens of times. Sometimes I get a dollar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked, \"When and where did you last see Shawna alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the day she was killed. It was a Friday in November. She left here about seven o\u0027clock. After dark, anyway. She was all dressed up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where was she going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Across the tracks. To Brannan\u0027s bar, probably. That\u0027s where she usually went.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Brannan\u0027s the most popular bar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all popular. But Brannan\u0027s is where most folk start out and finish up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did Shawna go with that night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She left on her own. Probably she was going to meet her boyfriend at the bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she ever get there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She was found two streets from here. Where someone started to build a house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The place with the gravel pile?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy nodded. \"She was dumped right on it. Like a human sacrifice in a history book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got up from the table and poked around the kitchen for a minute. Then we took more tea and sat down again. I said, \"Tell me about Shawna\u0027s last boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First white boyfriend she ever had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she like him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they get along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problems?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t see any.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he kill her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He might have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t rule him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gut feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to say no, but someone killed her. It could have been him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reed. That was all Shawna ever said. Reed this, Reed that. Reed, Reed, Reed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wear name tapes,\" I said. \"Battledress uniform, above the right breast pocket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never saw him in uniform. They all wear jeans and T-shirts to town. Jackets, sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Officer or enlisted man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You talked to him. Didn\u0027t he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid shook his head. \"He said his name was Reed. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he an asshole?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he look like he worked hard for a living?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. He didn\u0027t take things very seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably an officer, then,\" I said. \"What did he tell you about joining the army?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said serving your country was a noble thing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely an officer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said I could learn a skill. He said I might make specialist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could do better than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said they would explain it all at the recruiting office. He said there\u0027s a good one in Memphis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go there,\" I said. \"Way too dangerous. Recruiting offices are shared between all four branches of the service. The Marines might grab you first. Fate worse than death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where should I go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go straight to Kelham. There are recruiters on every post.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will that work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure it will. As soon as you\u0027ve got something in your hand that proves you\u0027re eighteen years old, they\u0027ll let you in and never let you out again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they say the army is getting smaller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for pointing that out, kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why would they want me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re still going to have hundreds of thousands of people. Tens of thousands will still leave every year. They\u0027ll always need to be replaced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with the Marines?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing really. It\u0027s a traditional rivalry. They say stuff, we say stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They do amphibious landings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"History shows the army has done many more all on its own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheriff Deveraux was a Marine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is a Marine,\" I said. \"They never stop being Marines, even after they leave. It\u0027s one of their things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like her,\" the kid said. \"I could tell. I saw you riding in her car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s OK,\" I said. \"Did Reed have a car? Shawna\u0027s boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid nodded. \"They all have cars. I\u0027m going to have a car too, after I join.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of car did Reed have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had a 1957 Chevy Bel Air two-door hardtop. Not really a classic. It was kind of beat up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What color was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid said, \"It was blue.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-affair-jack-reacher-16/page-10.html","bookId":2349,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:37 AM"}
