You didn’t help, but you didn’t make me cry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had exposed her hands while she tutored me—when she touched me. Shit. I’d forgotten about her scars. Hell, she’d forgotten about her scars—until now. I wanted that moment back, and to see her smile again. “Then who did? It’s been a while since I’ve been in a fight. My rep will be ruined if I’m good for too long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought it, but I won. The smile returned for a brief dazzling moment. “You’d be expelled if you got into a fight with Mrs. Collins. So thanks, but no, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit the back of my head against the locker. “She fucked with me today, too. Must be a third date thing.” I chuckled when Echo looked at me like I’d tattooed my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Third date thing meaning what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she live in a box? “After the third date, people generally have sex. Today was my third session and Mrs. Collins royally screwed me over. And by the looks of it, she did a number on you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer perfectly shaped eyebrows furrowed as she ran through what I said. I loved how her lips twitched in humor and a blush touched her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what sucks?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mrs. Collins?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but that’s not what I meant. Everything I need to know is in that freaking file she keeps on me. It’s like the key to the magic door that opens the magic kingdom.” She kicked her backpack across the hall. “I could finally find some real peace if I could get my hands on that stupid, stupid folder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she spoke, my mind whirled like a tornado. Mrs. Collins was in touch with Tyler and Jacob’s foster parents, which meant she had their information: their last names, their phone number, their address. Echo was right. Those files were a gold mine. If I got my hands on my folder, I could check on my brothers. I could prove they were in an abusive home and gain custody. “You, Echo, are a genius.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcho\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStage one of Operation Read My File consisted of my father, Ashley and me waiting for Mrs. Collins to call us in for our meeting. My father stood in the corner, speaking harshly to someone on the other end of his BlackBerry while Ashley and I sat next to each other on the row of chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley flung her hand over her stomach. “Oh. Oh, Echo, the baby kicked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can come in now,” called Mrs. Collins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flew out of my seat. “Thank God.” For months, Ashley had bored everyone with endless baby chatter. Okay, maybe not everyone. My father hung on her every word like she was Paul preaching the gospel. He’d never paid this much attention to my mother. If he had, I wouldn’t be the school freak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree weeks ago, Mrs. Collins had begun the term wearing business suits and then jeans and a nice shirt on casual Fridays. Each week casual Friday moved up a day. Today, Tuesday was the new Friday. From behind her desk, she flashed her never-ending smile. “Mr. and Mrs. Emerson, how wonderful to see you, but our group session is next week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith eyebrows raised, my father sent a questioning glance to Ashley, who sat stunned with her mouth open. “No. The family calendar clearly stated …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut her off. “I told them to come this week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Collins did that weird thing where she shifted her entire mouth to the right. “I know we had a rough session last week, but did you really think you needed to bring bodyguards?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Echo?” My father asked. “What happened last week?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart squeezed and dropped. His concern sounded real. I’d give anything if it was. I stood and walked to the window. Students mingled in the parking lot before heading home. This session had the possibility of stinking as much as last week’s. “Something good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s fantastic. This family needs good news.” Ashley’s perky voice grated like sandpaper against my skin. “I read in a magazine that babies can sense negativity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car pulled out of its spot, revealing Noah sitting on the hood of his rusting car next to some guy with lots of earrings and tattoos and biker chick Beth. His two friends stared at me when he gave me his mischievous grin. His friends gave me the creeps. Noah’s smile gave me flutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I should have flutters for Noah Hutchins. I was dating Luke, not him—that is if you called Luke’s one-sided nighttime phone conversations and a single awkward group outing to the local pizza place dating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and shook Luke out of my head. Noah and I had made a deal and I intended to uphold my end of the bargain. The plan was simple: I needed to push back my appointment so he could move his session from the morning to my current afternoon slot. With our appointment times near each other, one of us would distract Mrs. Collins while the other snuck a peek at the files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Echo?” my father prodded, the hint of concern still present. “What’s good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInhaling deeply to calm the nerves squeezing my stomach, I turned to face him. I loathed confrontation and I hated confrontation with my father more. “Why didn’t you tell me I won the Governor’s Cup?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me?” No concern left in my father’s tone now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA twinge of hurt joined the nerves. Why, on top of everything else, did he take art away from me, too? “I wanted to win so badly. You could have at least told me that much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Collins eyed me warily and kept her hands folded on her lap. I expected her to jump in and defend herself, but she remained annoyingly cool. Ashley placed her hand over my father’s. “Owen?” Was that guilt flickering in her blue eyes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScaring the crap out of me, he turned an unusual color of gray. “You remember?” His eyes grew round, making him look lost and terribly sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought he wanted me to remember. My forehead wrinkled in confusion. Wasn’t that the point of all this therapy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray turned to red as he faced Mrs. Collins. “This is unacceptable. We saw two psychiatrists and had three separate psychological evaluations. Each of them had a different opinion of how to proceed, but after her breakdown, every single one of them told us to leave that day alone. I knew when you asked for that ribbon to put in this room we should have opted out of your program. How could you force her to remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t force anything, Mr. Emerson. I simply placed the ribbon on the desk during her sessions. It’s called desensitizing. Her mind decided it was safe to remember, so she did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpringing from his chair, my father ran a hand through his hair. “My God, Echo. Why didn’t you tell me earlier? You have to understand …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Emerson, stop!” Mrs. Collins tried to keep her voice level, but I felt the slight urgency in her tone. “She only remembered receiving the ribbon. That’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father’s chest rose and fell rapidly. He reminded me of one of those paper bags people blow into during a panic attack. Then, as if to prove the impossible possible, he pulled me into him and hugged me. One of his arms wound around my back. His other hand cradled my head against him. I stood stiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet I felt warm. Secure. Safe. Like when I was a child and my mother spiraled into an episode and I was scared. Memories of my mother wide-eyed, yelling incoherently, her wild, red hair falling from a ponytail filled my mind. I used to run to my father and he would hold me—just like this. He protected me and kept me safe. I listened to his heart beating and I almost allowed myself to hug him back. Stilettos clicked against the floor when Ashley fidgeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbelievable pain stung my heart and I pushed him away. “You chose her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father held a hand out to me, his mouth hanging open. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You chose Ashley. She weaseled her way into our home and she tore our family apart. You chose her over us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Echo, no. It wasn’t like that.” Ashley’s plea was pathetic and fake. “I loved you and then I fell in love with your dad. Your parents’ marriage was over way before the divorce.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy foot tapped the floor. Liar. She was a liar. “Yes, because of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going home. This is a family matter.” My father reached for his jacket and Ashley stood. “Mrs. Collins, I appreciate the state’s willingness to place Echo in your program, but I believe it’s best if my family seeks private counseling someplace else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI panicked. In the parking lot, Noah was waiting for his turn to set our plan into motion. So far, I’d failed miserably. My father needed to stay until I accomplished my goal. In theory, I had one ally in this room. “Mrs. Collins?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a nod. “Mr. and Mrs. Emerson, with all due respect this is exactly the kind of matter that should be discussed here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father held out Ashley’s coat for her. “I’m capable of deciding what’s appropriate for my family. My divorce from my ex-wife and my marriage to Ashley have nothing to do with Echo’s memory loss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I beg to differ. They’re issues Echo needs to deal with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God. They were going to leave and I’d never learn what happened to me. I had to say something to keep them in the room. “I like her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three adults froze. “That’s why I brought you here.” I focused on the words I’d practiced since Noah and I had come up with the plan. “I wanted to tell you that I like the job Mrs. Collins found for me and that I’m done lying to her. I’m not fine and I’m not happy at home. I like her and I want to keep seeing her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd oddly enough, I didn’t blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Collins’s lips turned up, the exact reaction I hoped for. In order for Noah’s plan to work, she needed to think I trusted her. Now, if I could build a time machine, go back to twenty minutes ago, and stop myself from telling my father how I really felt, my plan would be back on track. Telling Ashley off felt good, but that only disappointed my father. I sighed. In an effort to make this up to him, I’d be the only college freshman still attempting a perfect ACT score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Daddy. I was out of line.” Ugh. I’d rather eat cockroaches than say this. “And you, too, Ashley. My comments to you were rude.” But true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father nodded and finished helping Ashley into her coat. “I don’t blame you, Echo.” He stared at Mrs. Collins, making it perfectly clear who he blamed for my outburst. “If you want to keep seeing Mrs. Collins then I’ll let you. On a trial basis only. That means these next few sessions will be scrutinized.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley rubbed her baby bump. “I’m glad you’re making progress, Echo. It was a wonderful day when you got that ribbon. It was the first time I ever felt like the three of us were a real family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why wasn’t my mom there?” Silence. Ashley’s hand froze mid-rub and my father stood motionless. I continued, “You said three. Mom would have never let you squeeze her out of that moment. She loved my paintings. She encouraged me more than the two of you combined.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black hole pulsed in my head and a faint memory squeezed out. “I invited her to the ceremony and she accepted.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pushing-the-limits-pushing-the-limits-1/page-11.html","bookId":2752,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:34 PM"}
