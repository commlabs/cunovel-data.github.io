We’re able to design all the eco features you’ve asked for. However…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChet and Remy exchanged a look, then Chet said, “It’ll be very labor intensive, which we all knew going into this project. So we updated materials costs and reworked our original estimate…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her breath because this wouldn’t be good news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The cost has gone up twenty percent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We refigured it a couple different ways,” Remy said, almost apologetically, “but the price didn’t change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to her miserly ways, she could afford to pay additional costs, but she was kicking herself for putting this off. “Thank you guys. The cost of everything has gone up.” She offered a wan smile. “Not happy, but not surprised. So that’s the worst of it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChet leaned forward. “Nope. With the building site location, and the time of year, and what’s already on our plate, there’s no way we can get to the project until next spring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that doesn’t have anything to do with us takin’ on Gavin’s garage,” Remy added. “Colby and Channing hafta wait for spring for the addition on their house too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should’ve set a firm date for the start date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, we don’t blame ya for waiting. You were already taking care of a house, even if technically it wasn’t yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you tell Gavin about my building delay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope. It’s between us, Ree, you have our word,” Chet said. “And no matter what you decide, whether or not to proceed in the spring, and why or why not, it’ll stay strictly between us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sharp gaze moved between the brothers. “Why would you think I’d back out?” She bristled. “I assure you, I may have had some rough times in the past, but I do have the money now—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa, there, that wasn’t what I was insinuating at all.” Chet blushed and looked at Remy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re insinuating something…worse?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s just back up,” Remy said. “One of Gavin’s main stipulations for hiring us was to keep this project in line with your original plans for the B\u0026amp;B outbuildings you didn’t get to implement due to your financial situation at the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gavin respects you. It’s there every time your name comes up,” Chet assured her. “And we’re to defer all the dirt work changes and landscaping to you. You have total control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our whole point is…even before we talked to Gavin, we believed you’d be better off waiting until after calving season to break ground. A lot of things could change between now and then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of things could change?” she asked Remy suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy gave an embarrassed laugh. “Now, Rielle, darlin’, don’t take this the wrong way. You are a damn attractive woman, but you don’t date. We know you’ve said no to all guys who’ve asked you out, not just us. Now you’re living with a man who saved your bacon a few years back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think I’m interested in Gavin because he’s rich?” Goddammit. Was that what everyone in the area would think? She’d assured Gavin it wouldn’t bother her…but faced with assumptions, she wasn’t so sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Chet and Remy burst out laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but the man sure is interested in you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at them blankly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy nudged Chet. “Told ya she hadn’t even freakin’ noticed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had noticed how Gavin acted around her—she’d have to be blind not to see how he looked at her sometimes, stupid not to recognize the familiar way he touched her and a complete idiot to pretend to be unaffected by his attention. It just surprised her that Chet and Remy West had picked up on the undercurrent so quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr had Gavin said something to them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Gavin wasn’t like that. But as far as she was concerned, that topic was off limits. “The only thing I’m interested in is you guys taking some of these tomatoes off my hands. You can swing by your mama’s house and earn major brownie points.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’d be great. You’re a doll,” Remy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And just for that, I’ll send a loaf of bread home with you guys too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChet groaned. “Man, I love your homemade bread. Don’t suppose you’ve got any extra honey lying around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus, Chet,” Remy said and smacked him in the back of the head. “Don’t be such a fuckin’ mooch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not a mooch, asshole. I was gonna buy it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy dodged Chet’s retaliatory swat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boys. There’s enough to go around. Let’s head up to the house.” She purposely didn’t say my house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin didn’t appear until Chet and Remy were gone. He leaned against the porch support. “I see you take pity on poor bachelors and send them home with food.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn’t shaken off the disappointing news yet. “The bachelors I like, yes. Why? You jealous?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little.” Gavin started down the steps. “But since you feed me on occasion, I get the better deal, since I’m living with you and all. That seemed to interest them more than it should have.” He stopped in front of her. “Is everything all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man had no concept of personal space. She considered saying something flip, but a soft, “No,” slipped out and she dropped her gaze to the empty basket still clutched in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the basket from her. When she looked up, he curled his hands around her arms, moving closer yet. “Rielle. What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“West Construction can’t start on my house until next spring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because of the garage addition? Dammit, I told them I could wait if it would affect—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it has nothing to do with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA calculating look entered his eyes. “If you need—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning fast Rielle placed her fingers over his lips. “Don’t you assume anything and offer me money or I swear to God I will scream or…do something equally horrible to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips curled into a smile and he lightly nipped her fingers before she pulled her hand away. “I like it when you get feisty. But if money isn’t the issue, what is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time. If they can’t get started until spring, then that means I’ll have to move into the cabin because I’m sure you don’t want me living with you and Sierra indefinitely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe immediate fierceness in his eyes made it hard to breathe. “Now who’s making assumptions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t any sign of mild-mannered Gavin. In fact, she’d begun to wonder if that easy-going man had just been a figment of her imagination—a pencil-pushing pushover she’d never be attracted to, therefore she could keep him at arm’s length. But this Gavin? No pushover. All man. All the time. And her attraction to him kept getting stronger every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen to me. You are not staying in that cabin unless living with me is so heinous that you want to kill me in my sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not, I mean, you’re not,” she assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. So we’ll stick to the original plan. Because I think it’s been working great.” He grinned. “So, pity a poor bachelor. What’s for lunch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle growled and smacked him playfully with the basket. “You’re such a mooch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she made him lunch anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin strolled into the kitchen and poured himself a glass of iced tea. Then he peered over Rielle’s shoulder, waiting for her to acknowledge him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past few weeks he’d gone out of his way to pester her—not that she considered the attention of a smart, funny, sexy man a chore. Gavin was interested in everything she did workwise and asked a million questions. So Rielle returned the favor whenever possible. Showing up in his office to chat. Since the man lived on the phone, she got to hear him acting all professional and business tycoon-y. But he hadn’t complained about her impromptu interruptions either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’re you doing?” he finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood so close the deep timbre of his voice vibrated against her skin and she fought a shiver. “Updating my notes on the new vegetable varieties I planted this year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bad year for squash?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which one? There are four genuses of squash: C maxima, C mixta, C moschata and C pepo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what I get for trying to be funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Squash is no laughing matter. So what’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you ever done something under…duress and wished you hadn’t?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was random. But typical for Gavin. She kept typing. “Like telling a stranger she can live in your house until spring?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Funny, Ree. But I’m serious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. What did you say under duress? And who’d you say it to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sierra. And I kinda, sorta, maybe promised…to buy her a car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRielle looked up from her laptop. “Are you kidding me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re telling me this…why? Because you want the parent-to-parent lecture on not rewarding your child’s bad behavior? The girl gets herself arrested and you’re buying her a car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” Gavin distractedly scrubbed his hands over the razor stubble on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squinted at him. He always bounded down in the morning dressed and clean shaven. It was afternoon and he looked like a bum—a hot bum, but nowhere near his usual put together self. “Gavin. Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” He sighed. “This whole buying her a car business might seem sudden, but I had planned on buying her one in Arizona, I just hadn’t told her. Then all that shit happened with her arrest. So as we’re driving across country, I’m encouraging her to talk to me, and she broke down completely. Crying about her mom leaving and how abandoned she felt, how stupid she felt that her new friends avoided her and her old friends dumped her, and berating herself for letting her grades drop. We were finally really talking about that long overdue emotional stuff…and it just slipped out.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-country-rough-riders-14/page-8.html","bookId":2695,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:57 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:57 AM"}
