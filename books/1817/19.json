There has to be something in there that you’ll eat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took out the bagels and the muffins first. Then she pulled out the Styrofoam containers that had the quiche slices in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like everything in here. You did good, Black.” She opened a drawer and pulled out paper plates and plastic silverware. “I only have paper and plastic. I hope that’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s fine. So, I take it you’re moving,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t imagine what gave you that idea.” She winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh man, she was getting me hard and this needed to stop. “You said last night that you would give anything to have your parents walk in. Are your parents no longer around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What gives you the right to ask that? I barely know you and you have no right!” she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand up. “Whoa, Amelia. I’m sorry. You told me to come over and we could sit and talk. Listen, you obviously changed your mind, so I’m just going to go and you can go about your business. I’m sorry that I was just trying to get to know you a little better,” I said as I got up from my chair and walked to the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait. Collin, I’m sorry. You don’t understand. Please stay,” she said as she walked up behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took in a deep breath. There was a desperation in her voice when she asked me to stay. I turned around and looked into her sad blue eyes. I desperately wanted to grab her and hold her tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh,” she said as she clasped her head. “My parents owned this house. They were killed two years ago in a boating accident.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amelia,” I whispered as I walked closer to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hands up and stopped me. “Don’t. I don’t want your pity,” she said as she walked back to the table and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m really sorry. I had no idea. I’m sorry,” I said as I shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit down and finish your coffee and breakfast. I’m sorry for being so rude. I don’t like to talk about it and I’ve closed myself off since the accident. I gave up my friends and I pretty much stay secluded in my apartment, except when I go to classes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back down and grabbed a bagel. “Classes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I attend NYU and I live in an apartment on campus. I’m going into my last year and it’s been really hard for me to focus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone buzzed in my pocket. “Excuse me,” I said as I pulled it out and saw a text message from Julia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t you tell me about this lovely girl you met?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven’t had a chance yet. We just met. Let me guess, Dad told you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, and he said you seemed to really like her. I’m so happy for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t get too excited yet. I’ll talk to you later. I’m with her now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, sorry. I can’t wait to hear all about her. Love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Love you too, sis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, that was my sister, Julia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it’s okay. Never apologize for taking a moment to talk with your family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I took a bite of the bagel that I was holding in my hand, I contemplated what to say to her next. “Listen, Amelia, I’m going to be totally honest with you. I don’t know what to say because I don’t want to upset you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me and gently put her hand on my arm. “I’m sorry that I make you feel that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer touch sent chills throughout my body. It was the way her soft fingers touched my skin. I found myself staring at her lips. I pictured myself kissing her and I wondered what it would be like. The one rule I always followed was the no kissing rule. The women I slept with never touched my lips. To me, kissing was special and passionate and it wasn’t to be shared with just anyone. I’d watched my mom and dad kiss a million times growing up and it was always full of passion. It symbolized their love for one another. Hailey was the only girl I’d ever kissed, and ever since we broke up, my lips hadn’t touched another woman’s. But as I sat there and stared at Amelia, I felt this overwhelming urge to kiss her. I wanted to feel how soft her lips felt against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snapped out of my daydream and smiled. “Yeah, I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were just staring at me. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. She noticed and I had to come up with something fast. “I’m just trying to figure you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I don’t want to be figured out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you do,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re very forward, Mr. Black.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re very closed off, Miss Gray.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I gave up on life after the accident. Everyone and everything that I ever loved was taken from me. Not only my parents, but my sister and my boyfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down because I didn’t want her to see the hurt that I felt for her in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the point of moving on when you’re alone and you have nobody to share anything with? Like I said, I gave up all my friends. Or should I say, they gave up on me. They could only take so much of my constant crying and refusal to leave my apartment before they left me. I don’t blame them, though. I’m not a good person to be around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t stand it anymore. I needed to touch her, and I needed to comfort her. I reached across the table and grabbed her hand. Her eyes widened as she looked at me, but she didn’t pull back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are a good person, and I won’t sit here and let you wallow in self-pity. Come on, I’m taking you somewhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Collin, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Amelia,” I said as I pulled her from the table. “You said you’re leaving tomorrow. We have all day today and you’re going to have fun with me, whether you like it or not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m not. You’re being bossy and I don’t like it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you are, and you’re being stubborn and I don’t like it!” I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood there for a moment and stared at me. “I have too much to do,” she said in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promise to help you with everything once we get back.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. Let me go get my purse and then we can leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Amelia. You might want to change into more casual clothes. A dress isn’t appropriate for what I’m planning.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-19.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
