In a rage he stormed out of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hot head had forced the outcome and he needed some time to cool down. Liam didn\u0027t believe Bale would physically harm Allison, but in Bale\u0027s present state of mind, Liam worried the other agent would want to interrogate her in his own personal style and no doubt scare the hell out of her. Liam wasn\u0027t about to let that happen. Phillips assured him Bale would be calm and sensible by morning. Until then, no one was going to get near her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drive,\" he said, stepping out into the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison draped her coat over her arm and followed. \"Okay, then,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed the most natural thing in the world for her hand to be in his, but once they reached the car, her self-conscious insecurities took over and she quickly let go. She told him whom the party was for and asked if he needed directions to the Hamilton Hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"I know where it is. I\u0027m staying there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpressed, she commented, \"It\u0027s very elegant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is.\" He didn\u0027t add the fact that Alec\u0027s wife and her brothers owned the Hamilton Hotels and that they had insisted that Liam stay there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the car, Liam went over some of the points he didn\u0027t like in Phillips\u0027s contract, and although she tried, Allison found it impossible to pay attention. Her mind kept wandering off in another direction, to fantasies of a more carnal nature. She couldn\u0027t stop herself from picturing him naked-she decided she wouldn\u0027t be normal if she didn\u0027t-and what a glorious memory that was. She remembered touching him and trailing her fingertips across his broad shoulders. She sighed inside, just thinking of his hard-as-steel muscles below his warm skin. She had to admit to herself that she loved touching him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was thankful he hadn\u0027t mentioned the fact that they had had sex the night before. When he\u0027d shown up at her door, she was shocked and nearly speechless. She was also . . . joyful. A silly word, she decided, but it exactly defined how she felt. She had thought she wouldn\u0027t see him again for months or maybe not ever because her work for him was done, and he traveled all over the world putting out fires. She had almost convinced herself that she was fine with that. Lots of people shared a night of passion and then moved on without complications. She could be one of those people. She was sure of it. Or was she? She didn\u0027t seem to know her own mind anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis question jarred her. \"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExasperated, he said, \"The contract. Haven\u0027t you heard a word I\u0027ve said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw no reason to bluff her way through. \"No, I haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over at her, saw her smile, and shook his head. \"I\u0027m trying to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then maybe you want to pay attention?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled up to the valet in the circle drive and put the car in park. Two attendants hurried forward to open their doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping into the hotel was like entering another world, one that was stately and yet chic. Similar to the other Hamilton Hotels, the design blended old-world charm with contemporary touches here and there. The marble floors gleamed, and a stunning staircase with a mahogany banister curved up like a grand ribbon to the mezzanine overlooking the lobby. Vases filled with fresh flowers were on every table. All of the Hamilton Hotels were renowned for their sophistication. What separated this hotel from the others was the original artwork depicting scenes from Boston\u0027s colorful history on each wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounding a bit awkward and out of place, Allison whispered as though she were in a church, \"It\u0027s beautiful, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is,\" he agreed. \"Haven\u0027t you been here before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes and no,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had stopped just inside the entrance. Allison turned to him and tried to explain. \"Yes, I have been here before, just once a couple of years ago, but I was working then, and when I work I sort of . . . disappear. The photo shoot was in one of the gardens. As soon as the chaos starts-you know, the different gowns and the makeup and hair-I turn into a mannequin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"A mannequin? You\u0027d never pass for a mannequin. Too many curves,\" he explained as he took her arm and crossed the lobby. \"What does \u0026amp;lsquo;sort of disappear\u0027 mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I zone out and work problems, write code.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s like daydreaming, and people do that all the time, so stop looking at me like I\u0027m crazy. Don\u0027t you ever daydream?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-61.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
