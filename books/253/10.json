{"id":7675,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 2 Firing Energy","content":"This is one of the most powerful exercises we do in myseminars, but even without supervision you can turn itinto a force to be reckoned with!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You\u0027ll need a partner to work with. Stand about eightfeet apart, facing each other like two gunfighters in acowboy movie. As you say \"Hi!\" clap your hands togetherand slide your right hand off and past the other in thedirection of your partner. Gather up all the energy youcan throughout your body and store it in your heart, thenclap the energy on through your right hand (the one youuse in a handshake) straight into the other person\u0027sheart. This is a long explanation for something that takesno more than two seconds, but when all six channels—body, heart, eyes, smile, clap and voice/breath—are firedat the person in a rapid flash there is a vast transferof energy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Immediately after receiving the energy, your partnershould fire it back at you in the same way. Taking turns,continue fast and focused, firing at each other. Be sure tomake contact with all six channels at once. Practice on eachother for two minutes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now the real fun begins. You\u0027re going to start firingdifferent qualities of energy: logic/head energy, com- -\u0026gt;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 17munication/throat energy, love/heart energy, power/solarplexus energy and sexual energy. You\u0027ve already firedlove/heart energy. Now do the same head to head instead ofheart to heart. Keep firing head/logic energy at each otheruntil you both agree that you can feel and differentiate itfrom love/heart energy. After two or three minutes back andforth, try the other regions: throat to throat, solar plexus tosolar plexus, etc.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It gets even better. Figure out which kind of energy youwant to send, but don\u0027t say what it is. Now greet your partner,shake hands, say \"Hi\" and fire! Your partner must identifythe kind of energy he or she is receiving. Take turns.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Practice and practice until your body language becomes subtleand almost imperceptible.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Next, go out and try it on the people you meet. Fireenergy when you say \"Hi\" to someone in a supermarket,to your waiter in the cafe, to your sister-in-law or theguy who fixes the photocopier in your office. They willnotice something special about you—some might call it\"star quality.\"that same special energy that usually accompanies thefull-blown shake.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Incidentally, the \"hands-free\" handshake works wondersin presentations when you want to establish rapportwith a group or audience.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/934/28306.html","bookId":253,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:54:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:54:35 AM"}
