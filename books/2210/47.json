What was it like?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant bass drum beaten slowly in the street of my childhood village as the Italian players announced the little drama to be performed from the back of their painted wagon. The great bass drum that I myself had pounded through the street of the town during those precious days when I, the runaway boy, had been one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was stronger than that. The booming of a cannon echoing through valleys and mountain passes? I felt it in my bones. I opened my eyes in the dark, and I knew it was drawing nearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rhythm of steps, it had, or was it the rhythm of a heart beating? The world was filled with the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a great ominous din that drew closer and closer. And yet some part of me knew there was no real sound, nothing a mortal ear could hear, nothing that rattled the china on its shelf or the glass windows. Or made the cats streak to the top of the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgypt lies in silence. Silence covers the desert on both sides of the mighty river. There is not even the bleat of sheep or the lowing of cattle. Or a woman crying somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it was deafening, this sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one second I was afraid. I stretched in the earth. I forced my fingers up towards the surface. Sightless, weightless, I was floating in the soil, and I couldn\u0027t breathe suddenly, I couldn\u0027t scream, and it seemed that if I could have screamed, I would have cried out so loud all the glass for miles about me would have been shattered. Crystal goblets would have been blown to bits, windows exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound was louder, nearer. I tried to roll over and to gain the air but I couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it seemed then I saw the thing, the figure approaching. A glimmer of red in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was someone coming, this sound, some creature so powerful that even in the silence the trees and the flowers and the air itself did feel it. The dumb creatures of the earth did know. The vermin ran from it, the felines darting out of its path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this is death, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe by some sublime miracle it is alive, Death, and it takes us into its arms, and it is no vampire, this thing, it is the very personification of the heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we rise up and up into the stars with it. We go past the angels and the saints, past illumination itself and into the divine darkness, into the void, as we pass out of existence. In oblivion we are forgiven all things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe destruction of Nicki becomes a tiny pinpoint of vanishing light. The death of my brothers disintegrates into the great peace of the inevitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed at the soil. I kicked at it, but my hands and legs were too weak. I tasted the sandy mud in my mouth. I knew I had to rise, and the sound was telling me to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt it again like the roar of artillery: the cannon boom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd quite completely I understood that it was looking for me, this sound, it was seeking me out. It was searching like a beam of light. I couldn\u0027t lie here anymore. I had to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sent it the wildest current of welcome. I told it I was here, and I heard my own miserable breaths as I struggled to move my lips. And the sound grew so loud that it was pulsing through every fiber of me. The earth was moving with it around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever it was, it had come into the burnt-out ruined house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door had been broken away, as if the hinges had been anchored not in iron but in plaster. I saw all this against the backdrop of my closed eyes. I saw it moving under the olive trees. It was in the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a frenzy again I clawed towards the air. But the low, common noise I heard now was of a digging through the sand from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt something soft like velvet brush my face. And I saw overhead the gleam of the dark sky and the drift of the clouds like a veil over the stars, and never had the heavens in all their simplicity looked so blessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lungs filled with air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a loud moan at the pleasure of it. But all these sensations were beyond pleasure. To breathe, to see light, these were miracles. And the drumming sound, the great deafening boom seemed the perfect accompaniment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he, the one who had been looking for me, the one from whom the sound came, was standing over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound melted; it disintegrated until it was no more than the aftersound of a violin string. And I was rising, just as if I were being lifted, up out of the earth, though this figure stood with its hands at its side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, it lifted its arms to enfold me and the face I saw was beyond the realm of possibility. What one of us could have such a face? What did we know of patience, of seeming goodness, of compassion? No, it wasn\u0027t one of us. It couldn\u0027t have been. And yet it was. Preternatural flesh and blood like mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIridescent eyes, gathering the light from all directions, tiny eyelashes like strokes of gold from the finest pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this creature, this powerful vampire, was holding me upright and looking into my eyes, and I believe that I said some mad thing, voiced some frantic thought, that I knew now the secret of eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then tell it to me,\" he whispered, and he smiled. The purest image of human love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O God, help me. Damn me to the pit of hell.\" This was my voice speaking. I can\u0027t look on this beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw my arms like bones, hands like birds\u0027 talons. Nothing can live and be what I am now, this wraith. I looked down at my legs. They were sticks. The clothing was falling off me. I couldn\u0027t stand or move, and the remembered sensation of blood flowing in my mouth suddenly overcame me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a dull blaze before me I saw his red velvet clothes, the cloak that covered him to the ground, the dark red gloved hands with which he held me. His hair was thick, white and gold strands mingled in waves fallen loosely around his face, and over his broad forehead. And the blue eyes might have been brooding under their heavy golden brows had they not been so large, so softened with the feeling expressed in the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man in the prime of life at the moment of the immortal gift. And the square face, with its slightly hollowed cheeks, its long full mouth, stamped with terrifying gentleness and peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink,\" he said, eyebrows rising slightly, lips shaping the word carefully, slowly, as if it were a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Magnus had done on that lethal night so many eons ago, he raised his hand now and moved the cloth back from his throat. The vein, dark purple beneath the translucent preternatural skin, offered itself. And the sound commenced again, that overpowering sound, and it lifted me right off the earth and drew me into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood like light itself, liquid fire. Our blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd my arms gathering incalculable strength, winding round his shoulders, my face pressed to his cool white flesh, the blood shooting down into my loins and every vessel in my body ignited with it. How many centuries had purified this blood, distilled its power?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed beneath the roar of the flow he spoke. He said again:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink, my young one, my wounded one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt his heart swell, his body undulate, and we were sealed against each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I heard myself say:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he answered:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-lestat-the-vampire-chronicles-2/page-47.html","bookId":2210,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM"}
