I knew where it was all going to happen. Coincidences aren\u0027t coincidences when they\u0027re controlled by higher magicians. The absurd \u0027box on stilts\u0027, the matchbox standing on its end – that was where Zabulon had lost the battle for Svetlana, that was where Gesar had unmasked the Light Magician he\u0027d assigned to the Inquisition, teaching Svetlana a lesson in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe focus of power for the whole complex manoeuvre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the third time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t feel like eating or drinking, but I stopped once, bought a coffee and drank it. It was tasteless, as if all the caffeine had been filtered out of it. People started making way for me, even though I was walking in the ordinary world. The magical tension was rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way I could conceal my approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t want to creep up on them anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pregnant woman was walking cautiously along the pavement. I shuddered when I saw she was smiling. And I almost turned away when I realised her unborn child was smiling too in its own safe little world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir power was like pale pink peonies – a large blossom and a round bud that hadn\u0027t unfolded yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to gather what I found along my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation or pity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something happening in the world around me too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heat seemed to have got stronger. In a single desperate surge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark and the Light Magicians must have had good reason to spend all those days trying to disperse the heat. Something was going to happen. I stopped and looked up at the sky through the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubtle, twisted coils of swirling air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparks on the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFading light in the south-east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glowing nimbus round the needle of the Ostankino TV Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was going to be a strange night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touched a little girl running by and took the naïve joy she felt because her father had come home sober. Like snapping off a briar branch, prickly and fragile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgive me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost eleven o\u0027clock when I reached the \u0027box on stilts\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last person I touched was a drunken factory worker, slumped against the wall in the alley. The same alley where I\u0027d killed a Dark One for the first time. He was barely even conscious. But happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took his power too. A dusty, trampled stem of coarse plantain, a crude, dirty-brown candle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was power too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I crossed the road, I realised I wasn\u0027t alone. I summoned my shadow and withdrew into the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building was cordoned off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the oddest cordon I\u0027d ever seen. Dark Ones and Light Ones all together. I spotted Semyon and nodded to him. He gave me a calm, slightly reproachful look. Tiger Cub, Bear, Ilya, Ignat . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen had they summoned them all? While I was wandering round the city, gathering power? Sorry about that holiday, guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Dark Ones. Even Alisa was there. The witch was a terrible sight: her face looked like a paper mask that had been crumpled and straightened out again. It looked as if Zabulon hadn\u0027t been lying when he told me she\u0027d be punished. Alisher was standing beside Alisa, and when I caught his eye, I could tell the two of them would fight. Maybe not now. But some day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped through the ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This is a restricted zone,\u0027 said Alisher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This is a restricted zone,\u0027 echoed Alisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I have a right to enter.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had enough power in me to enter without permission. Only the Great Magicians could stop me now, but they weren\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t try to stop me. Someone, either Gesar or Zabulon, or maybe both, must have ordered them just to warn me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good luck,\u0027 I heard someone whisper behind me. I swung round and caught Tiger Cub\u0027s eye. I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entrance hall was empty. And the house had gone quiet, like the time when the immense Inferno vortex was spinning over Svetlana\u0027s head: the Evil that she had summoned against herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked on through the grey gloom. The floor echoed hollowly under my feet. In the Twilight world even the ground responded to magic, even the shades of human buildings did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trapdoor to the roof was open. Nobody was trying to put any obstacles in my way. The trouble was I didn\u0027t know if I ought to be pleased about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI emerged from the Twilight. I couldn\u0027t see any point in it. Not now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started climbing the ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first person I saw was Maxim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked quite different from the way he had before, the spontaneous Light Magician, the Maverick who had killed adepts of the Dark for years. Maybe they\u0027d done something to him. Or maybe he\u0027d just changed. There are some people who make ideal executioners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaxim had been lucky. He\u0027d become an executioner. An Inquisitor. Standing over and above the Light and the Dark, serving everybody – and nobody. He had his arms crossed on his chest and his head slightly lowered. Something about him reminded me of Zabulon, the first time I\u0027d seen him. And something reminded me of Gesar too. When I appeared, Maxim raised his head slightly and cast a casual glance at me. Then he lowered his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I really was allowed in on the whole show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabulon was standing to one side, wrapped in a pale raincoat. He took no notice of my arrival. He\u0027d known I\u0027d be there anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesar, Svetlana and Egor were standing together. They gave me a much livelier reception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So you came after all?\u0027 the boss asked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and looked at Svetlana. She was wearing a long white dress and her hair was loose. She had a small, glittering box made of white morocco leather in her hand. It looked as if it was meant for a brooch or a medallion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anton, so you know then?\u0027 Egor shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anybody there was happy, he was. Perfectly happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, I know,\u0027 I answered. I walked up to him and ruffled his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis power was like a yellow dandelion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I felt like I\u0027d collected all I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Full up?\u0027 asked Gesar. \u0027Anton, what are you planning to do?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. Something was bothering me. There was something wrong here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was it! Why wasn\u0027t Olga there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad the final briefing already been given? Did Svetlana already know what she had to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A piece of chalk,\u0027 I said. \u0027A little piece of chalk, pointed at both ends. You can use it to write on anything. In a Book of Destiny, for instance. Cross out old lines, write in new ones.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anton, you\u0027re not going to tell anyone here anything they don\u0027t already know,\u0027 the boss said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Has permission been given?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesar looked at Maxim. As if he could feel the glance, the Inquisitor raised his head and said in a hollow voice:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Permission has been given.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Day Watch wishes to object,\u0027 Zabulon said in a dull voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Denied,\u0027 Maxim replied indifferently and lowered his head back on to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If a Great Sorceress picks up the chalk,\u0027 I said, \u0027every line in the Book of Destiny will take a particle of her soul. And return it to her, changed. You can only change a person\u0027s destiny by giving away your own soul.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know,\u0027 said Sveta. She smiled. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Anton. I think this is the right thing to do. It will be good for everyone.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief glint of concern in Egor\u0027s eyes. He\u0027d sensed something was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anton, you\u0027re a warrior of the Watch,\u0027 said Gesar. \u0027If you have objections, you may speak.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObjections? To what? To Egor becoming a Light Magician instead of a Dark one? To an attempt, even if it was bound to fail, to bring Good to humans? To Svetlana becoming a Great Sorceress?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven at the cost of sacrificing everything human she still had inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s nothing I wish to say,\u0027 I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I imagine it, or was there a flash of surprise in Gesar\u0027s eyes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to tell what the Great Magician was really thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Let\u0027s begin,\u0027 he said. \u0027Svetlana, you know what you have to do.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I do,\u0027 she said, looking at me. I moved a few steps away from her. So did Gesar. Now there were just the two of them standing together – Svetlana and Egor. Both equally anxious. Equally tense. I looked across at Zabulon – he was waiting. Svetlana opened the little box – the click of the catch sounded like a gunshot – and slowly took out the piece of chalk, almost as if she didn\u0027t want to. It was tiny. Had it really been worn down so much by the Light\u0027s attempts to alter the destiny of the world over the millennia?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesar sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana squatted down and began drawing a circle around herself and the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had nothing to say. I didn\u0027t know what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d collected so much power that it was bursting out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the right to do Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was just one little thing missing – I didn\u0027t understand exactly how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind stirred. Timidly, cautiously. Then it faded away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up and shuddered. Something was happening. Here, in the human world, the sky was covered with clouds. I hadn\u0027t even noticed them appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana finished drawing the circle and stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried glancing at her through the Twilight and immediately turned away. She seemed to be holding a red-hot coal in her hand. Was she feeling any pain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s a storm approaching,\u0027 Zabulon said from one side. \u0027A real storm, the kind we haven\u0027t had for a long time now.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody paid any attention. Except perhaps the wind – it started blowing more evenly, growing stronger. I looked down at the street – everything was calm. Svetlana was tracing the chalk through the air as if she was drawing something only she could see. A square outline with some design inside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgor gave a quiet groan and threw his head back. I took half a step forward and stopped. I couldn\u0027t get across the barrier. And there was no point anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you don\u0027t know what to do, don\u0027t trust anything. Not your cool head, not your pure heart, not your hot hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anton!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the boss. Gesar seemed worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s not just a storm, Anton. It\u0027s a hurricane. People will be killed.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Dark Ones?\u0027 I asked simply. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-69.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
