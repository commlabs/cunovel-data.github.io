But those people beyond the compound wall were not friends and relatives of the scores of scholars, intellectuals and artists still locked up in the cells below. They didn’t care a whit about the prisoners and would be just as happy to see them all burn along with the main block. So there was no noble cause to all of this. It was, he now understood, nothing but bloodlust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it any wonder we were needed? To control them. To control their baser instincts. Now look what has happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood near the front door, watching the pike-wielding agents patrolling the filthy compound. A number of times, in fact, they’d heard shouted demands for Tehol Beddict. The mob wanted him for themselves. They wanted to tear him to pieces. The Grand Drowning at dusk on the morrow was not enough to appease their savage need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there would be no releasing Tehol Beddict. Not as long as Karos Invictad remained in charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, if we gave him up, they might all calm down and go away. And we could begin again. Yes. Were I in charge, they could have Tehol Beddict, with my blessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not]anath. Oh no, she is mine. For ever now. He had been shocked to discover that she had few memories of her previous incarceration, but he had taken great pleasure in re-educating her. Ha, re-educating the teacher. I like that one. At least Karos Invictad had been generous there, giving her to him. And now she resided in a private cell, chained to a bed, and he made use of her day and night. Even when the crowds raged against the walls and agents were dying keeping them out, he would lie atop her and have his way. And she’d fast learned to say all the right things, how to beg for more, whispering her undying desire (no, he would not force her to speak of love, because that word was dead now between them. For ever dead) until those words of desire became real for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attention. The end to loneliness. She had even cried out the last time, cried out his name as her back arched and her limbs thrashed against the manacles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCried out for him: Tanal Yathvanar, who even as a child had known he was destined for greatness-for was that not what they all told him, over and over again? Yes, he had found his perfect world, at last. And what had happened? The whole damned city had collapsed, threatening all he now possessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll because of Karos Invictad. Because he refused to hand over Tehol Beddict and spent all his waking time staring into a small wooden box at a two-headed insect that had-hah-outwitted him in its dim, obstinate stupidity. There is a truth hidden in that, isn’t there! I’m certain of it. Karos and his two-headed insect, going round and round and round and so it will go until it dies. And when it does, the great Invigilator will go mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he now suspected he would not be able to wait for that. The mob was too hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the walls there was quiet, for the moment, but something vast and thousand-headed was seething on the other side of Creeper Canal, and would soon cross over from Far Reaches and make its way down to North Tiers. He could hear its heavy susurration, a tide in the darkness pouring down streets, gushing into and out of alleys, spreading bloody and black into avenues and lanes. He could smell its hunger in the bitter smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it comes for us, and it will not wait. Not even for Karos Invictad, the Invigilator of the Patriotists, the wealthiest man in all the empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe allowed himself a soft laugh, then he turned about and entered the main block. Down the dusty corridor, walking unmindful over crusted streaks left behind when the wounded and dying had been dragged inside. The smell of stale sweat, spilled urine and faeces-as bad as the cells below-and yes, are we not prisoners now, too? With bare scraps for food and well water fouled with ashes and blood. Trapped here with a death sentence hanging round our necks with the weight of ten thousand docks, and nothing but deep water on all sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thought to amuse him; another thought to record in his private books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp the stairs now, his boots echoing on the cut limestone, and into the corridor leading to the Invigilator’s office, Karos Invictad’s sanctum. His own private cell. No guards in the passage-Karos no longer trusted them. In fact, he no longer trusted anyone. Except me. And that will prove his greatest error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the door he pushed it open without knocking and stepped inside, then halted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room stank, and its source was sprawled in the chair opposite the Invigilator and his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol Beddict. Smeared in filth, cut and scabbed and bruised-Karos Invictad’s prohibition against such treatment was over, it seemed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-433.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
