If he had simply been a brilliant professor and an expert on the ideas of other philosophers, he would never have carved a place for himself in the history of philosophy.

But--and here Kant stretches his hand out to the rationalists--in our reason there are also decisive factors that determine how we perceive the world around us. In other words, there are certain conditions in the human mind that are contributive to our conception of the world.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You call that an example?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let us rather do a little experiment.

In other words, we can know before we experience things that we will perceive them as phenomena in time and space. For we are not able to take off the \u0027glasses\u0027 of reason.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So he thought that perceiving things in time and space was innate?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, in a way.

In the same way our perceptions adapt themselves to our \u0027forms of intuition.\u0027 \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think I understand what you mean.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Kant claimed that it is not only mind which conforms to things.

The other is the internal conditions in man himself--such as the perception of events as happening in time and space and as processes conforming to an unbreakable law of causality.

Neither.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Further, many philosophers named freedom as one of man\u0027s most important values. At the same time we saw philosophers like the Stoics, for example, and Spinoza, who said that everything happens through the necessity of natural law. This was another case of human reason being unable to make a certain judgment, according to Kant.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Both views are equally reasonable and unreasonable.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Finally, we are bound to fail if we attempt to prove the existence of God with the aid of reason. Here the rationalists, like Descartes, had tried to prove that there must be a God simply because we have the idea of a \u0027supreme being.\u0027 Others, like Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, decided that there must be a God because every-thing must have a first cause.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What did Kant think?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He rejected both these proofs of the existence of God. Neither reason nor experience is any certain basis for claiming the existence of God. As far as reason goes, it is just as likely as it is unlikely that God exists.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you started by saying that Kant wanted to preserve the basis for Christian faith.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, he opened up a religious dimension. There, where both reason and experience fall short, there occurs a vacuum that can be filled by faith.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s how he saved Christianity?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\"If you will. Now, it might be worth noting that Kant was a Protestant. Since the days of the Reformation, Protestantism has been characterized by its emphasis on faith. The Catholic Church, on the other hand, has since the early Middle Ages believed more in reason as a pillar of faith.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But Kant went further than simply to establish that these weighty questions should be left to the faith of the individual. He believed that it is essential for morality to presuppose that man has an immortal soul, that God exists, and that man has a free will.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So he does the same as Descartes. First he is very critical of everything we can understand. And then he smuggles God in by the back door.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But unlike Descartes, he emphasizes most particularly that it is not reason which brought him to this point but faith. He himself called faith in the immortal soul, in God\u0027s existence, and in man\u0027s free will practical postulates.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Which means?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To \u0027postulate\u0027 something is to assume something that cannot be proved. By a \u0027practical postulate,\u0027 Kant meant something that had to be assumed for the sake of \u0027praxis,\u0027 or practice; that is to say, for man\u0027s morality. \u0027It is a moral necessity to assume the existence of God,\u0027 he said.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly there was a knock at the door. Sophie got up, but as Alberto gave no sign of rising, she asked: \"Shouldn\u0027t we see who it is?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alberto shrugged and reluctantly got up. They opened the door, and a little girl stood there in a white summer dress and a red bonnet. It was the girl they had seen on the other side of the lake. Over one arm she carried a basket of food.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hi,\" said Sophie. \"Who are you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can\u0027t you see I am Little Red Ridinghood?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophie looked at Alberto, and Alberto nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You heard what she said.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m looking for my grandmother\u0027s house,\" said the girl. \"She is old and sick, but I\u0027m taking her some food.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s not here,\" said Alberto, \"so you\u0027d better get on your way.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He gestured in a way that reminded Sophie of the way you brush off a fly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I\u0027m supposed to deliver a letter,\" continued the girl in the red bonnet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With that, she took out a small envelope and handed it to Sophie. Then she went skipping away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Watch out for the wolf!\" Sophie called after her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alberto was already on his way back into the living room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Just think! That was Little Red Ridinghood,\" said Sophie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And it\u0027s no good warning her. She will go to her grandmother\u0027s house and be eaten by the wolf.

It was addressed \"To Hilde.\" She opened it and read aloud:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dear Hilde, If the human brain was simple enough for us to understand, we would still be so stupid that we couldn\u0027t understand it. Love, Dad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alberto nodded. \"True enough. I believe Kant said something to that effect. We cannot expect to understand what we are. Maybe we can comprehend a flower or an insect, but we can never comprehend ourselves. Even less can we expect to comprehend the universe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophie had to read the cryptic sentence in the note to Hilde several times before Alberto went on: \"We are not going to be interrupted by sea serpents and the like.

I have to go home soon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hume\u0027s skepticism with regard to what reason and the senses can tell us forced Kant to think through many of life\u0027s important questions again.

In this he agreed with the rationalists, who said the ability to distinguish between right and wrong is inherent in human reason. Everybody knows what is right or wrong, not because we have learned it but because it is born in the mind. According to Kant, everybody has \u0027practical reason,\u0027 that is, the intelligence that gives us the capacity to discern what is right or wrong in every case.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And that is innate?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The ability to tell right from wrong is just as innate as all the other attributes of reason. Just as we are all intelligent beings, for example, perceiving everything as having a causal relation, we all have access to the same universal moral law.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This moral law has the same absolute validity as the physical laws. It is just as basic to our morality as the statements that everything has a cause, or that seven plus five is twelve, are basic to our intelligence.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what does that moral law say?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Since it precedes every experience, it is \u0027formal.\u0027 That is to say, it is not bound to any particular situation of moral choice. For it applies to all people in all societies at all times. So it does not say you shall do this or this if you find yourself in that or that situation. It says how you are to behave in all situations.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But what is the point of having a moral law implanted inside yourself if it doesn\u0027t tell you what to do in specific situations?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Kant formulates the moral law as a categorical imperative. By this he means that the moral law is \u0027categorical,\u0027 or that it applies to all situations. It is, moreover, \u0027imperative,\u0027 which means it is commanding and therefore absolutely authoritative.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\"Kant formulates this \u0027categorical imperative\u0027 in several ways. First he says: Act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your will a Universal Law of Nature.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So when I do something, I must make sure I want everybody else to do the same if they are in the same situation.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Exactly. Only then will you be acting in accordance with the moral law within you. Kant also formulates the \u0027categorical imperative\u0027 in this way: Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So we must not exploit other people to our own advantage.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, because every man is an end in himself. But that does not only apply to others, it also applies to you yourself. You must not exploit yourself as a mere means to achieving something, either.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It reminds me of the golden rule: Do unto others . . .\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, that is also a \u0027formal\u0027 rule of conduct that basically covers all ethical choices. You could say that the golden rule says the same thing as Kant\u0027s universal law of morals.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But surely this is only an assertion. Hume was probably right in that we can\u0027t prove what is right or wrong by reason.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"According to Kant, the law of morals is just as absolute and just as universal as the law of causality. That cannot be proved by reason either, but it is nevertheless absolute and unalterable. Nobody would deny that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I get the feeling that what we are really talking about is conscience. Because everybody has a conscience, don\u0027t they?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. When Kant describes the law of morals, he is describing the human conscience. We cannot prove what our conscience tells us, but we know it, nevertheless.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sometimes I might only be kind and helpful to others because I know it pays off. It could be a way of becoming popular.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But if you share with others only to be popular, you are not acting out of respect for moral law. You might be acting in accordance with moral law--and that could be fair enough--but if it is to be a moral action, you must have conquered yourself. Only when you do something purely out of duty can it be called a moral action. Kant\u0027s ethics is therefore sometimes called duty ethics.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can feel it my duty to collect money for the Red Cross or the church bazaar.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, and the important thing is that you do it because you know it is right. Even if the money you collect gets lost in the street, or is not sufficient to feed all the mouths it is intended to, you obeyed the moral law. You acted out of good will, and according to Kant, it is this good will which determines whether or not the action was morally right, not the consequences of the action. Kant\u0027s ethics is therefore also called a good will ethic.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why was it so important to him to know exactly when one acts out of respect for moral law? Surely the most important thing is that what we do really helps other peo-pie.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Indeed it is and Kant would certainly not disagree. But only when we know in ourselves that we are acting out of respect for moral law are we acting freely.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We act freely only when we obey a law? Isn\u0027t that kind of peculiar?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not according to Kant. You perhaps remember that he had to \u0027assume\u0027or \u0027postulate\u0027 that man has a free will. This is an important point, because Kant also said that everything obeys the law of causality. How, then, can we have a free will?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Search me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"On this point Kant divides man into two parts in a way not dissimilar to the way Descartes claimed that man was a \u0027dual creature,\u0027 one with both a body and a mind. As material creatures, we are wholly and fully at the mercy of causality\u0027s unbreakable law, says Kant. We do not decide what we perceive--perception comes to us through necessity and influences us whether we like it or not. But we are not only material creatures--we are also creatures of reason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As material beings we belong wholly to the natural world. We are therefore subject to causal relations. As such, we have no free will. But as rational beings we have a part in what Kant calls das Ding an sich--that is, the world as it exists in itself, independent of our sensory impressions. Only when we follow our \u0027practical reason\u0027-- which enables us to make moral choices--do we exercise our free will, because when we conform to moral law, it is we who make the law we are conforming to.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, that\u0027s true in a way. It is me, or something in me, which tells me not to be mean to others.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So when you choose not to be mean--even if it is against your own interests--you are then acting freely.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re not especially free or independent if you just do whatever you want, in any case.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"One can become a slave to all kinds of things. One can even become a slave to one\u0027s own egoism.

They don\u0027t have any freedom to follow moral law, do they?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, that\u0027s the difference between animals and humans.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I see that now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And finally we could perhaps say that Kant succeeded in showing the way out of the impasse that philosophy had reached in the struggle between rationalism and empiricism. With Kant, an era in the history of philosophy is therefore at an end. He died in 1804, when the cultural epoch we call Romanticism was in the ascendant. One of his most quoted sayings is carved on his gravestone in Konigsberg: Two things fill my mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe, the more often and the more intensely the reflection dwells on them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.\u0027 \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alberto leaned back in his chair. \"That\u0027s it,\" he said. \"I think I have told you what\u0027s most important about Kant.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Anyway, it\u0027s a quarter past four.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But there is just one thing.

It\u0027s much easier to figure out the weather.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My name is Sophie.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nice to meet you, Sophie. As I said, I think you must be new around here. But now this little bear has to go \u0027cos I\u0027ve got to find Piglet. We are going to a great big garden party for Rabbit and his friends.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He waved with one paw. Sophie saw now that he was holding a little folded piece of paper in the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is that you\u0027ve got there?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Winnie-the-Pooh produced the paper and said: \"This was what made me lose my way.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But it\u0027s only a piece of paper.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No it\u0027s not only a piece of paper. It\u0027s a letter to Hilde-through-the-Looking-Glass.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh--I can take that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you the girl in the looking glass?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, but. . .\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A letter must always be delivered personally. Christopher Robin had to teach me that only yesterday.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I know Hilde.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Makes no difference. Even if you know a person very well, you should never read their letters.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I mean, I can give it to Hilde.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s quite a different thing. Here you are, Sophie. If I can get rid of this letter, I can probably find Piglet as well. To find Hilde-through-the-Looking-Glassyou must first find a big looking glass. But that is no easy matter round here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And with that the little bear handed over the folded paper to Sophie and set off through the woods on his little feet. When he was out of sight, Sophie unfolded the piece of paper and read it:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dear Hilde, It\u0027s too bad that Alberto didn\u0027t also tell Sophie that Kant advocated the establishment of a \"league of nations.\" In his treatise Perpetual Peace, he wrote that all countries should unite in a league of the nations, which would assure peaceful coexistence between nations. About 125 years after the appearance of this treatise in 1795, the League of Nations was founded, after the First World War. After the Second World War it was replaced by the United Nations. So you could say that Kant was the father of the UN idea. Kant\u0027s point was that man\u0027s \"practical reason\" requires the nations to emerge from their wild state of nature which creates wars, and contract to keep the peace. Although the road to the establishment of a league of nations is laborious, it is our duty to work for the \"universal and lasting securing of peace.\" The establishment of such a league was for Kant a far-distant goal. You could almost say it was philosophy\u0027s ultimate goal. I am in Lebanon at the moment. Love, Dad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophie put the note in her pocket and continued on her way homeward. This was the kind of meeting in the woods Alberto had warned her about. But she couldn\u0027t have let the little teddy wander about in the woods on a never ending hunt for Hilde-through-the-Looking-Glass, could she?\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/2013/57408.html","bookId":3,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 1:31:17 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 1:31:17 AM"}
