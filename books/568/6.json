ENDS IN A FIRE.","content":"DARIUS DARKE, to call him by the name by which he chose to be known, on parting company with Tom, turned his steps toward the house of Mr. Simpson, the wealthy shoe manufacturer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he walked along, he thought over the information which Tom had given him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What a scoundrel Simpson is!” he said to himself. “He might at least have taken care of poor Thatcher’s family. Now he has actually turned the boy out of his shop, depriving him of his living. There would be small chance of his doing anything for me if I hadn’t a hold upon him. I think I may be able to persuade him that it will be for his interest to provide for me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He walked on, till he stood opposite the fine mansion of the man he sought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So John Simpson lives here, and I have no roof to cover me. The wicked do prosper sometimes, it appears. Well, I’ll pull the bell, and see if he knows me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John Simpson was sitting in the same room in which he had had his interview with Tom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was ill at ease, for Tom’s questioning had stirred up unpleasant thoughts in the mind of the rich man. He was almost sorry that he had discharged Tom from39 his employment. He knew very well that Tom was popular in the village, as his father had been before him, and that the townspeople would take sides with him. Again, everybody knew the relations which had existed between him and the boy’s father, and he foresaw that he would be considered mean in thus treating the son of an old comrade. Yet he felt so irritated with Tom that he was not prepared as yet to recall his hasty words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll let him shift for himself for awhile,” he decided. “It may teach him a lesson, and cure him of his impertinence to me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At this moment the bell rang.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Very likely the boy has come back to beg that I will take him on again,” thought the rich man complacently, and he smiled in anticipation of the triumph this would afford him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But he did not know Tom, or he would never have thought of this. Our hero was poor, but he had plenty of self-respect and proper pride. He would have humiliated himself if he saw no other way of saving his mother and sister from privation, but not until he had tried earnestly to find employment elsewhere.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The servant appeared at the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Please, sir, there’s a poor man wants to see you, Mr. Simpson.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A poor man! Who is he?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Never saw him before, sir. He looks like a tramp.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t care to see him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He told me to say that he used to know you in California.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 40\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John Simpson started uneasily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Bring him in,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Directly afterward Darius Darke entered the room and coolly seated himself in an arm-chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good-evening, Mr. Simpson,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It appears to me that you are very ready to make yourself at home in a gentleman’s house,” said John Simpson, angrily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why shouldn’t I? I was once a gentleman myself.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It must have been long ago,” said the rich man with a sneer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, you judge by my clothes,” said the tramp, coolly. “That’s wrong. Such as you see me I am a man of education, and a college graduate.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t care what you have been. You are down in the world now.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s true enough.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What did you mean by sending me word that you knew me in California?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I told the truth.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Where was it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “At Rocky Gulch. You were associated with a man named Thatcher. By the way is he living now?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, he is not,” said Simpson, uneasily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How long has he been dead?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Eight years. He never came home from California.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How was that?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I suppose he was robbed.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And murdered?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 41 “Very probable. But you must excuse my speaking on this subject. It is painful to me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t wonder at it,” said Darius Darke, in a tone which was pointed and significant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John Simpson scanned his face sharply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Of course,” he explained, “it is painful to think of the sad fate of a man with whom I was so intimate.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Darius Darke moved his chair nearer that on which the rich man was seated and asked, abruptly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “John Simpson, what became of Thatcher’s money?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How should I know?” answered the shoe manufacturer nervously. “I suppose the men who stole it have spent it long ago. Why do you come to me with such a question?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I supposed you would be as likely to know as any one.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then, sir, you are very much mistaken. I don’t understand what business it is of yours. I should judge that your own affairs required all your attention.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So they do,” said Darius Darke, imperturbably. “I am coming to them by and by. But it occurred to me that poor Thatcher’s family needed the money he had when I knew him at Rocky Gulch.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How do you know he left a family?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I was speaking to his boy this evening. A fine, manly fellow Tom Thatcher is. He’ll make a smart man if he lives.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You were speaking to Tom Thatcher this evening?” gasped John Simpson, unpleasantly surprised. “At what time this evening?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 42 “Just before I came in.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And you hadn’t met him before?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No; I asked him the way to your house, and he told me he had just left it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John Simpson was relieved. He feared at first that Tom’s call was induced by a previous interview with his present visitor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He seems a fine boy,” repeated Darke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He is a very impertinent boy.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He doesn’t look like it. By the way, he tells me you have discharged him from your employment.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He forced me to it. I may take him on again after a time. Did you speak to Tom about his father?” asked John Simpson, uneasily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes. He says that you told him his father had only five thousand dollars.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Suppose I did.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He got ten thousand dollars for his share of the money you jointly sold the claim for, John Simpson.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How do you know that? Who are you?” demanded the rich man, with feverish interest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How do I know? I certainly ought to know, for I was one of the two men who bought you out.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You!” exclaimed Simpson, with undisguised amazement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes. I don’t look like it now, do I? But I had money then, and I paid ten thousand dollars down for a half interest in the claim. I may as well tell you that I never got the money back. The claim was nearly exhausted at the time you sold, though I am sure neither43 you nor Thatcher knew it. Well, you both remained awhile. After you left my partner and myself came to the conclusion that we had made a bad bargain, and he deputed me to follow you and see if you wouldn’t return a part of the money under the circumstances.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, I finally came up with you. It was a bright moonlight night. I found where you were encamped.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Darius Darke paused. He rose from his chair, went to the door, and closed it; then he came back, and approaching Mr. Simpson’s chair, said, in a low voice:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t ask me to tell what I saw. You, of all men, would shrink from hearing it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John Simpson looked at him with a dazed air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why have you come here to tell me this?” he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Darius Darke’s manner changed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Because,” said he, “I need money. The world has not used me well. Let me have five hundred dollars, and you will not see me again for a year.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I cannot do it,” answered Simpson, hastily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Reflect upon it for five minutes. I think you will let me have it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a little haggling, but Darke remained firm. In the end he prevailed. Before he left the room, money and securities amounting to five hundred dollars were in his hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Where are you going?” asked Simpson.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I leave this town to-morrow, but I must pass the night somewhere. I suppose I will not be received in the hotel, looking as I am. Will you allow me to sleep in your stable?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 44 John Simpson hesitated. Finally he spoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Follow me,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Out of the back door they went unobserved, to the back of the lot, six hundred feet away, where was an old ruined barn, now no longer used, as Mr. Simpson had built a stable near the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You will find some hay in the loft,” he said, “and can rest undisturbed till morning. I expect you to keep your promise then, and leave this village.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will do so.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e About one o’clock there was an alarm of fire in the village. John Simpson’s old barn was discovered to be on fire, and was past saving when the village hook-and-ladder fire-engine arrived on the spot.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2060/58617.html","bookId":568,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 4:56:18 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 4:56:18 AM"}
