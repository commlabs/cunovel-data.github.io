There was a brief pause, then he shook his head and looked at me. \"Good morning,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been awake long?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just woke... now. When you... spoke to me. Fell asleep... standing up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"But your eyes were open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Always open. No lids... or lashes. Can\u0027t shut them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more I learned about Harkat, the weirder he got! \"Does that mean you can see things while you\u0027re asleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I... take no... notice of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner appeared at the entrance to our room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rise and shine, boys,\" he boomed. \"Night\u0027s wearing on. There\u0027s work to be done. Anybody for bat broth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked to use the bathroom before we went to eat. Gavner led me to a small door with the letters WC carved into it. \"What does that stand for?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Water closet,\" he informed me, then added, \"Don\u0027t fall in!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought that was a joke, but when I stepped inside, I realized it was a genuine warning - there was no toilet in the water closet, just a round hole in the ground that led to a gurgling mountain stream. I stared down the hole - it wasn\u0027t large enough for an adult to fall through, but somebody my size might just fit - and shivered when I saw dark, gushing water at the bottom. I didn\u0027t like the idea of squatting over the hole, but there was no other option, so I just did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are all the toilets like that?\" I asked when I came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Gavner laughed. \"It\u0027s the easiest way to get rid of the waste. There are a couple of big streams leading out of the mountain and the toilets are built over them. The streams wash everything away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner led Harkat and me to the Hall of Khledon Lurt. Seba Nile had pointed out the Hall to me the day before and said it was where meals were served. He also told me a little about Khledon Lurt; he had been a General of great standing, who had died saving other vampires in the fight with the vampaneze, when they broke away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVampires loved telling tales about their ancestors. They kept only a few written records, choosing instead to keep their history alive by word of mouth, passing on stories and legends around fires or over tables from one generation to another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed drapes hung from the ceiling, covering the walls, and there was a large statue of Khledon Lurt at the center of the Hall. (Like most of the mountain\u0027s sculptures, it had been carved from the bones of animals.) The Hall was lit by strong torches, and it was almost full when we arrived. Gavner, Harkat, and me sat at a table with Mr. Crepsley, Seba Nile, and a bunch of vampires I didn\u0027t know. Talk was loud and rough. A lot of it had to do with fighting and daring acts of endurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was my first good look at a crowd of vampires, and I spent more time gazing around than I did eating. They didn\u0027t look that different from humans, except many were scarred from battle and hard living, and not a single one - pretty obvious why! - was suntanned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were a smelly bunch. They didn\u0027t use deodorant, although a couple had strings of wildflowers or naturally scented herbs around their necks and wrists. Although vampires made sure they washed in the world of humans - a foul stench could lead a vampire hunter to his prey - here in the mountain hardly any of them bothered with such luxuries. With all the soot and dirt of the Halls, they didn\u0027t see the point - it was impossible to stay clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed pretty much no women. After a long time scanning, I spotted one sitting at a table in a corner, and another serving food. Besides that, the vampires were all men. There were hardly any old people either; Seba seemed to be the oldest vampire present. I asked him about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very few vampires live to be a ripe, old age,\" he replied. \"While vampires live far longer than humans, very few of us make it to our vampiric sixties or seventies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires measure age in two ways - earth years and vampire years,\" he explained. \"The vampiric age is the age of the body - physically, I am in my eighties. The earth age refers to how many years a vampire has been alive - I was a young boy when I was blooded, so I am seven hundred earth years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven hundred! It was an incredible age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Though many vampires live for hundreds of earth years,\" Seba went on, \"hardly any make it to their vampiric sixties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? \"I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires live hard. We push ourselves to the limit, undergoing many tests of strength, wit, and courage. Hardly any sit around in pajamas and slippers, growing old quietly. Most, when they grow too old to care for themselves, meet death on their feet, rather than let their friends look after them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come you\u0027ve lived so long then?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren!\" Mr. Crepsley snapped, shooting me a piercing glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not chastise the boy.\" Seba smiled. \"His open curiosity is refreshing. I have lived to this long age because of my position,\" he said to me. \"I was asked many decades ago to become the quartermaster of Vampire Mountain. It is not an enviable job, since it means living inside - hardly ever going hunting or fighting. But quartermasters are essential and much honored - it would have been impolite of me to refuse. If I was free, I would have been long dead by now, but one who does not exert oneself tends to live longer than those who do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems crazy to me,\" I said. \"Why do you push yourselves so hard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is our way,\" Seba answered. \"Also, we have more time on our hands than humans, so it is less precious to us. If, in vampire years, a sixty-year-old man was blooded when he was twenty, he will have lived for more than four hundred earth years. A man grows tired of life when he has lived so much of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trying to see it from their point of view, but it was hard. Maybe I\u0027d think differently when I\u0027d been around a century or two!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner rose before we finished eating and said he had to leave. He asked Harkat to accompany him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Hall of Princes,\" he said. \"I must present myself to the Princes and tell them about the dead vampire and vampaneze we discovered. I also want to introduce Harkat, so he can pass on his message. The sooner the better, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they left, I asked Mr. Crepsley why we hadn\u0027t gone with them. \"It is not our place to present ourselves to the Princes,\" he said. \"Gavner is a General, so he has the right to ask to see the Princes. As ordinary vampires, we must wait to be invited before them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you used to be a General,\" I reminded him. \"They wouldn\u0027t mind if you popped in to say hello, would they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course they would.\" Mr. Crepsley scowled, then turned to Seba and sighed. \"He is slow to learn our ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeba laughed. \"And you are slow to learn the ways of the teacher. You forget how eagerly you questioned our way of life when you were blooded. I recall the night you stormed into my chambers and swore you would never become a General. You said Generals were backward imbeciles, and we should be looking to the future, not dwelling in the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never said that!\" Mr. Crepsley gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You certainly did,\" Seba insisted. \"And more! You were a fiery youth, and there were times when I thought you would never calm down. I was often tempted to dismiss you, but I did not. I let you ask your questions and air your rage, and in time you learned that yours was not the wisest head in the world, and that the old ways might indeed be best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Students never appreciate their teachers while they are learning. It is only later, when they know more of the world, that they understand how indebted they are to those who instructed them. Good teachers expect no praise or love from the young. They wait for it, and in time, it comes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you scolding me?\" Mr. Crepsley asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Seba smiled. \"You are a fine vampire, Larten, but you have much to learn about teaching. Do not be so quick to criticize. Accept Darren\u0027s questions and stubbornness. Answer patiently and do not scold him for his opinions. Only in this way can he mature and develop as you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI extracted a guilty pleasure out of watching Mr. Crepsley being hauled down a peg or two. I was extremely close to the vampire, but his pomposity sometimes got on my nerves. It was fun to see him have his wrists slapped!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop smirking!\" he snapped when he saw me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, now,\" I scolded him. \"You heard what Mr. Nile said - be patient - strive to understand me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Crepsley was puffing himself up to roar at me when Seba coughed discreetly. The vampire glanced at his old teacher, the air wheezed out of him, and he grinned sheepishly. Instead of giving out, he politely asked me to pass him a loaf of bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My pleasure, Larten,\" I responded wryly, and the three of us shared a quiet laugh while the other vampires in the Hall of Khledon Lurt bellowed, told stories, and cracked mischievous jokes around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-mountain-the-saga-of-darren-shan-4/page-14.html","bookId":2440,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:38 PM"}
