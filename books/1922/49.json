So I gave him my keys to let himself in. Did you order already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. And I tossed a few bottles of Cristal in the wine fridge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the best.\" I shoved my bag at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI showered and called my mom from the phone in my room, wincing at her strident, \"I have been trying to reach you for days!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, if it\u0027s about Gideon Cross - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course, it\u0027s partly about him! For goodness\u0027 sake, Eva. You\u0027re being called the significant woman in his life. How could I not want to talk about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there\u0027s also the appointment you asked me to make with Dr. Petersen.\" The note of smug amusement in her voice made me smile. \"We\u0027re scheduled to meet with him Thursday at six o\u0027clock in the evening. I hope that works for you. He doesn\u0027t do many evening appointments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plopped backward onto my bed with a sigh. I\u0027d been so distracted by work and Gideon that the appointment had slipped my mind. \"Thursday at six will be fine. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, then. Tell me about Cross...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I emerged from my bedroom dressed in jersey pants and a San Diego State University sweatshirt, I found Trey seated with Cary in the living room. Both men stood when I came in and Trey gifted me with an open, friendly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I look so ragged,\" I said sheepishly, running my fingers through my damp ponytail. \"Taking the stairs at work almost killed me today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elevator take the day off?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. My brain did. What the hell was I thinking?\" Spending the night with Gideon was enough of a workout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang and Cary went to get it while I headed into the kitchen for the Cristal. I joined him at the breakfast bar as he signed the credit card receipt and the look in his eyes when he glanced at Trey had me hiding a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a lot of those looks going back and forth between the two men as the evening progressed. And I had to agree with Cary that Trey was a hottie. Dressed in distressed jeans, matching vest, and a long-sleeved shirt, the aspiring veterinarian looked casual but well put together. He was very different personality-wise from the type of guy Cary usually dated. Trey seemed more grounded; not quite somber, but definitely not flighty. I thought he\u0027d be a good influence on Cary, if they stayed together long enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us made it through two bottles of Cristal and two pizzas between us, plus all of Demolition Man before I called it a night. I urged Trey to stay for Driven to round out the Stallone mini-marathon; then I went to my room and changed into a sexy black baby doll I\u0027d been given as part of a bridesmaid gift bag - sans the matching panties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving a candle burning for Gideon, I crashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke to darkness and the scent of Gideon\u0027s skin, the lights and sounds of the city shut out by soundproofed windows and blackout drapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon slid over me, a moving shadow, his bare skin cool to the touch. His mouth slanted over mine, kissing me slow and deeply, tasting of mint and his own unique flavor. My hands slid down his sleekly muscular back, my legs parting so he could settle comfortably between them. The weight of him against me made my heart sigh and my blood warm with desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hello to you, too,\" I said breathlessly when he let me up for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll come with me next time,\" he murmured in that sexy and decadent voice, nibbling at my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will I?\" I teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached down and cupped my butt in his hand, squeezing and lifting me into a deft roll of his hips. \"Yes. I missed you, Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my fingers through his hair, wishing I could see him. \"You haven\u0027t known me long enough to miss me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shows how much you know,\" Gideon scoffed, sliding downward and nuzzling between my br**sts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped as his mouth covered my nipple and sucked through the satin, deep pulls that echoed in the clenching of my core. He moved to my other breast, his hand pushing up the hem of my baby doll. I arched into him, lost to the magic of his mouth as it moved over my body, his tongue dipping into my navel, then sliding lower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you missed me, too,\" he purred with masculine satisfaction, the tip of his middle finger rimming my cleft. \"You\u0027re swollen and wet for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled my legs over his shoulders and licked between my folds, soft and provocative laps of hot velvet against my sensitive flesh. My hands fisted in the sheet, my chest heaving as he circled my cl*t with the tip of his tongue, then nudged the hypersensitive knot of nerves. I keened, my h*ps moving restlessly into the devious torment, my muscles tightening with the clawing need to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light, teasing flutters were driving me insane, giving me just enough to make me writhe but not enough to get me off. \"Gideon, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tortured me, coaxing my body to the brink of orgasm, and then letting me slide back down. Over and over. Until sweat misted my skin and my heart felt like it would burst. His tongue was tireless and diabolical, cleverly focusing on my cl*t until a single stroke would set me off, then moving lower to thrust into me. The soft, shallow plunges were maddening, the flickering against the nerve-laden tissues making me desperate enough to beg shamelessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Gideon...let me come...I need to come, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh, angel...I\u0027ll take care of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished me with a tenderness that made the orgasm roll through me like a crashing wave, building and swelling and spreading through me in a warm rush of pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threaded his fingers with mine when he came over me again, restraining my arms. The head of his c**k aligned with the slick entrance of my body and he pushed inexorably into me. I moaned, shifting to accommodate the heavy surge of his penis. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-49.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
