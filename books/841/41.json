{"id":44923,"no":41,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIX. TWO SUNDAYS","content":"\u0026nbsp;None of our Sunday Societies or Sunday Leagues seem ever to have thought of the advantages of advocating as I have long done—two Sundays—a Devotional Sunday and a Secular Sunday. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The advocacy of two Sundays would put an end to the fear or pretence that anybody wants to destroy the one we have.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Policy of a Second Sunday is a necessity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It would put an end to the belief that the working classes are mad, and not content with working six days want to work on the seventh.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It would preserve the present Sunday as a day of real rest and devotion. The one Sunday we now have is neither one thing nor the other. Its insufficiency for rest prevents it being an honest day of devotion. Proper recreation is out of the question. There is too little time for excursions out of town on the Saturday half-day holiday. Imprisonment in town irritates rather than refreshes—mere rest is not recreation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\"A want of occupation gives no rest\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;A mind quite vacant is a mind distressed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Those who would provide recreation in the country find it not worth while for the precarious chance of half-day visitors. On a Secular Sunday recreation would be organised and be more self-respecting than it now can be.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 1. It would conduce to the public health. The manufacturing towns of England are mostly pandemoniums of smoke or blast-furnace fumes. The winds of heaven cannot clear them away in one day—less than forty-eight hours of cessation of fire and fume would not render the air breathable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 2. With two Sundays one would be left undisturbed, devoted to repose, to piety, contemplation and improvement of the mind.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 3. It would give the preacher intelligent, fresh-minded and fruitful-minded hearers, instead of the listless, wearied, barren-headed auditors, who lower the standard of his own mind by forcing upon him the endeavour to speak to the level of theirs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 4. A second Sunday would give the people real rest when nobody would frown upon them, nor preach against them, nor pray against them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 5. It would be cheaper to millowners to stop their works two clear days than run them on short days; and there need not be fears of claims of further reduction of forty-eight hours a week on the part of workpeople, who would have a real sense of freedom from unending toil with two days\u0027 rest and peace. Manufacturing towns would no longer be, as now, penal settlements of industry. Holiness would no longer be felt to be wearisomeness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But for Moses, the changes here sought would have existed long ago. One day\u0027s rest in the week was enough for Jews who were doing nothing when one Sunday was prescribed to them. Had Moses foreseen the manufacturing system, instead of saying \"six days,\" he would have said, \"Five days shalt thou labour.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If he deserves well of mankind who makes two blades of wheat grow where only one grew before; he deserves better who causes two Sundays to exist where only one existed before—for corn merely feeds the body, whereas reasonable leisure feeds the mind.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3193/87311.html","bookId":841,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 8:04:31 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 8:04:31 AM"}
