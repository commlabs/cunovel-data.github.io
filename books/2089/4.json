Not only was he Indian, but he also was quite possibly the most gorgeous man I\u0027d ever seen. Even better than Damien, the possible figment of my imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe towered over Jessie, his body lithe and strong. The way he held himself screamed some kind of martial arts training. His hair was short, and a golden feather swung from one ear. He was exotic - both wild and tame. I couldn\u0027t seem to stop staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be Leigh. Welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man held out his hand, but Jessie yanked him back. \"Just one minute there, Slick; the duchess is being a pain in my ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since that\u0027s awful easy to do, Jess, I\u0027m not going to hold it against her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. He had her number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Will.\" He offered his hand again, and I managed to shake it before Jessie could stop us. \"Will Cadotte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leigh Tyler,\" I returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think Jessie is going to get us killed why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only was he sharp, but his hearing wasn\u0027t bad, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attachments.\" I shrugged. \"You can\u0027t have them if you\u0027re going to be a Jdger-Sucher.\"\u0026nbsp; I glanced at Edward. \"What\u0027s the matter with you? Didn\u0027t you check her out better than this? Or is he a new development?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t say I blamed her. Cadotte was a damn fine development. But I wasn\u0027t going to get my neck torn out or my head blown off because Jessie couldn\u0027t keep her mind off his assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is one of us, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Edward for a long moment. \"It\u0027s finally happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve gone senile. I must say, you hide it well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe narrowed his pale blue eyes. \"Watch your mouth, young lady. I know what I am doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat remained to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Cadotte. \"No offense, but you don\u0027t seem like much of a hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably because I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is the expert I spoke of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked Cadotte up and down. \"I just bet he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte threw his arm out, stopping Jessie before she could spring across the room and kick my ass. Or at least try. We were going to go round and round before this was over. It was only a matter of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must forgive Leigh,\" Edward said. \"She is devoted to the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t apologize for me. I\u0027m the one who has to train her. I can see she\u0027s gaga over him. If he\u0027s in danger, she\u0027ll be useless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the contrary, Jessie was very useful, even when Will was in grave danger. It is one of the reasons I chose her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes met Edward\u0027s. His were determined and I accepted the inevitable. Jessie was one of us now, and so was the boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of an expert is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right here,\" Cadotte said. \"I\u0027m a professor of Native American history, with a specialty in totems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which will do us any good why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips twitched. For some reason Cadotte found me more amusing than annoying, which only annoyed me more. Of course that was very easy to do. Jessie and I had more in common with each passing moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I live to acquire obscure data.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will was invaluable during our escapade with the wolf god,\" Edward said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wolf god is gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not forgotten,\" Jessie whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow flickered across her face. Will took her hand. I wondered what was up with that, and since I\u0027d never been one to shut my mouth, I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew the wolf god well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was my best friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least I had one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girls - \" Mandenauer broke off as Jessie and I both snarled at him. \"I mean, ladies, must you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they must,\" Cadotte murmured. \"It\u0027s a territorial thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t they just pee on the trees as we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027d be quieter,\" Cadotte agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Edward, then shifted my gaze to Jessie. \"What did you do to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie frowned. \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He never made jokes before he met you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then my work here is done.\" She brushed her palms together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leigh, if we cannot laugh once in a while, what good is living?\" Edward asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know; what good is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence fell over the room. Edward glanced away. Jessie and Will stared at me with something akin to pity in their eyes. And they didn\u0027t even know me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw up my hands. \"Never mind. Where am I staying? Just don\u0027t say here, because you can forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if,\" Jessie muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was one room for rent in Crow Valley,\" Edward said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only one? No cabin? No hotel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie rolled her eyes. \"You aren\u0027t in Kansas anymore, Duchess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced. Kansas. Did she know? Or was that just a lucky guess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward, ever sensitive to my pain, jumped in. \"Crow Valley is not a resort area. No one comes to this town on vacation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom what I\u0027d seen so far, I understood why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do they come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To retire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with here?\" Jessie demanded. \"I\u0027ve lived here - or near enough - for most of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sympathies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrowed. Yep, she definitely wanted to punch me. Which worked out well, because I wouldn\u0027t mind slugging her just for the hell of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte stepped in again. \"Crow Valley was originally a mining town. That\u0027s why they call Wisconsin the Badger State.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it was because you had too many badgers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my opinion, one was too many. I\u0027d met a few badgers in my travels, and they were mean little fucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do.\" Will\u0027s expression said he\u0027d encountered a few himself and had about as high an opinion of them as I did. \"But the nickname originated with the miners, who were called badgers because they dug in the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of mines?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lead mostly. Some zinc and copper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s a mine here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but it closed a long time ago. The town remained. It\u0027s a beautiful area. Very peaceful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you like snow eight months out of twelve, summer for one month, if you\u0027re lucky, and so many trees you can\u0027t see the sun half the time,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some people do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte was very good at smoothing the waters and imparting information without seeming to lecture, even though he was. He must have been an excellent professor. Just as I had once been an excellent teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put that thought right out of my head and focused on what he was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot of folks from the big cities who came north with their families for vacation have retired in Crow Valley. They don\u0027t want to live in a tourist trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this entire town is made up of old people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy pickings for the werewolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not entirely. An older community needs a lot of services. Medical, restaurants, entertainment. I\u0027d say Crow Valley is fifty-fifty between retirees and the regular Joes who wait on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A very large transient population then.\" In my experience, waiters, bartenders, and other service people moved around a lot. I know I would. \"Which makes it hard to tell if there\u0027s a new werewolf in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never said this was going to be easy,\" Edward murmured. \"That is why I called you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis praise warmed the cold spot in my chest that had been there since I\u0027d met Jessie. She was too tall, too confident, too palsy with Edward, and too damned lucky to have Cadotte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed to get over my jealousy. It wasn\u0027t as if I wanted her life. I knew better than to get close to anyone, and sooner or later Jessie would know better, too. I didn\u0027t want to be around when that happened. So I\u0027d do my job and get out of Dodge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Point me toward my room, would you? Nighttime\u0027s a-wastin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone exchanged glances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I growled. I hated being treated like an outsider - even when I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just...\" Cadotte shrugged. \"Since I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s going on yet, it might be a good idea to refrain from killing them for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like a bad idea to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if killing them is what they want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That makes no sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does anything make sense with werewolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood point. If I could believe in werewolves and assorted other creatures of the night, pretty much anything was possible. Even that killing them was what they wanted. Still, if I wasn\u0027t going to blast a few werewolves, what was I good for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can train Jessie,\" Edward said, as if he\u0027d heard my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled. She grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as Will has some idea of what we\u0027re up against, the two of you can begin to hunt,\" Edward soothed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way I was hunting with Jessie or anyone else. There was no way I was sitting on my ass and letting werewolves wander free to do their dirty deeds and make more werewolves. But I didn\u0027t have to tell them that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll start tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way Edward beamed at me, I would have felt bad for deceiving him. If I were capable of such a feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone talked at once, offering to show me to my room - on the other side of town. But I wanted to be alone. How else was I going to sneak away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just give me the address,\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problemo.\" Jessie snatched a paper from the end table, scribbled something on a corner, and tore it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill flinched at the sound and sighed. \"Jessie, could you check and see if that\u0027s a rare document or something important before you go tearing it into shreds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? Oh, sorry.\" She shrugged and handed me the corner anyway. Then dug into her pocket for the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stifled a smile. As annoying as she was, there were times when I sympathized with her. How did she stand living with an egghead like Will Cadotte?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled a pair of glasses from his pocket, settled them on his nose, then bent over the end table to read what was left of his precious paper. I got a good glimpse of his ass. Maybe this assignment wouldn\u0027t be so bad after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never been much of an ass woman, even before I\u0027d caught sight of Fitzgerald\u0027s chest and become bewitched by all that pale Irish skin and manly muscle. However, that didn\u0027t mean I couldn\u0027t admire beauty when it was displayed right in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my gaze from Will\u0027s jeans. My eyes collided with Jessie\u0027s. While most women would be mad to find another ogling their boyfriend\u0027s behind, she merely looked amused and shrugged as if to say, What can you do?\u0026nbsp; For just an instant I liked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she opened her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be at your place at seven a.m.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leigh is not a morning person,\" Edward explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I have to work at night, so morning is when we\u0027ll train.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll train when I say we\u0027ll train. At noon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrowed my eyes. She narrowed hers. We stared each other down. I was reminded of films I\u0027d studied of real wolves. Dominance struggles. Alpha and beta animals. Well, I was the alpha around here, and she\u0027d damn straight better get used to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe might have stared at each other all night, but Cadotte grabbed Jessie and kissed her again. Edward showed me to the door. The first round hadn\u0027t gone at all the way I\u0027d planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped into the hallway behind me. \"I must leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice sounded wan and needy. Pathetic. What was the matter with me? Thankfully Edward didn\u0027t seem to notice my sudden regression to the wimpy girlie-girl I\u0027d once been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elise requested I come to the compound as soon as I could. There is an... issue which requires my attention. You do not need me here with both you and Jessie, as well as Will, on the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When can you get back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not sure. You\u0027ll be fine. Just show Jessie everything I showed you and anything new you have learned along the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his hand on my shoulder. His fingers felt like dry twigs. Would they snap under too much pressure? For the first time I could remember, I was worried about Edward. He was very, very old, and today he seemed even older.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep me informed,\" he said. \"On the lovely Internet. What an invention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. Edward was fascinated with the Internet. His was both a charming and a convenient obsession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked out together, climbed into separate cars. I watched his until the taillights disappeared over a far hill, then drove down the main street of Crow Valley, which had been quaintly labeled Main Street, until I found a road called Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are hysterical in this town,\" I muttered as the carriage of my rental car scraped along the rutted, gravel-strewn surface of Good Road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clattered along in the night for quite a while, even began to wonder if Jessie\u0027s idea of a joke was sending me off on a path that led nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trees made a canopy over my car, shutting out any light, making the air seem to throb against the windshield in a cool, velvet haze. I could smell the forest - the evergreen scent of pine, the musty aroma of dying leaves, and the tang of summer gone away too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had almost decided to turn back when I heard it. The faint, exotic drift of music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept driving. The sky glowed dimly, as if city lights pulsed in the distance. But I knew from the map I\u0027d studied before leaving Minneapolis that there wasn\u0027t a town of any identifiable size within a hundred miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what were those lights, and who was playing music?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly ran into the answer. My car rolled up one side of an impressive bump, then slid down the other. I shot into a clearing and nearly slammed through the front wall of a tavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCars were parked all around the building at odd angles, as if the patrons had arrived drunk. Music spilled out the open windows - jazz - as out of place in this forest as I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sign on the building, no neon lights announcing McGinty\u0027s or Cheers, just a bright yellow spotlight perched at every corner of the tavern, blaring into the trees as if to keep whatever lurked there at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One helluvan odd place for a bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the single day I\u0027d been in Wisconsin, I\u0027d noticed they did taverns up right. There had to be one on every corner of every town I\u0027d driven through. Why should Crow Valley be any different? Although I didn\u0027t see a corner anywhere near here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere also didn\u0027t appear to be anything resembling a room for rent.
