Four alabaster columns, each adorned with elaborate reliefs, supported a massive block of verde green marble carved into intersecting vaults. Behind, framed by the baldachin, glittered the famous Pala d\u0027Oro, the screen rich with gold, precious stones, and enamel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the altar, she studied the two distinct parts of the stone sarcophagus. The misshapen top was more a slab-the bottom carved smooth into a rectangle upon which was etched CORPVS DIVI MARCI EVANGELISTAE. Her Latin was enough for a rough translation. Body of the divine St. Mark. Two heavy iron rings protruded from the top, which apparently was how the massive stones had been initially lowered into place. Now, thick iron bars pierced the rings, bolted at each end to four hydraulic jacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a real challenge,\" Michener said. \"Not much space beneath the altar. Of course, with heavy equipment we could easily get inside, but we don\u0027t have the time or privacy for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noticed the men preparing the jacks. \"Priests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Assigned here. We thought it best to keep this among us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know what\u0027s inside?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you\u0027re really asking is whether the remains are mummified.\" Michener shrugged. \"It\u0027s been over one hundred and seventy years since this tomb was opened. No one really knows what\u0027s in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe resented his smugness. Ptolemy had taken advantage of Eumenes\u0027 switch, and used what the world believed to be Alexander\u0027s corpse to its fullest political potential. She had no way of knowing if what she was about to see would provide any answers, but it was imperative she find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichener motioned to one of the priests and the hydraulic jacks were cranked. The iron rings atop the tomb stretched vertically, then, ever so slowly, a millimeter at a time, the jacks lifted the weighty lid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Powerful mechanisms,\" Michener said. \"Small, but they can lift a house from underneath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lid was now two centimeters skyward, but the interior of the sarcophagus remained in shadow. She stared high above the baldachin, into the apse\u0027s brightly lit semidome, at a golden mosaic of Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four men stopped working the jacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sarcophagus lid hung suspended about four centimeters above the bottom, the iron bars now flush with the underside of the altar top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more room to climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichener gestured for them to retreat toward the iconostasis, away from the altar, where he whispered, \"The Holy Father is trying to accommodate your request with the hope that you\u0027ll reciprocate his. But let\u0027s be real. You\u0027re not going to honor your promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not accustomed to being insulted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the Holy Father is not accustomed to being lied to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll pretense seemed to have left this diplomat. \"You\u0027ll be given access to the Federation, as I assured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she realized. He\u0027d waited until the lid was off. She hated herself, but because of Karyn, and Alexander the Great, and what may be out there, somewhere, to find, she had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached beneath his jacket and removed a folded sheaf of papers. \"We\u0027ve prepared a concordat between the Federation and the Church. Written assurances that we\u0027ll be given access. Per your request of yesterday, we\u0027ve reserved the right to the Federation on approval of any church construction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe unfolded the papers and saw the text had even been prepared in Kazakh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We thought it easier to have it in your language.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought it would be easier to disseminate in my language. My signature is your insurance. No way I could deny you then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced through the concordat. The language detailed a cooperative effort between the Roman Church and the Central Asia Federation to \"jointly promote and encourage the free exercise of religion through unrestricted allowance of missionary work.\" The paragraphs went on to assure that violence against the Church would not be tolerated and offenders would be punished. More provisions guaranteed that visas would be liberally granted to Church personnel and no reprisals would be tolerated against any converts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared back at the altar. The lower half of the sarcophagus remained in shadow. Even from ten meters away she could see nothing inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be a good one to have on my team,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like serving the Church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at her watch-12:50 A.M. Viktor should already be here. He was never late. So dependable. She stared out into the nave, back toward the upper portions of the west atrium where only the golden ceilings were illuminated. Lots of dark places to hide. She wondered, when one A.M. came and she was granted her thirty minutes, if she\u0027d really be alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If signing the concordat is a problem,\" Michener said, \"we could just forget the whole thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words from yesterday when she\u0027d challenged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called his bluff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a pen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORTY-EIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE SPOTTED A PAIR OF RED RUNNING LIGHTS A QUARTER mile away, flitting erratically across the black water, as if the boat was without a pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see that out there?\" he asked Stephanie, pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood on the other side of the helm. \"It\u0027s beyond the marked channel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d thought the same thing. He kept the boat churning forward. They were closer now to the drifting craft, maybe a couple hundred yards off. No question, the other boat, about the same shape and size as his, was near the shallows. Then, in the ambient glow from its helm, he saw someone plunge into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother figure appeared and three shots banged in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cotton,\" Stephanie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Already on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whirled the wheel left and headed straight for the lights. The other boat seemed to spring to life and motored away. He cut a swath through the water and sent swells heading toward the other low-riding craft. Water slashed into the hull. Malone was still fifty feet away, the other craft passing them now. The shadowy outline of its pilot appeared at the helm, a gun at the end of an outstretched arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down,\" he screamed to Stephanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d apparently spotted the danger, too, and was already leaping to the wet deck. He dove with her as two bullets whizzed past, one shattering a window in the aft cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sprang to his feet and regained control of the helm. The other boat was speeding away toward Venice. He needed to pursue, but now wondered about the person in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find a flashlight,\" he said, as he slowed the boat and maneuvered toward the spot where they\u0027d initially seen the other vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie scampered into the forward cabin and he heard her rummaging through the compartments. She reappeared with a light in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted the throttle to idle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie raked the water with the flashlight\u0027s beam. He heard sirens in the distance and spotted three boats with flashing emergency lights rounding the shore of one of the islands, heading for Torcello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusy night for the Italian police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See anything?\" he asked. \"Somebody hit the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had to be careful not to plow over them, but that was going to be difficult in the pitch darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" Stephanie hollered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rushed to her side and spotted a figure struggling. Only a second was needed for him to know that it was Cassiopeia. Before he could react, Stephanie tossed the flashlight aside and leaped into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bolted back to the helm and maneuvered the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to the other side of the deck just as Stephanie and Cassiopeia waded close. He reached down and grabbed hold of Cassiopeia, yanking her out of the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laid her limp body on the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stringed bow and arrow quiver was strapped to her shoulder. Certainly a story unto itself, he thought. He rolled Cassiopeia onto her side. \"Cough it all out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed to ignore him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe popped her on the back. \"Cough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to spit out water, gagging on each exhale, but at least she was breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie climbed out of the lagoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s woozy. But she wasn\u0027t hit by any bullets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tough shot in the dark from a wobbly deck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept lightly pounding her spine and more water sprayed from her lungs. She seemed to be coming around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You all right?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes seemed to reacquire their focus. He knew the look. She\u0027d been popped on the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cotton?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it would be pointless to ask why you have a bow and arrows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed her head. \"That piece of-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was he?\" Stephanie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stephanie? What are you doing here?\" Cassiopeia reached out and touched Stephanie\u0027s wet clothes. \"You pulled me out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I owed you that one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone had only been told some of what had happened last fall in Washington while he was under siege in the Sinai, but apparently these two had bonded. At the moment, though, he needed to know, \"How many are dead inside the Museo di Torcello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia ignored him and reached back, searching for something. Her hand reappeared with a Glock. She shook the water from it, drying the barrel. Great selling point about Glocks, which he knew from firsthand experience-the damn things were nearly waterproof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose to her feet. \"We need to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that Viktor in the boat with you?\" he asked, irritation now in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Cassiopeia had recovered her wits and he saw anger again in her eyes. \"I told you earlier this doesn\u0027t concern you. Not your fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right. There\u0027s all kinds of crap swirling here that you don\u0027t know a thing about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the bastards in Asia killed Ely, on orders of Irina Zovastina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Ely?\" Stephanie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long story,\" he said. \"One that\u0027s causing us a lot of problems at the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia continued to shake the fog from her brain and water from her gun. \"We need to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kill anybody?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roasted one of them like a marshmallow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll regret that later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the counseling. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided to delay her and tried, \"Where was Viktor headed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swung the bow off her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henrik sent you that thing?\" he asked, recalling the cloth bag from the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I said, Cotton, this isn\u0027t your affair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie stepped forward. \"Cassiopeia. I don\u0027t know half of what\u0027s happening here, but I know enough to see that you\u0027re not thinking. Like you told me last fall, use your head. Let us help. What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, too, Stephanie. Back off. I\u0027ve been waiting for these men for months. Finally, tonight, I had them in my sights. I got one. I want the other. And yes, it\u0027s Viktor. He was there when Ely died. They burned him to death. For what?\" Her voice had steadily risen. \"I want to know why he died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s find out,\" Malone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia paced with an unsteady gait. At the moment she was trapped, nowhere to go, and she was apparently smart enough to know that neither of them was going to back off. She rested the palms of her hands on the deck rail and gathered her breath. Finally, she said, \"Okay. Okay. You\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered if they were being placated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia stood still. \"This one\u0027s personal. More than either of you realize.\" She hesitated. \"It\u0027s more than Ely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the second time she\u0027d insinuated as much. \"How about you tell us what\u0027s at stake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted desperately to help her and arguing seemed pointless. So he glanced at Stephanie, who knew what his eyes were asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded her approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped toward the helm and powered up the engines. More police cruisers passed, heading for Torcello. He aimed the boat for Venice and the distant lights of Viktor\u0027s retreating craft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about a corpse,\" Cassiopeia said. \"There\u0027ll be nothing left of the body or that museum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to know something. \"Stephanie, any word on Naomi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing since yesterday. That\u0027s why I came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Naomi?\" Cassiopeia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my business,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia did not challenge him. Instead she said, \"Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at his watch. The luminous dial read 12:45 A.M. \"Like I told you. Lots going on here, and we know exactly where Viktor\u0027s headed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSAMARKAND\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:50 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVINCENTI\u0027S SPINE TINGLED. TRUE, HE\u0027D ORDERED PEOPLE KILLED, one just yesterday, but this was different. He was about to embark on a bold path. One that would not only make him the wealthiest person on the planet, but also secure him a place in history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn lay a little over an hour away. He sat in the rear of the car while O\u0027Conner and two other men approached a house shielded behind a thicket of blooming chestnut trees and a tall iron fence, everything owned by Irina Zovastina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO\u0027Conner drew near to the car and Vincenti lowered the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The two guards are dead. We took them out with no trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any other security?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it.

The two other men they\u0027d hired for tonight held Karyn Walde\u0027s nurse, an older woman with a stern face, wearing a bathrobe and slippers. A frightened look filled her Asian features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" he said to her, \"that you care for Ms. Walde.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that you resent how the Supreme Minister treats her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s terrible to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pleased their intelligence had been accurate. \"I understand that Karyn is suffering. Her illness is progressing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the minister won\u0027t let her rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe signaled and the two men released their hold. He stepped close and said, \"I\u0027m here to relieve her suffering. But I need your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze carried suspicion. \"Where are the guards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead. Wait here while I go see her.\" He motioned. \"Down the hall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe switched on one of the bedside lamps and gazed at the pathetic sight lying prone beneath a pale pink comforter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaryn Walde breathed with the help of bottled oxygen and a respirator. An intravenous bag fed one arm. He removed a hypodermic, inserted the needle into one of its IV ports, and let it dangle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman\u0027s eyes opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to wake up,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked a few times, trying to register what was happening. She then pushed herself up from the pillow. \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know they\u0027ve been in short supply lately, but I\u0027m a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I know you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No reason why you would. But I know you. Tell me, what was it like to love Irina Zovastina?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely an odd question from a stranger in the middle of the night, but she only shrugged. \"Why would you care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve dealt with her many years. Never once have I ever felt any affection either from or toward her. How did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a question I\u0027ve asked myself many times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced around at the room\u0027s decor. Elegant and expensive, like the rest of the house. \"You live well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Small comfort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet when you became ill, knew you were HIV positive, you returned to her. Came back after several years of estrangement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know a lot about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To come back you must have felt something for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laid herself back on the pillow. \"In some ways, she\u0027s foolish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listened closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She fashions herself Achilles to my Patroclus. Or worse, she\u0027s Alexander and thinks of me as Hephaestion. I\u0027ve listened to those stories many times. You know the Iliad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Achilles felt responsible for Patroclus\u0027 death. He allowed his lover to lead men into battle, pretending to be him. Alexander the Great felt great guilt over Hephaestion dying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know your literature and history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know a thing. I\u0027ve just listened to her ramble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is she foolish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wants to save me, yet can\u0027t bring herself to say it. She comes, stares at me, chastises me, even attacks me, but always she\u0027s trying to save me. When it came to me I knew she was weak, so I returned to where I knew I\u0027d be looked after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet you obviously hate her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assure you, whoever you are, that someone in my shoes has little choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak freely to a stranger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have nothing to hide or fear. My life\u0027s about over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve given up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I have a choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided to see what else he could learn. \"Zovastina is in Venice. Right now. Searching for something. Are you aware of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t surprise me. She\u0027s the great hero, on the great hero\u0027s quest. I\u0027m the weak lover. We\u0027re not to ask or challenge the hero, just accept what\u0027s offered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have listened to a lot of nonsense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"She imagines herself my savior, so I allow it. Why not? Besides, tormenting her is my only pleasure. Life\u0027s choices and all that bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes life is fickle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see that she was intrigued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are the guards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my nurse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine. I believe she actually cares for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight nod. \"She does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her prime this woman would have been formidable-able to seduce both men and women-easy to see how Zovastina would have been attracted to her. But it was also easy to see how the two women would have clashed. Both alpha-females. Both accustomed to having their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been watching you for some time,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s not much to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, if you could have anything in this world, what would it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gravely ill soul lying before him seemed to seriously consider his inquiry. He saw the words as they formed in her mind. He\u0027d seen the same resolution before, in others long ago, facing similar dire consequences, clinging to little or no hope since neither science nor religion could save them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when she drew a breath and mouthed her answer, he was not disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To live.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-venetian-betrayal-cotton-malone-3/page-17.html","bookId":2234,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM"}
