But I worry. He falls into bad habits without support.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have any thoughts about that, Gideon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his tone neutral. “I knew what I was getting into when I married her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Always a good thing.” Dr. Petersen smiled. “But that doesn’t tell me much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon’s hand lifted from my shoulder and went to my hair, playing with it. “As a married man yourself, Doctor, you know there are concessions a husband makes to keep the peace. Cary is one of mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat hurt me to hear, but I understood Cary had started out with a clean slate with Gideon. Then he’d made several wrong moves—like having group sex in our living room one night—that put marks against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Petersen looked at me. “So you’re attempting to balance the needs of both your husband and your best friend. Is that stressful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not fun,” I hedged, “but it’s not really balancing, either. My marriage—and Gideon—comes first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell Gideon liked hearing that when his hand fisted gently—possessively—in my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But,” I continued, “I don’t want to overwhelm Gideon and I don’t want Cary to feel abandoned. Moving a small bag of stuff over every day makes the change gradual.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the thought was out, I had to admit how maternal that sounded. Still, I couldn’t help wanting to protect those in my life who needed it, especially from pain my own actions might cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve mentioned everyone but you,” he pointed out. “How do you feel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The penthouse is starting to feel like home. The only thing I’m struggling with is our sleeping arrangements. We’ve been sharing a bed, but Gideon wants us to sleep separately and I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because of the nightmares?” Dr. Petersen asked, his gaze on Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you had any lately?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy husband nodded. “Not the really bad ones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What constitutes a really bad nightmare? One that you act out physically?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon’s chest expanded on a deep breath. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor looked at me again. “You understand the risk, Eva, but you still want to share a bed with Gideon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, of course.” My heartbeat quickened at the memories. Gideon had pinned me down viciously, ugly words of pain and fury spilling out in terrible threats of violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the grip of a nightmare, Gideon didn’t see me, he saw Hugh—a man he wanted to tear apart with his bare hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Many happily married couples sleep separately,” Dr. Petersen pointed out. “The reasons are varied—the husband snores, the wife steals the covers, et cetera—but they find that sleeping apart is more conducive to marital harmony than sleeping together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straightened away from Gideon, needing them both to understand. “I like sleeping next to him. Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night and I watch him sleep. Sometimes, I wake up and I don’t even open my eyes, I just listen to him breathing. I can smell him, feel his warmth. I sleep better when he’s beside me. And I know he sleeps better, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Angel.” Gideon’s hand stroked my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking over my shoulder, I caught his gaze. His face was impassive. Gorgeous. His eyes, however, were dark blue pools of pain. I reached for his hand. “I know it hurts you. I’m sorry. I just need us to work toward having that. I don’t want us to ever give up on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What you describe,” Dr. Petersen said gently, “is intimacy, Eva. And it’s one of the true joys of marriage. It’s understandable that you crave it. Everyone does to some extent. For you and Gideon, however, it probably seems particularly important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It does to me,” I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you implying it’s different for me?” Gideon said tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I twisted to face him. “Please don’t get defensive. This isn’t your fault. I’m not blaming you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know how shitty this makes me feel?” he accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish you wouldn’t take it personally, Gideon. It’s—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My wife wants to watch me sleep and I can’t even give her that,” he snapped. “What is that, if not fucking personal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, let’s discuss,” Dr. Petersen said quickly, drawing our attention to him. “The root of this conversation is a craving for intimate familiarity. Human beings, by nature, desire intimacy, but childhood sexual abuse survivors can find this need especially acute.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-83.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
