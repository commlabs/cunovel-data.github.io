He wasn\u0027t going to leave his mistress\u0027s side until she was safely in her husband\u0027s arms. Yes, he would go along with the assembly. And if he could remember how to hang onto a mount, he just might lead them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina had no idea of the worry she was causing her staff. She huddled under the covers, hugging Lyon\u0027s pillow to her bosom, weeping softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her tears were spent, she slowly climbed out of the bed and went in search of her scissors. She would cut her hair and begin the mourning ritual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, her Aunt Patricia was dead. Christina would never again acknowledge her existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe task of cutting several inches off the length of curls took little time. Kathleen rushed into the room with a pale green gown draped over her arm. Her eyes widened when she saw what her mistress had done to her hair, but she held her silence and assisted her mistress in changing her clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will be ready to leave in ten minutes\u0027 time,\" Kathleen whispered to Christina before leaving her alone again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina walked over to the windows to stare out at the land. She thought about her family. How Merry would love this country. Black Wolf would be impressed, too, though he\u0027d never acknowledge it, of course. He was too arrogant to make such an admission. He\u0027d be perplexed, too, if he knew that Lyon owned so much land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite Eagle would be more impressed with Lyon\u0027s stables. The horses had been bred for strength and endurance, and the new foals, so feisty, so magnificent, were proof of Lyon\u0027s careful selection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are not dead.\" Christina\u0027s voice was filled with anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to cry again. No, they weren\u0027t dead. The letter was a lie. She would have known, in her heart, if anything had harmed her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have known,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it was trickery. Christina didn\u0027t know how her aunt had accomplished the foul deed, but she was behind the deception. The evil woman wanted Christina to believe that her Indian family was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina didn\u0027t understand the Countess\u0027s reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon would be able to explain. He was a cunning warrior who knew all the ways of the jackals in this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a desperate need to get to her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina would demand that he take her into his arms and tell her how much he loved her. And then she would make him kiss her. His touch would take the pain and the sorrow away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would demand and Lyon would give. It was his duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lyon arrived at his townhouse in London proper, Sir Fenton Richards was waiting on his doorstoop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichards wasn\u0027t smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon was immediately on his guard. \"You\u0027ve put on weight,\" he announced in lieu of a greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have put on weight,\" Richards admitted with a grin. He patted his belly to emphasize just where the extra pounds had settled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon began to relax. His friend\u0027s manner told him all he needed to know. There had to be a problem, for Richards wouldn\u0027t have waited for him just to pay a social call. Yet his casual manner indicated it wasn\u0027t a terribly important problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichards turned to bang on the door. It was immediately opened by a servant. Lyon motioned to his man to take the reins and see to his mount, then led his friend inside to the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichards lumbered in behind him. He was a large man with a bushy beard and silver-tipped hair. He was softspoken, stoop-shouldered, and usually guarded in his expressions. Except when he was in Lyon\u0027s company. The older man could relax then, because his trust in his young friend was absolute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All hell has broken loose, and with a vengeance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon raised an eyebrow over the mildly given remark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rhone is under house arrest,\" Richards announced. He settled himself in one of the two leather-backed chairs in front of Lyon\u0027s desk before adding, \"I tried to intervene, but the charges had already been filed by Wellingham. It\u0027s up to you to take care of the matter now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was he found out?\" Lyon asked. He sat down behind his desk and began to sift through the stack of letters and invitations piled in the center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichards chuckled. \"You\u0027re taking our friend\u0027s demise well,\" he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you said, it\u0027s up to me now. I\u0027ll take care of the matter. Tell me what happened. How—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wellingham noticed the bandage on Rhone\u0027s wrist. One guess led to another after that. Rhone takes too many chances,\" Richards announced. \"It seems he ran into Wellingham on his way home from your wedding. I was sorry I missed the celebration, by the way,\" he added. \"Couldn\u0027t be helped. I just got back to London the day before yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a small affair,\" Lyon said. \"You\u0027ll have to come to Lyonwood to meet my Christina,\" he added. \"How\u0027s Rhone taking the situation?\" he asked, turning the subject back to the immediate problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With his usual flair for nonsense,\" Richards commented dryly. \"Since he can\u0027t get out, he\u0027s had a party at his townhouse every night. There\u0027s another one scheduled for this eve, as a matter of fact. I thought I\u0027d drop in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichards paused to give Lyon a long, meaningful look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon grinned. \"I\u0027ll be there,\" he told his friend. \"Don\u0027t bring any valuables with you, Richards. You wouldn\u0027t want to be robbed by Jack, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, then Jack will be making an appearance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may wager on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t Rhone be amused?\" Richards commented. He straightened in his chair, his manner suddenly brisk. \"Now that Rhone\u0027s problem is taken care of, I\u0027ll move on to my other reason for coming to see you. Your wife\u0027s father, to be exact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichards had just captured Lyon\u0027s full attention. He pushed the letters aside and leaned forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know your wife\u0027s father is on his way to London?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon shook his head. \"How would you know him?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name is Edward Stalinsky, but of course you would know that,\" Richards said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon nodded. He did know his father-in-law\u0027s full name, but only because he\u0027d watched Christina sign the marriage certificate. \"Yes, Baron Stalinsky,\" he said, urging Richards along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did a favor for us a very long time ago. The Brisbane affair. Do you remember hearing about that mishap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMishap? Lyon shook his head. \"I remember you called the Battle of Waterloo Napoleon\u0027s mishap,\" he said. \"Tell me about this Brisbane business. I have no memory of it in my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were a young lad. Still, I thought you might have heard of the matter sooner or later,\" Richards said, his voice whisper-soft. \"I forget I\u0027m a good twenty years your senior. I suppose I should let the younger ones take charge,\" he added with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve tried to resign several times since I\u0027ve worked for you,\" Lyon answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was eager to hear Richards recount the happening to him and learn all he could about Christina\u0027s father, but he knew his friend well enough to understand he would take his usual slow time getting to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m like an old hound,\" Richards said. \"The scent of trouble still captures my mind. Brisbane was an Englishman,\" he continued, finally getting to the heart of the matter. \"You might say he was our Benedict Arnold. He turned traitor, sold a few secrets, then his family began to worry his conscience. He had a wife and four little girls. He came to us and confessed his transgressions. We, or rather my predecessors, worked a promise with the man. We were after bigger fish, you see. With Brisbane\u0027s full cooperation, we set a trap to catch his superiors. Baron Stalinsky acted as our intermediary. I don\u0027t remember how he got involved,\" he added with a shrug. \"The baron did all he could—took every precaution, I\u0027m told—but the plan failed miserably all the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brisbane\u0027s wife and children were murdered. Their throats were cut. The atrocity was made to look as if Brisbane had killed them and then turned the blade on himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t believe that\u0027s what really happened, do you?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not. I think one of Brisbane\u0027s superiors found out about the trap,\" Richards answered. \"Either by chance or by payment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Baron Stalinsky? Did he continue to work with the government?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He married shortly after the Brisbane business and returned to his home. He was outraged by the horror he\u0027d witnessed. He was the first to find the bodies, you see, and he refused to lend England a hand after that. Can\u0027t fault the man. I wasn\u0027t there, but I can imagine the nightmare Stalinsky walked into.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you kept in touch with the Baron since that time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of us have,\" Richards said. \"But several of his old friends have received notice from him that he\u0027ll be arriving in England soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder if he knows he has a daughter now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good God. You mean to tell me he didn\u0027t know?\" Richards asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father and daughter have never met. I believe the baron thought his wife and child had died years ago. For that matter, everyone I talked to thought the Baron had passed away, too. Sir Reynolds was one to make that speculation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, there was surprise when the letters arrived,\" Richards said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder what the baron has been up to all these years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard that a year or so later Stalinsky lost his kingdom. Then he vanished. We never had reason to keep track of the man,\" Richards added. A frown marred his expression. \"Something\u0027s bothering you. What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any reason at all to distrust the baron?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, so that\u0027s the itch, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me everything you know about the man,\" Lyon ordered. \"Everything you can remember. I realize it was a long time ago,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s very little to tell. I was young and impressionable back then, but I do remember being in awe of the man. He wasn\u0027t much older than I was. He had a commanding presence. I envied him. Lyon, damn it all, you\u0027ve got my guts churning. Now you tell me what you know about the baron,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any information to give you. I\u0027ve never met him. Christina hasn\u0027t either, but she\u0027s afraid of him. When you meet my wife, you\u0027ll understand the full force of that comment. Christina isn\u0027t a woman who frightens easily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already know that much about her,\" Richards said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She married you, didn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon grinned. \"Yes, she did,\" he said. \"Not very willingly, but…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichards snorted with laughter. \"Perhaps she\u0027s afraid of her father because of the unusual circumstances,\" he said after a moment\u0027s pause. \"Not to know one\u0027s father and then finally to meet him…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Lyon said, shaking his head. \"Her fear is based on something else. She called him a jackal. Keep your guard up when you\u0027re with the baron, Richards. My instincts and Christina\u0027s fears are enough to sway my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re that uneasy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why hasn\u0027t Christina explained the real reasons for her fears, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s very stubborn,\" Lyon announced with a smile that told Richards he thought that was a noble quality. \"And she is just beginning to trust me. It\u0027s a fragile bond, Richards. For that reason, I\u0027m not going to prod her. Christina will tell me when she\u0027s ready, and not a minute before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you trust her judgment?\" Richards asked. \"You trust her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\" His answer was given without hesitation, his voice emphatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the full realization settled in his mind… and in his heart. He did trust her. Completely. \"In all matters.\" Lyon acknowledged in a soft voice. \"God only knows why, but I do,\" he told his friend before he started to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s amusing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. My little wife and I have been playing a game with each other,\" Lyon confessed. \"It\u0027s amusing, you see, because neither one of us has realized it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" Richards confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m only just beginning to understand,\" Lyon said. \"Christina hides her past from me… just as I\u0027ve been hiding my past from her. I think she believes I\u0027ll find her inferior in some way,\" he added. \"I wouldn\u0027t, of course, but she needs to learn to trust me enough to believe it in her heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would be happy to investigate your wife\u0027s past for you,\" Richards volunteered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I sent men to France to make inquiries, but I\u0027m going to call them home. I will not look into her past, and I don\u0027t want you to either, Richards. In time she\u0027ll tell me what she wants me to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And will you tell her your secrets?\" Richards asked. His voice was whisper-soft. \"You have no cause to worry, Lyon. I\u0027ve never been able to trust a man the way I trust you. Your loyalty to your country has always been absolute. That is why you were always given the most difficult assignments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon was surprised by the vehemence in his friend\u0027s voice. Richards wasn\u0027t a man given to compliments. In all their years working together, Lyon had never heard such praise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027ve got me worried about Stalinsky,\" Richards continued. \"I\u0027ll start looking into his affairs immediately. There\u0027s another problem, however,\" he added. He scratched his beard in an absentminded fashion. \"The department had hopes that you\u0027d give a reception honoring your father-in-law when he arrives. Heaven help us, there\u0027s already talk of knighthood. Some of the older gentlemen remember with exaggerated recall the noble deeds Baron Stalinsky accomplished for the good of England. I\u0027m going to look into those deeds as well,\" he added with a brisk nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A reception isn\u0027t going to sit well with Christina,\" Lyon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichards gave a discreet cough, then said, \"Lyon, I certainly don\u0027t want to be the one to tell you how to manage your marriage, but it would seem to me that you must simply question your wife about her father at the first opportunity. Order her to explain her fears to you. Make her answer your questions, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestion her? Lyon felt like laughing. Since the minute he\u0027d met Christina he\u0027d done nothing but question her. \"There will be no questions. She\u0027ll tell me—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know,\" Richards interrupted with a long sigh. \"In her own time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s about it,\" Lyon answered. \"Until then, it\u0027s my duty to keep her safe.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-s-lady-crown-s-spies-1/page-33.html","bookId":1792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:35 PM"}
