It\u0027s Isabel, probably wanting advice about Paco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know what time it is?\" I ask when I answer the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead, Brittany. He\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" I ask frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paco. And ... I didn\u0027t know if I should call you, but you\u0027ll find out eventually that Alex was there also and--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers tighten on the phone. \"Where\u0027s Alex? Is he okay? Please tell me he\u0027s okay. I beg of you, Isa. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a second, I wait for her to say the dreaded words. He\u0027s dead. But she doesn\u0027t. \"He\u0027s in surgery at Lakeshore Hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she finishes the sentence, I\u0027m ripping off my pj\u0027s and frantically throwing on clothes. Grabbing my keys, I head out the door still holding my cell phone tight as Isabel relays all of the details she knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drug deal went bad and Paco and Hector are dead. Alex was shot, and is in surgery. That\u0027s all she knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,\" I chant throughout the ride to the hospital after I hang up with Isabel. When I spent the evening with Alex last night, I was sure he would choose me over the drug deal. He might have betrayed our love, but I can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep sobs rack me. Paco assured me yesterday he was going to make sure Alex didn\u0027t do the drug deal but . . . oh, God. Paco took Alex\u0027s place and ended up dead. Poor, sweet Paco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m trying to drown out the images of Alex not making it through the surgery. A part of me will die with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask the hospital receptionist where I should wait for updates on Alex\u0027s condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady asks me to spell his name, then types it on her keyboard. The sound is making me crazy. She\u0027s taking so long I want to grab her shoulders and shake her into going faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman looks at me with curious eyes. \u0027Are you family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady shakes her head in disbelief, then shrugs. \"Alejandro Fuentes was brought in with a gunshot wound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to be okay, right?\" I cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady punches her keyboard again. \"It looks like he\u0027s been in surgery all morning, Miss Fuentes. The waiting room is the orange room down the hall on the right. The doctor will inform you of your brother\u0027s prognosis after surgery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clutch the counter. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the waiting room, I freeze as soon as I see Alex\u0027s mother and two brothers huddled in the corner, sitting on orange-colored hospital chairs. His mother looks up first. Her eyes are bloodshot and tears stream down her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand goes to my mouth and I can\u0027t help a sob from escaping; I can\u0027t hold it in. Tears well in my eyes, and through the blurriness I see Mrs. Fuentes open her arms to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverwhelmed with emotion, I run into her embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand twitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my head from Alex\u0027s hospital bed. I\u0027ve sat beside him through the night waiting for him to wake up. His mother and brothers haven\u0027t left his side, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor said it could be hours before he\u0027s conscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wet a paper towel from the hospital room sink and touch it to Alex\u0027s forehead. I\u0027ve done this throughout the night as he sweated and thrashed in a restless sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flutter. I can tell he\u0027s fighting the sedation as he forces them open. \"Where am I?\" His voice is scratchy and faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hospital,\" his mom says as she rushes to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were shot,\" Carlos adds, his voice full of agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex\u0027s brows draw together in confusion. \"Paco . . . ,\" he says, his voice hitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think about that right now,\" I say, trying to hold my emotion in with little success. I need to be strong for him now and I won\u0027t let him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think he\u0027s about to reach for my hand, but a pained expression crosses his face and he pulls back. I have so much to tell him, so much to say. I wish I could have a Do Over Day and change the past. I wish I could have saved Paco and Alex from their fates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes are still glassy from drowsiness when he looks at me and says, \"Why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as his mom rubs his arm, trying to lend him comfort. \"Brittany stayed all night, Alex. She\u0027s worried about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me talk to her. Alone,\" he says weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brothers and mother exit the room, giving us privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we\u0027re alone, he winces in pain as he adjusts his position. Then he glares at me. \"I want you to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t mean that,\" I say, reaching for his hand. He can\u0027t mean it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jerks his hand away, as if my touch burned him. \"Yes. I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, we\u0027ll get through this. I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns his head and focuses on the floor. He swallows and clears his throat. \"I fucked you because of a bet, Brittany,\" he says softly, but his words come out crystal clear. \"It didn\u0027t mean anythin\u0027 to me. You don\u0027t mean anythin\u0027 to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step back as Alex\u0027s hurtful words seep into my brain. \"No,\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and me ... it was a game. I bet Lucky his RX-7 that I could fuck you before Thanksgiving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alex referred to our lovemaking as a \"fuck,\" I cringed. Galling it sex would have left a bitter taste in my mouth. Calling it a \"fuck\" makes my stomach churn. I keep my hands limp at my sides. I want to make him take back his words. \"You\u0027re lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns his gaze from the floor and looks right into my eyes. Oh, God. There\u0027s no emotion there. His eyes are as steely as his words. \"You\u0027re pathetic if you think this thing between us was real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head violently. \"Don\u0027t hurt me, Alex. Not you. Not now.\" My lips are trembling as I mouth a silent but pleading, \"Please.\" When he doesn\u0027t respond I take another step back, almost stumbling as I think about me, the real me only Alex knows. In a pitiful whisper I tell him, \"I trusted you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was your mistake, not mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touches his left shoulder and winces in pain before a group of his friends file into the room. They offer him condolences and sympathy while I stand frozen in the corner, completely unnoticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it all for the bet?\" I say above the commotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe six or so people in the room stare at me. Even Alex. Isabel steps toward me, but I hold up a hand and stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it true? Did Alex make a bet to have sex with me?\" I say, because I still can\u0027t wrap my brain around Alex\u0027s hurtful words. It can\u0027t be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes drift to him, but Alex\u0027s eyes penetrate my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her,\" Alex orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guy named Sam lifts his head up. \"Well, uh, yeah. He won Lucky\u0027s RX-7.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI back up to the hospital room door, trying to hold my head high. A cold, hard expression settles on Alex\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat threatens to close as I say, \"Congratulations, Alex. You win. I hope you like your new car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I grab the door handle to leave, Alex\u0027s steely glare turns to relief. I calmly walk out of the room. I hear Isabel come up behind me when I\u0027m in the hallway, but I run away from her, the hospital, and Alex. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t run from my heart. It hurts, deep inside my body. And I know I\u0027ll never be the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 56 Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been in the hospital a week. I hate nurses, doctors, needles, tests . . . and especially hospital gowns. I think the longer I\u0027ve been in this place, the crabbier I\u0027ve gotten. Okay, so I probably shouldn\u0027t have sworn at the nurse who took out my catheter. It was her cheery disposition that pissed me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to see anyone. I don\u0027t want to talk to anyone. The less people involved in my life, the better. I shoved Brittany away and it killed me to hurt her. But I had no choice. The closer she got to me, the more her life was in danger. I couldn\u0027t let what happened to Paco happen to the girl I . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop thinking about her, I tell myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people I care about die, it\u0027s as simple as that. My dad. Now Paco. I was an idiot to think I could have it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen there\u0027s a knock at my door, I scream, \"Go away!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knock gets more persistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuckin\u0027 leave me alone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the door creaks open, I hurl a cup at the door. The cup doesn\u0027t hit a hospital employee; it hits Mrs. P. squarely in the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shit. Not you,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. P.\u0027s got new glasses, with rhinestones on them. \"That\u0027s not exactly the greeting I expected, Alex,\" she says. \"I can still give you a detention for cussing, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn on my side so I don\u0027t have to look at her. \"Did you come here to give me detention slips? \u0027Cause if you did, you can forget it. I\u0027m not goin\u0027 back to school. Thanks for visitin\u0027. Sorry you have to leave so soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going anywhere until you hear me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, please no. Anything except having to listen to her lecture. I push the button that calls the nurse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we help you, Alex?\" a voice bellows through the speaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m bein\u0027 tortured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. P. walks over to me and pulls the speaker out of my hand. \"He\u0027s joking. Sorry to bother you.\" She puts the remote speaker on the nightstand, deliberately out of my reach. \"Don\u0027t they give you happy pills in this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to be happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. P. leans forward, her straight bangs brushing the top of her glasses. \"Alex, I\u0027m sorry about what happened to Paco. He wasn\u0027t a student of mine, but I heard how close you two were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look out the window to avoid her. I don\u0027t want to talk about Paco. I don\u0027t want to talk about anything. \"Why\u0027d you come here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the rustling as she pulls something from her bag. \"I brought you some work to do, to catch up until you come back to class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not comin\u0027 back. I already told you, I\u0027m droppin\u0027 out. It shouldn\u0027t surprise you, Mrs. P. I\u0027m a gang member, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks around the bed, coming into my line of vision. \"I guess I was wrong about you. I would have bet you\u0027d be the one to break the mold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, maybe that was before my best friend got shot. It was supposed to be me, you know.\" I\u0027m looking at the chemistry book in her hand. All it does is remind me of what was, and what can never be. \"He wasn\u0027t supposed to die, dammit! I was!\" I yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. P. doesn\u0027t flinch. \"But you didn\u0027t. You think you\u0027re doing Paco a favor by quitting school and giving up? Consider it a gift he gave you, Alex, instead of a curse. Paco isn\u0027t coming back. You can.\" Mrs. P. places the chem book on the window ledge. \"I\u0027ve had more students die than I ever thought possible. My husband urges me to quit Fairfield and teach at some school without gang members who live their lives only to die or end up as drug dealers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on the edge of my bed, she looks down at her hands. \"I stay at Fairfield hoping I can make a difference, be a role model. Dr. Aguirre believes we can bridge the gaps, and so do I. If I can just change one of my students\u0027 lives, I can--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Change the world?\" I interject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t. It is what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up at me, totally undefeated. \"Oh, Alex. You\u0027re so wrong. It is what you make it. If you think you can\u0027t change the world, then go on and follow the path already carved out for you. But there are other roads to choose, they\u0027re just harder to trudge through. Changing the world isn\u0027t easy, but I sure as hell am going to keep trying. Are you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-42.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
