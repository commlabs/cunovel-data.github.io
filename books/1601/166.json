The other messenger was killed when one of your raken was hit and fell from the sky onto our camp\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe suldam raised an eyebrow. \"I am Catrona\", she said. \"And you will do exactly as I say while in camp\". She turned and waved for Min to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin hurried gratefully behind the woman as they crossed the ground. The Seanchan camp was very different from Bryne’s. They had raken to fly their messages and reports, not to mention an empress to protect. They had set their camp away from the hostilities. It also looked far tidier than Bryne\u0027s camp, which had been nearly destroyed and rebuilt, and which included people from many different countries and military backgrounds. The Seanchan camp was homogeneous, full of trained soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least that was the way Min decided to interpret its orderliness. Seanchan soldiers stood in ranks, silent, awaiting the call to battle. Sections of the camp had been marked with posts and ropes, everything clearly organized. Nobody bustled about. Men walked with quiet purpose or waited at parade rest. Speak what criticism one would about the Seanchan—and Min had a number of things she could add to that conversation—they certainly were organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe suldam led Min to a section of camp where several men stood at ledgers set on tall desks. Wearing robes and bearing the half-shaved head of upper servants, they quietly made notations. Immodestly dressed young women carrying lacquered trays threaded their way between the desks, placing on them thin white cups of steaming black liquid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have we lost any raken in the last little while?\" Catrona asked the men. \"Was one hit by an enemy marath\u0027damane while in flight, and could it have crashed into General Bryne\u0027s camp?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A report just came in of such a thing\", a servant said, bowing. \"I am surprised that you have heard of it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatrona’s eyebrow inched a little higher as she inspected Min.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hadn’t expected the truth?\" Min asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\", the suldam said. She moved her hand, replacing a knife into its sheath at her side. \"Follow\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin let out a breath. Well, she had dealt with Aiel before; the Seanchan couldn’t possibly be as prickly as they were. Catrona led the way along another path in the camp, and Min found herself growing anxious. How long had it been since Bryne had sent her? Was it too late?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight, but the Seanchan liked things well guarded. There were two soldiers at every intersection of paths, standing with raised spears, watching through those awful helmets of theirs. Shouldn’t all of these men be out fighting? Eventually, Catrona led her to an actual building they had constructed here. It wasn’t a tent. It had walls that looked to be draped silk, stretched into wooden frames, a wooden floor and a ceiling covered with shingles. It probably broke down quickly to be transported, but it seemed frivolous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guards here were big fellows in armor of black and red. They had a wicked appearance. Catrona passed them as they saluted her. She and Min entered the building, and Catrona bowed. Not to the ground—the Empress wasn’t in the room, it appeared—but still deep, since many members of the Blood were inside. Catrona glanced at Min. \"Bow, you fool!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I’ll be fine standing\", Min said, folding her arms as she regarded the commanders inside. Standing at their forefront was a familiar figure. Mat wore silken Seanchan clothing—she had heard he was in this camp—but he topped it with his familiar hat. He had an eyepatch covering one eye. So that viewing had finally come to pass, had it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat looked up at her and grinned. \"Min!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m a total fool\", she said. \"I could have just said I knew you. They’d have brought me right here without all of the fuss\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t know, Min\", Mat said. \"They rather like fuss around here. Don’t you, Galgan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wide-shouldered man with a thin crest of white hair on his otherwise shaven head eyed Mat, as if uncertain what to make of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mat\", Min said, clearing her mind. \"General Bryne needs cavalry\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat grunted. \"I don’t doubt it. He’s been pushing his troops hard, even the Aes Sedai. Man ought to be given a medal for that. I’ve never seen one of those women budge so much as to take a step indoors when a man suggests, even if she’s standing in the rain. First Legion, Galgan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will do\", Galgan said, \"so long as the Sharans don’t manage to get across the ford\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won’t\", Mat said. \"Bryne has set up a good defensive position that should punish the Shadow, with a little encouragement. Laero lendhae an indemela\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\" Galgan asked, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin missed it, too. Something about a flag? She had been studying the Old Tongue lately, but Mat spoke it so quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm, what?\" Mat said. \"You’ve never heard it before? It’s a saying of the Fallen Army of Kardia\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" Galgan sounded baffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind\", Mat said. \"Tylee, would you care to lead your legion on to the battlefield, assuming the good General approves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would be honored, Raven Prince\", said a woman in a breastplate standing nearby, four plumes rising from the helmet she held under her arm. \"I have wanted to watch the actions of this Gareth Bryne more directly\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat glanced to Galgan, who rubbed his chin, inspecting his maps. \"Take your legion, Lieutenant-General Khirgan, as the Raven Prince suggests\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And\", Mat added, \"we need to watch those Sharan archers. They’re going to move north along the river for a better shot at Bryne’s right flank\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be certain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s just obvious\", Mat said, tapping at the map. \"Send a raken to make sure, if you want\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalgan hesitated, then gave the order. Min wasn’t certain that she was needed any longer, so she started to walk away, but Mat caught her by the arm. \"Hey. I could . . . uh . . . use you, Min\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use me?\" she asked flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make use of you\", Mat said. \"That’s what I meant. I’ve had trouble with the words coming out of my mouth lately. Only the stupid ones seem to make it. Anyway, could you . . . uh . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-166.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
