{"id":99761,"no":53,"title":"Page 53","content":"\u003cp\u003eMe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 35\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been waiting in the indoor garden, and I jumped up as soon as I heard the front door slam accompanied by the mutter of voices. But close as I was to the entrance, I still only caught a glimpse of a red-soaked Shrapnel and Maximus restraining an equally bloody stranger before they disappeared toward the entrance to the underground stone staircase. More vampires I didn\u0027t recognize appeared and disappeared just as quickly, one of them cradling a body with achingly familiar curly brown hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen. Tears pricked my eyes that I fought back. I\u0027d grieve for him properly later. Right now, I had to trap the vampire responsible for his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there shortly,\" Vlad said in a tone I never wanted to hear directed at me. Then he strode toward me, smelling strongly of smoke and charred meat, but as usual, without a singe mark on him. The only things that marred his gunmetal-colored shirt and black pants were smears of red that required no explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vlad-\" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After your vision, I wanted you to see for yourself that I\u0027m safe,\" he cut me off in a much gentler tone, \"but I must join Maximus and Shrapnel now. We only managed to take one of Szilagyi\u0027s men alive and I intend to question him myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d already turned away, moving with that inhuman speed toward the entrance of the staircase that led to the dungeon, when my voice chased after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt he knows where he is. Szilagyi considered anyone at that abbey expendable since he intended to flatten it with the mountain. Besides, I know how to find him tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped him cold. He whirled to face me, green sparking in his coppery gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" A single word heavy with surprise and lethal intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to like it, but hear me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brow went up at that. Then he walked over in a leisurely way that somehow looked more dangerous than his supersonic bursts of speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Continue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around. I didn\u0027t see any of the dozen or so guards he had on this floor, but they were there. Maybe I should\u0027ve waited until we had more privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I trust everyone in this house implicitly, so speak,\" Vlad stated, overhearing that in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go into town by myself. I\u0027ll pretend to run away, then link to Szilagyi and tell him I want to switch sides. He\u0027ll snatch me up, take me to where he is, and then I\u0027ll link to you and you can come and fry him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad said nothing. Time stretched until the silence was painful. I couldn\u0027t tell what he was thinking from his expression. It was so bland, he might have been daydreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if he didn\u0027t have his men kill you on sight, Szilagyi won\u0027t let you discover where he is,\" he finally replied. \"He\u0027d make sure you were unconscious when you were transported to his location. Before you arrived, he\u0027d have you stripped of any objects, clothes included, that you could link through in order to contact me. Then, because he wouldn\u0027t trust you, he\u0027d torture you until he was satisfied that every word you told him was the truth. In short, it\u0027s a brave but stupid idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bristled. I might not be the world\u0027s most famous vampire like some arrogant people I knew, but I was not stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you think I connected to you when I was trapped at the club?\" I snapped. \"I hadn\u0027t seen you that day. Your essence wasn\u0027t on a single piece of my clothing, yet I still managed to link to you. Szilagyi could have me stripped naked without a single clue as to where I was, and in ten minutes, I could still be transmitting my location to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d brought something I touched with you,\" he muttered, his gaze narrowing. \"How did you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked the last few paces that separated us, taking his hand and not flinching at the stains that coated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in my skin,\" I said. \"The day before, you\u0027d traced my mouth with your hand and almost kissed me, so I followed the essence you imprinted on my lips back to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes glowed, emerald against bronze, as he brought my hand up and kissed it. The gloves I\u0027d put on meant I didn\u0027t feel that silky brush of flesh, but I imagined that I could still feel his heat through the current-repelling material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s no fool. He\u0027ll restrain you to keep you from touching anything, my dark-haired beauty. Even your lips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027ll imprint some of your essence onto my hand,\" I replied steadily. \"You\u0027re probably doing that right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat fathomless stare bore into mine. \"But how will you know where you are to tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By following essence trails left in that room. Someone\u0027s bound to know where they are. Even if I can\u0027t pull a location from that, I can link to whoever ties me up and follow that person. Szilagyi won\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing. You told me you can\u0027t hear my thoughts when I access my power. The rest of the time, it\u0027ll be the worst of the eighties songs in my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll know you\u0027re using your power, and be suspicious as to why.\" He dropped my hand. \"At best, he\u0027ll torture you until you can\u0027t block him from your thoughts and he learns what you intend to do. The answer is no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not her, Vlad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said it knowing full well that I was tearing open his deepest scar, but I didn\u0027t let that stop me. He was merciless and unapologetic when he knew he was right. I\u0027d be the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t rather die than fall into your enemy\u0027s hands,\" I continued. \"Even if everything you fear happens, I can take it. I\u0027ve relived every terrible thing that people-human and otherwise-do to each other, and though it broke me once, I came back stronger. Szilagyi kidnapped me, tried to kill me, did kill my friend Ben, and is now holding my dearest friend hostage. I want revenge, and I want Marty safely back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t f**king believe it,\" a feminine voice gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swung around. Gretchen was about fifty paces behind me in the hall, and from the way her mouth hung open in a classic expression of disbelief, she\u0027d overheard everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is wrong with you?\" she went on, now marching toward us. \"You\u0027d think getting electrocuted, cutting your wrist, and dating a vampire would be close enough to death for anyone, but no! You\u0027ve got to offer yourself up like a present to some freaky vampire who\u0027ll probably kill you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf all the times for my sister to come out of her room. \"Gretchen, now\u0027s not-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not what, a good time?\" she finished angrily. \"It never is with you, Leila! But since you\u0027re about to try and get killed again, I\u0027m not waiting. So here\u0027s a news flash: You\u0027re not the only one whose life went to shit when Mom died. And if Dad going emotionally catatonic afterward wasn\u0027t bad enough, you started shoving me away as soon as you came out of that coma.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-53.html","bookId":2011,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM"}
