Cal liked to know little bits like that, even though at the moment he was in the Hollow where the damp, cold wind blew like a mother and froze his eyeballs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyeballs were about the only things exposed as he zipped across Main Street from Coffee Talk, with a to-go cup of mochaccino in one gloved hand, to the Bowl-a-Rama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days a week, he tried for a counter breakfast at Ma\u0027s Pantry a couple doors down, and at least once a week he hit Gino\u0027s for dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father believed in supporting the community, the other merchants. Now that his dad was semiretired and Cal oversaw most of the businesses, he tried to follow that Hawkins tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shopped the local market even though the chain supermarket a couple miles outside town was cheaper. If he wanted to send a woman flowers, he resisted doing so with a couple of clicks on his computer and hauled himself down to the Flower Pot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had relationships with the local plumber, electrician, painter, the area craftsmen. Whenever possible, he hired for the town from the town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for his years away at college, he\u0027d always lived in the Hollow. It was his place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery seven years since his tenth birthday, he lived through the nightmare that visited his place. And every seven years, he helped clean up the aftermath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unlocked the front door of the Bowl-a-Rama, relocked it behind him. People tended to walk right in, whatever the posted hours, if the door wasn\u0027t locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d once been a little more casual about that, until one fine night while he\u0027d been enjoying some after-hours Strip Bowling with Allysa Kramer, three teenage boys had wandered in, hoping the video arcade was still open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesson learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked by the front desk, the six lanes and ball returns, the shoe rental counter and the grill, turned and jogged up the stairs to the squat second floor that held his (or his father\u0027s if his father was in the mood) office, a closet-sized john, and a mammoth storage area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set the coffee on the desk, stripped off gloves, scarf, watch cap, coat, insulated vest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe booted up his computer, put on the satellite radio, then sat down to fuel up on caffeine and get to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bowling center Cal \u0027s grandfather had opened in the postwar forties had been a tiny, three-lane gathering spot with a couple of pinball machines and counter Cokes. It expanded in the sixties, and again, when Cal \u0027s father took the reins, in the early eighties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, with its six lanes, its video arcade, and its private party room, it was the place to gather in the Hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCredit to Grandpa, Cal thought as he looked over the party reservations for the next month. But the biggest chunk of credit went to Cal \u0027s father, who\u0027d morphed the lanes into a family center, and had used its success to dip into other areas of business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe town bears our name, Jim Hawkins liked to say. Respect the name, respect the town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal did both. He\u0027d have left long ago otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour into the work, Cal glanced up at the rap on his doorjamb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, Cal. Just wanted you to know I was here. Thought I\u0027d go ahead and get that painting done in the rest rooms since you\u0027re not open this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Bill. Got everything you need?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure do.\" Bill Turner, five years, two months, and six days sober, cleared his throat. \"Wonder if maybe you\u0027d heard anything from Gage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in a couple months now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTender area, Cal thought when Bill just nodded. Boggy ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll just get started then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal watched as Bill moved away from the doorway. Nothing he could do about it, he told himself. Nothing he was sure he should do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid five years clean and sober make up for all those whacks with a belt, for all those shoves and slaps, all those curses? It wasn\u0027t for him to judge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced down at the thin scar that ran diagonally across his wrist. Odd how quickly that small wound had healed, and yet the mark of it remained-the only scar he carried. Odd how so small a thing had catapulted the town and people he knew into seven days of hell every seven years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould Gage come back this summer, as he had every seventh year? Cal couldn\u0027t see ahead, that wasn\u0027t his gift or his burden. But he knew when he, Gage, and Fox turned thirty-one, they would all be together in the Hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d sworn an oath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished up the morning\u0027s work, and because he couldn\u0027t get his mind off it, composed a quick e-mail to Gage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey. Where the hell are you? Vegas? Mozambique? Duluth? Heading out to see Fox. There\u0027s a writer coming into the Hollow to do research on the history, the legend, and what they\u0027re calling the anomalies. Probably got it handled, but thought you should know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s twenty-two degrees with a windchill factor of fifteen. Wish you were here and I wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d answer eventually, Cal thought as he sent the e-mail, then shut down the computer. Could be in five minutes or in five weeks, but Gage would answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to layer on the outer gear again over a long and lanky frame passed down by his father. He\u0027d gotten his outsized feet from dear old Dad, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark blond hair that tended to go as it chose was from his mother. He knew that only due to early photos of her, as she\u0027d been a soft, sunny blonde, perfectly groomed, throughout his memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes, a sharp, occasionally stormy gray, had been twenty-twenty since his tenth birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he zipped up his parka to head outside, he thought that the coat was for comfort only. He hadn\u0027t had so much as a sniffle in over twenty years. No flu, no virus, no hay fever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d fallen out of an apple tree when he\u0027d been twelve. He\u0027d heard the bone in his arm snap, had felt the breathless pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he\u0027d felt it knit together again-with more pain-before he\u0027d made it across the lawn to the house to tell his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he\u0027d never told her, he thought as he stepped outside into the ugly slap of cold. Why upset her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe covered the three blocks to Fox\u0027s office quickly, shooting out waves or calling back greetings to neighbors and friends. But he didn\u0027t stop for conversation. He might not get pneumonia or postnasal drip, but he was freaking tired of winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray, ice-crusted snow lay in a dirty ribbon along the curbs, and above, the sky mirrored the brooding color. Some of the houses or businesses had hearts and Valentine wreaths on doors and windows, but they didn\u0027t add a lot of cheer with the bare trees and winter-stripped gardens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hollow didn\u0027t show to advantage, to Cal \u0027s way of thinking, in February.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked up the short steps to the little covered porch of the old stone townhouse. The plaque beside the door read: FOX B. O\u0027DELL, ATTORNEY AT LAW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was something that always gave Cal a quick jolt and a quick flash of amusement. Even after nearly six years, he couldn\u0027t quite get used to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long-haired hippie freak was a goddamn lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped into the tidy reception area, and there was Alice Hawbaker at the desk. Trim, tidy in her navy suit with its bowed white blouse, her snowcap of hair and no-nonsense bifocals, Mrs. Hawbaker ran the office like a Border collie ran a herd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked sweet and pretty, and she\u0027d bite your ankle if you didn\u0027t fall in line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Mrs. Hawbaker. Boy, it is cold out there. Looks like we might get some more snow.\" He unwrapped his scarf. \"Hope you and Mr. Hawbaker are keeping warm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Warm enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard something in her voice that had him looking more closely as he pulled off his gloves. When he realized she\u0027d been crying he instinctively stepped to the desk. \"Is everything okay? Is-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s fine. Just fine. Fox is between appointments. He\u0027s in there sulking, so you go right on back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am. Mrs. Hawbaker, if there\u0027s anything-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just go right on back,\" she repeated, then made herself busy with her keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the reception area a hallway held a powder room on one side and a library on the other. Straight back, Fox\u0027s office was closed off by a pair of pocket doors. Cal didn\u0027t bother to knock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFox looked up when the doors slid open. He did appear to be sulking as his gilded eyes were broody and his mouth was in full scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat behind his desk, his feet, clad in hiking boots, propped on it. He wore jeans and a flannel shirt open over a white insulated tee. His hair, densely brown, waved around his sharp-featured face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s going on. My administrative assistant just gave me her notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" Fox shoved back from the desk and opened the minifridge for a can of Coke. He\u0027d never developed a taste for coffee. \"Try we, brother. We camped out at the Pagan Stone one fateful night, and screwed the monkey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal dropped into a chair. \"She\u0027s quitting because-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just quitting. They\u0027re leaving the Hollow, she and Mr. Hawbaker. And yeah, because.\" He took a long, greedy drink the way some men might take a pull on a bottle of whiskey. \"That\u0027s not the reason she gave me, but that\u0027s the reason. She said they decided to move to Minneapolis to be close to their daughter and grandchildren, and that\u0027s bogus. Why does a woman heading toward seventy, married to a guy older than dirt, pick up and move north? They\u0027ve got another kid lives outside of D.C., and they\u0027ve got strong ties here. I could tell it was bull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of what she said, or because you took a cruise through her head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First the one, then the other. Don\u0027t start on me.\" Fox gestured with the Coke, then slammed it down on his desk. \"I don\u0027t poke around for the fun of it. Son of a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they\u0027ll change their minds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t want to go, but they\u0027re afraid to stay. They\u0027re afraid it\u0027ll happen again-which I could tell her it will-and they just don\u0027t want to go through it again. I offered her a raise-like I could afford it-offered her the whole month of July off, letting her know that I knew what was at the bottom of it. But they\u0027re going. She\u0027ll give me until April first. April frickin\u0027 Fools,\" he ranted. \"To find somebody else, for her to show them the ropes. I don\u0027t know where the damn ropes are, Cal. I don\u0027t know half the stuff she does. She just does it. Anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got until April, maybe we\u0027ll think of something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t thought of the solution to this in twenty years plus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant your office problem. But yeah, I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about the other.\" Rising, he walked to Fox\u0027s window, looked out on the quiet side street. \"We\u0027ve got to end it. This time we\u0027ve got to end it. Maybe talking to this writer will help. Laying it out to someone objective, someone not involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asking for trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it is, but trouble\u0027s coming anyway. Five months to go. We\u0027re supposed to meet her at the house.\" Cal glanced at his watch. \"Forty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We?\" Fox looked blank for a moment. \"That\u0027s today? See, see, I didn\u0027t tell Mrs. H, so it didn\u0027t get written down somewhere. I\u0027ve got a deposition in an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you use your damn BlackBerry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it doesn\u0027t follow my simple Earth logic. Reschedule the writer. I\u0027m clear after four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay, I can handle it. If she wants more, I\u0027ll see about setting up a dinner, so keep tonight open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful what you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, I\u0027m going to. But I\u0027ve been thinking. We\u0027ve been careful about that for a long time. Maybe it\u0027s time to be a little reckless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like Gage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fox...I\u0027ve already started having the dreams again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFox blew out a breath. \"I was hoping that was just me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we were seventeen they started about a week before our birthday, then when we were twenty-four, over a month. Now, five months out. Every time it gets stronger. I\u0027m afraid if we don\u0027t find the way, this time could be the last for us, and the town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you talked to Gage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just e-mailed him. I didn\u0027t tell him about the dreams. You do it. Find out if he\u0027s having them, too, wherever the hell he is. Get him home, Fox. I think we need him back. I don\u0027t think we can wait until summer this time. I gotta go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch your step with the writer,\" Fox called out as Cal started for the door. \"Get more than you give.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle it,\" Cal repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQUINN BLACK EASED HER MINI COOPER OFF THE exit ramp and hit the usual barrage at the interchange. Pancake House, Wendy\u0027s, McDonald\u0027s, KFC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith great affection, she thought of a Quarter Pounder, with a side of really salty fries, and-natch-a Diet Coke to ease the guilt. But since that would be breaking her vow to eat fast food no more than once a month, she wasn\u0027t going to indulge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There now, don\u0027t you feel righteous?\" she asked herself with only one wistful glance in the rearview at the lovely Golden Arches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer love of the quick and the greasy had sent her on an odyssey of fad diets, unsatisfying supplements, and miracle workout tapes through her late teens and early twenties. Until she\u0027d finally slapped herself silly, tossed out all her diet books, her diet articles, her I LOST TWENTY POUNDS IN TWO WEEKS-AND YOU CAN, TOO! ads, and put herself on the path to sensible eating and exercising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifestyle change, she reminded herself. She\u0027d made a lifestyle change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut boy, she missed those Quarter Pounders more than she missed her ex-fianc¨¦.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, who wouldn\u0027t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the GPS hooked to her dashboard, then over at the directions she\u0027d printed out from Caleb Hawkins\u0027s e-mail. So far, they were in tandem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached down for the apple serving as her midmorning snack. Apples were filling, Quinn thought as she bit in. They were good for you, and they were tasty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they were no Quarter Pounder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to keep her mind off the devil, she considered what she hoped to accomplish on this first face-to-face interview with one of the main players in the odd little town of Hawkins Hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, not fair to call it odd, she reminded herself. Objectivity first. Maybe her research leaned her toward the odd label, but there would be no making up her mind until she\u0027d seen for herself, done her interviews, taken her notes, scoped out the local library. And, maybe most important, seen the Pagan Stone in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loved poking at all the corners and cobwebs of small towns, digging down under the floorboards for secrets and surprises, listening to the gossip, the local lore and legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d made a tiny name for herself doing a series of articles on quirky, off-the-mainstream towns for a small press magazine called Detours. And since her professional appetite was as well-developed as her bodily one, she\u0027d taken a risky leap and written a book, following the same theme, but focusing on a single town in Maine reputed to be haunted by the ghosts of twin sisters who\u0027d been murdered in a boardinghouse in 1843.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe critics had called the result \"engaging\" and \"good, spooky fun,\" except for the ones who\u0027d deemed it \"preposterous\" and \"convoluted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d followed it up with a book highlighting a small town in Louisiana where the descendent of a voodoo priestess served as mayor and faith healer. And, Quinn had discovered, had been running a very successful prostitution ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hawkins Hollow-she could just feel it-was going to be bigger, better, meatier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t wait to sink her teeth in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fast-food joints, the businesses, the ass-to-elbow houses gave way to bigger lawns, bigger homes, and to fields sleeping under the dreary sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road wound, dipped and lifted, then veered straight again. She saw a sign for the Antietam Battlefield, something else she meant to investigate and research firsthand. She\u0027d found little snippets about incidents during the Civil War in and around Hawkins Hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to know more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her GPS and Caleb\u0027s directions told her to turn, she turned, following the next road past a grove of naked trees, a scatter of houses, and the farms that always made her smile with their barns and silos and fenced paddocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d have to find a small town to explore in the Midwest next time. A haunted farm, or the weeping spirit of a milkmaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nearly ignored the directions to turn when she saw the sign for Hawkins Hollow (est. 1648). As with the Quarter Pounder, her heart longed to indulge, to drive into town rather than turn off toward Caleb Hawkins\u0027s place. But she hated to be late, and if she got caught up exploring the streets, the corners, the look of the town, she certainly would be late for her first appointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon,\" she promised, and turned to take the road winding by the woods she knew held the Pagan Stone at their heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gave her a quick shiver, and that was strange. Strange to realize that shiver had been fear and not the anticipation she always felt with a new project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she followed the twists of the road, she glanced with some unease toward the dark and denuded trees. And hit the brakes hard when she shifted her eyes back to the road and saw something rush out in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought she saw a child-oh God, oh God-then thought it was a dog. And then...it was nothing. Nothing at all on the road, nothing rushing to the field beyond. Nothing there but herself and her wildly beating heart in the little red car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trick of the eye,\" she told herself, and didn\u0027t believe it. \"Just one of those things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she restarted the car that had stalled when she\u0027d slammed the brakes, then eased to the strip of dirt that served as the shoulder of the road. She pulled out her notebook, noted the time, and wrote down exactly what she thought she\u0027d seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung boy, abt ten. Lng blck hair, red eyes. He LOOKED right at me. Did I blink? Shut my eyes? Opened, amp; saw lrg blck dog, not boy. Then poof. Nothing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCars passed her without incident as she sat a few moments more, waited for the trembling to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntrepid writer balks at first possible phenom, she thought, turns around, and drives her adorable red car to the nearest Mickey D\u0027s for a fat-filled antidote to nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could do that, she considered. Nobody could charge her with a felony and throw her into prison. And if she did that, she wouldn\u0027t have her next book, or any self-respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man up, Quinn,\" she ordered. \"You\u0027ve seen spooks before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteadier, she swung back out on the road, and made the next turn. The road was narrow and twisty with trees looming on both sides. She imagined it would be lovely in the spring and summer, with the green dappling, or after a snowfall with all those trees ermine drenched. But under a dull gray sky the woods seemed to crowd the road, bare branches just waiting to reach out and strike, as if they and only they were allowed to live there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to enforce the sensation, no other car passed, and when she turned off her radio as the music seemed too loud, the only sound was the keening curse of the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould\u0027ve called it Spooky Hollow, she decided, and nearly missed the turn into the gravel lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, she wondered, would anyone choose to live here? Amid all those dense, thrusting trees where bleak pools of snow huddled to hide from the sun? Where the only sound was the warning growl of Nature. Everything was brown and gray and moody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bumped over a little bridge spanning a curve of a creek, followed the slight rise of the stingy lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the house, exactly as advertised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sat on what she would have termed a knoll rather than a hill, with the front slope tamed into step-down terraces decked with shrubs she imagined put on a hell of a show in the spring and summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t a lawn, so to speak, and she thought Hawkins had been smart to go with the thick mulch and shrubs and trees skirting the front instead of the traditional grass that would probably be a pain in the ass to mow and keep clear of weeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe approved of the deck that wrapped around the front and sides, and she\u0027d bet the rear as well. She liked the earthy tones of the stone and the generous windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sat like it belonged there, content and well-settled in the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled up beside an aging Chevy pickup, got out of her car to stand and take a long view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd understood why someone would choose this spot. There was, unquestionably, an aura of spookiness, especially for one who was inclined to see and feel such things. But there was considerable charm as well, and a sense of solitude that was far from lonely. She could imagine very well sitting on that front deck some summer evening, drinking a cold one, and wallowing in the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could move toward the house, the front door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sense of d¨¦j¨¤ vu was vivid, almost dizzying. He stood there at the door of the cabin, the blood like red flowers on his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can stay no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words sounded in her head, clear, and in a voice she somehow knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Black?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snapped back. There was no cabin, and the man standing on the lovely deck of his charming house had no blood blooming on him. There was no force of great love and great grief shining in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still, she had to lean back against her car for a minute and catch her breath. \"Yeah, hi. I was just...admiring the house. Great spot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. Any trouble finding it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. Your directions were perfect.\" And, of course, it was ridiculous to be having this conversation outside in the freezing wind. From the quizzical look on his face, he obviously felt the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed off the car, worked up what she hoped was a sane and pleasant expression as she walked to the trio of wooden steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd wasn\u0027t he a serious cutie? she realized as she finally focused on the reality. All that windblown hair and those strong gray eyes. Add the crooked smile, the long, lean body in jeans and flannel, and a woman might be tempted to hang a SOLD! sign around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped up, held out a hand. \"Quinn Black, thanks for meeting with me, Mr. Hawkins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Cal.\" He took her hand, shook it, then held it as he gestured to the door. \"Let\u0027s get you out of the wind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stepped directly into a living room that managed to be cozy and male at the same time. The generous sofa faced the big front windows, and the chairs looked as though they\u0027d allow an ass to sink right in. Tables and lamps probably weren\u0027t antiques, but looked to be something a grandmother might have passed down when she got the urge to redecorate her own place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was even a little stone fireplace with the requisite large mutt sprawled sleeping in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me take your coat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is your dog in a coma?\" Quinn asked when the dog didn\u0027t move a muscle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Lump leads an active and demanding internal life that requires long periods of rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want some coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027d be great. So would the bathroom. Long drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed herself into a small, spotlessly clean powder room as much to pull herself back together from a couple of psychic shocks as to pee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Quinn,\" she whispered. \"Here we go.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-brothers-sign-of-seven-1/page-4.html","bookId":2248,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:44 PM"}
