Victims, they said, dead when police arrived. She stared in shock . . . Carlo was dead? She was so stunned she almost didn’t catch the next words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DeMarco’s funeral is scheduled for tomorrow . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuneral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men in the diner sighed exasperatedly. “Perfect example of why we need gun control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way,” the other man said. “They do us all a favor by killing each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud sob escaped Haven’s throat when it hit her and she quickly brought her hands up to cover her mouth. She trembled, shaking her head furiously. Funeral? Dr. DeMarco was dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hayden?” Kelsey’s voice rang out. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven tried to respond, but as soon as she uncovered her mouth another sob echoed through the diner. She jumped up from the booth and nearly fell, her legs barely able to withstand her weight. She pushed past her friend as she ran for the door and bolted down the street to her apartment. Kelsey yelled after Haven but she didn’t turn around, fumbling for the keys and rushing inside. Leaning back against the door, she closed her eyes and tried to get a grip on herself. The words of the news report continually ran through her mind, although she couldn’t make sense of it. How could he be dead? What happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter her breathing was under control, she opened her eyes again and wiped the tears from her cheeks. Grabbing the small black cell phone, she dialed the Chicago number and listened as it rang. “Corrado Moretti. Leave a message.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven pushed back the nerves that always accompanied the call. The words escaped her lips, the burn in her chest dulling as another sensation settled in. Through the shock, through the horror and fear, she felt the resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m coming to Chicago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven left her apartment under the cloak of darkness, taking only a small bag of clothes. She locked up before making her way down the block to the nearest parking garage, taking the elevator up to the third tier. She spotted the black Mazda parked precisely where she had left it almost a year before. The thick layer of dirt and dust covering the paint concealed the scratches still adorning the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took nearly every penny she had in her pocket to pay the parking fees and fill up the gas tank for her trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart ached as she drove out of the city, thoughts of Dr. DeMarco infiltrating her mind. Unlike so many times before, when the incident where he had punished her would spring to mind, all she could think about were the good moments: the time he had given her the picture of her mother, the holidays, the sound of his laughter, and the look of pride on his face when Dominic graduated. She thought about the food he had given her and how he had handed over his keys so she could learn to drive. He hadn’t even been angry when it was returned with a scratch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as if more than a year’s worth of memories flooded Haven, and with them came the tears. Dominic’s words ran through her mind, ones he had spoken down by the river in Durante.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already lost my mom to this life,” he’d said. “I don’t want to lose him, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic had made Haven see that it was okay to want more in life. He had helped her face her worst fear. It was only fair she would be there to help him face his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e39\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven sat in the car along the curb, her stomach churning as she stared at the blue door of the old house. She had only seen it once before, sitting on the bottom step with Carmine by her side. More than a year had somehow passed since that day . . . more than a year since she had laid eyes on him. She wondered if he would be happy to see her, or if he would be angry she came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many scenarios flooded her mind as she got out of the car and made her way across the street. She tried to push back her anxiety as she stepped on the porch, but before she could even knock her name was called from down the street. Her vision blurred, her heart rate skyrocketing as she turned around, watching Corrado’s leisurely approach. “Sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad to see you’re well.” He eyed her intently, a serious expression hardening his face. Haven immediately grew paranoid, wondering if it was wrong for her to be there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic crept through her at the prospect that she could be in danger. “I didn’t know if I should come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was nice of you to show up,” he said as he stepped closer. “I apologize for not calling. By the time I had a chance, you’d informed me of your intention to come, so I assumed someone else told you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw it on the news,” she said quietly. “They said there was a massacre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorrado scoffed at the word. “It was hardly a massacre. If it was, no one would’ve survived, but Carmine and I walked away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carmine?” she gasped, horrified. “He was there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Corrado said. “And as you can probably guess, he isn’t taking it very well. After Maura’s murder, he didn’t speak to anybody for a long time. It seems he’s dealing with his father’s death the same way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh God.” The burn flared in her chest as her eyes filled with tears. “He saw them both die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is he, uh . . . ?” She motioned toward the door behind her. “Is he home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorrado shook his head. “He’s already gone to the service with my wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re welcome to join me,” Corrado said. “I’m waiting on the car service to pick me up. Plenty of time to meet them at the cemetery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven looked down at herself, eyeing her wrinkled shirt and dirty jeans. She had had them on since yesterday morning, having not taken the time to change before leaving. “I don’t really have anything with me to wear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God doesn’t care what you wear, Haven,” Corrado said. “It wouldn’t matter to Vincent, either. But if it would make you feel better, I’m sure there’s something in my wife’s closet that would suffice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh no, I couldn’t.” Haven furiously shook her head. “I couldn’t impose like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorrado let out a sharp bark of laughter. “As much as I’ve already done, a change of clothes is hardly an imposition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat silenced her immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come,” he insisted. “No excuses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven quietly followed him to his house and upstairs to the bedroom he shared with Celia. She glanced through the closet, pulling out a plain black dress she found in the back. It was slightly too big but fit better than she expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe borrowed a pair of shoes, too, some simple black heels that pinched her toes, a size too small but good enough for the moment. She did little else to prepare, in and out in less than twenty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorrado waited downstairs for her, peering out the front door at the black town car parked along the curb. They climbed into it, and Haven shifted anxiously around on the leather seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve tried,” Corrado said quietly a few minutes into the drive. “I’ve done everything within my power for Carmine, but it seems to be beyond my reach. He’s too stubborn and reckless. The way he’s going, he’s doomed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoomed. That word rippled through her, a cold chill striking her bones. “You’ve given up on him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter . . . not when he’s already given up on himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Haven could respond, Corrado’s cell phone rang. He pulled it out, letting out a long exhaustive sigh as he answered the call. “Moretti speaking . . . Yeah, it’s all settled. I’m certain it’ll go according to plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up quickly, slipping his phone back away as his attention once more turned to her. “Is this visit temporary, or do you need to retrieve your things from New York?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blanched. “Well, I . . . I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away from her, his eyes focusing straight ahead. “Let me know when you figure it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long, gold-toned casket stood out strikingly on the grassy knoll, a makeshift memorial of colorful flowers surrounding it on all sides. A crowd of mourners gathered, dozens of people dressed in their most expensive black clothing, their heads bowed and gazes cast away, as if avoiding having to face reality. Sorrow and misery wafted around them, the atmosphere stifling with pain lingering in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven paused a few yards away from the service, her knees weak. Dr. DeMarco’s cold body lay in that box, his heart no longer beating and the life expelled from him. He was gone, never again to open his eyes and see another day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air seemed to be forced from Haven’s lungs at the thought, dizziness blurring her vision. She took a few steps to the side to lean against a tall maple tree in order to catch her breath as Corrado continued on, infiltrating the crowd. She scanned them as she composed herself, catching brief glimpses of Celia and Dominic, but the others were shielded from view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to go closer, desperate to see Carmine, but her feet wouldn’t move no matter how hard she tried to make them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vincenzo was a loyal man,” the priest declared, clutching a Bible to his chest as he stood behind the casket. “He was a husband and a father; a son and a brother. He wasn’t a perfect man, he made mistakes, but no man is perfect. We all sin; we all fall victim to temptation. Vincenzo was no different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greed, lust, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy, pride—the seven cardinal sins. He struggled with them, trying to balance the good and evil in his life, and many times he failed. But just because he succumbed to evil doesn’t mean he was evil. Vincenzo visited me often before his life came to an end. He expressed remorse for all of the hurt he had caused, and because of that I am certain of one thing—despite his flaws, Vincenzo Roman DeMarco was a true Man of Honor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSobs rang out from the crowd, but Haven couldn’t decipher who they came from. When the priest finished a few minutes later, mourners took turns placing long-stemmed red roses on top of the casket, one by one saying their final good-byes to the man inside. Haven caught a glimpse of Tess and Dia, but the family stood in the front and remained mostly blocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven picked at her nails nervously as the crowd dispersed, chipping away at the pale pink polish when Carmine finally came into view. He wore a black suit, his hair slicked back and head bowed as he stared into the massive hole in the ground. People spoke to him as they passed, but he didn’t acknowledge them. He just stood still, a cold marble statue, unmoving and unwavering, looming in the pathway as everyone moved around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched Celia rub Carmine’s back before she and Corrado walked away. Corrado steered her in Haven’s direction, her footsteps faltering as a look of surprise passed over her face. She smiled warmly as she approached, pulling her into a hug. “You look great, kiddo. It’s been way too long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” Haven said quietly as she let go, seeing Celia’s face was flushed, her makeup was smudged from crying. “I’m so sorry for your loss, Celia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, too, sweetie,” she whispered, glancing back over at Carmine, frowning, before looking at Haven again. “Go on,” she said, motioning toward him. “Make sure he gets home safely, okay?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sempre-redemption-forever-2/page-58.html","bookId":2785,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:14 PM"}
