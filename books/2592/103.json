The writer wanted this job, but I dissuaded him. The following account doesn’t require the embellishments the writer would have insisted on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime around 2:15 Robby had a nightmare from which he awoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 2:25 Robby heard “the sounds” of something in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby assumed it was me until he heard the scratching at his door, and then he assumed it was Victor. (Later Robby would admit he had “hoped” it was Victor because he somehow knew “it wasn’t.”)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby decided to move through the bathroom into his sister’s room (according to his account, she was seemingly involved in her own nightmare) where he opened Sarah’s door and looked out into the hallway so he could see what was causing the scratching noises and leaving the deep grooves in the lower right-hand corner of his door. (At one point, Robby said, he feared he was dreaming all this.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby didn’t see anything when he peered from his sister’s door and down the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Note: The sconces in the hallway were flickering, and according to Robby this was something he had noticed before, as I had, though neither Jayne nor Sarah—nor Rosa nor Marta, for that matter—had seen it.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby did, however, hear something as he stepped from his sister’s room and into the flickering hallway. There was a “rustling” sound farther down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, Robby realized something was coming up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It” was “breathing raggedly” and, according to Robby, “it” was also “mewling”—a word I had never heard before. (Dictionary definition: “to cry, as a baby, young child, or the like; whimper.”)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe “thing” noticed Robby’s presence and, because of this, suddenly stopped advancing up the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby turned away—panicking—and walked quietly in the opposite direction, toward the master bedroom at the end of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened when he opened the door and stepped into the room?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was dark. I was lying on my back in bed. I believed I was dreaming. I had passed out after drinking half the bottle of vodka that had appeared on my desk while I was talking to whom I thought was Clayton, the boy who wanted to be Patrick Bateman. When I slowly became aware that I was no longer sleeping, my eyes remained closed and I felt a pressure on my chest. I was still swirling up from a dream in which crows were turning into seagulls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad?” This was an echo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t open my eyes. (If I had, I would have seen Robby silhouetted in the doorway, backlit by the flickering hallway behind him.) “What is it?” my voice rasped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad, I think there’s someone in the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby was trying not to whine, but even drunk I could detect the fear in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat, my eyes still closed. “What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s I think there’s something coming up the stairs,” he said. “There was something scratching at my door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Robby, I actually said the following: “I’m sure it’s nothing. Just go back to sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby countered with “I can’t, Dad. I’m scared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first reaction: Well, so am I. Welcome to the club. Get used to it. It never leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear Robby moving closer, stepping through the darkness of the master bedroom. I could hear him nearing me as he made his way toward my black and shapeless form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weight shifted on my chest again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby was speaking into the darkness: “Dad, I think there’s somebody in the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby was reaching for the bedside lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby turned on the lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind my closed eyelids an orange light burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobby was silenced by something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was contemplating what he was looking at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image he was contemplating momentarily knocked the fear away and was replaced by an awful curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis silence was rousing me from my inebriation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weight shifted on my chest again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad,” Robby said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Robby,” I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad, there’s something on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes but couldn’t focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I saw next happened very quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Terby was on my chest, looming above me, its face seizing, its open mouth a rictus that now took up half the doll’s head, and the fangs I had only noticed earlier that day were stained brown \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-103.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
