The answer lies in you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words came out of the darkness, in a voice I didn\u0027t recognize. I awoke to a whole new world - a beautiful place, full of color and light and scent. People and animals meandered about, enjoying the sun that sparkled on clear water. The lion with the lamb, black people with white, I even saw a coyote resting his head on the feathered breast of a chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are in the Land of Souls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman separated from those lounging near the water and walked toward me. Tall, slim, her hair was flowing black with only a trace of silver. Her face defied time; her eyes were dark, clear, and honest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer white T-shirt was tucked into a long colorful skirt. She wore a ring on each finger and on two of her toes. Three earrings hung from each ear and bracelets jangled around her slim wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Her smile was gentle. She took my hand. \"But I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re Cora.\" Her brows lifted. \"Will spoke of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression became both fond and sad. \"He\u0027s a good boy, and I miss him. Tell him all that I have is his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll like that.\" I considered the beautiful, dead old woman. \"You engineered everything, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lydia told me what she had planned.\" Cora shrugged. \"I planned better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gave me strength.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The strength was always yours. The talisman was merely an instrument that allowed you to access it.\" She brushed her hands together. \"Now, I promised you the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Embrace what you are, discover the secret you seek.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you just tell me who the bad guys were?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Land of Souls doesn\u0027t work that way. Only through accepting yourself could you ever become whole and learn the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure I could handle any more truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you defeated the one who ended my days, I can grant you the answer to a single question. All you need do is ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one question I\u0027d ever wanted the answer to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is the cure for lycanthropy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t wish to know how to cure yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it the same thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cure for one will not cure the other. You are different. You must choose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMyself or all the werewolves? Once the decision would have been easy. I had loathed what I was, would have done anything to remove the curse, cure the virus. But I\u0027d learned a lot in the past few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward might hate me, but that was his problem. I no longer did. I could help people, save lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic hadn\u0027t run screaming. Yet. However, he could when he discovered I might never be cured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused to think, but I didn\u0027t really have to. I couldn\u0027t choose an easy life over hundreds, thousands of deaths. I just couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Them, not me,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wish to have the power to remove the demon and make werewolves human again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sacrifice,\" Cora murmured. \"For the good of mankind. In the end, you will be blessed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took me by the hand. When she released me, a pentagram remained, stark black against the pale of my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark of the wolf,\" she told me. \"The power to heal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The gift was always in you. You fought what you were. You refused to embrace the beast. Relying on science to turn back the tide of magic.\" Cora shook her head. \"There is no cure that comes from a bottle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But science made the monsters. Or at least some of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hate makes monsters. Those who worshipped the sign of the beast attempted to bring about Doomsday, and they failed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nazis? The swastika?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one should call forth powers they do not understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be able to cure werewolves now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are woman and wolf - human and inhuman. Only you can touch them and make them whole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Land of Souls shimmered, faded, and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither the sun was setting or a storm was coming. The ravine was shadowed, cool, a bit spooky. I could smell blood, a lot of it, along with wolves, people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long had I been -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had I been?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic, who was on his knees at my side, leaned over and kissed me. A thorough kiss, both sweet and seductive. I lifted my arms and wrapped them around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we save the pornographic video for later? I got questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was Jessie\u0027s voice. When had she gotten here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic lifted his head, touched my cheek. There were shadows in his eyes that hadn\u0027t been there before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t have a pulse.\" Jessie leaned over and put her finger to my neck. \"You do now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slapped her hand away. \"I saw Cora in the Land of Souls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone went silent. Jessie and Nic exchanged glances. I could tell by their expressions they thought I\u0027d lost my mind. Maybe I had. I\u0027d been hit hard enough to jiggle my brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cora,\" I began, but stopped when Jessie pointed her .44 at my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s on your hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked at the black pentagram glistening starkly in the half-light. The Land of Souls hadn\u0027t been a dream after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cora touched me and there it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last time there was a tattoo like that it was on a Weendigo,\" Jessie said. \"I hate those guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic slid in front of Jessie\u0027s .44. \"Put the gun down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" I tugged on his arm. \"She isn\u0027t going to shoot me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn straight I will, Doc. I\u0027m not going through that Weendigo shit again, even for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pentagram with one point ascendant represents good.\" Edward\u0027s voice - my grandfather\u0027s voice - drifted across the ravine. \"Two points ascendant means evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie leaned in close, squinting at my palm. \"One up - guess you aren\u0027t Satan\u0027s handmaiden after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, wincing at the pain the movement caused in my head. Struggling to sit, I glanced in Edward\u0027s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the werewolves from the basement, save one, were on the ground, dead bodies still smoking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward guarded the remaining lycanthrope, rifle nearly touching the guy\u0027s nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you manage to arrive in the nick of time?\" I asked Jessie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will had a bad feeling.\" She shrugged, kicked the ground. \"His feelings come true a lot. When he went to talk to the wigwam guy, I headed here.\" She lifted her gaze to mine. \"Lucky I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witchie wolves surrounded what was left of Billy. Even though he\u0027d deserved what he got, my eyes still shied away from the remains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait a second. Someone was missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Lydia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poof,\" Jessie said. \"We got a little busy with...\" Her nod indicated the werewolves, Billy, me. \"When we looked, she was gone. Though Edward did find something interesting in her pocket before she left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie held out her hand. In it lay a set of dentures and a bottle of clear liquid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ll bite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie snorted at my pathetic pun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We couldn\u0027t figure out how the bodies were being bitten by a werewolf in human form when Damien said there was no evidence of a werewolf in Fairhaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How were they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They weren\u0027t - not really. We think Lydia made an impression of Billy\u0027s teeth, collected his saliva, then did the deed herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why Billy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The usual reason, most likely, power. He was loaded with it. I figure Lydia didn\u0027t want to release him if she didn\u0027t have to. That guy was whacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the compound blew up, he got out, came here, and she had no choice but to work with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great minds,\" Jessie agreed, and glanced at the bloody grass. \"Guess we\u0027ll never know the truth for sure, but it all fits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lydia\u0027s going to try and rule the world again,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They always do. But we\u0027ll be here to stop her. Unless I have to shoot you in the head. Tell the tale, Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly I explained my journey to the Land of Souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been wasting your time and the government\u0027s money? All you had to do was touch them, and they\u0027d be human?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly.\" I frowned. \"I\u0027ve touched a few werewolves. Got a headache. Never cured one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s special now. The mark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" As my mind cleared, everything Cora had said began to combine with all that I\u0027d learned, all that I knew. \"Not the mark, but what it represents. Embracing my power, the magic, and my beast gave me strength and led me to the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess that makes as much sense as anything,\" Jessie said. \"So why don\u0027t we find out if that brand-new fashion accessory works?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed Jessie\u0027s gaze to the werewolf Edward held under the gun. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\" Nic put a hand on my shoulder. \"Maybe you should rest first. Who knows what might happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly, G-man. Who knows what might happen? She\u0027s the most powerful werewolf now. I don\u0027t know about you, but that makes me mighty nervous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was the most powerful werewolf all along,\" Nic said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the witchie wolves. \"He\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie aimed her gun and so did Edward. No moss on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She commands the witchie wolf army,\" Edward murmured. \"They are indestructible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So if I\u0027m of a mind to rule the world - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can,\" Jessie finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I\u0027d never been big on world domination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait for me in the Land of Souls,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the last word left my mouth, the witchie wolves began to fade. Flesh and bone became ghost, ghost became shadow, and then they were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oookay,\" Jessie muttered. \"They can\u0027t be killed, but they can be commanded to wait in heaven. Works for me.\" She lowered her gun. \"Let\u0027s move on. I want to know if that pentagram is good or evil - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She just proved she\u0027s not evil,\" Nic said. \"She got rid of the witchies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That proved she\u0027s the most powerful. I don\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not wild about it myself,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if she\u0027s evil, you shoot her?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie merely turned a bland gaze in his direction. Stupid question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t let you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t have anything to say about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic\u0027s hand crept toward his gun and I put mine on his. \"I\u0027m not evil. She won\u0027t kill me. And this is going to work. Watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to my feet, managed not to wobble. This day, this week, hell, this life, was taking a lot out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed the ravine, skirting the mess that had been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly. The last werewolf from the basement, Jack Mc-Grady, stared at me in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" He tried to skitter back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward thrust him forward. \"Do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to be human,\" Jack shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you rather be dead?\" Edward shoved the barrel of a rifle into Jack\u0027s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack was just a kid. He\u0027d had his whole life ahead of him - in 1955. Since then, he\u0027d made a career of ending other kids\u0027 lives. I didn\u0027t feel an ounce of guilt over using him as my guinea pig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching out, I placed my tattooed palm against his forehead. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3/page-35.html","bookId":2090,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM"}
