With only a tank top underneath, tiny bumps spread over my skin. “So are you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis full lips twisted into a grimace. “I can take care of myself, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I can, too.” I tugged my hair back. “I’m not helpless, Daemon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood still for a moment, and then a shudder rolled through his body. Next second he was in front of me, grasping my chilled cheeks. “I know you aren’t helpless, but there are things I would do that you won’t. Things I know you could never live with, but I can. What would you have done if someone saw you? What would I have done if you were captured or…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon didn’t finish, but I knew what he was getting at. I could’ve been captured tonight or worse, and he wasn’t worried about how the connection would have caused his own death. He was worried about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know why I did what I did next. Maybe it was everything that had happened tonight. Or maybe it was the tone of his voice—the fear behind his words. Too many emotions were building in me. I felt slippery inside, tipping in one direction and then the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clasped his cheeks. They were warm, like always—a touch of sunlight. His skin was smooth and hummed under my hands. I leaned in, and he didn’t move…or breathe. Like, at all. Knowing that I could do that to him filled me with a heady rush of power. Closing my eyes, I brushed my lips over his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kitten,” he growled roughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed him softly, sliding my hands into his silky locks, letting the pieces slide through my fingers. I tasted in him my own rising desire, my own need and heartache. Thrilling. Frightening. I pulled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kitten,” he said again, voice strained. “You don’t get to do that and then stop. That’s not how it works.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, my breath stalling in my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not when you’re mine.” Daemon backed us up and slid down the wall, pulling me onto his lap so I was straddling him. “And you’re mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed my hands on his shoulders as he brought my mouth to his. This kiss was lazy, exploratory…and sensual. For once, I wasn’t fighting the depth of my response. I welcomed it, thrived in the warmth rippling through me. I deepened the kiss. He made a sound in the back of his throat, and his arms wrapped around me, pinning me to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers found the strands of hair curling at the back of his neck and dug in. I couldn’t get enough of him—never could. I couldn’t remember feeling this way about anyone else. I couldn’t remember being kissed like this by anyone else. I’m not sure how long we kissed, but it seemed like forever, and at the same time, it wasn’t long enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait. Wait,” I breathed, pulling back slightly. I closed my eyes, dragging in a deep breath. “Important stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands dropped on my hips, pulling me down and against him. “This is important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” I gasped as his hands slid under the hem of my tank top, teasing the edges of my rib cage. “But this is really important. I found something in Vaughn’s house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon stilled, opening his eyes. They were luminous. Beautiful. Mine. “You went inside Vaughn’s house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “Yeah, I went into his house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you a career criminal?” he asked quietly. When I shook my head, his lips turned down at the corners. “I’m curious how you got into his house, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting my lip, I prepared myself. “I unlocked the door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With what…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The same way you would.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle popped in his jaw. “You shouldn’t be doing things like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing uncomfortable, I wiggled around. His hold tightened. If we started arguing about what I was and wasn’t supposed to be doing, we’d never get through this. “I found stuff. And I also met someone.” I tried to get up, but his arms clamped around me. “Are you going to let me go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a tight smile. “Nope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, folding my hands primly in the small space between us. “They’ve been watching us, Daemon. From the moment I moved here.” The way his eyes flared, I could tell all of this was going to go over real well. I told him about the pictures, the receipts, and the money transfers. “But that’s not all. Bethany showed up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Suddenly we both were standing. He backed off, needing space. “Did she talk to you about Dawson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, see, she’s not…well, she didn’t respond well to his name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a cool, measured look. “Explain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She kind of went alien ninja on my butt.” Feeling too warm, I grabbed a hair tie and twisted my hair up. “She threw me against the wall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows shot up in interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. “Not in that way, you perv. She’s like a suped-up freakin’ mutant. She even did the whole glowworm thing, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon rubbed his chin. “Did she tell you anything useful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him what she’d said, elaborating on the fact that most of it didn’t make sense. “I think she’s cracked. And she flipped out when I mentioned Dawson. She didn’t give me much of a choice to push the questioning. She removed me from the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit,” he said under his breath, turning away. “Besides getting ahold of one of the DOD officers, she was my last hope to find out where Dawson could be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did find something else.” I dug into my pocket, pulling out the scrap of paper. “I found this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon took it, his eyes widening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think DB stands for Dawson Black?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It could.” He clenched the paper tight. “Can I use your laptop? I want to see where this address goes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” I moved over to the coffee table, opening up the computer and quickly shutting down the website I’d been looking at. I didn’t want to tell him about Blake’s potential involvement in all of this. Not when Daemon was looking incredibly scary and I had no idea how deep Blake was involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon sat beside me and quickly typed the address in Google Maps. Modern technology was frightening. Not only did it give us directions right to the doorstep, but he was able to pull it up on the satellite and see that it was an office building in Moorefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chewed on my fingernail as he scribbled down the directions. “Are you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to, right now, but I need to scope out the place first. Tomorrow I’ll check it out, then go back later.” He shoved the piece of notebook paper in his pocket and faced me. Hope sparked in his eyes. “Thank you, Kat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I kind of owed you something, right?” I rubbed my arms, shivering. “You’ve saved my butt a lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what a lovely butt it is, but you risked too much by doing this.” He reached behind me, tugging the quilt off, draping it over my shoulders. He held the edges together, searching my face intently. “Why did you do this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered my eyes. “I just was thinking about everything, and I wanted to see what was in there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was crazy dangerous, Kitten. You can’t do anything like that again. Promise me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught the edge of my chin, tilting my face up to him. “Promise me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shoulders slumped. “I won’t. Okay. I promise. But you’ve got to promise me the same thing. I know you can’t drop this. I understand that, but you have to be careful, and you can’t sneak off without me, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon scowled. “This shouldn’t involve you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it does,” I insisted. “And I’m not a fragile human, Daemon. We’re in this together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Together?” He mulled over the word, then a slow smile played on his lips. “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a tentative smile. “So, that means I go when you check out the address.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded with a resigned smile. We talked about the photos, and how much the DOD had to know. He was taking the violation of privacy a lot better than I had, but I discovered he was accustomed to them being all up in his business. “What do you think Bethany meant by ’They are coming’?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sprawled against the back of the couch, the picture of ease and lazy arrogance, but I knew he was coiled tight. “I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess it might not mean anything. I mean, she was kind of whacked out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon nodded, staring straight ahead. Many seconds passed before he spoke again. “I can’t help but wonder what my brother is like right now. Is he like that? Whacked out? I don’t think I could…deal with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest ached from the desperation in his voice. Tomorrow could bring anything, and things were really up in the air between us, but he…he needed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inched toward him. My confidence wavered with the near-feral look he shot my way. Pushing forward, I crawled up against him, wiggling down so that my head was against his shoulder. He inhaled sharply, and I squeezed my eyes shut. “Even if he is…whacked out, you can deal with it. You can deal with anything. I don’t doubt that at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery slowly, he draped his arm around my shoulders. I felt his chin rest on top of my head. “What are we going to do, Kitten?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy toes curled at the deep octave of his voice. “I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a few ideas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cracked a grin. “I’m sure you do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wanna hear about them? Although, I’m much better at the show part rather than the tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Somehow, I believe you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you didn’t, I could always give you a teaser.” He paused, and I could hear the smile in his voice. “You bookish people love teasers, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “You’ve been doing your research on my blog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,” he replied. “Like I said, I’ve got to keep an eye on you, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon and I checked out the office building in Moorefield the following morning. We’d thought it would be empty, considering it was sort of a holiday, but the whole plaza of offices was packed with cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling the cap over his face, he jumped from the car and checked out the office on the street. When he returned, he grinned at me and quickly pulled out of the plaza. “It appears to be a lawyer’s office. Has at least two floors above the main one. They’re closed for New Year’s and obviously on Sunday. Bad news is they are outfitted with an alarm system.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crap. Know a way around that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fry their systems. If I do it quickly enough, I shouldn’t trigger an alarm. But that’s not all. Above the entrances and windows is that same damn blackish-red gemstone.” His lips tipped up higher. “This is good, though. Whatever those stones are, they have to mean something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did. Dawson could be in there right now. “What if it’s guarded?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t answer. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-47.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
