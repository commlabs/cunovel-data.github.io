Why doesn\u0027t she leave the girl alone? You would think that having a bad dream was some sort of felony.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"As a matter of fact,\" said Seldon soothingly, \"it\u0027s just a matter of something Wanda remembered as part of the dream. I don\u0027t know if Wanda told you, but apparently in her dream she heard something about \u0027lemonade death.\u0027 \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Hmm!\" Manella was silent for a moment. Then she said, \"That doesn\u0027t really matter so much. Wanda is crazy about lemonade and she\u0027s expecting lots of it at the party. I promised she\u0027d have some with Mycogenian drops in it and she\u0027s looking forward to it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"So that if she heard something that sounded anything like lemonade, it would be translated into lemonade in her mind.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Yes. Why not?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Except that, in that case, what do you suppose it was that was actually said? She must have heard something in order to misinterpret it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s necessarily so. But why are we attaching so much importance to a little girl\u0027s dream? Please, I don\u0027t want anyone talking to her about it anymore. It\u0027s too upsetting.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I agree. I\u0027ll see to it that Dors drops the subject-at least with Wanda.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"All right. I don\u0027t care if she is Wanda\u0027s grandmother, Hari.
