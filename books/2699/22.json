They were a deep green now, threaded into a hexagon around the tongue, then knotting up in the middle, bringing to mind a cat\u0027s eye but sideways. Everything else was standard Logo Exile except for her jacket - sleek, black, and sleeveless, shining in the sun, oversized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. My interest isn\u0027t professional,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Mandy called and told me.\" She looked down. \"Turns out I did get you fired after all. Just took a little longer than we thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that was why she\u0027d called. She felt guilty. This was a mercy meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips parted, but nothing came out. I wanted to tell her what I\u0027d realized about the Jammers, but everything I needed to say was too big to fit in my mouth. Jen waited for a moment, then raised the binoculars to her eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you looking at?\" I managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Brooklyn waterfront.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to stare across the river, where a few features of the navy yard were discernible in the expanse of industrial buildings, winding highways, and crumbling dock space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course. Jen never gave up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027\"See you at the factory?\" I quoted. That\u0027s what Mwadi Wickersham had said after the hoi aristoi had broken in, all violet and violent. The Jammers had been scheduled to relocate on Monday, but with serious forces in motion against them, why not a day early?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You figure they\u0027ll stay in Brooklyn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I think they belong in Dumbo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the cool part of town, I hear.\" We stood shoulder to shoulder. \"Seen anything interesting?\" I asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t followed, were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think so. Walked up through Stuyvesant Town, then back down along the river. Not much cover in Stuy Town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, said, \"Roger this,\" and handed me the binoculars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were heavy, military, camo-printed. Our fingertips touched for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waterfront jumped into detail before my eyes, every quiver of my hands amplified into an earthquake. I steadied my grip, following a bicyclist along the Brooklyn Promenade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I looking for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check out the Domino Sugar factory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swept ahead of the bicycle, everything a blur with my speed. Then the familiar, long-stained factory walls flashed across my view. I backtracked, found the unlit neon letters of the name, the diagonal sugar chute that connected two buildings. Finally, a small, empty lot between the factory and the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rental trucks,\" I said softly. A few figures moved between the trucks and an open loading dock. \"Jen, did you ever trace the license number of the truck we saw in front of the abandoned building?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, no. Turns out I have no idea how to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me neither. But... have you ever seen professional movers wearing all black? In summer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never. And see how they\u0027re parked? All squeezed up against the wall like that, so you can\u0027t see them from the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered the binoculars. The trucks were grains of yellow rice to the naked eye, the human figures no bigger than iron filings moved by a hidden magnet. \"They weren\u0027t expecting anyone to be watching them from Manhattan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, those field glasses were fourteen hundred bucks. Former Soviet Union military. But the guy said I can return them tomorrow if I don\u0027t like them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, Jen.\" I handed the binoculars back very carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised them to her eyes, leaned against the railing, the binoculars\u0027 neck strap dangling over the water now. \"The client must have coughed up some serious cash for the shoes. I heard they were turning those buildings into residential condos. Beautiful Manhattan views at a million a pop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all of them, apparently. My guess is that they\u0027ve got a TV studio in their part of the factory, an editing suite at least, and who knows what else. So the Jammers are probably zoned light industrial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Postindustrial, you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Postapocalyptic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. But give them time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood there in silence for a while, Jen following the movements across the river carefully, me just glad to be there - analyzing how the Brooklyn waterfront had changed over the years, watching Jen\u0027s buzzed hair ruffle in the wind, liking the way it felt to be beside her, even if this was as close as we\u0027d get from now on. j\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you like your jacket? \u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My what?\" Then a strobe of recognition flickered in my brain. I reached out, touching the black, silken surface with its pattern of tiny fleur-de-lis. It was the lining of my thousand-dollar disaster, now on the outside. The horrendous rip was gone, along with the sleeves, the seams re-sewn to pull the jacket\u0027s elegant lines into its new inside-out configuration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try it on.\" She slipped out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt fit me as beautifully as it had two nights ago. Slightly better, as things sometimes do when they\u0027re inside out. And this new jacket -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;unexpectedly sleeveless, silken ersatz Japanese, and bow-tie resistant -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;didn\u0027t belong to the non-Hunter; it was all me. \"Gorgeous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad you like it. Took all night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands felt the seams down the sides, ran across the breast pocket (originally inside, now out), felt the fit across the shoulders. Then they slipped around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed out slowly, looking into her green eyes. Relief flooded through me, as if some terrible test were over. \"Me too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away. \"You weren\u0027t the one being a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were just telling the truth. Possibly in a bitchy way, but the truth. I watch too much. Think too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what you do. And you do it in a really cool way. I like the stuff in your brain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Jen, but you want to change things - and not just how people tie their shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do you.\" She turned to look out across the river. \"You were just trying to make me feel better yesterday, pretending the Jammers weren\u0027t such a big deal. Weren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly.\" I took a deep breath, because in between crippling bouts of feeling sorry for myself all night, I\u0027d actually thought about this. \"Jen, I\u0027m not sure about the Jammers. I think they shoot for easy targets. And they take risks with other people\u0027s brains. You can\u0027t just go around rewiring people without asking. The moment someone gets seriously hurt, the whole trickster thing kind of loses its quirky appeal, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about this for a moment, then shrugged. \"Maybe. But that just means they need us to help them out. Your analytical skills, your vast database of useless facts. And my, uh, original thinking or whatever. We can help them. And they\u0027re just so cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know they are.\" I remembered my first day at school here in New York, realizing how far down the pyramid I\u0027d fallen. I was suddenly a dork; anyone could see from the moment I walked into class. And I could see in turn who the cool kids were. It was like they were glowing, bright razors, so sharp that it hurt to look at them. I\u0027ve been able to spot the cool kids ever since, no matter how young or old they are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut since that day, I\u0027ve never really trusted them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why did I trust Jen? I wondered. This was the girl who\u0027d broken up with me only twelve hours before over... a pile of shoes. Or rather hated me because I hadn\u0027t stayed there to help, oblivious to her conviction that if she lost this one chance with the Jammers, she\u0027d lose her cool again, as easy as tripping over a crack in the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was a nutty thing to believe but very Jen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, she\u0027d stopped hating me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we\u0027d make them even cooler, Hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at her and laughed, knowing that I\u0027d help her find them. Because Jen thought she needed them, and I needed her. \"Sure, we would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the factory. Shrugged. \"I\u0027ve got a present for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another one?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The jacket wasn\u0027t a present. It was yours, bought and paid for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twinged. \"Not paid for yet, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and put the binoculars into her backpack (in their thick, padded, Soviet-era case, I was glad to see). Pulled out a paper bag. Before she even had it open, I caught a whiff of burned plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you I\u0027d find one. You should have stayed with me. If I\u0027d had some help, it might not have taken two whole hours.\" She unwrapped it carefully as she spoke. \"Just one, right at the bottom of the pile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth dropped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shoe had remained miraculously untouched by the heat, the panels still pliable, their silvery, liquid-metal shine unblemished. The laces ran through my fingers like tendrils of sand. The eyelets glittered, tiny bicycle spokes spinning in the sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d almost forgotten how good they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smells like the fire,\" Jen said. \"But I stuck a couple of shoe deodorizers in it, and it\u0027s already better. Just give it time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what it smells like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed this too, I realized. It didn\u0027t take much to rewire Jen. Her brain was something unique, poised to turn ten years old again at the drop of a paka-paka attack, ready for every rooftop emergency door or plummeting j air shaft or secret revolution. But I hadn\u0027t felt this way in so long - like I could fly or at least dunk from the free-throw line, like the mortar in my brain was loosening. I took the shoe from her and held on tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still think the Jammers are so bad?\" Jen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, looked out over the river at the enemies of all I held dear, and gave them the Nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have their moments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 36\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI OWNED THE SHOE FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS. THEN MY CREDIT-CARD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebill arrived. Drastic action was required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can always buy a pair when they come out,\" Jen assured me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but not with the real logo.\" I\u0027d miss that bar sinister. As a certain French philosopher once said, \"Man is the animal that says no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t say no to a certain credit-card company whose name is a four-letter word. So we called up Antoine to make sure he was working that day, said we had something important to show him, and went uptown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Jay\u0027s, like hip-hop culture itself, appeared in the Bronx in 1975. They\u0027re still there and now all over town, selling shoes and tracksuits and all manner of sports gear made from synthetic materials with names like Supplex and Ultrah, space-age words to conjure images of robot courtesans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My man, Hunter,\" Antoine said, then gave Jen the Nod, which probably meant that he remembered what she\u0027d said at the focus group and thought it had been pretty cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led us to the back, through the good-natured chaos egged on by the store\u0027s awesome sound system: little kids running the carpet to test fit and feel, guys trying on jerseys to find that perfect length between waist and knee, reflective rainbows of team logos spinning on their racks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the sanctuary of the storeroom and squeezed ourselves between high shelves of boxes ranked by size and make, Antoine pushing a rolling library ladder out of our way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that smell?\" he asked as the shoe box opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jet engine,\" Jen said matter-of-factly, unwrapping the shoe from its paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it came into the light, Antoine\u0027s eyes began to shine. He took it gingerly from her hands, rotated it to every side in turn, checking eyelets, tongue, laces, tread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later he whispered, \"Where did it come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bootleg,\" Jen said. \"But they were all destroyed. That\u0027s the last one as far as we know\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The client will be doing a version,\" I said. \"But this is the original.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slowly, his eyes never leaving the shoe. \"They won\u0027t do it right. Not like this. Some committee will mess it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027ll never have that.\" I pointed to the anti-logo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Guess I won\u0027t be wearing them to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no them. Only one survived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. \"The thing is, I have to sell it. Serious money problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me, waiting for the catch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to sell it, okay?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh. Never figured you like that, Hunter. But if you need the money, you need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" I said, sounding like the groom at a shotgun wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you see, I\u0027ve got this credit-card bill, and it\u0027s about a thousand dollars - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until we were out on the street, cash in hand, that I realized I could have asked for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe punch line to this tragic little tale is that the client never released the shoe. They never intended to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, they pirate little bits of it every season. Like Frankenstein\u0027s monster in reverse, the shoe is being slowly disassembled, its beautiful organs transplanted into a dozen different bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve probably seen the shoe yourself if you\u0027ve kept your eyes on the ground, but only in pieces. It\u0027s easy to recognize, on the client\u0027s products and a dozen knockoffs and bootlegs - that part of any shoe that rewires your brain, makes you think for a moment that you can fly. But you\u0027ll never hold the whole thing in your hand. It went up in smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, you can\u0027t blame the client for following the first rule of consumerism: Never give us what we really want. Cut the dream into pieces and scatter them like ashes. Dole out the empty promises. Package our aspirations and sell them to us, cheaply made enough to fall apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least Antoine got good value for his money: he got the real thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I got Jen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe wound up kissing after the shoe was sold and gone, out on the street in the Bronx, me a little bit nervous about the thousand dollars stuffed into our pockets, big wads of small bills. (Try it sometime - it\u0027s pretty intense.) And after that we went back downtown and back to work, me knowing that I was following a compass whose needle swung toward trouble. Jen\u0027s an impact player, a spoiled brat, a royal pain in the ass, and she rewires me like nothing else. But things get better when she turns them inside out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich she usually does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter WHATEVER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSO JEN AND I ARE STILL WATCHING THE JAMMERS, WAITING\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor their next move. But don\u0027t try this at home. They\u0027re cashed up, dressed to move, and if they catch you messing with them, they will turn your head purple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t worry, though. You won\u0027t be left out. They\u0027re coming soon to a shopping mall near you. They have an agenda, and it includes everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jammers are all around you, even if you can\u0027t see them. Well, okay, they\u0027re not exactly invisible. A lot of them have hair dyed in five colors, or wear six-inch platform sneakers, or carry enough metal in their skin that it\u0027s a hassle getting on an airplane. Pretty easy to spot, come to think of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they don\u0027t wear signs saying what they are. After all, if you knew what they were up to, they couldn\u0027t work their magic. They have to observe carefully and delude and confuse you in ways you don\u0027t realize. Like good tricksters, they let you think you\u0027ve discovered chaos on your own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you ask the question: What can the Jammers do, anyway? Won\u0027t they just fizzle like any other fad, fail like a million other revolutions, wind up useless and bitter, like an orphaned pile of pet rocks in the closet? Or can a small group of well-organized and charismatic Innovators really change the world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe they can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy my reading of history, that\u0027s the way it\u0027s happened every time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/so-yesterday/page-22.html","bookId":2699,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:56 AM"}
