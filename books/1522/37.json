Go ahead ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Further information, Category two emergency in approximately thirty-five minutes.

If not open, will use runway two five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever they could, airport controllers avoided naming, on radio, an airline involved in any accident, or a potential one, The phrase \"the flight in question\" was used as a cover. Airlines were touchy about such things, taking the view that the fewer times their name was repeated in that kind of context, the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust the same, Mel was aware, what had happened tonight would get plenty of publicity, most likely worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"City twenty-five to ground control. Is the pilot requesting foam on runway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No foam. Repeat, no foam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe absence of foam meant that the aircraft had serviceable landing gear and would not require a belly landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll emergency vehicles, Mel knew---pumpers, salvage trucks, and ambulances---would be following the fire chief, who also had a separate radio channel to communicate with them individually. When an emergency was notified, no one waited. They observed the principle: better to be ready too soon than too late. Emergency crews would now take up position between the two runways, ready to move to either as necessary. The procedure was no improvisation. Every move for situations like this was detailed in an airport emergency master plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen there was a break in transmissions, Mel thumbed on his own radio mike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ground control from mobile one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mobile one, go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has Joe Patroni, with stalled aircraft on runway three zero, been advised of new emergency situation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Affirmative.

He was heading across the airfield for the second time tonight, one hand on the wheel, the other on the microphone---driving as fast as he dared in the continued blowing snow and restricted visibility. Taxi and runway lights, guidelines in the dark, flashed by. Beside him on the car\u0027s front seat were Tanya Livingston and the Tribune reporter, Tomlinson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes ago, when Tanya had handed Mel her note about the explosion aboard Flight Two, and the flight\u0027s attempt to reach Lincoln International, Mel had broken free instantly from the crowd of Meadowood residents. With Tanya beside him, he headed for the elevators which would take him to the basement garage two floors below, and his official airport car. Mel\u0027s place now was on runway three zero, if necessary to take charge. Shouldering his way through the crowd in the main concourse, he had caught sight of the Tribune reporter and said tersely, \"Come with me.\" He owed Tomlinson a favor in return for the reporter\u0027s tip-off about Elliott Freemantle---both the legal contract form and the lawyer\u0027s mendacious statements later, which Mel had been able to repudiate. When Tomlinson hesitated, Mel snapped, \"I haven\u0027t time to waste. But I\u0027m giving you a chance you may be sorry for not taking.\" Without further questioning, Tomlinson fell in step beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, as they drove, Mel accelerating ahead of taxiing aircraft where he could, Tanya repeated the substance of the news about Flight Two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me get this straight,\" Tomlinson said. \"There\u0027s only one runway long enough, and facing the right direction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel said grimly, \"That\u0027s the way it is. Even though there should be two.\" He was remembering bitterly the proposals he had made, over three successive years, for an additional runway to parallel three zero. The airport needed it. Traffic volume and aircraft safety cried out for implementation of Mel\u0027s report, particularly since the runway would take two years to build. But other influences proved stronger. Money had not been found, the new runway had not been built. Nor had construction---despite Mel\u0027s further pleas---yet been approved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a good many projects, Mel could swing the Board of Airport Commissioners his way. In the case of the proposed new runway, he had canvassed them individually and received promises of support, but later the promises were withdrawn. Theoretically, airport commissioners were independent of political pressure; in fact, they owed their appointments to the mayor and, in most cases, were political partisans themselves. If pressure was put on the mayor to delay an airport bond issue because of other projects, similarly financed and more likely to swing votes, the pressure penetrated through. In the case of the proposed new runway it not only penetrated, but three times had proved effective. Ironically, as Mel remembered earlier tonight, triple-decking of the airport\u0027s public parking lots---less necessary, but more visible---had not been held up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriefly, and in plain words, which until now he had reserved for private sessions, Mel described the situation, including its political overtones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to use all that as coming from you.\" Tomlinson\u0027s voice held the controlled excitement of a reporter who knew he was on to a good story. \"May I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be the devil to pay after it appeared in print, Mel realized; he could imagine the indignant telephone calls from City Hall on Monday morning. But someone should say it. The public ought to know how serious the situation was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead,\" Mel said. \"I guess I\u0027m in a quoting mood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I thought.\" From the far side of the car the reporter regarded Mel quizzically. \"If you don\u0027t mind my saying so, you\u0027ve been in great form tonight. Just now, and with the lawyer and those Meadowood people. More like your old self. I haven\u0027t heard you speak out like that in a long while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel kept his eyes on the taxiway ahead, waiting to pass an Eastern DC-8, which was turning left. But he was thinking: Had his demeanor of the past year or two, the absence of his old fiery spirit, been so obvious that others had noticed it also?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him, close enough so that Mel was conscious of her nearness and warmth, Tanya said softly, \"Ali the time we\u0027re talking... about runways, the public, Meadowood, other things... I\u0027m thinking about those people on Flight Two. I wonder how they\u0027re feeling, if they\u0027re afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re afraid, all right,\" Mel said. \"If they\u0027ve any sense, and provided they know what\u0027s happening. I\u0027d be afraid, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was remembering his own fear when he had been trapped in the sinking Navy airplane, long ago. As if triggered by memory, he felt a surge of pain around the old wound in his foot. In the past hour\u0027s excitement he had adjusted to ignoring it, but as always, with tiredness and overstrain, the effect forced itself on him in the end. Mel compressed his lips tightly and hoped that soon the seizure would lessen or pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been waiting for another gap in ground-to-ground radio exchanges. As one occurred, Mel depressed his mike button once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mobile one to ground control. Do you have report on how critical is the requirement of the flight in distress for runway three zero?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mobile one, we understand very critical. Is that Mr. Bakersfeld?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand by, sir. We\u0027re getting more information now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill driving, nearing runway three zero, Mel waited. What came next would determine whether or not to follow the drastic course of action he was contemplating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ground control to mobile one. Following message just received, via Chicago Center, from flight in question. Message begins. Straight-in course to Lincoln no good if ends on runway two five. Airplane heavily loaded, will be landing very fast...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trio in the car listened tensely to the report of Vernon Demerest\u0027s message. At the words, \"If we\u0027re brought in on two five there\u0027ll be a broken airplane and dead people,\" Mel heard Tanya\u0027s sharp intake of breath, felt her shudder beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to acknowledge when ground control transmitted again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mobile one---Mr. Bakersfeld, there is an addition to previous message, personal to you, from your brotherin-law. Can you reach a phone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Negative,\" Mel said. \"Read it now, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mobile one\"---he sensed the controller hesitate---\"the language is very personal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe controller was aware---as Mel was---that many ears around the airport would be listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it concern the present situation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Affirmative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then read it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. Message begins. \u0027You helped make this trouble, you bastard, by not listening to me about airport flight insurance...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel\u0027s mouth tightened, but he waited to the end, then acknowledged non-committally, \"Roger, out.\" He was sure that Vernon had enjoyed sending the message, as much as anything could be enjoyed aboard Flight Two at present, and would be even more pleased to learn the way it was received.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe extra message was unnecessary, though. Mel had already made his decision on the basis of the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis car was now speeding down runway three zero. The circle of floodlights and vehicles surrounding the mired Aereo-Mexican 707 jet were coming into sight. Mel noted approvingly that the runway was only lightly snow-covered. Despite the blockage of one portion, the remainder had been kept plowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe switched his radio to the frequency of airport maintenance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mobile one to Snow Desk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Snow Desk.\" Danny Farrow\u0027s voice sounded tired, which was not surprising. \"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny,\" Mel said, \"break the Conga Line. Send the Oshkosh plows and heavy graders across to runway three zero. They\u0027re to head for where the stuck airplane is, and await instructions. Get them started now, then call me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger, wilco.\" Danny seemed about to add a question, then apparently changed his mind. A moment later, on the same frequency, the occupants of the car heard him issue orders to the Conga Line convoy leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tribune reporter leaned forward around Tanya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m still fitting pieces together,\" Tomlinson said. \"That bit about flight insurance... Your brother-in-law\u0027s an Air Line Pilots Association wheel, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Mel halted the car on the runway, a few feet short of the circle of lights around the big, stalled aircraft. There was plenty of action, he could see; beneath the aircraft fuselage, and on both sides, men were digging feverishly. The stocky form of Joe Patroni was visible directing activities. In a moment Mel would join him, after the return radio call from Danny Farrow at the Snow Desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter said thoughtfully, \"I think I heard something awhile back. Didn\u0027t your brother-in-law make a big play to cancel insurance vending here---the way ALPA wants to---and you turned him down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t turn him down. The airport board did, though I agreed with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it isn\u0027t an unfair question, has what\u0027s happened tonight made you change your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya protested, \"Surely this isn\u0027t the time...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll answer that,\" Mel said. \"I haven\u0027t changed my mind, at least not yet. But I\u0027m thinking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel reasoned: the time for a change of heart about flight insurance---if there was to be one---was not now, in the height of emotion and the wake of tragedy. In a day or two, what had occurred tonight would be seen in better perspective. Mel\u0027s own decision---whether to urge the airport board to revise its policy, or not---should be made then. Meanwhile, no one could deny that tonight\u0027s events added strength to Vernon Demerest\u0027s---and the Air Line Pilots Association---arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePossibly, Mel supposed, a compromise might be worked out. An ALPA spokesman once confided to him that the pilots did not expect their anti-airport insurance campaign to be won, either outright or quickly; success would take years and \"would have to be cut like bologna---a slice at a time.\" One slice at Lincoln International miglit be to prohibit use of non-supervised insurance vending machines, as some airports had already done. One state---Colorado---had outlawed the machines by Legislative Act. Other states, Mel knew, were considering similar legislation, though there was nothing to stop airports, meanwhile, from acting on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the insurance vending machine system which Mel liked least, even though D. O. Guerrero\u0027s huge insurance policy tonight had not been bought that way. Then, if over-the-counter sales remained---for a few more years until public opinion could be molded---there would have to be more safeguards...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though Mel had resolved not to make a firm decision, it was obvious to himself which way his reasoning was going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio, still tuned to airport maintenance frequency, had been busy with calls between vehicles. Now it announced, \"Snow Desk to mobile one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel responded, \"Go ahead, Danny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four plows and three graders, with convoy leader, are on their way to runway three zero as instructed. What orders, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel chose his words carefully, aware that somewhere in an electronic maze beneath the control tower they were being recorded on tape. Later he might have to justify them. He also wanted to be sure there was no misunderstanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mobile one to Snow Desk. All plows and graders, under direction of convoy leader, will stand by near Aereo-Mexican aircraft which is blocking runway three zero. Vehicles are not, repeat not, initially to obstruct the aircraft, which in a few minutes will attempt to move under its own power. But if that attempt fails, plows and graders will be ordered in to push the aircraft sideways, and to clear the runway. This will be done at any cost, and with all speed. Runway three zero must be open for use in approximately thirty minutes, by which time the obstructing aircraft and all vehicles must be clear. I will coordinate with air traffic control to decide at what time the plows will be ordered in, if necessary. Acknowledge, and confirm. that these instructions are understood\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the car the reporter, Tomlinson, whistled softly. Tanya turned toward Mel, her eyes searching his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn radio there were several seconds\u0027 silence, then Danny Farrow\u0027s voice. \"I guess I understand. But I\u0027d better be sure.\" He repeated the gist of the message, and Mel could imagine Danny sweating again, as he had been earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger,\" Mel acknowledged. \"But be clear about one thing. If those plows and graders go in, I\u0027ll give the order; no one else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s clear,\" Danny radioed. \"And better you than me. Mel, I guess you\u0027ve figured what that equipment of ours\u0027ll do to a 707.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll move it,\" Mel said tersely. \"Right now that\u0027s the important thing.\" There was, Mel knew, other motorized equipment in Airport Maintenance, capable of the same kind of brute force clearing job; but using the Conga Line units, already on the runways, would be surer and faster. He signed off, and replaced the radio mike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomlinson said incredulously, \"Move it! A six-million dollar airplane shoved sideways by snowplows! My God, you\u0027ll tear it to pieces! And afterward, the owners and insurers\u0027ll do the same to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be surprised,\" Mel said. \"Of course, a lot depends on your point of view. If the owners and insurers were on that other flight coming in, they might be cheering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" the reporter conceded, \"I\u0027ll grant you there are some decisions take a lot of guts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya\u0027s hand reached down beside her and found Mel\u0027s. She said softly, emotion in her voice, \"I\u0027m cheering---for what you\u0027re doing now. Whatever happens after, I\u0027ll remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plows and graders which Mel had summoned were coming into sight, traveling fast down the runway, roof beacons flashing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may never happen.\" Mel squeezed Tanya\u0027s hand before releasing it, then opened the car door. \"We\u0027ve twenty minutes to hope it won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN MEL Bakersfeld approached him, Joe Patroni was stomping his feet in an effort to be warm; the effort was largely unsuccessful despite the fleece-lined boots and heavy parka the TWA maintenance chief was wearing. Apart from the brief time Patroni had spent on the aircraft flight deck when the Aereo-Mexican captain and first officer departed, he had been continuously out in the storm since his arrival on the scene more than three hours ago. As well as being cold and physically tired from his various exertions of the day and night, his failure to move the stranded jet despite two attempts so far, had made his temper ready to erupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt almost did, at the news of Mel\u0027s intention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith anyone else, Joe Patroni would have stormed and ranted. Because Mel was a close friend, Patrord removed the unlighted cigar he had been chewing, and eyed Mel unbelievingly. \"Shove an undamaged airplane with snowplows! Are you out of your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Mel said. \"I\u0027m out of runways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel fell a momentary depression at the thought that no one in authority, other than himself, seemed to understand the urgency of clearing three zero, at any cost. Obviously, if he went ahead as he intended, there would be few who would support his action afterward. On the other hand, Mel had not the least doubt there would be plenty of people tomorrow with hindsight---including Aereo-Mexican officials---who would assert he could have done this or that, or that Flight Two should have landed on runway two five after all. Obviously his decision was to be a lonely one. It did not change Mel\u0027s conviction that it should be made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sight of the assembled plows and graders, now deployed in line on the runway, to their right, Patroni dropped his cigar altogether. As he produced another he growled, \"I\u0027ll save you from your own insanity. Keep those Dinky Toys of yours out of my hair and away from this airplane. In fifteen minutes, maybe less, I\u0027ll drive it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel shouted to make himself heard above the wind and roaring engines of vehicles around them. \"Joe, let\u0027s be clear about one thing. When the tower tells us we\u0027re running out of time, that\u0027s it; there\u0027ll be no argument. People\u0027s lives are involved on the flight that\u0027s coming in. If you\u0027ve engines running, they\u0027re to be shut down. At the same time all equipment and the men must move clear immediately. Make sure in advance that all your people understand. The plows will move on my order. If and when they do, they won\u0027t waste time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatroni nodded gloomily. Despite his outburst, Mel thought, the maintenance chief\u0027s usual cocky self-assurance seemed abated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel returned to his car. Tanya and the reporter, huddled in their coats, had been standing outside, watching the work of digging around the aircraft. They got into the car with him, grateful for the warmth inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, Mel called ground control on radio, this time asking for the tower watch chief. After a brief pause, the tower chief\u0027s voice came on the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few words Met explained his intention. What he sought from air traffic control now was an estimate of how long he could wait before ordering the plows and graders to move. Once they did, it would take only minutes to have the obstructing aircraft clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way it looks now,\" the tower chief said, \"the flight in question will be here sooner than we thought. Chicago Center expects to hand over to our approach control in twelve minutes from now. After that we\u0027ll be controlling the flight for eight to ten minutes before landing, which would make time of touchdown, at latest, 0128.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel checked his watch in the dim light from the dash. It showed 1:01 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A choice of which runway to use,\" the tower chief said, \"will have to be made no later than five minutes before landing. After that, they\u0027ll be committed; we can\u0027t turn them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what it meant, Mel calculated, was that his own final decision must be made in another seventeen minutes, perhaps less, depending on the handover time from Chicago Center to Lincoln approach control. There was even less time remaining than he had told Joe Patroai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel found he, too, was beginning to sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould he warn Patroni again, informing him of the reduced time? Mel decided not. The maintenance chief was already directing operations at the fastest pace he could. Nothing would be gained by harassing him further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mobile one to ground control,\" Mel radioed. \"I\u0027ll need to be kept informed of exact status of the approaching flight. Can we hold this frequency clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Affirmative,\" the tower chief said. \"We\u0027ve already moved regular traffic to another frequency. We\u0027ll keep you informed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel acknowledged and signed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him, Tanya asked, \"What happens now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wait.\" Mel checked his watch again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute went by. Two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside they could see men working, still digging feverishly near the front and on each side of the mired aircraft. With a flash of headlights, another truck arrived; men jumped down from its tailgate and hastened to join the others. Joe Patroni\u0027s stocky figure was moving constantly, instructing and exhorting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plows and graders were still in line, waiting. In a way, Mel thought, like vultures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter, Tomlinson, broke the silence inside the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just thinking. When I was a kid, which isn\u0027t all that long ago, most of this place was fields. In summer there were cows and corn and barley. There was a grass airfield; small; nobody thought it would amount to much. If anyone traveled by air, they used the airport in the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s aviation,\" Tanya said. She felt a momentary relief at being able to think and talk of something other than what they were waiting for. She went on, \"Somebody told me once that working in aviation makes a lifetime seem longer because everything changes so often and so fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomlinson objected, \"Not everything\u0027s fast. With airports, the changes aren\u0027t fast enough. Isn\u0027t it true, Mr. Bakersfeld, that within three to four years there\u0027ll be chaos?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chaos is always relative,\" Mel said; the focus of his mind was still on the scene he could see through the car windshield. \"In a good many ways we manage to live with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you dodging the question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he conceded. \"I suppose I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was scarcely surprising, Mel thought. He was less concerned with aviation philosophy at this moment than with the immediacy of what was happening outside. But he sensed Tanya\u0027s need for a lessening of tension, even if illusory; his awareness of her feelings was part of the empathy they seemed increasingly to share. He reminded himself, too, that it was a Trans America flight they were waiting for, and which might land safely or might not. Tanya was a part of Trans America, had helped with the flight\u0027s departure. In a real sense, of the three of them she had the most direct involvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an effort he concentrated on what Tomlinson had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s always been true,\" Mel declared, \"that in aviation, progress in the air has been ahead of progress on the ground. We sometimes think we\u0027ll catch up; in the mid-1960s we almost did but by and large we never do. The best we can manage, it seems, is not to lag too far behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter persisted, \"What should we do about airports? What can we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can think more freely, with more imagination, for one thing. We should get rid of the railway station mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe we still have it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel nodded. \"Unfortunately, in a good many places. All our early airports were imitation railway stations because designers had to draw on experience from somewhere, and railroad experience was all they had. Aftetward, the habit remained. It\u0027s the reason, nowadays, we have so many \u0027straight line\u0027 airports, where terminals stretch on and on, and passengers must walk for miles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomlinson asked, \"Isn\u0027t some of that changing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slowly, and in just a few places.\" As always, despite the pressures of the moment, Mel was warming to his theme. \"A few airports are being built as circles---like doughnuts with car parking inside, instead of somewhere out beyond; with minimum distances for people to walk with aids like high-speed horizontal elevators; with airplanes brought close to passengers instead of the other way around. What it means is that airports are finally being thought of as special and distinct; also as units instead of separate components. Creative ideas, even outlandish ones, are being listened to. Los Angeles is proposing a big, offshore seadrome; Chicago, a man-made airport island in Lake Michigan; nobody\u0027s scoffing. American Airlines has a plan for a giant hydraulic lift to stack airplanes one above the other for loading and unloading. But the changes are slow, they\u0027re not coordinated; we build airports like an unimaginative, patchwork quilt. It\u0027s as if phone subscribers designed and made their own telephones, then plugged them into a world-wide system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio cut abruptly across Mel\u0027s words. \"Ground control to mobile one and city twenty-five. Chicago Center now estimates hand-off of the flight in question to Lincoln approach control will be 0117.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel\u0027s watch showed 1:06 A.m. The message meant that Flight Two was already a minute earlier than the tower chief had forecast. A minute less for Joe Patroni to work; only eleven minutes to Mel\u0027s own decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mobile one, is there any change in the status of runway three zero?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Negative; no change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel wondered: was he cutting things too fine? He was tempted to direct the snowplows and graders to move now, then restrained himself. Responsibility was a two-way street, especially when it came to ordering the near-destruction of a six-million dollar aircraft on the ground. There was still a chance that Joe Patroni might make it, though with every second the possibility was lessening. In front of the stalled 707, Mel could see, some of the floodlights and other equipment were being moved clear. But the aircraft\u0027s engines had not yet been started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those creative people,\" Tomlinson queried, \"the ones you were talking about. Who are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith only half his mind, Mel acknowledged, \"It\u0027s hard to make a list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was watching the scene outside. The remainder of the vehicles and equipment in front of the stalled Aereo-Mexican 707 had now been moved clear, and Joe Patroni\u0027s stocky, snow-covered figure was climbing the boarding ramp, positioned near the aircraft\u0027s nose. Near the top, Patroni stopped, turned, and gestured; he appeared to be shouting to others below. Now Patroni opened the front fuselage door and went inside; almost at once another, slighter figure climbed the ramp and followed him. The aircraft door slammed. Others below trundled the ramp away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the car, the reporter asked again, \"Mr. Bakersfeld, could you name a few of those people---the most imaginative ones about airports and the future?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Tanya said, \"couldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel thought: it would be like a parlor game while the house was burning. All right, he decided if Tanya wanted him to, he would play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can think of some,\" Mel said. \"Fox of Los Angeles; Joseph Foster of Houston, now with ATA of America. Alan Boyd in government; and Thomas Sullivan, Port of New York Authority. In the airlines: Halaby of Pan Am; Herb Godfrey of United. In Canada, John C. Parkin, In Europe---Pierre Cot of Air France; Count Castell in Germany. There are others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Including Mel Bakersfeld,\" Tanya injected. \"Aren\u0027t you forgetting him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomlinson, who had been making notes, grunted. \"I already put him down. It goes without saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel smiled. But did it, he wondered, go without saying? Once, not long ago, the statement would have been true; but he knew that on the national scene he had slipped from view. When that happened, when you left the mainstream for whatever reason, you were apt to be forgotten quickly; and later, even if you wanted to, sometimes you never did get back. It was not that he was doing a less important job at Lincoln International, or doing it less well; as an airport general manager, Mel knew he was as good as ever, probably better. But the big contribution which he had once seemed likely to make no longer was in view. He realized that this was the second time tonight the same thought had occurred to him. Did it matter? Did he care? He decided; Yes, he did!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look!\" Tanya cried out. \"They\u0027re starting the engines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter\u0027s head came up; Mel felt his own excitement sharpen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind number three engine of the Aereo-Mexican 707, a puff of white-gray smoke appeared. Briefly it intensified, then whirled away as the engine fired and held. Now snow was streaming rearward in the jet blast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second puff of smoke appeared behind number four engine, a moment later to be whisked away, snow following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ground control to mobile one and city twenty-five.\" Within the car the radio voice was so unexpected that Mel felt Tanya give a startled jump beside him. \"Chicago Center advises revised handoff time of the flight in question will be... 0116 seven minutes from now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlight Two, Mel realized, was still coming in faster than expected. It meant they had lost another minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Mel held his watch near the light of the dash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the soft ground near the opposite side of the runway from their car, Patroni now had number two engine started. Number one followed. Mel said softly, \"They could still make it.\" Then he remembered that all engines had been started twice before tonight, and both attempts to blast the stuck airplane free had failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of the mired 707 a solitary figure with flashlight signal wands had moved out ahead to where he could be seen from the aircraft flight deck. The man with the wands was holding them above his head, indicating \"all clear.\" Mel could hear and feel the jet engines\u0027 thrum, but sensed they had not yet been advanced in power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix minutes left. Why hadn\u0027t Patroni opened up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanya said tensely, \"I don\u0027t think I can bear the waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter shifted in his seat. \"I\u0027m sweating too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Patroni was opening up! This was it! Mel could hear and feel the greater all-encom passing roar of engines. Behind the stalled Aereo-Mexican jet, great gusts of snow were blowing wildly into the darkness beyond the runway lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mobile one,\" the radio demanded sharply, \"this is ground control. Is there any change in status of runway three zero?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatroni, Mel calculated by his watch, had three minutes left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The airplane\u0027s still stuck.\" Tanya was peering intently through the car windshield. \"They\u0027re using all the engines, but it isn\u0027t moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was straining forward, though; that much Mel could see, even through the blowing snow. But Tanya was right. The aircraft wasn\u0027t moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snowplows and heavy graders had shifted closer together, their beacons flashing brightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold it!\" Mel said on radio. \"Hold it! Don\u0027t commit that flight coming in to runway two five. One way or the other, there\u0027ll be a change in three zero status any moment now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe switched the car radio to Snow Desk frequency, ready to activate the plows. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airport/page-37.html","bookId":1522,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:45:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:45:00 AM"}
