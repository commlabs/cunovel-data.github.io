His hair dulling, his eyes losing their lively spark, the muscles and build of his youth, his life, shriveling into the shell of his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis zombie nature reared its head even as Gale opened her eyes. She pegged him and told me, \"Stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" I said, never wanting to stop something more than I did in that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad they stood in front of me right then I could have killed the Zondorae brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it was done, the bullet had popped out of her chest as if purged and she sat up, taking Clyde\u0027s bony hand in hers. She was utterly unaffected by Clyde\u0027s new appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho knew how long it would last?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now, he was all-zombie, his life-like appearance stolen for the gift of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that I am not the handsome man you have come to love, Dear Heart,\" he said from a mouth that could not speak in dulcet notes any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed her hand to his softened face and said, \"I loved you when you were rotting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed his forehead to hers and sighed, wrapping his arms around her, mindful of his zombie strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb!\" Lewis Archer yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whipped my head around to where he was yelling and saw Brett seizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sprinted to Brett and Jade sat next to him, holding his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tears dropped on him like warm rain and I felt pity well inside me. He\u0027d been my enemy for so long I hadn\u0027t really ever seen him as anything else. But I knew what Brett Mason really was.

Jerking me down next to his face with the last of his strength he said in a hoarse whisper, \"Take care of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur gazes locked for the last time, mine absent of the rancor of our past. I nodded. \"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt his life slip away, his eyes glazing over with the fog of the recently dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt him inside the count of the dead that still lingered within the scope of my call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett now waited with the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade let Brett\u0027s limp hand drop beside his body. Tilting her head to the sky she wailed into the still twilight, her despair like crystal shards in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing it left me bleeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to Jade and when she didn\u0027t resist me I pulled her in against my body, my eyes meeting the rest of the group. Mia looked all around us and then she said in a quiet voice full of fear, \"Where\u0027s Howie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eff, that goddamned Manipulative is prancing around somewhere?\" Jonesy said, his eyes roving to Brett\u0027s still form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked around us, finding nothing but a pile of zip ties, the plastic shredded in loose piles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had escaped his bindings. The directive to the Zondorae brothers fulfilled, still high on adrenaline and loose amongst the populace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed Jade\u0027s head under my chin and said, \"John...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" John asked, straightening after putting the only blanket we had over Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the lump that used to be Brett and swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pulse 911.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb... are you sure?\" Tiff asked, gumless. Her mouth lay silent, her eyes serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They may throw your ass in the local holding tank, Hart,\" Bry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, maybe. But Brett deserved to be handled with dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like it,\" Jonesy said in a contemplative tone. We all turned to him. Jonesy wasn\u0027t introspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, that place is corn cob central...\" he trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher sighed. \"Would you stop with that? Not everything has to have a homosexual reference, Mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, exit only, pal... ya feel me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonesy, this is like a solemn moment here. Brett\u0027s dead, the cops are going to come and maybe Caleb\u0027s going to be in even worse trouble?\" Sophie said, trying to appeal to Jonesy\u0027s decorum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy shrugged. \"I\u0027m just sayin\u0027, preparin\u0027 Hart for stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, don\u0027t, okay?\" I said over Jade\u0027s head as the first of the cruisers pulled up in a loose vee outside the gates of the dump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGame over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost turds traveled along the cheap vinyl flooring of what used to be the Frazier house, swirling around in big fuzzy dirt clumps with the breeze that came through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade and I stood in the open doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place had been stripped. Jade didn\u0027t have anything left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that wasn\u0027t exactly true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d found her broken dreamcatcher behind some loose lumber that lay underneath the basement steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same scrap lumber that Howie had used to beat me but two weeks ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Graysheets had come and cleaned house. All of us knew who the Fraziers had really been. Just a plant. Their sole purpose had been to set up my unraveling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unravel that never happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d have to bite the bullet and just off my ass if they wanted to get rid of me that bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might come to that, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police had launched a full investigation into the death of Brett Mason. We\u0027d given hours of personal testimonies. They weren\u0027t satisfied but the entire group of my friends corroborated my story so they couldn\u0027t nail me with using the dead. Even though I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust not in the way they thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett\u0027s death was truly an accident. Although, some could say that he wouldn\u0027t have died if he hadn\u0027t been carried along by the wind of our paranormal travels. Basically, it was death by association.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was the matter of all the bruises and healing bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there were years of collective damage on Brett. The coroner had enough evidence of systematic abuse to put the dad away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd throw away the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess who was gonna get the corn cob treatment? Couldn\u0027t have happened to a more swell guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all glad. Brett could have transcended into someone of value if he\u0027d lived an alternate life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck. He had been of value. Had. Now he was a statistic. But we weren\u0027t going to forget Brett. His main flaw had been loving Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that it could be a flaw. I totally understood his problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and pressed a kiss on Jade\u0027s still-damp hair, fresh from the same shower I used every day. She was living under my roof now. We were all terrified of whatever may happen in the few days leading up to her legal emancipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything could happen. You\u0027d think she\u0027d be automatically off the hook when the foster family she\u0027d been assigned to live with suddenly were no longer living in the home of record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll their shit gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a scrap of paper, a coin... only the lonely dreamcatcher stood testimony that Jade had ever lived there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuspicious-much, guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps had taken the time to get fifteen trillion reams of paperwork filed that allowed a temporary stay of Jade\u0027s living circumstance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d moved back into my house and she had the spare bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on my hands so I wouldn\u0027t sneak in there for some Quality Time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I remembered the lecture from the experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been through a great deal Caleb,\" my AFTD teacher said, giving the whole group of us a long stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brett Mason\u0027s death, considering their connection via your Life-Transference...\" he shrugged, folding his arms across his chest. \"Well, it had to have been more of an influence than any of us realized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Jonesy asked, earning a scowl of barely-there patience from my teacher. \"She like... was his slave or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Tiff said, popping her gum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out the separator and she sighed. \"Ugh!\" she griped, spitting it out into the proper slot and plunking her butt on an empty seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s that extreme but let\u0027s ask Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes went to her and she blushed, uncomfortable with the attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a small shrug. \"I don\u0027t know, everything felt natural between Brett and I,\" she said, sliding her eyes to mine and I nodded to her. I was the one that established the connection, I couldn\u0027t exactly bitch about it now. \"Anyway, he uh... when he died,\" she took a deep, shuddering breath and I wrapped an arm around her shoulder, stroking her arm as I did. Jade smiled gratefully and went on, \"I felt this release from something I didn\u0027t even know was there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" John asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I couldn\u0027t be with Caleb.\" She looked at me then finished, \"I didn\u0027t want to be with Brett but being with Caleb didn\u0027t feel right anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then there was the other issue,\" Archer said and looked at the teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all got him. Not in front of mixed company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, the translation was: not in front of adults. Technically, with us all emancipated, we were. But somehow all of us still felt separate from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What issue?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex shrugged. \"It\u0027s nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t nothing but we weren\u0027t going to reveal all that to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was something we were still dealing with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had taken a full week for the enhancer to wear off. It had been one of the longest weeks of my life. Remembering Jade\u0027s withdrawals... Sophie\u0027s. The emotional upheaval, a roller coaster of crap I didn\u0027t ever want to ride again. Who even knew what the long-term ramifications were?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trail of my memories broke when Jade spoke, \"I guess this is it, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around at the dump she\u0027d lived in and exhaled in relief. It was over. She\u0027d be moving into her own, government-funded dwelling for minors. A place that was close, secure and clean. This weekend she\u0027d be seventeen and that\u0027s how we\u0027d celebrate, her new digs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, this is it,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stepped out of the doorway hand in hand and she closed it softly behind her, pressing her thumb to the lock pad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pulse-activated lock flashed its reading:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade LeClerc, authorized, 3:42 PM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrazier residence, Secured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left without looking back, her small hand clasped in my larger one, the dreamcatcher held tightly in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only it could protect her from more than nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEPILOGUE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade shivered inside her pink puffy and I pulled her closer to my body.
