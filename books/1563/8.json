People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn\u0027t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\u0027t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\u0027t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghosts didn\u0027t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn\u0027t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\u0027s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\u0027d whisk off for Filch, who\u0027d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\u0027s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn\u0027t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn\u0027t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren\u0027t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\u0027s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he\u0027d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren\u0027t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\u0027t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\u0027t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\u0027t have much of a head start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape\u0027s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we\u0027ll be able to see if it\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wish McGonagall favored us,\" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\u0027t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedwig hadn\u0027t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\u0027s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Harry,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry borrowed Ron\u0027s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\u0027d been wrong. Snape didn\u0027t dislike Harry -- he hated him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\u0027s, but they had none of Hagrid\u0027s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\u0027t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren\u0027t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\u0027t a dunderhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowdered root of what to an infusion of what ? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\u0027s hand had shot into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, sir,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape\u0027s lips curled into a sneer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn\u0027t everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored Hermione\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn\u0027t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought you wouldn\u0027t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\u0027, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape was still ignoring Hermione\u0027s quivering hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though, why don\u0027t you try her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\u0027s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\u0027t you all copying that down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings didn\u0027t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\u0027s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\u0027s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Idiot boy!\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You -- Potter -- why didn\u0027t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he\u0027d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\u0027s another point you\u0027ve lost for Gryffindor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t push it,\" he muttered, \"I\u0027ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\u0027s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\u0027d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cheer up,\" said Ron, \"Snape\u0027s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\u0027s voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang -- back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid\u0027s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\u0027s freckles. I spent half me life chasin\u0027 yer twin brothers away from the forest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\u0027s knee and drooled all over his robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \"that old git.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An\u0027 as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\u0027d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\u0027yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\u0027t get rid of her -- Filch puts her up to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry told Hagrid about Snape\u0027s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he seemed to really hate me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet Harry couldn\u0027t help thinking that Hagrid didn\u0027t quite meet his eyes when he said that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot -- great with animals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\u0027s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet :\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what\u0027s good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\u0027t mentioned the date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might\u0027ve been happening while we were there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\u0027t meet Harry\u0027s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they\u0027d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\u0027d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\u0027t want to tell Harry? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone-harry-potter-1/page-8.html","bookId":1563,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:29 PM"}
