You remember that shit we used to drop in water in chemistry class? What was that—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Potassium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it. Boom, right? That shit is you and Chavez, man. I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re talking to that pinche bastard again. You thought about that offer I made you earlier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be into it, Ralphas. I got enough worries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph blew a line of marijuana smoke against the window. He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get you. I been trying since high school and I still don\u0027t. You push a guy off a smokestack ten stories up\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Special circumstances. He was going to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You break some pendejo\u0027s leg just because an old lady asked you to, for no money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was ripping off her social security checks, Ralphas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you work for Chavez when you know he\u0027s going to fuck you up, man. Then I offer you five hundred a week easy, doing the same kind of shit, and you tell me you\u0027re not into it. Loco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChico had been quiet so far. Now he turned his head slightly and said, \"Fuck him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Ralph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph took another toke. \"Chico\u0027s new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChico kept his eyes on the road, left hand on the wheel, and huge right arm draped along the top of the bench seat. He had LA RAZA tattooed in very small letters on his deltoid. His hair was covered with a yellow bandanna, tied in back, piratestyle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck him,\" he said again. \"What you need his pansy ass for, man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph smiled at me. \"Eh, Chico, this guy\u0027s okay. I saved his ass from some shitkickers in high school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saved me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, man. You remember.\" Then to Chico: \"Changed his life, man. Became this martial arts badass. He\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChico grunted, unimpressed. \"Guy I knew in the pen did tae kwon do. Kicked the shit out of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kept driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePawnshop Number Fourteen was in a fiveunit strip mall just off Hillcrest, sandwiched between the Mayan Taco King and Joleen\u0027s Beauty Shop. Number Fourteen\u0027s bright yellow marquee said WE BUY GOLD!!!! The windows were painted with pumpkins and witches and smiling cartoon dollar signs that didn\u0027t quite go with the burglar bars and the shotgun displays aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gallery ran in front of the mall, covered by a metal awning held up by square white posts. Leaning against the posts outside Number Fourteen were two young Latino guys, maybe seventeen, both in black jeans and Raiders jackets. They would\u0027ve made good fullbacks if they\u0027d been in school. Sitting on the sidewalk between them, leaning back on his elbows, was a much skinnier kid who\u0027d evidently done his clothes shopping with the fullbacks. On all of them the clothes were huge and baggy, but especially on the skinny guy. The three of them looked like a family of elephants who\u0027d gotten a group rate on liposuction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph and Chico walked up to them. I followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of the kids moved, but the skinny one in the middle smiled. He had the pointiest chin I\u0027d ever seen, with a little spiky tuft of adolescent beard at the tip. It made the lower half of his face look like it had been fashioned out of a stirrup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boss man,\" he said. \"?Que pasa?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph smiled back. \"Vega. You want to take your Chiquita’s here and play somewhere else? You\u0027re cramping my business, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got the feeling Ralph and Vega had gone through this a couple of times before. They looked at each other, both smiling, waiting for something to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat broke was our new man Chico\u0027s patience. He detached himself from Ralph\u0027s side and said, \"Fuck this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked up to the skinny kid and lifted him by his jacket with one hand. Maybe that would\u0027ve been impressive if the kid hadn\u0027t weighed ninety pounds, or if Chico hadn\u0027t planted his legs apart and given Vega a beautiful opportunity to knee him in the balls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVega\u0027s knee was mostly bone, and what he lacked in weight he made up for in ferocity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he kneed Chico, Vega\u0027s face tightened and his teeth clenched so hard his tuft of beard almost touched his lower lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChico grunted, dropped the kid, then doubled over and started turning around in slow motion. Chico\u0027s face was the same colour as his bandanna. One of the fullbacks kicked him from behind and Chico went sideways onto the asphalt groaning: \"Mierda, mierda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Ralph. \"He\u0027s new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVega adjusted his baggy clothes and sat back down, smiling again. He rubbed his little beard and told his buddies what a big tough pachuco Chico was. They laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, man,\" said Vega, \"you had some customers come by today, Boss, but they didn\u0027t look like a good type of people, right? We told them no way. We\u0027re looking out for you good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout then a scrawny grayhaired man shuffled out of the pawnshop, looked at Ralph a little fearfully, and started apologizing in Spanish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Arguello, I swear I didn\u0027t know they were out here. I chased them off twice already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the old man started waving a rolledup newspaper at the three kids, halfheartedly telling them to go away. Nobody paid him any attention. The kids were looking at the .357 Magnum Ralph was now holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, vato,\" Ralph said to me casually, \"used to be you had just La Familia coming to you. Least they were adults, right? Now you\u0027ve got these pinche kids, think just because they can beat up their math teacher they got a right to protection money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSad, man. It\u0027s really sad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVega looked at the gun in Ralph\u0027s hand like it was a big joke. \"You gonna shoot me, Boss Man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVega wasn\u0027t afraid. Maybe you don\u0027t get afraid when you\u0027re seventeen and you\u0027ve got your set behind you and you know guns the way other kids know skateboards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, I didn\u0027t like the way Ralph was smiling. I\u0027d seen Ralph use a .22 like a staple gun on a guy who\u0027d touched his girlfriend in a bar. Ralph had been smiling the same way as he stapled the guy\u0027s palm flat against the wooden counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got guns,\" Vega said. \"Like in the middle of the night. Outside your house, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChico was on his hands and knees now, taking noisy breaths and mumbling that he was going to kill them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVega looked down and said, \"Good dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat got another laugh from his fullbacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph was perfectly still, frozen. I figured I had a few seconds before he made up his mind what part of this kid\u0027s body he was going to blow a hole in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You three need to leave,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVega looked at me for the first time. \"Who\u0027s this, Boss Man? This your girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Ralph could shoot, I grabbed Vega\u0027s ankles and pulled. The kid went back off his elbows and hit his head on the cement edge of the stairs. I dropped him just as his fullback buddies realized they needed to act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t often use Ride the Tiger. Usually you don\u0027t get opponents attacking the way a tiger does, from above. As the first kid jumped me I slid into bow stance and swept my arms up in a circle, my right hand rolling against his chest and my left hand against his leg. He flew over me like he\u0027d been bounced over the top of a spinning wheel. I didn\u0027t look behind to see how he landed on the asphalt of the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second kid tackled me from the side. I hooked his baggy jacket, turned my waist hard, and flipped him over my knee. He landed on his butt with a muffled crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I saw Vega move out of the corner of my eye and saw the flash of metal and I turned, it would\u0027ve been too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid was propped up on one elbow, a long knife in his hand, the tip frozen six inches away from my thigh. Ralph was kneeling next to him, smiling calmly, the muzzle of his .357 pressed hard into Vega\u0027s eye. Vega\u0027s head tilted up at the same angle as the barrel, as if he was looking into the eyepiece of a telescope. His free eye was twitching violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man put you on the ground, ese,\" Ralph told him amiably. \"You got any sense, that\u0027s where you stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us stayed frozen for a couple of centuries. Then, finally, Vega\u0027s knife clattered against the pavement. \"You\u0027re dead, Boss Man. You know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph grinned. \"Twenty or thirty times, ese.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph took Vega\u0027s knife, then stood up and put away Mr. Subtle. I looked around. The guy I\u0027d knocked on his butt was still on his butt. He was staring at me. His eyes were watering and he was tilting sideways, trying to get away from the pain. The guy I\u0027d thrown into the parking lot was trying to stand up, but it looked like his left shoulder was glued to the pavement. I think maybe his collarbone was broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got the kids to their feet and started herding them out of the lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shuffled down Bandera, Vega shouting back at me that they knew where I lived and my family was dead. I called after Vega that his buddy would need a doctor for the collarbone. Vega shot me the finger. His eye was still twitching from the cold, oily nudge of the .357 muzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I came back to the front door of Number Fourteen, Chico was sitting on the sidewalk, trying not to throw up. He looked up at me resentfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky shot,\" I said. \"I thought you had him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man with the rolledup newspaper was trying to explain to Ralph that everything was fine and he would have it under control from now on. He looked nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph grinned at me and brought out a clip of money and peeled off a few bills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Least I can do, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe going price for beating up teenagers was two hundred dollars. A lot more expensive than a few .357 rounds. I gave the money back to Ralph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph shook his head in amazement. \"So you wouldn\u0027t be into it, eh, vato \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. Then he turned and went into Number Fourteen to check on business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are definite disadvantages to teaching a fouryearold to tell time. As soon as I walked in Erainya\u0027s front door at six that evening Jem looked up at me from the diningroom table, pointed at his Crayola Swatch, and told me I was late. We now had only thirty minutes before our movie started at the Galaxy. He didn\u0027t want to miss the previews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scooted out from the table and rushed toward me. Instead of our usual fulltackle hug he screamed \"Watch!\" as he ran, then proved how well he\u0027d been practicing his moves by landing a flying kick in my crotch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also disadvantages to teaching a fouryear old martial arts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped away a few tears and limped with him into the kitchen, assuring him he was learning the basics just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen smelled like burnt fila and garlic. It always smelled like Erainya had just been cooking, though I\u0027d never actually caught her doing it. I suspected she\u0027d snuck an entire sweatshop full of Greek cooks back from the old country and kept them locked in the basement when she had company over. Of course this was the same woman who\u0027d shot her husband, so I\u0027d never gotten the courage to actually check her basement. No telling what or who else I\u0027d find down there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya handed me a threesection paper plate loaded with Mediterranean food. It was so thickly covered with Saran Wrap I couldn\u0027t tell exactly what was underneath the wrap. I only knew it was food because Erainya handed me a plate like that every time I came over. Apparently my uncertain employment status hadn\u0027t changed the ritual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just in time,\" I said. \"I was beginning to think I might have to go shopping this month.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-22.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
