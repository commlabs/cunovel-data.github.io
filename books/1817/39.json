You’re not trying to convince yourself because Hailey’s back, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not. I was falling in love with you after our first date. Hailey has nothing to do with this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s good then, because I love you too.” She smiled as she hugged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and smiled because she loved me like I loved her. I broke our embrace and kissed her as the waves danced around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready to go back to the shore?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, not yet.” She smiled. “I want to be here with you in the water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I feel safe with you,” she said as she splashed water at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, so that’s how you want to play?” I chuckled as I splashed her in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a playful scream and splashed me back. Then she really surprised me when she started to swim away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get back here!” I said as I swam after her. God, she was fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slowed down and I was able to catch up to her. I grabbed her from behind and we both went under the water. When we both came back up, she laughed. I was loving this side of her; this side that she had hidden away from everyone for the past two years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer laughter stopped and she placed her hands on each side of my face. “Thank you. Thank you for everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went back to the beach house to change out of our bathing suits because we needed to get back to the city. I went to my room to change and Amelia went to hers. As I grabbed a pair of shorts from the drawer, I heard Amelia call my name from her room. When I opened the door, she was standing in the middle of the room, holding a sheet around her. I tilted my head and smiled as did she. She never looked sexier than she did at that moment. Her blonde hair was still wet and it was starting to dry in waves. The silhouette of her perfectly shaped body was visible under the sheet that clung to her. I walked over to her and stroked her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never been so sure of anything in my life. I’m a little nervous because I’ve only ever had sex with Billy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t need to be nervous with me, baby. I will be everything you need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur lips locked passionately as my hand cupped the nape of her neck. This was it. The moment I’d been waiting for since the first day I laid eyes on her. I was going to explore every inch of her body, not only with my hands, but with my tongue as well. Making love to her was going to be slow and gentle because that was what she deserved. She was going to get my full attention to her needs and I was going to make sure that it was something she would never forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let go of the sheet and let it drop to the floor. I broke our kiss and stared at her beautiful naked body. She was more perfect than I had thought and I didn’t think that was possible. Her blue eyes stared into mine as she took my hand and placed it on her breast. I was so hard and my cock was throbbing for her. I walked her back to the bed, where she lay flat on her back with her legs hanging over the bed. I smiled as I took down my shorts and my lips covered her supple breast. She moaned as my teeth lightly tugged on her hard nipple and then my tongue licked it to soothe the sting. My hand gripped her other breast, kneading it and getting her more excited, before it traveled down her torso and stopped when my fingers touched her clit. She moaned and threw her head back as my fingers rubbed her in tiny circles. I lifted my mouth from her breast and looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to make sure you are completely satisfied and I’m going to take my time. I can promise you this won’t be rushed. You deserve every bit of pleasure I have to offer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too,” I said as my lips explored her other breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved my fingers down and felt the wetness that emerged from her. I let out a moan as I plunged my finger inside her and felt how tight she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to make you come like this,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please do.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inserted another finger inside her and, as I moved them in and out, her hips moved up and down with the same motion. Her moans became louder, arousing me more. I planted my thumb firmly on her clit and rubbed it until she couldn’t take anymore and I sent her body to orgasm. She tightened her legs and her body shook as she threw back her head and her voice reached a high-pitched shout. I immediately went down on her and tasted every bit of pleasure that poured from her. She ran her fingers through my hair and then held my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” she kept saying over and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up and took down my underwear. She smiled as she looked at my full package and licked her lips as she sat up on the bed. She wrapped her lips around my cock and began sucking. She caught me off guard, but I wasn’t going to complain. I fisted her hair as I stood there and watched her move her head up and down. Her mouth felt incredible wrapped around me and I could only imagine what her pussy felt like when it was wrapped tightly around me. I stopped her because I needed to be inside her. I reached over to grab a condom and she grabbed my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m on the pill. I have been for years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay back down on the bed and I hovered over her, pushing my cock between her legs. “If at any time it hurts you, I will stop. Just say the word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Collin, I love how gentle you’re being, but for the love of God, just fuck me already.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckled as I kissed her lips and then stared into her beautiful eyes while I pushed myself inside her. I wanted to take it slow so I didn’t hurt her. I wanted to ease my way in, but she had another plan. She placed her hands firmly on my ass and pushed me down so I would be deep inside her. As soon as she did that, I let out a loud moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amelia, you feel incredible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So do you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thrust in and out of her slowly at first, but then I picked up the pace when she wrapped her legs around my waist and I fell deeper inside her. My lips met hers and our tongues danced together as I was on the verge of an orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to come, Amelia. Can you come with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“YES!” she screamed as her body tightened. I felt her coming and one last deep thrust was all it took before I spilled myself inside her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-39.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
