Do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto looked away from her and focused on Moneo\u0027s back, the motions of the majordomo, the tucked-in pretenses of secrecy so apparent there. The procession had come off the first gentle incline. It turned now to begin the climb onto Ringwall West. Moneo moved as he had always moved, one foot ahead of another, aware of the ground where he would place each step, but there was something new in the majordomo. Leto could feel the man drawing away, no longer content to march beside his Lord\u0027s cowled face, no longer trying to match himself to his master\u0027s destiny. Off to the east, the Sareer waited. Off to the west, there was the river, the plantations. Moneo looked neither left nor right. He had seen another destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not answer me,\" Hwi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already know the answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.

And I think I already know where it is that you live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned a startled glance on her and found himself locked in her gaze. It was astonishing. He could not move his eyes away from her. A profound fear coursed through and he felt his hands begin to twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You live where the fear of being and the love of being are combined, all in one person,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You area mystic,\" she said, \"gentle to yourself only because you are in the middle of that universe looking outward, looking in ways that others cannot.

The trembling of his hands could be felt all through his front segment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love, that is what you understand,\" she said. \"Love, and that is all of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands stopped trembling. A tear rolled down each of his cheeks. When the tears touched his cowl, wisps of blue smoke erupted. He sensed the burning and was thankful for the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have faith in life,\" Hwi said. \"I know that the courage of love can reside only in this faith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out with her left hand and brushed the tears from his cheeks. It surprised him that the cowl did not react with its ordinary reflex to prevent the touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know,\" he asked, \"that since I have become thus, you are the first person to touch my cheeks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I know what you are and what you were,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I was... ahhh, Hwi.

You are the first person, the only person to whom I have ever completely revealed myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I will not mourn for what might have been,\" he said. \"Yes, my love, I will share my soul with you.\" -\u003d Think of it as plastic memory, this force within you which trends you and your fellows toward tribal forms. This plastic memory seeks to return to its ancient shape, the tribal society. It is all around you-the feudatory, the diocese, the corporation, the platoon, the sports club, the dance troupes, the rebel cell, the planning council, the prayer group... each with its master and servants, its host and parasites. And the swarms of alienating devices (including these very words!) tend eventually to be enlisted in the argument for a return to \"those better rimes.\" I despair of teaching you other ways. You have square thoughts which resist circles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Stolen Journals IDAHO FOUND he could manage the climb without thinking about it. This body grown by the Tleilaxu remembered things the Tleilaxu did not even suspect. His original youth might be lost in the eons, but his muscles were Tleilaxu-young and he could bury his childhood in forgetfulness while he climbed. In that childhood, he had learned survival by flight into the high rocks of his home planet. It did not matter that these rocks in front of him now had been brought here by men, they also had been shaped by ages of weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning sun was hot on Idaho\u0027s back. He could hear Siona\u0027s efforts to reach the relatively simple support position of a narrow ledge far below him. The position was virtually useless to Idaho, but it had been the argument which had brought Siona finally into agreement that they should attempt this climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had objected that he might try it alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla, three of her Fish Speaker aides, Garun and three chosen from his Museum Fremen waited on the sand at the foot of the barrier Wall which enclosed the Sareer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho did not think about the Wall\u0027s height. He thought only about where he would next put a hand or a foot. He thought about the coil of light rope around his shoulders. That rope was the tallness of this Wall. He had measured it out on the ground, triangulating across the sand, not counting his steps. When the rope was long enough it was long enough. The Wall was as high as the rope was long. Any other way of thinking could only dull his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling for handholds which he could not see, Idaho groped his way up the sheer face... well, not quite sheer. Wind and sand and even some rain, the forces of cold and heat, had been at their erosive work here for more than three thousand years. For one full day, Idaho had sat on the sand below the Wall and he had studied what had been accomplished by Time. He had fixed certain patterns in his mind-a slanting shadow, a thin line, a crumbling bulge, a tiny lip of rock here and another over there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers wriggled upward into a sharp crack. He tested his weight gently on the support. Yes. Briefly, he rested, pressing his face against warm rock, not looking up or down. He was simply here. Everything was a matter of the pacing. His shoulders must not be allowed to tire too soon. Weight must be adjusted between feet and arms. Fingers took inevitable damage, but while bone and tendons held, the skin could be ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, he crept upward. A bit of rock broke away from his hand; dust and shards fell across his right cheek, but he did not even feel it. Every bit of his awareness concentrated on the groping hand, the balance of his feet on the tiniest of protrusions. He was a mote, a particle which defied gravity... a finger-hold here, a toehold there, clinging to the rock surface at times by the sheer power of his will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine makeshift pitons bulged one of his pockets, but he resisted using them. The equally makeshift hammer dangled from his belt on a short cord whose knot his fingers had memorized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla had been difficult. She would not give up her lasgun. She had, however, obeyed Siona\u0027s direct order to accompany them. A strange woman... strangely obedient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you not sworn to obey me?\" Siona had demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla\u0027s reluctance had vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, Siona had said: \"She always obeys my direct orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we may not have to kill her,\" Idaho had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would rather not attempt it. I don\u0027t think you have even the faintest idea of her strength and quickness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarun, the Museum Fremen who dreamed of becoming a \"true Naib in the old fashion,\" had set the stage for this climb by answering Idaho\u0027s question: \"How will the God Emperor come to Tuono?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the same way he chose for a visit during my great-grandfather\u0027s time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that was?\" Siona had prompted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been sitting in the dusty shadows outside the guest house, sheltering from the afternoon sun on the day of the announcement that the Lord Leto would be wed in Tuono. A semicircle of Garun\u0027s aides squatted around the doorstep where Siona and Idaho sat with Garun. Two Fish Speakers lounged nearby, listening. Nayla was due to arrive momentarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarun pointed to the high Wall behind the village, its rim glistening distant gold in the sunlight. \"The Royal Road runs there and the God Emperor has a device which lowers him gently from the heights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s built into his cart,\" Idaho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suspensors,\" Siona agreed. \"I\u0027ve seen them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My great-grandfather said they came along the Royal Road, a great troop of them. The God Emperor glided down to our village square on his device. The others came down on ropes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho spoke thoughtfully: \"Ropes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did they come?\" Siona asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To affirm that the God Emperor had not forgotten his Fremen, so my great-grandfather said. It was a great honor, but not as great as this wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho arose while Garun was still talking. There was a clear view of the high Wall from nearby-straight down the central street, a view from the base in the sand to the top in the sunlight. Idaho strode to the corner of the guest house out into the central street. He stopped there, turned and looked at the Wall. The first look told why everyone said it was not possible to climb that face. Even then, he resisted thinking about a measurement of the height. It could be five hundred meters or five thousand. The important thing lay in what a more careful study revealed tiny transverse cracks, broken places, even a narrow ledge about twenty meters above the drifting sand at the bottom... and another ledge about two-thirds of the way up the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that an unconscious part of him, an ancient and dependable part, was making the necessary measurements, scaling them to his own body-so many Duncan-lengths to that place, a handgrip here, another there. His own hands. He could already feel himself climbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona\u0027s voice came from near his right shoulder as he stood in that first examination. \"What\u0027re you doing?\" She had come up soundlessly, looking now where he looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can climb that Wall,\" Idaho said. \"If I carried a light rope, I could pull up a heavier rope. The rest of you could climb it easily then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarun joined them in time to hear this. \"Why would you climb the Wall, Duncan Idaho?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona answered for him, smiling at Garun. \"To provide a suitable greeting for the God Emperor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had been before her doubts, before her own eyes and the ignorance of such a climb, had begun to erode that first confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that first elation, Idaho asked: \"How wide is the Royal Road up there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have never seen it,\" Garun said. \"But I am told it is very wide. A great troop can march abreast along it, so they say. And there are bridges, places to view the river and... and... oh, it is a marvel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why have you never gone up there to see it yourself?\" Idaho asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarun merely shrugged and pointed at the Wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla arrived then and the argument about the climb had begun. Idaho thought about that argument as he climbed. How strange, the relationship between Nayla and Siona! They were like two conspirators... yet not conspirators. Siona commanded and Nayla obeyed. But Nayla was a Fish Speaker, the Friend who was trusted by Leto to make a first examination of the new ghola. She admitted that she had been in the Royal Constabulary since childhood. Such strength in her! Given that strength, there was something awesome about the way she bowed to Siona\u0027s will. It was as though Nayla listened for secret voices which told her what to do. Then she obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho groped upward for another handhold. His fingers wriggled along the rock, up and outward to the right, finding at last an unseen crack where they might enter. His memory provided the natural line of ascent, but only his body could learn the way by following that line. His left foot found a toehold... up... up... slowly, testing. Left hand up now... no crack but a ledge. His eyes, then his chin lifted over the high ledge he had seen from below. He elbowed his way onto it, rolled over and rested, looking only outward, not up or down. It was a sand horizon out there, a breeze with dust in it limiting the view. He had seen many such horizons in the Dune days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, he turned to face the Wall, lifted himself onto his knees, hands groping upward, and he resumed the climb. The picture of the Wall remained in his mind as he had seen it from below. He had only to close his eyes and the pattern lay there, fixed the way he had learned to do it as a child hiding from Harkonnen slave raiders. Fingertips found a crack where they could be wedged. He clawed his way upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching from below, Nayla experienced a growing affinity for the climber. Idaho had been reduced by distance to such a small and lonely shape upon the Wall. He must know what it was like to be alone with momentous decisions. l would like to have his child, she thought. A child from both of us would be strong and resourceful. What is it that God wants from a child of Siona and this man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla had awakened before dawn and had walked out to the top of a low dune at the village edge to think about this thing that Idaho proposed. It had been a lime dawn with a familiar winding cloth of dust in the distance, then steel day and the baleful immensity of the Sareer. She knew then that these matters certainly had been anticipated by God. What could be hidden from God? Nothing could be hidden, not even the remote figure of Duncan Idaho groping for a pathway up to the edge of heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she watched Idaho climb, Nayla\u0027s mind played a trick on her, tipping the wall to the horizontal. Idaho became a child crawling across a broken surface. How small he looked... and growing smaller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn aide offered Nayla water which she drank. The water brought the Wall back into its true perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona crouched on the first ledge, leaning out to peer up- ward. \"If you fall, I will try it,\" Siona had promised Idaho. Nayla had thought it a strange promise. Why would both of them want to try the impossible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho had failed to dissuade Siona from the impossible promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is fate, Nayla thought. It is God\u0027s will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bit of rock fell from where Idaho clutched at it. That had happened several times. Nayla watched the falling rock. It took a long time coming down, bounding and rebounding from the Wall\u0027s face, demonstrating that the eye did not report truthfully when it said the Wall was sheer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe will succeed or he will not,- Nayla thought. Whatever happens, it is God\u0027s will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel her heart hammering, though. Idaho\u0027s venture was like sex, she thought. It was not passively erotic, but akin to rare magic in the way it seized her. She had to keep reminding herself that Idaho was not for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is for Siona. If he survives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if he failed, then Siona would try. Siona would succeed or she would not. Nayla wondered, though, if she might experience an orgasm should Idaho reach the top. He was so close to it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho took several deep breaths after dislodging the rock. It was a bad moment and he took the time to recover, clinging to a three-point hold on the Wall. Almost of its own accord, his free hand groped upward once more, wriggling past the rotten place into another slender crack. Slowly, he shifted his weight onto that hand. Slowly... slowly. His left knee felt the place where a toehold could be achieved. He lifted his foot to that place, tested it. Memory told him the top was near, but he pushed the memory aside. There was only the climb and the knowledge that Leto would arrive tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto and Hwi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not think about that, either. But it would not go away. The top... Hwi... Leto... tomorrow...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery thought fed his desperation, forced him into the immediate remembrance of the climbs of his childhood. The more he remembered consciously, the more his abilities were blocked. He was forced to pause, breathing deeply in the attempt to center himself, to go back to the natural ways of his past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut were those ways natural?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a blockage in his mind. He could sense intrusions, a finality... the fatality of what might have been and now would never be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto would arrive up there tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho felt perspiration run down his face around the place where he pressed a cheek against the rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto. will defeat you, Leto. I will defeat you for myself, not for Hwi, but only for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sensation of cleansing began to spread through him. It was like the thing which had happened in the night while he prepared himself mentally for this climb. Siona had sensed his sleeplessness. She had begun to talk to him, telling him the smallest details of her desperate run through the Forbidden Forest and her oath at the edge of the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I have given an oath to command his Fish Speakers,\" she said. \"I will honor that oath, but I hope it will not happen in the way he wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does he want?\" Idaho asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has many motives and I cannot see them all. Who could possibly understand him? I only know that I will never forgive him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis memory brought Idaho back to the sensation of the Wall\u0027s rock against his cheek. His perspiration had dried in the light breeze and he felt chilled. But he had found his center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever forgive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho felt the ghosts of all his other selves, the gholas who had died in Leto\u0027s service. Could he believe Siona\u0027s suspicions? Yes. Leto was capable of killing with his own body, his own hands. The rumor which Siona recounted had a feeling of truth in it. And Siona, too, was Atreides. Leto had become something else... no longer Atreides, not even human. He had become not so much a living creature as a brute fact of nature, opaque and impenetrable, all of his experiences sealed off within him. And Siona opposed him. The real Atreides turned away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brute fact of nature, nothing more. Just like this Wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho\u0027s right hand groped upward and found a sharp ledge. He could feel nothing above the ledge and tried to remember a wide crack at this place in the pattern. He could not dare to allow himself into the belief that he had reached the top... not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyet. The sharp edge cut into his fingers as he put his weight on it. He brought his left hand up to that level, found a purchase and pulled himself slowly upward. His eyes reached the level of his hands. He stared across a flat space which reached outward... outward into blue sky. The surface where his hands clutched showed ancient weather cracks. He crawled his fingers across that surface, one hand at a time, seeking out the cracks, dragging his chest up... his waist... his hips. He rolled then, twisting and crawling until the Wall was far behind him. Only then did he stand and tell himself what his senses reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top. And he had not required pitons or hammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint sound reached him. Cheering?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked back to the edge and looked down, waving to them. Yes, they were cheering. Turning back, he strode to the center of the roadway, letting elation still the trembling of his muscles, soothe the aching of his shoulders. Slowly, he turned full circle, examining the top while he let his memories at last estimate the height of that climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine hundred meters... at least that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Royal Roadway interested him. It was not like what he had seen on the way to Onn. It was wide, wide... at least five hundred meters. The roadbed was a smooth, unbroken gray with its edge some one hundred meters from each lip of the Wall. Rock pillars at man height marked the road\u0027s edge, stretching away like sentinels along the path Leto would use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho walked to the far side of the Wall opposite the Sareer and peered down. Far away in the depths, a hurtling green flow of river battered itself into foam against buttress rocks. He looked to the right. Leto would come from there. Road and Wall curved gently to the right, the curve beginning about three hundred meters from the place where Idaho stood. Idaho returned to the road and walked along its edge, following the curve until it made a returning \"S\" and narrowed, sloping gently downward. He stopped and looked at what was revealed for him, seeing the new pattern take shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout three kilometers away down the gentle slope, the roadway narrowed and crossed the river gorge on a bridge whose faery trusses appeared insubstantial and toy like at this distance. Idaho remembered a similar bridge on the road to Onn, the substantial feel of it beneath his feet. He trusted his memory, thinking about bridges as a military leader was forced to think about them-passages or traps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving out to his left, he looked down and outward to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanother high Wall at the far anchor of the faery bridge. The road continued there, turning gently until it was a line running straight northward. There were two Walls along there and the river between them. The river glided in a man-made chasm, its moisture confined and channeled into a northward wind drift while the water itself flowed southward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho ignored the river then. It was there and it would be there tomorrow. He fixed his attention on the bridge, letting his military training examine it. He nodded once to himself before turning back the way he had come, lifting the light rope from his shoulders as he walked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only when she saw the rope come snaking down that Nayla had her orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- \u003d What am I eliminating? The bourgeois infatuation with peaceful conservation of the past. This is a binding force, a thing which holds humankind into one vulnerable unit in spite of illusionary separations across parsecs of space. If I can find the scattered bits, others can find them. When you are together, you can share a common catastrophe. You can be exterminated together. Thus, I demonstrate the terrible danger of a gliding, passionless mediocrity, a movement without ambitions or aims. I show you that entire civilizations can do this thing. I give you eons of life which slips gently toward death without fuss or stirring, without even asking \u0027Why?\u0027 I show you the false happiness and the shadow-catastrophe called Leto, the God Emperor. Now, will you learn the real happiness?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Stolen Journals HAVING SPENT the night with only one brief catnap, Leto was awake when Moneo emerged from the guest house at dawn. The Royal Cart had been parked almost in the center of a three-sided courtyard. The cart\u0027s cover had been set on one-way opaque, concealing its occupant, and was tightly sealed against moisture. Leto could hear the faint stirring of the fans which pulsed his air through a drying cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo\u0027s feet scratched on the courtyard\u0027s cobbles as he approached the cart. Dawn light edged the guest house roof with orange above the majordomo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto opened the cart\u0027s cover as Moneo stopped in front of him. There was a yeasting dirt smell to the air and the accumulation of moisture in the breeze was painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should arrive at Tuono about noon,\" Moneo said. \"I wish you\u0027d let me bring in \u0027thopters to guard the sky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not want \u0027thopters,\" Leto said. \"We can go down to Tuono on suspensors and ropes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto marveled at the plastic images in this brief exchange. Moneo had never liked peregrinations. His youth as a rebel had left him with suspicions of everything he could not see or label. He remained a mass of latent judgments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I don\u0027t want \u0027thopters for transport,\" Moneo said. \"I want them to guard...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Moneo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo looked past Leto at the open end of the courtyard which overlooked the river canyon. Dawn light was frosting the mist which arose from the depths. He thought of how far down that canyon dropped... a body twisting, twisting as it fell. Moneo had found himself unable to go to the canyon\u0027s lip last night and peer down into it. The drop was such a... such a temptation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that insightful power which filled Moneo with such awe, Leto said: \"There\u0027s a lesson in every temptation, Moneo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeechless, Moneo turned to stare directly into Leto\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See the lesson in my life, Moneo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord?\" It was only a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They tempt me first with evil, then with good. Each temptation is fashioned with exquisite attention to my susceptibilities. Tell me, Moneo, if I choose the good, does that make me good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it does, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you will never lose the habit of judgment,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo looked away from him once more and stared at the chasm\u0027s edge. Leto rolled his body to look where Moneo looked. Dwarf pines had been cultured along the lip of the canyon. There were hanging dewdrops on the damp needles, each of them sending a promise of pain to Leto. He longed to close the cart\u0027s cover, but there was an immediacy in those jewels which attracted his memories even while they repelled his body. The opposed synchrony threatened to fill him with turmoil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t like going around on foot,\" Moneo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the Fremen war,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo sighed. \"The others will be ready in a few minutes. Hwi was breakfasting when I came out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto did not respond. His thoughts were lost in memories of night-the one just past and the millennial others which crowded his pasts-clouds and stars, the rains and the open blackness pocked with glittering flakes from a shredded cosmos, a universe of nights, extravagant with them as he had been with his heartbeats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo suddenly demanded: \"Where are your guards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sent them to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like them leaving you unguarded!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crystal sound of Moneo\u0027s voice rang in Leto\u0027s memories, speaking things not cast in words. Moneo feared a universe where there was no God Emperor. He would rather die than see such a universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will happen today?\" Moneo demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a question directed not to the God Emperor but to the prophet. ` A seed blown on the wind could be tomorrow\u0027s willow tree,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know our future! Why won\u0027t you share it?\" Moneo was close to hysteria... refusing anything his immediate senses did not report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto turned to glare at the majordomo, a gaze so obviously filled with pent-up emotions that Moneo recoiled from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take charge of your own existence, Moneo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo took a deep, trembling breath. \"Lord, I meant no offense. I sought only...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look upward, Moneo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvoluntarily, Moneo obeyed, peering into the cloudless sky where morning light was increasing. \"What is it, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no reassuring ceiling over you, Moneo. Only an open sky full of changes. Welcome it. Every sense you possess is an instrument for reacting to change. Does that tell you nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, I only came out to enquire when you would be ready to proceed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moneo, I beg you to be truthful with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am truthful, Lord!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you live in bad faith, lies will appear to you like the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, if I lie... then I do not know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That has the ring of truth. But I know what you dread and will not speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo began to tremble. The God Emperor was in the most terrible of moods, a deep threat in every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dread the imperialism of consciousness,\" Leto said, \"and you are right to fear it. Send Hwi out here immediately!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo whirled and fled back into the guest house. It was as though his entrance stirred up an insect colony. Within seconds, Fish Speakers emerged and spread around the Royal Cart. Courtiers peered from the guest house windows or came out and stood under deep eaves, afraid to approach him. In contrast to this excitement, Hwi emerged presently from the wide central doorway and strode out of the shadows, moving slowly toward Leto, her chin up, her gaze seeking his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto felt himself becoming calm as he looked at her. She wore a golden gown he had not seen before. It had been piped with silver and jade at the neck and the cuffs of its long sleeves. The hem, almost dragging on the ground, had heavy green braid to outline deep red crenellations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHwi smiled as she stopped in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, love.\" She spoke softly. \"What have you done to get poor Moneo so upset?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoothed by her presence and her voice, he smiled. \"I did what I always hope to do. I produced an effect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You certainly did. He told the Fish Speakers you were in an angry and terrifying mood. Are you terrifying, Love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only to those who refuse to live by their own strengths.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhh, yes.\" She pirouetted for him then, displaying her new gown. \"Do you like it? Your Fish Speakers gave it to me. They decorated it themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My love,\" he said, a warning note in his voice, \"decoration! That is how you prepare the sacrifice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came up to the edge of the cart and leaned on it just below his face, a mock solemn expression on her lips. \"Will they sacrifice me, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of them would like to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you will not permit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our fates are joined,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I shall not fear.\" She reached up and touched one of his silver-skinned hands, but jerked away as his fingers began to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me, Love. I forget that we are joined in soul and not in flesh,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sandtrout skin still shuddered from Hwi\u0027s touch. \"Moisture in the air makes me overly sensitive,\" he said. Slowly, the shuddering subsided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I refuse to regret what cannot be,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be strong, Hwi, for your soul is mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned at a sound from the guest house. \"Moneo returns,\" she said. \"Please, Love, do not frighten him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Moneo your friend, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are friends of the stomach. We both like yogurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto was still chuckling when Moneo stopped beside Hwi. Moneo ventured a smile, casting a puzzled glance at Hwi. There was gratitude in the majordomo\u0027s manner and some of the subservience he was accustomed to show to Leto he now directed at Hwi. \"Is it well with you, Lady Hwi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is well with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto said: \"In the time of the stomach, friendships of the stomach are to be nurtured and cultivated. Let us be on our way, Moneo. Tuono awaits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo turned and shouted orders to the Fish Speakers and courtiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto grinned at Hwi. \"Do I not play the impatient bridegroom with a certain style?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaped lightly up to the bed of his cart, her skirt gathered in one hand. He unfolded her seat. Only when she was seated, her eyes level with Leto\u0027s, did she respond, and then it was in a voice pitched for his ears alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love of my soul, I have captured another of your secrets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Release it from your lips,\" he said, joking in this new intimacy between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seldom need words,\" she said. \"You speak directly to the senses with your own life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shudder flexed its way through the length of his body. It was a moment before he could speak and then it was in a voice she had to strain to hear above the hubbub of the assembling cortege.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Between the superhuman and the inhuman,\" he said, \"I have had little space in which to be human. I thank you, gentle and lovely Hwi, for this little space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- \u003d In all of my universe I have seen no law of nature, unchanging and inexorable. This universe presents only changing relationships which are sometimes seen as laws by short-lived awareness. These fleshly sensoria which we call self are ephemera withering in the blaze of infinity, fleetingly aware of temporary conditions which confine our activities and change as our activities change. If you must label the absolute, use it\u0027s proper name: Temporary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Stolen Journals NAYLA WAS the first to glimpse the approaching cortege. Perspiring heavily in the midday heat, she stood near one of the rock pillars which marked the edges of the Royal Road. A sudden flash of distant reflection caught her attention. She peered in that direction, squinting, realizing with a thrill of awareness that she saw sun-dazzle on the cover of the God Emperor\u0027s cart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They come!\" she called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt hunger then. In their excitement and singleness of purpose, none of them had brought food. Only the Fremen had brought water and that because \"Fremen always carry water when they leave sietch.\" They did it by rote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNayla touched one finger to the butt of the lasgun holstered at her hip. The bridge lay no more than twenty meters ahead of her, its faery structure arching across the chasm like an alien fantasy joining one barren surface to another. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-32.html","bookId":2156,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM"}
