My eyes aren’t adjusted to the dark, so I stare into pure black, like the backs of my eyelids. I hear shuffling and the squeak of a shoe. A heavy thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then a wail that curdles my blood and makes my hair stand on end. I throw the blankets back and stand on the stone floor with bare feet. I still can’t see well enough to find the source of the scream, but I see a dark lump on the floor a few bunks down. Another scream pierces my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turn on the lights!” someone shouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk toward the sound, slowly so I don’t trip over anything. I feel like I’m in a trance. I don’t want to see where the screaming is coming from. A scream like that can only mean blood and bone and pain; that scream that comes from the pit of the stomach and extends to every inch of the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights come on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward lies on the floor next to his bed, clutching at his face. Surrounding his head is a halo of blood, and jutting between his clawing fingers is a silver knife handle. My heart thumping in my ears, I recognize it as a butter knife from the dining hall. The blade is stuck in Edward’s eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMyra, who stands at Edward’s feet, screams. Someone else screams too, and someone yells for help, and Edward is still on the floor, writhing and wailing. I crouch by his head, my knees pressing to the pool of blood, and put my hands on his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lie still,” I say. I feel calm, though I can’t hear anything, like my head is submerged in water. Edward thrashes again and I say it louder, sterner. “I said, lie still. Breathe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My eye!” he screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smell something foul. Someone vomited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take it out!” he yells. “Get it out, get it out of me, get it out!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and then realize that he can’t see me. A laugh bubbles in my stomach. Hysterical. I have to suppress hysteria if I’m going to help him. I have to forget myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say. “You have to let the doctor take it out. Hear me? Let the doctor take it out. And breathe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It hurts,” he sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know it does.” Instead of my voice I hear my mother’s voice. I see her crouching before me on the sidewalk in front of our house, brushing tears from my face after I scraped my knee. I was five at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will be all right.” I try to sound firm, like I’m not idly reassuring him, but I am. I don’t know if it will be all right. I suspect that it won’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the nurse arrives, she tells me to step back, and I do. My hands and knees are soaked with blood. When I look around, I see that only two faces are missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they take Edward away, I carry a change of clothes into the bathroom and wash my hands. Christina comes with me and stands by the door, but she doesn’t say anything, and I’m glad. There isn’t much to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrub at the lines in my palms and run one fingernail under my other fingernails to get the blood out. I change into the pants I brought and throw the soiled ones in the trash. I get as many paper towels as I can hold. Someone needs to clean up the mess in the dormitory, and since I doubt I’ll ever be able to sleep again, it might as well be me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I reach for the door handle, Christina says, “You know who did that, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should we tell someone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really think the Dauntless will do anything?” I say. “After they hung you over the chasm? After they made us beat each other unconscious?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a half hour after that, I kneel alone on the floor in the dormitory and scrub at Edward’s blood. Christina throws away the dirty paper towels and gets me new ones. Myra is gone; she probably followed Edward to the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one sleeps much that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is going to sound weird,” Will says, “but I wish we didn’t have a day off today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. I know what he means. Having something to do would distract me, and I could use a distraction right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have not spent much time alone with Will, but Christina and Al are taking naps in the dormitory, and neither of us wanted to be in that room longer than we had to. Will didn’t tell me that; I just know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slide one fingernail under another. I washed my hands thoroughly after cleaning up Edward’s blood, but I still feel like it’s on my hands. Will and I walk with no sense of purpose. There is nowhere to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could visit him,” suggests Will. “But what would we say? ‘I didn’t know you that well, but I’m sorry you got stabbed in the eye’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt isn’t funny. I know that as soon as he says it, but a laugh rises in my throat anyway, and I let it out because it’s harder to keep it in. Will stares at me for a second, and then he laughs too. Sometimes crying or laughing are the only options left, and laughing feels better right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” I say. “It’s just so ridiculous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to cry for Edward—at least not in the deep, personal way that you cry for a friend or loved one. I want to cry because something terrible happened, and I saw it, and I could not see a way to mend it. No one who would want to punish Peter has the authority to, and no one who has the authority to punish him would want to. The Dauntless have rules against attacking someone like that, but with people like Eric in charge, I suspect those rules go unenforced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say, more seriously, “The most ridiculous part is, in any other faction it would be brave of us to tell someone what happened. But here…in Dauntless…bravery won’t do us any good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you ever read the faction manifestos?” says Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faction manifestos were written after the factions formed. We learned about them in school, but I never read them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have?” I frown at him. Then I remember that Will once memorized a map of the city for fun, and I say, “Oh. Of course you have. Never mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of the lines I remember from the Dauntless manifesto is, ‘We believe in ordinary acts of bravery, in the courage that drives one person to stand up for another.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t need to say anything else. I know what he means. Maybe Dauntless was formed with good intentions, with the right ideals and the right goals. But it has strayed far from them. And the same is true of Erudite, I realize. A long time ago, Erudite pursued knowledge and ingenuity for the sake of doing good. Now they pursue knowledge and ingenuity with greedy hearts. I wonder if the other factions suffer from the same problem. I have not thought about it before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the depravity I see in Dauntless, though, I could not leave it. It isn’t only because the thought of living factionless, in complete isolation, sounds like a fate worse than death. It is because, in the brief moments that I have loved it here, I saw a faction worth saving. Maybe we can become brave and honorable again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go to the cafeteria,” Will says, “and eat cake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walk toward the Pit, I repeat the line Will quoted to myself so I don’t forget it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe in ordinary acts of bravery, in the courage that drives one person to stand up for another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a beautiful thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when I return to the dormitory, Edward’s bunk is stripped clean and his drawers are open, empty. Across the room, Myra’s bunk looks the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I ask Christina where they went, she says, “They quit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even Myra?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She said she didn’t want to be here without him. She was going to get cut anyway.” She shrugs, like she can’t think of anything else to do. If that’s true, I know how she feels. “At least they didn’t cut Al.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl was supposed to get cut, but Edward’s departure saved him. The Dauntless decided to spare him until the next stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who else got cut?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina shrugs again. “Two of the Dauntless-born. I don’t remember their names.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and look at the blackboard. Someone drew a line through Edward and Myra’s names, and changed the numbers next to everyone else’s names. Now Peter is first. Will is second. I am fifth. We started stage one with nine initiates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we have seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT’S NOON. LUNCHTIME.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit in a hallway I don’t recognize. I walked here because I needed to get away from the dormitory. Maybe if I bring my bedding here, I will never have to go to the dormitory again. It may be my imagination, but it still smells like blood in there, even though I scrubbed the floor until my hands were sore, and someone poured bleach on it this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pinch the bridge of my nose. Scrubbing the floor when no one else wanted to was something that my mother would have done. If I can’t be with her, the least I can do is act like her sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear people approaching, their footsteps echoing on the stone floor, and I look down at my shoes. I switched from gray sneakers to black sneakers a week ago, but the gray shoes are buried in one of my drawers. I can’t bear to throw them away, even though I know it’s foolish to be attached to sneakers, like they can bring me home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tris?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up. Uriah stops in front of me. He waves along the Dauntless-born initiates he walks with. They exchange looks but keep moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay?” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had a difficult night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I heard about that guy Edward.” Uriah looks down the hallway. The Dauntless-born initiates disappear around a corner. Then he grins a little. “Want to get out of here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I ask. “Where are you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To a little initiation ritual,” he says. “Come on. We have to hurry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI briefly consider my options. I can sit here. Or I can leave the Dauntless compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push myself to my feet and jog next to Uriah to catch up to the Dauntless-born initiates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The only initiates they usually let come are ones with older siblings in Dauntless,” he says. “But they might not even notice. Just act like you belong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What exactly are we doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something dangerous,” he says. A look I can only describe as Dauntless mania enters his eyes, but rather than recoil from it, as I might have a few weeks ago, I catch it, like it’s contagious. Excitement replaces the leaden feeling inside me. We slow when we reach the Dauntless-born initiates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the Stiff doing here?” asks a boy with a metal ring between his nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She just saw that guy get stabbed in the eye, Gabe,” says Uriah. “Give her a break, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe shrugs and turns away. No one else says anything, though a few of them give me sidelong glances like they’re sizing me up. The Dauntless-born initiates are like a pack of dogs. If I act the wrong way, they won’t let me run with them. But for now, I am safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turn another corner, and a group of members stands at the end of the next hallway. There are too many of them to all be related to a Dauntless-born initiate, but I see some similarities among the faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go,” one of the members says. He turns and plunges through a dark doorway. The other members follow him, and we follow them. I stay close behind Uriah as I pass into darkness and my toe hits a step. I catch myself before falling forward and start to climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back staircase,” Uriah says, almost mumbling. “Usually locked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, though he can’t see me, and climb until all the steps are gone. By then, a door at the top of the staircase is open, letting in daylight. We emerge from the ground a few hundred yards from the glass building above the Pit, close to the train tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I have done this a thousand times before. I hear the train horn. I feel the vibrations in the ground. I see the light attached to the head car. I crack my knuckles and bounce once on my toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe jog in a single pack next to the car, and in waves, members and initiates alike pile into the car. Uriah gets in before me, and people press behind me. I can’t make any mistakes; I throw myself sideways, grabbing the handle on the side of the car, and hoist myself into the car. Uriah grabs my arm to steady me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train picks up its speed. Uriah and I sit against one of the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shout over the wind, “Where are we going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUriah shrugs. “Zeke never told me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zeke?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My older brother,” he says. He points across the room at a boy sitting in the doorway with his legs dangling out of the car. He is slight and short and looks nothing like Uriah, apart from his coloring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t get to know. That ruins the surprise!” the girl on my left shouts. She extends her hand. “I’m Shauna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake her hand, but I don’t grip hard enough and I let go too quickly. I doubt I will ever improve my handshake. It feels unnatural to grasp hands with strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m—” I start to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know who you are,” she says. “You’re the Stiff. Four told me about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pray the heat in my cheeks is not visible. “Oh? What did he say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smirks at me. “He said you were a Stiff. Why do you ask?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If my instructor is talking about me,” I say, as firmly as I can, “I want to know what he’s saying.” I hope I tell a convincing lie. “He isn’t coming, is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. He never comes to this,” she says. “It’s probably lost its appeal. Not much scares him, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe isn’t coming. Something in me deflates like an untied balloon. I ignore it and nod. I do know that Four is not a coward. But I also know that at least one thing does scare him: heights. Whatever we’re doing, it must involve being high up for him to avoid it. She must not know that if she speaks of him with such reverence in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know him well?” I ask. I am too curious; I always have been. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/divergent-divergent-1/page-18.html","bookId":1698,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:44 AM"}
