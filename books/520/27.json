Wouldn\u0027t it be funny\n\u003cbr\u003e to be drowned in lemon jelly?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Two other problems are engaging the attention of our table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 1st. What shape are the rooms in an octagon house? \n\u003cbr\u003e Some of the girls insist that they\u0027re square;\n\u003cbr\u003e but I think they\u0027d have to be shaped like a piece of pie. Don\u0027t you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 2nd. Suppose there were a great big hollow sphere made of\n\u003cbr\u003e looking-glass and you were sitting inside. Where would it stop\n\u003cbr\u003e reflecting your face and begin reflecting your back? The more\n\u003cbr\u003e one thinks about this problem, the more puzzling it becomes. \n\u003cbr\u003e You can see with what deep philosophical reflection we engage our leisure!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Did I ever tell you about the election? It happened three weeks ago,\n\u003cbr\u003e but so fast do we live, that three weeks is ancient history. \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie was elected, and we had a torchlight parade with\n\u003cbr\u003e transparencies saying, `McBride for Ever,\u0027 and a band consisting\n\u003cbr\u003e of fourteen pieces (three mouth organs and eleven combs).\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027re very important persons now in `258.\u0027 Julia and I come in\n\u003cbr\u003e for a great deal of reflected glory. It\u0027s quite a social strain\n\u003cbr\u003e to be living in the same house with a president.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bonne nuit, cher Daddy.\n\u003cbr\u003e Acceptez mez compliments,\n\u003cbr\u003e Tres respectueux,\n\u003cbr\u003e je suis,\n\u003cbr\u003e Votre Judy\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59749.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
