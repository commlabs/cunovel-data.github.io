She is the first,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad ran his hands over my hair and smoothed it back, his cold eyes studying my face with piercing intensity. “Someday, when you learn to love me as your sisters do, I will share with you my many secrets.” He kissed me and I allowed him to. It was merely a press of lip to lip. “Already, I am terribly fond of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed up at him solemnly. “You frighten me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I know.” He kissed me again, then whispered against my lips. “You shall do as I say or I will kill your brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I know,” I echoed his words and tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I began to cry tears of joy and fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Lady Glynis Wright\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5th of March, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we are off!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight we departed for Buda and my excitement can barely be contained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me digress and explain how the evening began…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage rocked gently as it rolled slowly out of the courtyard of the castle. I leaned forward and glanced out the window back toward the three ghostly women clustered together in the great doorway. Cneajna raised her hand over head, and I waved back with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold, dreary rain fell through the gloom. An icy mist wafted over the wet flagstones of the courtyard. Thick, black clouds shrouded the moon and lightning cracked the sky as the distant booming of thunder resounded. It was a horrible night to begin our journey to Buda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Close the window and sit back,” Vlad ordered shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI obeyed, sitting back sullenly. I pouted slightly. I am quite sure my eyes were vivid with my anger. It was impossible not to recollect the last time I departed Prince Vlad Dracula\u0027s castle to journey to Buda and not feel bitterness. My family\u0027s failed attempt to escape haunted me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDressed in one of the beautiful dresses my mother had purchased for me in Paris, I looked like a fine, young aristocrat. With Cneajna\u0027s assistance, I had cut my hair so I could style it into a more modern, fashionable style that suited the Lady Glynis of the past, but not necessarily the vampire I am now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs usual, Vlad was dressed all in black, his fine new suit impressive on his frame. Despite his penchant to wear very out of fashion clothes in the castle, I noted he always wore the best in modern clothing when departing the castle. He had even allowed me to cut his hair to a more reasonable length and trim his mustache. He had seem bemused by the whole process. Though his thick auburn hair remained long, it was much tidier, and I was satisfied that he had bowed to my wishes. He now looked more like a businessman than a cold-blooded warrior of old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching into his pocket, he pulled out a gold pocket watch and flipped it open. With a sigh, he clicked it shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is wrong?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The storm will slow us down. I want to be through Bârgãu Pass and onto Bistriţa as soon as possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And why is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad regarded me coolly then frowned. “I have many enemies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that why we did not fly to Buda?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fly?” Vlad began to laugh with delight. “Fly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yes. I can fly. Can you not as well?” I was rather insulted by his laughter and my voice was quite condescending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, of course I can fly. But to fly takes much blood-power and there is the possibility of violating another vampire\u0027s territory. They do not like grandiose shows of power. We must travel as mortals to ensure our safety.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Other vampires?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, of course. You did not think we were the only ones, did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, not truly,” I confessed. “But are you not the Prince of this country?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad sighed a bit. “I was a mortal prince of this country. But as a vampire, I am restricted by the curse of the day. I did not realize this as a mortal man when I made the choice to become what I am now. I struggled for years to regain my princedom, but I could never wield the influence necessary to secure my throne again. But, yes, Glynis, I control all that surrounds our castle. If any vampire enters our domain, they either respect me as a Master or I slay them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So are there many of us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In this country, yes. In other countries, that are not so rich with legend and magic, we are but a few. You might as well know that some vampires are quite mad and dangerous and we must destroy them on sight least they expose us. If too many humans die from the vampire bite, it brings the vampire hunters. You must be alert at all times. If you encounter another vampire, merely tell them you are my progeny and they will let you be. I am still a feared man in this country, just not among mortals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered this then asked, “So is there some sort of code among vampires?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad laughed at this. “You amuse me so, Glynis.” He shook his head. “No, no. Some of the older vampires of have tried --actually they are still attempting -- to impose some sort of vampire law upon us, but they have continuously failed. Vampires as old as I and older are too set in their own ways to bow to any modern concepts of civility. Besides, most vampires carve out small territories for themselves. Nothing official, mind you, but it is theirs because they make it so. There are some vampire families, such as ours, that keep certain precepts and that is their choice. But no, Glynis, there is no vampire code.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pondered this for some time, then turned to him. “Our land is ours. But what of Buda?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad\u0027s expression darkened slightly. “There is another. He rules there. Again, if anyone disturbs you, merely inform them that you are my progeny. He allows me freedom in the city.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Allows you?” I arched an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad frowned as his gaze slowly slid toward me. “I still rule over those below me, dear wife, even if I sometimes bow to a another. I learned the rules of politics long ago in the court of King Matayas. You are merely a bride, my wife, hardly more than a servant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI openly glared at him for that. My belligerence burned in my gaze as I lifted my chin. “You are wrong. I am so much more than a mere servant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him my most arrogant of smiles. “Oh, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad began to chortle with delight. “Really, Glynis, you amuse me so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You doubt me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad\u0027s eyes narrowed as he studied me. I tried to look as innocent and wide-eyed as possible. By the smirk on his face, I could see he saw clearly past this façade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are a clever woman, I shall give you that much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One night, you shall know just how clever I truly am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad reached out and gripped my face tightly in one hand. I could feel his fingers digging into my skin, his long nails drawing blood. “Do not threaten me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered my eyes. “I am not threatening you. I am merely promising you that one night you shall see me rise to my full potential.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You speak in riddles.” Vlad dismissed me with the flick of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned away from him, my face flushed, and stared into the forest flowing past the window. Vlad may dismiss me now, but one night, he will be at my mercy. He will witness my full power and brutality as I have my vengeance. It will happen. Vlad will know what it feels like to stare into my face and know fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storm broke over us with vicious violence. The carriage groaned in protest, and I was forced to grab hold of the safety straps. The lightning cackling across the sky clearly illuminated the treacherous pass we were traveling over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad glanced dispassionately out of the window at the massive thunderheads rolling over the valley. “It is a lovely night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped at him then gasped as the carriage swerved sharply around a turn in the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will make good time no matter what force of nature attempts to delay us,” Vlad declared confidently. “We shall arrive in Bistriţa on time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at him rather sullenly, none too pleased with the weather conditions. The carriage lurched and swayed, but resolutely slogged along the rain soaked pass. I clung tightly to the safety straps and whispered a prayer I was uncertain would reach the ears of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage sped into the stormy night and down the mountain into the valley below. As we passed through the tiny village of Rosu-the same village my family had tried in vain to find safety in that fateful day nearly a year before-I peered out the window. I felt tears, warm and passionate threatening to spill down my cheeks. We had been so close, so very, very close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quaint buildings emerged from the gloom into the light of the carriage lanterns for a brief moment before being swallowed up into the night. Not a soul was to be seen. Only the village inn was illuminated from within. As the carriage roared past, I pressed my nose against the glass of the carriage window in an attempt to see inside. The inn shutters were drawn beneath wreaths of garlic and only slivers of firelight escaped through the cracks of wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage rolled on and was devoured by the darkness of the night. I sat back in my seat, a single tear traveling down my flushed cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad cast a searing glance in my direction, and I lowered my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should not mourn after all this time. You are more than you were. You are beyond anything your parents could have ever imagined for you,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he possibly expect me to be grateful for my fate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cannot help but mourn my family. They were my life,” I retorted. “Do you not mourn your mortal family?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They served their purpose,” Vlad responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to protest, but realized quickly the futility of it. He cannot possibly understand my emotions. I do not believe he has ever experienced them. His passions burn fierce, but are tinged with violence and anger. My own passions are stirred by love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur journey, though long in hours, seemed quickly finished. I found myself deep in thought, dwelling in the comfort of memories. How easily I lost myself in the beauty of the past. I daydreamed of tea parties, balls, and shopping expeditions. I relished the memories of time spent with my siblings and my parents. I fondly dwelt on my friends and the beauty of England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I know not what Vlad thought of during our journey. He was still, silent, and reflective. His gaze was steadfast upon the terrain we traveled over. I wondered if he was remembering his other life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrived in Bistriţa in the early hours of the morning. The sun was still below the horizon and the air was crisp. The town was shrouded in a heavy mist and it was difficult to make out the ancient buildings that so carried the flavor of the Carpathians. Our driver drew the carriage up to Golden Krone Hotel. Immediately, the door flew open and a man hurried down to open the carriage door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Count and Countess Dracula, welcome, welcome!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe proprietor was a man in his early thirties and he seemed flushed with both fear and excitement. Behind him, porters dressed in traditional garb rushed out to help unload our luggage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad exited first and turned to offer his hand. His gaze was startling and passionate when I looked upon his face. I realized, in that moment, he was desperate for me to play the role... no, to be his wife to the world beyond the castle. I obliged him, took his hand, and slid effortlessly from the carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Countess Dracula, how lovely to see you. Your husband wrote that you were accompanying him, and we have prepared the best room in the hotel for your stay!” He kissed my hand a few too many times, then motioned us into the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many hours until sunrise?” Vlad asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two, sir,” was the reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well. Please see my lovely wife to her rooms. I have pressing business to attend to.” Vlad turned to me and drew me close to kiss my cheek. He whispered, “Stay in the hotel. Do not leave. I will soon return.” He kissed me gently on the cheek and released my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him curiously, then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The best room! You have the best room,” my host assured me. He was so nervous I could smell it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-38.html","bookId":2614,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:06 PM"}
