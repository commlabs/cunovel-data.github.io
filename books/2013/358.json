Fiddler and Gesler who had been slapping each other on the back pulled apart and then walked over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hood’s pecker, Hellian,’ Fiddler said under his breath, ‘what happened to all the townfolk? As if I can’t guess,’ he added, glancing over at the heaped heads. ‘They’ve all run away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrb had joined them and he said, ‘They were all those Indebted we heard about. Fifth, sixth generations. Working on blanks.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Blanks?’ Gesler asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For weapons,’ Fiddler explained. ‘So, they were slaves, Urb?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In everything but name,’ the big man replied, scratching at his beard from which dangled one severed finger, grey and black. ‘Under all those Edur heads is the local Factor’s head, some rich bastard in silks. We killed him in front of the Indebted and listened to them cheer. And then they cut off the poor fool’s head as a gift, since we come in with all these Edur ones. And then they looted what they could and headed out.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler’s brows had risen at all that. ‘So you’ve managed what the rest of us haven’t-arriving as damned liberators in this town.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHellian snorted. ‘We worked that out weeks back. Never mind the Lurrii soljers, since they’re all perfessionals and so’s they like things jus’ fine so’s they’s the one y’gotta kill no diff ‘rent from the Edur. No, y’go into the hamlets and villages and kill all the ‘ficials-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The what?’ Gesler asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrb said, ‘Officials. We kill the officials, Gesler. And anybody with money, and the advocates, too.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Legal types. Oh, and the money-lenders and debt-holders, and the record-keepers and toll-counters. We kill them all-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Along with the soljers,’ Hellian added, nodding-and nodding, for some reason finding herself unable to stop. She kept nodding as she said, ‘An’ what happens then is simple. Looting, lotsa sex, then everybody skittles out, and we sleep in soft beds and drink an’ eat in the tavern an’ if the keepers hang round we pays for it all nice an’ honest-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Keepers like the ones hiding in the kitchen?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHellian blinked. ‘Hiding? Oh, maybe we’ve gotten a little wild-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s the heads,’ Urb said, then he shrugged sheepishly. ‘We’re getting outa hand, Gesler, I think. Living like animals in the woods and the like-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Like animals,’ Hellian agreed, still nodding. ‘In soft beds and lotsa food and drink an’ it’s not like we carry them heads on our belts or anything. We just leave ‘em in the taverns. Every village, right? Jus’ to let ‘em know we been through.’ Unaccountably dizzy, Hellian sat back down, then reached for the flagon of ale on the table-needing to twist Balgrid’s fingers from the handle and him fighting as if it was his flagon or something, the idiot. She swallowed a mouthful and leaned back-only it was a stool she was sitting on so there was no back to it, and now she was staring up at the ceiling and puddled whatever was soaking through her ragged shirt all along her back and faces were peering down at her. She glowered at the flagon still in her hand. ‘Did I spill? Did I? Did I spill, dammit?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not a drop,’ Fiddler said, shaking his head in wonder. This damned Sergeant Hellian, who by Urb’s account had crossed all the way from the coast in an inebriated haze-this soft-featured woman, soft just on the edge of dissolute, with the bright always wet lips-this Hellian had managed to succeed where every other squad-as far as Fiddler knew-had failed miserably. And since Urb was adamant on who was leading whom, it really had been her. This drunken, ferocious marine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving severed heads in every tavern, for Hood’s sake!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she had cut loose the common people, all these serfs and slaves and Indebted, and had watched them dance off in joy and freedom. Our drunk liberator, our bloodthirsty goddess-what in Hood’s name do all those people think when they first see her? Endless rumours of a terrible invading army. Soldiers and Edur dying in ambushes, chaos on the roads and trails. Then she shows up, dragging heads in sacks, and her marines break down every door in town and drag out all the ones nobody else has any reason to like. And then? Why, the not-so-subtle cutting away of all burdens for all these poor folk. ‘Give us the bar for a couple nights and then we’ll just be on our way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, and if you run into any Edur in the woods, send somebody back to warn us, right?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it any wonder that Hellian and Urb and their squads had marched so far ahead of the others-or so Captain Sort had complained-with hardly any losses among her marines? The drunk, bright-eyed woman with all the rounded excesses of a well-fed, never sober but still young harlot had somehow managed to co-opt all the local help they’d needed to stay alive. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-358.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
