I had stayed here often when I visited L.A., after I made the move to Camden and then to New York, and over the years part of this large space overlooking the San Fernando Valley had slowly transformed itself into an office, where I stored old manuscripts and files on shelves built into a walk-in closet. This was where I was heading. I immediately started rummaging carelessly through stacks of papers—drafts of novels, magazine essays, children’s books—until the floor became littered with them. And then I finally located what I was looking for: the original manuscript copy of American Psycho, which had been typed on an electric Olivetti (four drafts in all, which continued to fill me with disbelief). I sat on the futon beneath the framed Elvis Costello poster that still hung on the wall and began flipping through its pages. Without even knowing what I was looking for, I felt a vague desire to touch the book and rid myself of something that Donald Kimball had said. There was a piece of information that had never fit into the pattern revealing itself to us. I wanted to make sure it did not exist. But as I kept turning pages I began knowing what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made itself apparent the moment I hit page 207 in the original manuscript.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn page 207 was the drawing of a face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had drawn a face onto the thin sheet of typing paper (leaving enough space between the chapter breaks to fit it in).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd beneath the face I drew the words, scrawled in red pen: “I’m B a c k.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis image of words scrawled in blood was used later on, but I had cut the scene that preceded this warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis chapter had been omitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I had also removed the crude drawing of the face from any subsequent manuscripts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething became confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a copy of the manuscript I had shown no one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the copy that had been rewritten before I handed the book to my agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the copy that no editor or publisher had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the one chapter I had cut from the very first draft and that no one but me had ever read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt included details of the murder of a woman called Amelia Light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flashed on the phone call I received on November 5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you do to her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d check the text of that dirty little book you wrote again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fictional details—the missing arms and head, the ropes, the blowtorch—were identical to the details of the murder in the Orsic Motel in a place called Stoneboat, according to what Donald Kimball had imparted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I kept turning pages, I realized even before I arrived at the next chapter that it would be titled “Paul Owen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe murder that followed Amelia Light’s would be Paul Owen’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonald Kimball was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was tracking the book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a man named Paul Owen in Clear Lake would be the next victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached for a phone to call Donald Kimball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something stopped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reminded myself again, this time with more force, that no one except me had ever seen this copy of the manuscript.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis led to: What was I going to say to Kimball?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was there to say? That I was going insane? That my book was now reality?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no reaction—emotional, physical—to any of this.

Because of the heat I’ve had intense dreams the last four nights about vivisection and I’m doing nothing now, vegetating in my office with a sickening headache and a Walkman with a soothing Kenny G CD playing in it, but the bright midmorning sunlight floods the room, piercing my skull, causing my hangover to throb, and because of this, there’s no workout this morning. Listening to the music I notice the second light on my phone blinking off and on, which means that Jean is buzzing me.
