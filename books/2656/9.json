{"id":63977,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac tucked the reins under his thigh and laced his fingers, stretching his arms before him. He flexed his wrists to the point of discomfort, but still, mastering his body was taking a conscious effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So strong you are,” Marjorie cooed, her voice sounding low and sultry next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mumbled a curse. She\u0027d been purring, whispering, and just about moaning at that damned mare all morning, and it was driving him to distraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, so strong.” She ran her hands along her horse\u0027s neck in long, languid strokes. “You were lonely in that stall. But you like when I ride you, don\u0027t you? Yes you do. You like having me on your back.” Cormac flexed until his knuckles popped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked out of the corners of his eyes, watching the sway of her hips in the saddle. The sound of her bedroom voice was a reverberating hum through his body. What would she look like riding him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind returned to the image branded there: Marjorie, standing in the shallows. Her wet bodice had clung to her, revealing every curve, every dip and swell of her soft flesh. And then she\u0027d looked at him, and there\u0027d been a darkness in her eyes, a wanting that he recognized as his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027d taken all the concentration he had not to go hard at the sight of her. If there was anything that could make his cold cock rouse, it had been the feel of Ree\u0027s eyes on him, roving his naked body as though she\u0027d a right to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer horse began to flag, and Marjorie made soft kissing noises to liven up the animal\u0027s gait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God help me,” he breathed. He adjusted himself on the saddle, forcing himself to focus on the path ahead, on the sway of the horse beneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should\u0027ve been a decent ride. Gregor had shocked Cormac when he loaned his braw chestnut gelding, but not even the superior horseflesh at Cormac\u0027s seat could distract him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie. Marjorie was the distraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ohhh, that\u0027s the way,” she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac\u0027s groin tightened anew. He scowled. Agony. What could\u0027ve been a pleasant enough ride had become his own personal hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his body stiffly, putting his mind to other things. Fishing. Hunting. The fine horse he rode. He patted the animal\u0027s neck, willing thoughts like the mending of boats and the gelding of horses to wipe the wayward images from his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s his name?” Marjorie asked, trotting to catch up to his side. The sea breeze had pinkened her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d always loved riding, and she bore the hint of a smile on her face. Her breathing was up, and her bodice strained with it. The sight silenced him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cormac?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie was waiting for his response, and the only words that surged to mind were how lovely she looked with the wind in her hair. He shook himself. It was too dangerous to entertain such notions. “Name?” he said, coming back to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, Gregor\u0027s horse. What\u0027s his name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down, contemplating the animal\u0027s coat, dark russet with sweat. He shrugged. “I don\u0027t ken its name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn\u0027t ask the horse\u0027s name?” She nudged her mount closer to his. Her skirts rustled against Cormac\u0027s calf, and he stifled a shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFishing. Hunting. Boat mending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s a braw one,” Marjorie said, leaning toward the animal. Her bodice tugged lower, revealing the gentle swells of her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoat mending. Hoof trimming. Stall mucking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe murmured to the beast in a low, sultry voice, “Aren\u0027t you just a big, braw boy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” Cormac asked abruptly, his voice barking out like a muted shout. “Why would I need its name? It\u0027s not as though he\u0027ll come if I call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you\u0027ll be riding him all day. Don\u0027t you want to know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac was completely off his guard, and so his response was something his younger self might have said. “He and I, we weren\u0027t formally introduced, Ree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly silent, Marjorie let her horse fall behind. Cormac grew curious after a moment, and twisted in the saddle to study her. A puzzled look wrinkled her brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” he asked, concerned. “Are you not comfortable?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer puzzled look intensified. “No… I… why do you ask?” Her features hardened. “I\u0027m perfectly comfortable. Don\u0027t forget, Cormac. I have made this journey before, and I am perfectly capable of making it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Och, that\u0027s not what I was saying at all.” What had he unwittingly stepped into? “That\u0027ll teach a man,” he added under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she just looked hurt. He rued his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s not what I\u0027d meant,” he said, trying again. “You simply… you\u0027ve got a look about you. I thought you might be uncomfortable, is all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” She thought on it for a moment, then gave a brisk shake to her head. “I\u0027m perfectly comfortable. It\u0027s simply… you foxed me some, with your jesting.” She gave him an uneasy smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, I\u0027ve not jested much,” he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not jested? Cormac, you barely speak.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye.” He stopped himself from saying more. Marjorie\u0027s bright blue eyes were guileless and her face open as she watched him. She seemed to be waiting for something to happen. He needed to stem such ideas. Nothing would ever happen. How had he even found himself this far into the conversation? Nothing could come of such talk. Naught could ever be between them. “Aye, \u0027tis true,” he said again, and left it at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brief exchange had charged their silence, and he regretted ever saying anything in the first place. Her horse caught and then passed his on the path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re angry at me,” she said after a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh aye?” The lass was such a mystery. He didn\u0027t recall her being so perplexing when they\u0027d been children. He studied her back as she rode before him, watching as her muscles tensed, imagining the look that might be crossing her face. “Angry, you say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a tight nod. “For making you come with me to Aberdeen.” He thought on it. It wasn\u0027t anger but dread that he felt. He dreaded Aberdeen. Cormac didn\u0027t want to face the ruffians of Justice Port; they had naught but fights and death in their eyes, and he only recognized himself in their cold, flat gazes. He dreaded revisiting her uncle\u0027s town house. Most of all, he dreaded facing the memories of another missing boy, one who\u0027d never been found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Marjorie would be dreading Aberdeen as much as he did. She\u0027d come to him for help, and he\u0027d been acting the boor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt guilty, and it warmed his words. “It\u0027s not that I\u0027m angry, Ree.” He sighed. He\u0027d never been able to stay angry with her anyhow. Like it or not, they were traveling to Aberdeen together, and he might as well make the best of it. Inhaling deeply, he announced, “We\u0027ll need a plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A plan?” It was Marjorie\u0027s voice again, the voice he knew, straightforward and without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t realized his shoulders had tensed until he felt them unclench just then. “Aye, if we\u0027re to search for the boy, we\u0027ll need a plan. We\u0027re up the coast to Aberdeen, and to your uncle\u0027s by dusk. We\u0027ll take a turn around the quay tomorrow, at first light.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and stilled her mare for him to catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac felt a fraction lighter inside. Empathy was too painful, but this planning, this he could do. He was in it now, and if he was going to do a thing, there was no sense in not doing it right. His words came more easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll need to know about the boy. You\u0027d said he\u0027s a wee lad, just five?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye.” Her voice cracked. She cleared it and started again. “He didn\u0027t know exactly, but he thought five. I\u0027d say not more than six.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s he look like, then?” He braced himself. He would hear her response and parse it as though devising a military campaign. He\u0027d not let himself imagine this boy too vividly. This boy who would never be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s a wee rascal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac heard the smile in her voice and kept his eyes trained on the path ahead. He gathered his nerves. He\u0027d not let himself grow attached to the thought of a missing child. And more even than that, he\u0027d not allow concerns for Marjorie to penetrate his defenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s a little ginger-haired boy,” she continued, warming to the topic. “Smaller than the others. With freckles, and a pointing chin, and mischief to spare. From the start, he seemed to me a fey creature.” It was clear she loved the boy. It suddenly struck him how much she\u0027d enjoy raising a child of her own. He wondered why she hadn\u0027t yet married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he realized he was oddly glad she hadn\u0027t. Deep down it pleased him that there was someone out there who\u0027d turned to him for help. More so, that it\u0027d been Ree who had. The thought that she might\u0027ve married, might now be relying on another man for support, sent a plume of instinctive, protective anger snaking through his belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let the sensation hang briefly before pushing it away. It\u0027d do no good to dwell on such things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you\u0027re certain he wouldn\u0027t simply have wandered off?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m certain of it,” she said with a steadiness that made him feel a strange wash of pride. “Evening was his favorite time of the day. Supper at Saint Machar isn\u0027t a grand affair, by any means. But there\u0027s a pack of them, the youngest boys, who play in the evenings. Such grand stories they enact for themselves. Davie\u0027s favorite is to relive tales of the Campbell, just as we did. Remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye,” he said quietly, feeling a small crack in his heart. Of course he remembered. It\u0027d been his favorite thing as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac\u0027s expression softened almost imperceptibly, and Marjorie swelled at the sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let herself relive memories of Davie. “They\u0027ll play at the same stories for days,” she said, smiling wistfully. “Such elaborate campaigns with pretend armaments and battle plans. Fights with the Marquis of Montrose are a particular favorite. Except when Davie has to play the Campbell. Och, but he hates being the Campbell, just like—” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-9.html","bookId":2656,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM"}
