She should be thankful she had such good friends who wanted to take care of her. And at the Hamilton she was pampered. Earlier Regan had sent up a member of the spa staff to wash and blow-dry her hair. After she’d taken a lovely bath, the nurse came in to help her change and fix the sling for her cast. She was feeling so much better thanks to all the support she was getting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAiden knocked on her door to announce that he had ordered dinner and asked her to come out to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really can take care of myself,” she told him as he pulled the chair out for her and put the napkin in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you mentioned that a couple of times earlier today.” He lifted the silver plate cover to reveal filet mignon, asparagus, and baby red potatoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at the mouthwatering steak for several seconds, then said, “You did that on purpose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did what?” he asked innocently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew she couldn’t cut the steak, and that was why he’d ordered it, to prove to her she wasn’t self-reliant just yet. He took the steak knife and fork and cut the meat into bite-size pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want me to feed you?” There was laughter in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not necessary,” she grumbled as she picked up the fork with her free hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat across from her and uncovered the same meal on his plate. She was surprised he was having dinner with her because she knew he usually went out every evening, sometimes for business, sometimes for pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shall we have an argument-free dinner?” he proposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t argue. I simply express my opinion, and you ignore it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So that’s a no,” he said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We won’t argue,” she promised. And to prove it she thanked him for dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a bite of steak and said, “This is good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe agreed. It was delicious. “Tell me about the congressman making you crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not much to tell, and it’s Walker making me crazy.” He then explained what had happened with Rock Point. “Spencer had worked hard on the deal, and the resort would bring that community back to life, but the congressman got greedy and demanded more money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He agreed to one price, then changed his mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAiden nodded. He wasn’t used to talking about his frustrations with anyone, and it felt good to get it all out. “The guy’s a jerk,” he said. “Know what he said? Giving his word and shaking my hand didn’t mean anything. He hadn’t signed anything, so it wasn’t a done deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did Walker get involved, and why did he negotiate with the congressman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAiden shook his head. “I don’t know. I haven’t talked to him yet. I thought I’d get over my anger first, but that’s not happening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When is Armageddon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question made him laugh, and his mood was suddenly lightened. “Tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then talked about the Houston property and the difficulty getting permits for the expansion. She couldn’t imagine how he kept everything straight in his head. She would have trouble remembering how many hotels there were. Not Aiden. He oversaw every phase, from breaking ground to the grand opening, and he could rattle off numbers faster than a computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you stay so organized?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got a lot of good people I can rely on to get the job done, and Spencer does as much as I do. We split the work,” he explained. “He’s just more laid-back about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about what he had just said and decided she might have unjustly judged Walker as a giant liability and a man who refused responsibility. His older brothers had taken over the running of the business, and he had very little to say about it. Maybe Walker had more to offer than they realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The four of you have an equal vote,” Cordie said. “Isn’t that right? Even though Regan runs the charity foundation, she still has a vote on any new development.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so does Walker?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happens if Walker and Regan vote against you and Spencer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “I figure out a way to get what I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “You’re arrogant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo apology came with the acknowledgment, but then she didn’t expect he would view arrogance as a flaw. Aiden Madison was the ultimate alpha, and she, supposedly a liberated female, shouldn’t be attracted to him. Should she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got to get some work done tonight,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going down to your office?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’ll work on my laptop here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed her chair back and stood. “I won’t bother you. I should answer my e-mails. That will take forever.” She hoped that when her fingers weren’t so swollen she would be able to type, but for now she had to use the one-finger technique. Thank goodness Regan had brought over some of her electronics. Cordie would be lost without her laptop and her cell phone charger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went into the bedroom for her computer, then returned to the living room to find her phone so she could charge it. After a futile search, she picked up the hotel phone and called her cell. Following the ring, she located the phone under a chair. How had it gotten there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAiden leaned against the bar watching her. The living room was beginning to look as though it had been ransacked. The cushions on the sofas were askew; the coffee table was cluttered with Cordie’s laptop, iPad, earbuds, and chargers. One of her robes was draped over a chair, and her e-reader was on the seat. She hadn’t even been in the suite all that long. What would the room look like in a week? She needed to get organized, he decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know how much time you waste looking for things you’ve misplaced?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCordie was untangling her charger cord from the laptop. She straightened and asked, “Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe repeated his question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Aiden, I don’t know how much time I waste looking for things. At home I have a place for my things. Here, I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t argue with her because his phone rang. “It’s Alec,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited impatiently for Aiden to finish his conversation and tell her what Alec wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s coming over with the video,” he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t he just e-mail it to us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wants to talk to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else did he say?” She leaned against the arm of the sofa. She didn’t want to sit, afraid she wouldn’t be able to get up. With all the bumps and bruises, by the end of the day moving was exhausting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said it’s official now. Sean and Jayden were on the mark. Someone deliberately pushed you into the path of that car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was astounded and outraged. “So it’s for real. Now there’s proof. Oh my God. Someone actually tried to kill me. I could have died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was surprised by her reaction. “We already knew you were pushed. This is confirmation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re awful relaxed about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still sounded too calm to her. “I can’t believe it. I should have paid attention. I slacked off. All week I’ve been looking behind me every time I thought someone was following me, and the minute I let my guard down, boom. I almost get killed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaw clenched, he said her name in a warning tone. “Cordelia, you thought someone was following you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, and apparently I let him sneak right up behind me. I can’t believe it. Do you know who’s behind this? Because I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAiden wanted to shout at her for not telling him sooner. He decided to wait for Alec to get the entire story out of her. Then he would get to yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Simone,” she announced unequivocally. “She’s trying to dispose of me just like she did with her marriage to my father. That freak of a family in Australia won’t know what hit them when I . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped ranting as soon as Aiden took her into his arms. “You know what this means, Cordelia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her forehead. “You’re not going anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided to wait until the agreed-on time to call Sydney. He wanted to downplay the incident, and for that reason he didn’t make an emergency call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything to report?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he said. “As instructed, I’ve continued to follow and observe the woman. I didn’t find anything in her house that would connect you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been looking for the best time to dispose of the problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those were your instructions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cleared his throat. “An opportunity presented itself on a crowded street, and I made the decision to go ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I pushed the woman into heavy traffic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With witnesses? You said a crowded street. People saw you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no one saw what I did,” he rushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But something did go wrong. I hear it in your voice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The woman survived. She had injuries, but she will recover.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You idiot! What made you think that would work? I sent you there to take care of this problem and you failed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stammered, “Yes . . . yes . . . I realize I should have found a better way by now. The police believe it was an accident. She should have died, but the car was slowing down . . . I just acted on the spur of the moment because I saw an opportunity . . .” He realized he was making excuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This should have been done already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I did fail, but it won’t happen again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It better not. No more waiting. You finish it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCordie watched the video at the table with Aiden beside her. Alec had gone to the bar to get a beer before he took a chair across from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really did bounce.” She winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See what you did there?” Aiden replayed the seconds before impact. “It looks like you tried to jump up, like a pole-vaulter, onto the hood of the car. That was smart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you seriously trying to put a positive spin on this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “Maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it looks like I tried to stop the car with my left arm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The blinkers were on,” Alec commented. “It’s a good thing the car was slowing down, or you could have been in much worse shape.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCordie knew they were trying to be reassuring, but their attempts to make her see the glass as half full were not working. She backed up the video and watched it again. She saw herself step up to the edge of the curb and the crowd gather around her. Everyone was facing forward, and suddenly their heads turned. Apparently this was the point at which the truck backfired. Within a fraction of a second, Cordie lurched into the path of the oncoming car. When she played the video again, she concentrated on the people behind her. Everyone was crammed together so closely, it was impossible to see faces. She backed up the image once more and watched the pedestrians heading to the corner. There was only one suspicious-looking character. He wore a baseball cap down low over his brow, and he never looked up so the traffic cam could catch his face. He seemed to disappear in the throng. She let the video continue to play. After the crash, some people ran to help her; some stood watching in shock; and others who wondered what was happening walked into the camera’s view. The commotion lasted a couple of minutes before a few onlookers began to drift away. She looked closely as they dispersed and saw the baseball cap disappearing among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec and Aiden played the video at least twenty times more, looking at individuals but concentrating on the man in the cap and finally concluding they saw nothing that would identify an assailant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s enough,” she said. “I can’t watch this again. I don’t recognize anyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you tell Alec how you let him sneak up on you,” Aiden suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?” Alec asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All week long I’ve had this weird feeling that someone was following me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec didn’t say anything for a couple of seconds. He took a long swig of beer. “All week long, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. From the look in his eyes, she could tell he was about to get testy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to tell me why you think someone was following you? And then maybe you could explain why you didn’t tell me about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was just a feeling,” she said, trying to defend herself. “I didn’t have any proof, and every time I got that feeling and tuned around or looked in a mirror, there was never anyone there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAiden felt like banging his head against the wall. “For God’s sake, Cordelia, the whole point would be to avoid being seen if he was any good at his job, and apparently he was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You needn’t snap at me. I was going to mention it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Start mentioning it now,” Alec said. “When did you first suspect someone was watching you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went through her week, telling him about the art gallery, the parking garage, and the cemetery. When she was finished, all he said was, “Okay. Is there anything else you want to mention?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCordie couldn’t tell if Alec was irritated with her now or not. Turning to Aiden, she asked, “What time is it in Sydney?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t have to think before he answered. “It’s after nine here, so it’s after twelve noon there. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to call Liam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been talking to him,” Alec said. “He’s looking into a couple of things and will call me back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat couple of things? Before she could ask, he said, “I’ll let you know. You have to be patient, Cordie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was easier said than done. She wanted to help, but she didn’t know how. It was frustrating, and fatigue was taking a toll. At least she didn’t have to worry about getting dark circles under her eyes. The bruises would hide them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate being helpless,” she admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAiden actually looked sympathetic. “I know, but you have to let us handle this for now. You’ve suffered quite a trauma.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aches and pains she was feeling at the moment told her he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Regan and I have a favor to ask,” Alec said. His demeanor had changed. He was no longer the professional and serious FBI agent, but her friend. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fast-track-buchanan-renard-12/page-23.html","bookId":1825,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:27:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:27:12 PM"}
