This meant that there were no crimes, only deeds which cost more. Every citizen had a well-established value, expressed in currency. Morality lay in not trying to do something without paying for it. Every transaction flowed on the grease of value. Every injury had a price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;If you wanted to kill your enemy, you could—but you had to deposit his full worth in the Sector Fundat within a day.

Their method makes for good manners.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Hari had to agree. Several Galactic Zones used the same scheme; they were models of stability. The poor had to be polite. If you were penniless and boorish, you might not survive. But the rich were not invulnerable, either. A consortium of economic lessers could get together, beat a rich man badly, then simply pay his hospital and recovery bills. Of course, his retribution might be ex­ treme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“But she was operating outside Analytica,” Hari said. “That’s il­ legal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“To us, to me, surely.

The embossed sheet, with its elaborate saluta­ tions, came “freighted with nuance,” as Hari’s protocol officer put it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;This audience was in one of the stranger Sectors. Even buried in layers of artifice, many Sectors of Trantor displayed an odd biophil­ ia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Here in Arcadia Sector, expensive homes perched above a view of an interior lake or broad field. Many sported trees arranged in artfully random bunches, with a clear preference for those with spreading crowns, many branches projecting upward and outward from thick trunks, displaying luxuriant bunches of small leaves. Balconies they rimmed with potted shrubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Hari walked through these, seeing them through the lens of Pa­ nucopia. It was as though people announced through their choices their primeval origins. Was early humanity, like pans, more secure in marginal terrain—where vistas let them search for food while keeping an eye out for enemies? Frail, without claws or sharp teeth, they might have needed a quick retreat into trees or water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Similarly, studies showed that some phobias were Galaxy-wide. People who had never seen the images nonetheless reacted with startled fear to holos of spiders, snakes, wolves, sharp drops, heavy masses overhead. None displayed phobias against more recent threats to their lives: knives, guns, electrical sockets, fast cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;All this had to factor somehow into psychohistory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“No tracers here, sir,” the Specials’ captain said. “Little hard to keep track, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Hari smiled. The captain suffered from a common Trantorian malady: squashed perspectives. Here in the open, natives would mistake distant, large objects for nearby, small ones. Even Hari had a touch of it. On Panucopia, he at first mistook herds of grazers for rats close at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;By now Hari had learned to look through the pomp and glory of rich settings, the crowds of servants, the finery. He ruminated on his psychohistorical research as he followed the protocol officer and did not fully come back to the real world until he sat across from the Academic Potentate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;She spoke ornately, “Please do accept my humble offering,” ac­ companied delicate, translucent cups of steaming grasswater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;He remembered being irked by this woman and the high academ­ ics he met that evening. It all seemed so long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“You will note the aroma is that of ripe oobalong fruit. This is my personal choice among the splendid grasswaters of the world Calafia. It reflects the high esteem in which I hold those who now grace my simple domicile with such illustrious presence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Hari had to lower his head in what he hoped was a respectful gesture, to hide his grin. There followed more high-flown phrases about the medical benefits of grasswater, ranging from relief of di­ gestion problems to repair of basal cellular injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Her chins quivered. “You must need succor in such trying times, Academician.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Mostly I need time to get my work done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Perhaps you would favor a healthy portion of the black lichen meat? It is the finest, harvested from the flanks of the steep peaks of Ambrose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Next time, certainly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“It is hoped fervently that this lowly personage had perhaps been of small service to a most worthy and revered figure of our time…one who perhaps is overstressed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;A steely edge to her voice put him on guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Could madam get to the point?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Very well.
