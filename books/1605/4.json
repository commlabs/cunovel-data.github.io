He shot him, Bri. He shot him in the head. We need to get out of here now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn around, man. Go that way. Up the hill.\" Brian sounded scared, which made me scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the wrong way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who fucking cares. DRIVE!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jeep sped up and I felt a huge bump. Then my stomach felt like it was rolling around inside of me. I lost my grip on the seat and was flung up. The thick book hit me in the face. My seatbelt caught me and I saw colors behind my eyes, as I was thrown back onto the seat. It didn\u0027t feel comfortable anymore. It felt hard and scraped my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turned over and over and loud bangs filled up all the air there was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard them screaming and then it stopped. Then it was just me screaming. We stopped moving, but my lips stayed open and my cries were everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heaved slightly and looked around. I was upside-down and hanging by my seatbelt. I clicked it, but I didn\u0027t fall. The top of the jeep was closer than it was before. I could see blood. Some of it was mine and some of it came from the front seat. Brian was gone. The windows were gone. I heard a groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Em,\" Dad groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached frantically, \"Dad. Dad. I can\u0027t see you.\" His headrest was up and the jeep was bent and crumpled around him. I slithered out the back of it and dragged myself onto the dry, brown grass. There were other cars surrounding us and in no better shape than the jeep. In the distance, I could see other people, but not many. I could see them noticing the accident and pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Em, the others will want our stuff. Run,\" he whispered harshly and coughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dragged myself to his window, which was gone. His body was stuck, pinned by the jeep. I pulled on the door handle, but it didn\u0027t budge. I cried and scratched and slapped at the jeep. I kicked at the door, but it wouldn\u0027t move. I was too small and too skinny and I couldn\u0027t even dent the metal. All my anger, pain, and fear wouldn\u0027t even scratch at the cold, hard door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked bad. His body was upside down, but not hanging. The jeep was all around him, snug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moaned again, \"Em. Run. You can run fast and far, don’t let yourself give up. Take this and run. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held nothing out for me to take, but his hand was bent funny. I sat on the grass beside him and cried. I could feel the defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licked his lips and looked at me with the most frightening eyes I\u0027d ever seen. \"Run, Em. Run and get to the cabin. Go up that mountain to the right of us. Climb up until you come to a dirt road. Follow it until you come to an old farmhouse. From there, it\u0027s across their hayfield and up the mountain behind their house. To the right.\" He slipped his bent hand out and grabbed mine. I could feel his fingers click when he bent them. \"It\u0027s us and them, Em. I\u0027m still with you. You can feel it, you\u0027ll always feel it. But right now, I need you to be a brave girl—the brave girl I trained for exactly this moment. Run and don’t help anyone. Don’t ask for help. It\u0027s everyone for themselves now. They\u0027re all sick, Em. In some way, they\u0027re all sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood dripped into his hair from a cut above his eye. I shook my head and cried. I heard a truck behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe screamed at me, \"RUN, EM! THEY\u0027RE COMING! NEVER GET CAUGHT, EM! NEVER!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backed away on the grass and stood on my bruised and battered legs. They almost buckled in fear, but I did as he said. I swallowed my sobs and turned and ran. I ran across the freeway and up the hill into the grass. Feet made noises behind me, but I had always been fast, even as a little girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the vehicle and the gunshot. I heard the others. I knew they\u0027d shot him, if he lived that long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran and ran until I threw up in the grass, and even then, I ran. I ran until my eyes saw things that could not be and heard people I knew to be dead. People like my father. I felt him pulling me up the hill and yelling at me to hurry up. I felt his breath on my face, as he shouted and squeezed my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran until I saw the farmhouse. Then I crept and snuck and hid in the shadows of the dark. Then I sat alone in those shadows, too terrified to cry. Too terrified to move. But I knew food and water would be waiting at the cabin. All the food and water, I could manage to get inside me. Hunger gnawed at my spine. I stumbled across the field in the dark. I got to the other side and climbed one of the trees there. Its rough bark reminded me, I was alive. Just as he always said it would, pain reminded me I was still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flashes stop, and the memory fades, and I am alone in the dark room with the smiling statue of Jesus. And again the pain reminds me I am still alive, just like it did then in the big tree at the edge of the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I wake, the pain is gone, but I\u0027ve peed myself. The pee is everywhere. My pants are sticky and wet. It smells rusty like blood, but I recall peeing. I recall the pain and the pressure and how good it felt to let go of the pee. I am becoming one of the infected. It\u0027s what he put into my arm. I know it. I\u0027ve peed and cramped. Soon I will wander about and crave flesh…or just die and be eaten by the other infected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere is Anna? Has she come for me? Is she captured? I need to be stronger to save her, unless she was truly a hallucination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room is so dark that I can\u0027t see Jesus, but I assume he is still here. I wonder if he is grossed out that I\u0027ve peed on the floor and am so weak I cannot move out of my own filth. I wish he wasn’t a stone statue, but rather a mannequin. I need new clothes. The image of being infected and wondering the world in robes that I stole from a Jesus mannequin, makes me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab one of the bags of glucose and pull the plug from the bottom of it. I drink the sweet water until I feel sick, and even then, I force a little more down. I drain the bag and drop it to the floor, where I then lower my face and arms. The cold of the floor is comforting somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes flicker like the lights in the hall and I know I\u0027m passing out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t dream this time. I don’t remember anything else about before. I just sleep and then wake up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I wake again, I lick my lips. They feel chapped and cracked. The pee is dried and when I move my legs, they feel stuck in the pants. I am weak. Very weak. My breath feels like effort. My heart doesn’t feel like it\u0027s beating at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find the door and find Anna,\" I whisper to myself, and maybe Jesus. He\u0027s like Leo. He makes me less crazy, because with him there, I\u0027m not talking to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push myself to my knees and crawl to where I think the door is. I feel along the wall for the gap where the handle will be. The edge of the door evades me. Did the room seal while I slept? I look around in the darkness for Jesus. From what Granny said, he is supposed to be my light in the dark, but even my animal eyes don’t work in this place. There is no light in this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall feels like it is never-ending. I feel like I will travel this wall in a circle, until I go mad and claw my way through it. I wonder if I am in hell. I am being punished for the sins I have committed. I\u0027m not really sorry for any of them. That might be a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and feel for the statue of Jesus. Nothing feels like it will happen fast enough. The air in the room feels like its oxygen supply has been sucked dry. All that’s left is the pollution I have made with every panicked exhale. My heartbeat feels like it\u0027s been started with a shock, and it\u0027s now making an attempt to rip itself from my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a panic attack. I recognize it as my fingers touch the cold statue. My fingers meet the cold of his robes and I fall at his feet in a heap. I am like his followers. The ones I\u0027ve seen who save the children crying alone on the road. The ones who seem kind and gentle, but somehow their eyes make you feel not good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me,\" I whisper, gripping to his cold robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear something and lift my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I think it\u0027s Jesus whispering, making me shiver. I am about to become devout for the remaining seconds of my life, when I realize the wind is coming from the door. I crawl away from Jesus, feeling along the floor for the bottom of the door where the air is coming in. It\u0027s clean and fresh. Something has changed in the hallway outside. Anna?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the slight cool whisper of air, as my hands reach the base of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run my hands up it to the handle and hang on for dear life. I turn the lock on the door, just as the handle turns. It gets stuck on the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice follows the movement of the handle, \"Clear here too.\" The vibration of the movement jolts through me. \"She went up the stairs. Everything else is locked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost leap back screaming. But I force myself to be calm. I hold my fingers on the door and wait. They are checking the hall and looking for me. They know I am gone. I am not alone. The doctor wasn’t alone. Where were they when I was killing him? Are they looking for Anna?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother voice fills the silent air of the hallway, \"God dammed, do you know how important she was? For Christ\u0027s sake. It\u0027s one little girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle girl? Are they talking about me? Am I still a little girl or is it Anna they\u0027ve lost? My heart is already panicked from the arrival of the men, this doesn’t help it calm down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to think, but my stomach is hurting too much. I don\u0027t know what to do. If I go looking for them, I might lead the men to where they are. I\u0027m sick and, most likely dying, so it isn’t like I\u0027ll be much help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause my thoughts when I hear footsteps again, \"Get her back or it\u0027s your lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the wolf?\" a man asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo. I almost say his name aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s alive. He\u0027s near. Fire burns in my belly, but I refuse it. I need to find him. I need him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices walk away from me, growing quieter, \"She\u0027s sick. She doesn’t know where he is. Don\u0027t worry about him…find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lose them after that. The hallway is silent again and the wind is gone from under the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull another bag from my pocket and pull the plug. I drink it down. It tastes sweet and stale and funny but I know I\u0027m dehydrated and sick. The poison he shot into me made me sick but didn’t kill me. I need to replace my fluids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and press my face against the door. I listen for the sounds of boots and guns. I listen for breath that gets ragged, when you\u0027re searching for someone. There is nothing. The men\u0027s voices are gone. The men who rattled the door and tried the lock, are gone. It\u0027s almost like they were a figment of my imagination, like Anna. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-4.html","bookId":1605,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM"}
