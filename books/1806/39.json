We are expected to accept the actions of the royal family blindly and without question. That is most assuredly not the way of Trieux.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriedrich shifted. “In the Army, I give orders and expect my men to follow them…but usually an explanation accompanies the orders. It would be dangerous to send ignorant soldiers into combat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly!” Cinderella triumphantly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps you are right,” Friedrich said, looking uncomfortable. “From a logical standpoint, I can see why it would assure you of Trieux to hear of the queen’s doings. As an Erlauf citizen, though, I do not think it would be easy to change that aspect of the Erlauf monarchy. It is ingrained in our culture that we must trust our monarch implicitly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then our best hope is the Crown Prince,” Cinderella said. “If he is as aware of the strife as you say he is, he might be more accepting of change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriedrich cleared his throat. “I think a great deal of it will also rest in whomever he marries.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps…,” Cinderella said, considering the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriedrich was quiet for a few moments. “Did you plant the flowers?” he asked changing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The day after you gave me the seeds. They have already begun sprouting,” Cinderella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Already? It has been barely two weeks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The book you gave me mentioned they have a short growing period.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. I expect you will be able to turn a profit more swiftly than originally estimated?” Friedrich said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Indeed. Thank you again for the seeds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your desires are my goals, Pet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Must you call me that?” Cinderella asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course; it is endearing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is not. It is, ugh. How would you feel if I called you…Scamp?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would be touched.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rogue?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honored.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…Fred?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriedrich pulled back, as if Cinderella had backhanded him. “You wouldn’t,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella smiled and rubbed her hands in delight. “Why not? Fred is a respectable name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriedrich winced. “Words cannot describe how much I dislike that particular shortening of my name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then at least you will know how I feel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cinderella,” Friedrich said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriedrich sighed. “You’re no fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? I think I’m hysterical.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Killjoy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever you say, Fred.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems General Hardbutt intends to keep the Second Regiment at Werra,” Merrich said, sipping his pint of ale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe it is in preparation of Queen Freja’s departure at the end of the year,” Diederick, a friend of Friedrich’s and a government official, said. “The country is stable, but if she intends to tour the lands, the Third Regiment will accompany her,” he said, swirling his mug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the Commander,” Merrich added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiederick nodded. “And the Commander,” he echoed. “Their absence will make things… interesting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think a rebellion is very likely,” Merrich said. “The taxes are stiff, yes, but the commoners don’t seem to mind them too much, and there’s hardly anyone left to lead them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The remaining Trieux nobles are too aware of the precarious situation they are in. No, my friend, Trieux is definitely a part of Erlauf. At least on paper. The peoples’ hearts and loyalties don’t belong to Erlauf, but that is not something I am not responsible for,” Diederick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerrich laughed and leaned back in his chair. “Do you hear that, Friedrich? Friedrich.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She called me Fred,” Friedrich said, scowling into his pint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerrich laughed again and pounded his hand on the table at which they sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?” Diederick asked, adjusting his wire-rimmed eyeglasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His Trieux misses,” Merrich grinned. “Lady Lacreux. She has the looks of the troll, but she sounds like barrels of fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lady Lacreux? She does not look—,” Diederick started. He quieted when Friedrich kicked him under the table. “So that is whom you have chosen? She has a fiery temper, I’ve been told. Are you certain you have not bitten off more than you can chew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s the one for me,” Friedrich said, lazily balancing his chair on the back two legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and his friends were seated outdoors in front of a tavern where they could watch commoners—Trieux and Erlauf alike—hurry on their way, call out their wares, and gossip and laugh in the open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiederick shrugged. “Personally speaking, it makes very little difference to me whom you marry. You will be the one to live with her. You think she is a good choice in every way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her servants would die for her—although I doubt she knows. They handle her with kid gloves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A footman popped one of my soldiers in the head when I sent him to check in on her. The footman thought he was spying on her. The butler nearly busted my man before I could send word,” Friedrich said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is a good choice. Her blood and heritage will bring legitimacy to your position—but do you think she’ll actually say yes?” Diederick asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cinderella-and-the-colonel-timeless-fairy-tales-3/page-39.html","bookId":1806,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:18 PM"}
