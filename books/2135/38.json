{"id":95008,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"\u003cp\u003eWe were at Cold Stone Creamery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it nice to know that you don\u0027t have to keep faking it all the time, Mom,\" said Tammy as we all sat in a booth in the far corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the weather was warming, the creamery was empty. I wasn\u0027t complaining. My kids couldn\u0027t keep their voices down even if I paid them to. Especially not now. Not with this much excitement in the air. After our talk a few hours ago, it had been Anthony who suggested we all go get ice cream. No surprise there. The kid was literally eating me out of house and home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, just in the past two hours, the kids were getting along better. And not just getting along but being - and get this - friendly toward each other. At one point, Anthony suggested to Tammy that she try the Snickers on her ice cream, and she actually did. She didn\u0027t tell him to mind his own business. She didn\u0027t ignore him. She didn\u0027t tell him he was stupid and looked funny. She said, \"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there in amazement, watching the scene play out. Tammy then nudged Anthony and pointed to a big stain on the worker\u0027s apron and they both giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranted, they were laughing at someone else, but at least they were getting along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaby steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered Tammy\u0027s question as I sat with the two of them. I was drinking from a water bottle and chewing gum. The gum was nice. It only gave me the smallest of stomach cramps - no doubt from the trace ingredients in the flavor - but it was nice to chew and drink and look like a real mom. I said to Tammy, \"Yes. It is a relief, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to keep pretending to eat or to have stomach aches,\" said Anthony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least, not around you two,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or Daddy,\" said Anthony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t eat with Daddy anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTammy was eating her ice cream thoughtfully. \"But when we are around other people...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I will still have to pretend to eat, or pretend that I\u0027m full, or pretend that I have a tummy ache.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded thoughtfully. Somewhere through all of this, my daughter had seriously grown up. Having access to others\u0027 minds might have something to do with that. Or maybe it was realizing that her mother was the mother of all freaks, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember, what I am,\" I said to them again, \"is a secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We knoooooow,\" said Anthony, laying his head on the table. \"You told us like a Brazilian times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bazillion,\" Tammy corrected. \"Brazil is a state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Country,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" she said. \"The point is, we all have secrets now. We should make a pact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s a pact?\" asked Anthony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for his sister to ridicule his question, or, at least, to roll her eyes at his simplicity. She didn\u0027t. Instead, she surprised me again by turning to him and saying patiently, \"It means we all agree to something forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forever?\" said Anthony, blinking. \"But mom\u0027s a mimmortal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Immortal,\" said Tammy, only slightly losing her patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I said. Mimmortal. She lives forever. That\u0027s a long time to keep a secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly fell out of my seat. Listening to my kids discussing something so casually that I had tried so hard to keep secret from them was just too surreal. I didn\u0027t know if I should smile, weep, or fear for the mental health of all of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll make a pact to keep our secrets forever. Deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deal,\" they said together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all looked at each. Anthony voiced what was on all of our minds. \"So, how do we make a pact?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I honestly don\u0027t know,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A blood pact!\" said Tammy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t wanna make a blood pact!\" screamed Anthony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No blood pacts,\" I said, shushing them. The Cold Stone worker had looked over at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about an ice cream pact!\" said Anthony, although I was pretty sure no one knew what he was talking about, least of all himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"How about a pinkie pact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! A pinkie pact,\" shouted Anthony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTammy nodded, too, and we all held our pinkies over the slightly sticky table. We interlocked them. Theirs were warm. Mine, not so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pinkie swear,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pinkie swear,\" they said together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To keep our secrets to ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both nodded solemnly, and we unhooked our pinkies and Anthony was about to go back to his ice cream when he paused and said, \"Tammy can really read my thoughts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is so weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No weirder than you being half vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not half vampire. I\u0027m just strong like a vampire. Like Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the half part, buttface.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the buttface, buttface.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t say buttface twice, buttface.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just did!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and checked my watch. They had gotten along for all of two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter than nothing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-38.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
