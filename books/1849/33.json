And she looks so tempting I can’t help but lean over her chair, trapping her with my arms. Small talk is over. Time to get back to business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come for a walk with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice is low. Persuasive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd utterly ineffective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Kate, it’ll just take a minute. I want to show you something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorts. “What’d you do? Hire Ringling Brothers to do a show in the lobby? Organize a ticker-tape parade in my honor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. “Don’t be ridiculous. I wouldn’t do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate raises one skeptical brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, you’re right—I would so do that. But not today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushes me back and stands up. I let her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not scared, are you?” I ask. “Afraid you won’t be able to control yourself if you’re alone with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo people like Kate and me, a dare is kind of like a hooker at a sex addicts’ convention. There’s almost no chance they’re going to get turned down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you mean am I afraid I’ll kill you if there aren’t any witnesses to testify against me, then the answer’s yes. Although I must admit, twenty-to-life is looking like a small price to pay at the moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you think she enjoys the verbal foreplay as much as I do? She’s got to. She’s so good at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe circles around, putting her desk between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, Drew, I have a new client. I told you that. You know how it is. I can’t afford these…distractions right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take that as a compliment. “I distract you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe huffs. “That’s not what I meant.” Then her face changes. And she’s imploring, “You have to stop this—” her hands wave in the air “—this mission you’re on. Just let it go. Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Steven was eleven, he ran into a tree during a game of touch football in his backyard—and busted his forehead open. For as long as I live, I’ll never forget the sound of him begging, pleading with his mother not to take him to the hospital. Because he knew he needed stitches. And stitches just—suck. At any age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Janey Reinhart didn’t give in. She brought him anyway. Because even though Steven was terrified—even though it wasn’t what he wanted—she knew it was what he needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou see where I’m going with this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ball’s in your court, Kate. I told you that from the beginning. You want me gone, all you have to do is go out with me on Saturday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bites her lip. And looks down at her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, I’d love to. With Kate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay—not the time to joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry? Could you repeat that, please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes meet mine. They look hesitant but resigned. Like someone waiting in line for a rollercoaster. Determined to get on but not exactly sure what the hell they’ve gotten themselves into. “I said yes. I’ll have dinner with you on Saturday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s official. Brace yourselves. Hell has actually frozen the f**k over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After talking with your sister, I realized a few things…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou love me? You need me? You can’t live without me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…I think you need closure, Drew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no. Not closure. Anything but f**king closure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosure is a made-up word that women invented so they can overanalyze something and talk about it—to death. And then, after it’s been blessed and buried, closure gives them the excuse to dig the poor f**ker up and talk about it—some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuys don’t do that. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s over. Fade to black. The end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s all the goddamn closure we need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Closure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks toward me. “I think things with us started and stopped so fast, you didn’t have time to acclimate yourself. Maybe if we spend some time…if we talk away from the office…you’ll understand that after everything that’s happened, the best we can hope to be is friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m pretty sure she means without benefits. And that just doesn’t work for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guy can’t be friends with a woman he’s actively attracted to. Not really. Because at some point his dick will take over. It’ll walk like him and talk like him, but—like one of the poor schmucks infected by those freaky face-sucking things in Alien—it won’t be him. And from that point on, every move, every gesture will be geared toward accomplishing the dick’s goal. Which sure as shit won’t have anything to do with friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, I have friends—Matthew, Steven, Jack. I don’t want to f**k any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Friends?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t notice my disgust with the idea. Or she just doesn’t give a damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. We should get reacquainted as coworkers. Equals. Not a date. Kind of more like a business meeting between colleagues.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenial is a powerful thing. But at this point I’ll take what I can get. “So, what you’re telling me is you’ll go out with me on Saturday? That’s the bottom line, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitates. And then nods. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perfect. Don’t say anything else. I’ll pick you up at seven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I’ll meet you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI speak slowly, “Now, Kate, I know you haven’t been on many dates, considering the moron you called a boyfriend had you engaged before you were out of a training bra. But in cases like this, the guy—that’s me—is supposed to pick you—the girl—up. It’s an unwritten law.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee how her lips press together? How her shoulders square off? Oh yeah, she’s ready to rumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just told you this isn’t a date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. “Semantics.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s say hypothetically it is a date. It would be a first date. And I would never have a man that I didn’t know come to my apartment to pick me up for a first date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push a hand through my hair. “That doesn’t make any sense. You know me. We did sixty-nine. I’d say you know me pretty damn well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, these are my terms. If you can’t live with them, we can just forget the whole—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait, wait. Let’s not be hasty. I give. You can meet me at my apartment. At seven. Sharp.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I have some terms of my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumps down my throat. “I’m not hav**g s*x with you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force myself to look surprised. “I’m wounded. Really. Who said anything about sex? I would never require sex as part of our agreement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s optional. Clothing too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolls her eyes. “Is that it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else do you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, baby. If she only knew. Though it’s probably better that she doesn’t. Don’t want to scare her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want four hours. At least. Uninterrupted. I want conversation, dinner—appetizers, entrée, dessert—wine, dancing…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe holds up her hand. “No dancing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One dance. That’s non-negotiable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at the ceiling, weighing her options. “Fine. One dance.” She points her finger at me. “But if your hands go anywhere near my ass, I’m out of there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it’s my turn to think it over. “Well…okay. But if you renege on any of my stipulations, I reserve the right to call do-over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waits a moment. Her eyes narrow distrustfully. “And you’ll leave me alone—completely—until Saturday? No priests popping in to say hello? No ice sculptures melting outside my door?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk. “It’ll be like we never met. Like I don’t even work here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChances are I won’t be here. I’m going to be a very busy boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate nods. “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold out my hand. She shakes it and says, “It’s a deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn her hand over gently and kiss the back—like I did the first night we met. “It’s a date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you ever walked into a room to get something, but once you’re there, you have no idea what you came for? Good. Then you’ll understand why I turn and start to walk out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil Kate’s voice stops me. “Drew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at her. “Yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face is downcast. “I don’t…I don’t enjoy hurting people. So…don’t get your hopes up about Saturday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can open my mouth, movement out the window catches my eye. And I can’t believe I almost forgot. Wordlessly, I walk forward and take Kate’s hand. I bring her to the window and stand behind her, resting my hands on her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring my mouth to her ear. My breath gives her goose bumps. The good kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted it to be simple. Something I would have carved on a tree or spray-painted on a wall if we were kids. But I needed it to be clear. A proclamation. Telling Kate and every other woman out there that I, Drew Evans, am off the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate gasps when she sees it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp there in the sky, in huge white letters, for the whole city to see:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways go out on top. Have I told you this yet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo? Well I’m telling you now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t care if you’re a businessman, a singer, or a top-rated television show—leave them wanting more. Never overplay your hand. You can always go back later for an encore, but once they’re sick of you, there’s no taking it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss the top of her head. “I’ll see you Saturday, Kate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she’s still staring out the window as I walk out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t worry—the show’s not over yet. I still have a few tricks up my sleeve, and I always save the best for last. You’re really not going to want to miss this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head straight for Erin’s desk. “I need you to get the florist on the phone. And the caterer. And set up an appointment for me—tonight—with that interior designer we talked about yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picks up her phone and dials. “I’m on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I said interior designer. You don’t know what that’s for, do you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the grand finale. My winning move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEE THAT RAKISHLY HANDSOME GUY in the charcoal slacks and black shirt with the sleeves half rolled up? The one arranging the china plates on that table?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s me. Drew Evans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, not really. Not the old me. I’m new and improved. This is DAK. Can you guess what that stands for? Half the women in this city would give their left tit to have me where I am right now. Pussy whipped. Obsessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there’s only one woman who was able to put me here. Now I just need to show her I’m here to stay. I haven’t seen her for two days. Two long, excruciating days. It wasn’t as bad as the seven, but it was close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, take a look around. What do you think? Am I missing anything? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tangled-tangled-1/page-33.html","bookId":1849,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:17 PM"}
