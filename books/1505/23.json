He did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t move. He already felt a sort of all-conquering, all-pervasive killing aura. If he moved, regardless of the movement, he might give the opponent an opening. Even a single twitch of a muscle might be a fatal mistake. Although he knew that a person like Gongzi Yu was definitely not the type of person to attack from behind, he couldn’t not take precaution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu suddenly laughed. His laughter was graceful and courteous. “You truly are worthy of being called an incomparable, elite master.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was still silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Madame Zhuo blinked her eyes a few times. “He didn’t even move, but you can tell he is a master?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Precisely because he did not move, he is an incomparable, elite master.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Can it be that not moving is harder than moving?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Much harder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “I don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “You should understand. If you were Fu Hongxue, and knew that I had suddenly arrived at your back, what would you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “I would definitely be very surprised!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “When surprised, you can’t help but put up your guard. You can’t help but move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Right!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “But so long as you moved, you would die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Because you simply do not know from where I might attack. Thus, no matter how you move, you will have made a fatal mistake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “If an opponent like you suddenly appeared behind somebody, no matter who they are, they would be tense. Even if they didn’t move, the muscles on their back would tighten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “But his did not. Although I have been standing behind him for very long, not a single part of his body has changed!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo finally let out a sigh. “Now I finally understand. Not moving truly is much harder than moving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you knew a man like Gongzi Yu was standing behind you, but could keep all the muscles in your body loose and slack, then you must be a man with nerves colder than ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo suddenly asked again, “Can it be that if he doesn’t move, you won’t have an opportunity to attack?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Not moving is moving. The final destination of all movements is not moving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “If you have too many openings, you actually have no openings, because your entire body will have become open. Open and clear, as empty as a vast mist. So you actually won’t know where to make your move?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu chuckled. “I knew you would understand this reasoning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “I also know that you definitely won’t attack. If you wanted to kill him from behind, you had many better opportunities than this one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, she said, “Because your goal isn’t to kill him. It’s to beat him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu suddenly let out a sigh. “Killing him is easy. Beating him is really very difficult.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally walked out from behind Fu Hongxue. His steps were serene and stable. Just at this moment, Fu Hongxue suddenly felt as though he were about to collapse. Cold sweat soaked his clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe definitely could not let Gongzi Yu see this. He suddenly said, “Why must you give up the easy path and take the hard one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said in a heavy voice, “Because you are Fu Hongxue, and I am Gongzi Yu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu was finally facing Fu Hongxue now. But Fu Hongxue still could not see his true appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the back, his elegant bearing seemed perfect and unassailable. However, on his face he wore a ferocious, hideous bronze mask!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue coldly said, “I didn’t imagine that Gongzi Yu doesn’t dare to use his own face to meet people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “You are wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “What you are seeing right now is Gongzi Yu’s true face.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “What I am seeing right now is but a mask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Isn’t there a mask on my face right now? Have you always had this cold, frozen, bloodless pale look to your face? And yet, isn’t this still your true face?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue shut his mouth again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Actually, you should understand that how he looks isn’t important, so long as you know that he is Gongzi Yu. This is the important point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the truth. Not even Fu Hongxue could deny it, because he couldn’t help but ask himself: “Am I currently showing my true features right now? What do my true features look like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu lightly said, “I don’t necessarily want to see your true features. I just want to know that you are Fu Hongxue. That’s enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at him. Only after a long time, did he say in a deep voice, “Now, you already know that I am Fu Hongxue. I also already know that you are Gongzi Yu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Therefore, there is something I wish to resolve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Between the two of us, only one of us can stay alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was still callous but polite. He was clearly very confident in himself. “Whoever is stronger is whoever shall survive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “There seems to be only one way to resolve this issue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Correct. There’s only one way. Since ancient times, there’s only been one way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the sabre in Fu Hongxue’s hand. “So I must personally defeat you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Otherwise, you’d rather die?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unspeakable look of sorrow was suddenly revealed in Gongzi Yu’s eyes. “Otherwise, I must die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “You should understand. I don’t want others to kill you, in order to prove that I am stronger than you. I am definitely going to be the strongest in the world. Otherwise, I would rather die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was suddenly filled with cynicism. “The martial world is like an independent country of its own. Only one ruler may be allowed to exist at any one time. If it isn’t me, it’d be you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “This time, I’m afraid you’re wrong!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “I’m not wrong. There are many things which indicate that aside from me, you are the person with the highest level of martial arts in the martial world!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly turned around, facing the painting on the wall. He slowly continued, “You were able to survive long enough to get here. That wasn’t an easy task. It wasn’t due to luck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo let out a light sigh. “It definitely wasn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were many people on the painting, almost lifelike in their perfection. The painting revealed a series of stories. There was a common person in every story. That person was Fu Hongxue. Facing the painting, the first thing he saw was himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGloomy weather, a little town on the borderlands. There were two people locked in a vicious battle in the long street. One wore clothes as white as snow, but in his hand he wielded a scarlet red sword. The other wielded a pitch-black sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “You should remember this. This is the Phoenix Market.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue naturally remembered. At that time, the Phoenix Market hadn’t become a dead settlement. That was also the first time he had met Yan Nanfei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “In this battle, you defeated Yan Nanfei.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the second segment of the painting, the Phoenix Market had already become a ghost town. In the middle of the mist, two people knelt before Fu Hongxue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “In this battle, you defeated the Twin Killers of the Five Elements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it was the vipers in the horse saddle, Ghostly Granny’s poisonous cakes, and the poisoned wine in the bright moon’s building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of the desolate Ni Family Garden, a young barefoot man was slowly falling down before his sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Du Lei originally was an expert of a rarely seen calibre in the martial world. His sabre was forged through bitterness and misery. Although it was a bit arrogant and artificial, I really did not imagine that you would kill him in one chop!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “A sabre art designed to kill only has one chop!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu sighed. “Not to think of it, and yet when you think of it, the gods know . Striking later, but arriving first. Not changing despite thousands of transformations in front of you. One sabre chop really is enough!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only did this single sabre chop shatter all of the various transformations of all sabre arts, it also overcame the boundaries of form and speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “What I really could not imagine was that you were actually able to escape from that secret room in the Peacock Manor!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Peacock Manor had turned into a heap of rubble, and Zhuo Yuzhen appeared on the painting. The Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch angrily chopped the horse in half, chef Hao chopped flesh in front of the cart, Mingyue Xin and Zhuo Yuzhen being sent into the secret room in the Peacock Manor, Gongsun Tu appearing, Zhuo Yuzhen giving birth in the secret room…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time, Fu Hongxue’s hand had already turned ice cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “She was a string. Originally, we wanted to use her to bind your hands. If your heart always pined after her and her two children, your hands will effectively have been fastened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA person whose hands had been fastened, naturally was not worth Gongzi Yu personally dealing with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo sighed again. “But we truly did not imagine that even in that situation, you were capable of killing the Demon Decapitating Sabre of Heaven’s Monarch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s hands tightened. “At that time, you were already preparing to allow her to reveal her true identity. Why did you have her kill Du Shiqi?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Because we needed her to do one last thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You wanted her to use those two children to force me to hand over the Sorrowful Book of Yin and Yang and of Heaven and Hell Mingling?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo nodded. “Only then did we believe that the Sorrowful Book of Yin and Yang did not fall into your hands, because we knew that for those two children, you would be willing to give up everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed again, then said, “A pity that you actually were able to master the Great Acupoint Changing Technique. You actually didn’t die in her hands. The even greater pity is that you couldn’t steel your heart enough to kill her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl wearing the jasmine flowers appeared on the painting. She was feeding chicken soup to Fu Hongxue. The old lady next door was killing a chicken. Xiao Ting, wearing her jasmine flowers, was buying alcohol in the small store at the other side of the street. The obese store owner was staring at her chest, an obscene smile on his face. But he lay drunken in that small room, as though he had slowly become used to that lowly way of living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “At that time, we originally thought that you were finished. Even if you could still kill, you would be nothing more than an insane executioner. You were already not worth Gongzi Yu personally dealing with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only person Gongzi Yu would personally deal with was the strongest person in the martial world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Even if you were already no longer the strongest person in the martial world, we wouldn’t have been happy if you died in a sewer. So at that time, we were planning to find someone else to kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Unfortunately, there aren’t many people who can kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “We at least have one person who can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue suddenly once again thought of that bitter, cold, despairing melody. It was more than enough to make a person totally lose all his will to live. No one could have imagined that when he reached that point, he would still have the courage to keep living. Perhaps it was because he had that sort of courage, that he was able to live until today. If even he himself could defeat himself, why would Gongzi Yu need to personally deal with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Thus, you should now finally understand that you were able to live until today, not because of luck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue asked again. “Have you done this solely because you must prove you are stronger than me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, that unspeakable sorrow and cynicism was in his eyes. “Because all of this can only be enjoyed by the strongest person. If you can defeat me, all of this is yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “All of this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “What all of this refers to is everything. It not only includes all of his riches, his honor, and his glory, it also includes me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. Her laughter was very gentle, very warm, very sweet. “So long as you can beat him, even I am yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen the door and outside you would see a long hallway, so long that it seemed one could never reach the end. Gongzi Yu had already opened the door, walked out, then turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, come with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo didn’t follow Fu Hongxue out. Now, they had reached the end of this hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the hallways was another flower-carved wooden door. It was exquisite but solemn. Within was a spacious grand hall. There was an enormous stone platform, with four enormous torches lit in each of the four corners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu slowly went onto the platform. Standing in the middle of the platform, he said, “This is where we shall fight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Excellent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA perfectly smooth stone platform. Brilliant torchlight. No matter where you stood, no matter where you faced, everything was the same. There wasn’t even a hint of wind in the room. The preparations you made while striking, or the speed of your strike, definitely wouldn’t be interfered with by any outside factors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu clearly didn’t want to gain any unfair advantages from the weather or the terrain. For a person to do this much was already a very rare thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were three large and comfortable chairs on each of the two sides of the stone platform. Every chair was precisely seven feet away from the stone platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “When we fight, only six people can be allowed to watch. They will also be the witnesses to our duel. You may choose any three people you please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “No need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “When experts fight, victory and defeat are often determined in a very brief period of time. With your own friends watching on the side, you would feel a bit more at ease. Why would you give up this right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because I have no friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu stared at him, then said, “It’s best if you keep this right. If the people whom I bring make you feel uncomfortable, you have the right to reject them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Very good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “You’ve been exhausted, day after day. You can’t help but not be as vigorous, as alert as you normally would be. It’s better if you rest here for some time. Thus, I will allow you to choose the day of our battle as well!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue hesitated, then said, “How about tomorrow, at this time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Very good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Then tomorrow, I will come again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “No need to leave. I have already prepared a room and a change of clothes for you here. You can rest in peace. There will definitely be no one who will come to disturb you. If you have any needs, we can carry them out for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “It seems this really will be a very fair duel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “It definitely will be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I imagine you have already prepared my coffin as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu actually did not deny it. “It’s an excellent coffin made of nanmu wood. I had it specially imported here from Liuzhou. If you want to take a look at it, I can take you there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Have you seen it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “I’ve seen it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You are satisfied with it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu said, “Very satisfied.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue dully said, “Then that’ll be all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongzi Yu’s reaction was even more flat. “Right now, perhaps the only thing you wish to see is your bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaudy, beautiful velvet curtains blocked the rays of the sun. The room as as dark as dusk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom outside, the dull, monotonous sound of a sword being drawn could once more be heard. Fu Hongxue was totally awake and clear-minded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, he had actually fallen asleep. He hadn’t been woken up by the sound of the sword. He suddenly woke up because someone had appeared in the room. A tall and slender human shadow, leaning against the window, back towards him. Beneath her soft silk gown, one could vaguely see her slender waist and limbs, and her perfectly straight legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that Fu Hongxue had woken up, but did not turn around. Instead, she lightly let out a sigh, then slowly said, “Another day has passed. Day after day, year after year. When will this sort of life end?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA noble, graceful voice. A gentle, exquisite posture. And yet, it carried an indescribable sense of weariness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue did not react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo slowly continued, “Perhaps you feel that I shouldn’t have come at all. After all, I am still his wife, but I truly am too tired of this life, and therefore…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Therefore, you hope that I can defeat him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Right. I do hope you can defeat him. After all these years, you are the only person who has a chance to defeat him. Only after you defeat him can my life change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “The victor will get everything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Absolutely everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Even his wife is included?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue suddenly laughed coldly. “Since you aren’t a good wife, there’s no need for him to risk it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “But he still wishes to prove he is stronger than you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue coldly said, “Prove it to who? Can it be that there is another master here who controls his life? Can it be that he is doing this because he simply does not have any room to choose otherwise?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo suddenly turned her head and fixed him with her stare. Her beautiful eyes were filled with shock. After a long time, she finally sighed, then said, “Why would you think these sorts of thoughts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “If you were me, what would you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “At the very least, I wouldn’t think crazy thoughts like you are doing right now. I would focus all of my thoughts on how to defeat him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slowly walked over, her limbs and her waist soft, her eyes like a pool of water. “Although I cannot be considered a good wife, I am still a very good woman. You should be able to see this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo lightly let out a sigh. “Why don’t you take a look now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she finished these words, the soft silk clothes on her body fell down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s breath stopped. He couldn’t help but admit that this was the most beautiful, flawless body he had ever seen in his life. A tall, noble woman, suddenly baring everything in front of you. This sort of temptation is all the more difficult for people to resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe quietly stood at the head of the bed, staring at him. “As long as you can win this battle, everything will be yours. But right now, it isn’t yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s pallid face had already flushed red. He knew the changes which were going on in his body. He also knew that she must have noticed as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beautiful dusk. The room was so quiet, yet filled with the graceful aroma which her body emitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a man, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she suddenly lifted up her clothes, gliding out like a swallow. As she walked out the door, she suddenly turned and laughed, “Right now, I’m not yours yet. But if you need it, I can find someone else to accompany you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue tightened his fist. He suddenly asked, “Is Zhuo Yuzhen here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Bring her here. Immediately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked, Madame Zhuo stared at him. It seemed as though even in her wildest dreams, she had never imagined he would make this request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue coldly said, “You just said, if there is anything I need, you can provide it for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo laughed again. It seemed as though her laughter was filled with an indescribable sort of cunning. “Why do you insist on her? Why don’t you choose Mingyue Xin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s body suddenly went stiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said leisurely, “You didn’t imagine that she would still be alive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Zhuo said, “She’s here. Do you want me to bring her here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face suddenly sunk. She coldly said, “I know you don’t want me to. You want Zhuo Yuzhen. You’ve always liked despicable, diabolical girls like her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a slamming sound, the door closed heavily. This time, when she left, she didn’t look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did she suddenly turn so impulsive and angry? Just because Fu Hongxue wanted Zhuo Yuzhen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beautiful, cunning, yet level-headed woman, usually wouldn’t become angry over something like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was still quietly lying on his bed. That shrill, abrupt sound was still going on nonstop. The other was paying such a high price for this battle. If he were to become annoyed over a woman, wouldn’t that be silly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he couldn’t help but think of Mingyue Xin. If she really still had not died, and had fallen into the hands of these people, she might have met with a fate more miserable than death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly when he thought of this did he suddenly realize that it had been a long, long time since he had thought of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA person would always try to avoid thinking about things which made him feel guilty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the night was deep and dark. The room was totally black. From outside, there was a sound of knocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is miss Zhuo, miss Zhuo Yuzhen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo serving girls helped Zhuo Yuzhen walk in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had made herself up beautifully. Her beautiful black hair was adorned with pearl ornaments, and a beautiful scarlet red cloak covered her, dragging on the ground. She looked almost like the legendary beauty who was given away for a marriage treaty, Wang Zhaojun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, she obviously did not need to continue the pretense of being so pitiable. She coldly stared at Fu Hongxue. Her face was expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe serving girls put down the lantern. They giggled, then quietly crept away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen suddenly coldly said, “Did you ask me to come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “To get revenge on me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I asked you to come, originally because I had a few questions I wanted to talk to you about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “And now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “And now, I don’t want to ask anymore. So you can go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “You don’t want to get revenge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “You don’t want me to go to your bed either?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue closed his mouth. He didn’t actually blame her. For her to say these words wasn’t very surprising either. For women like her, when they were no longer capable of harming others with their actions, they would use poisonous words to harm instead. She hurt others, perhaps only to protect herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t blame her, but he suddenly felt very tired. He only hoped that she would leave quickly, and that they would never meet again. He suddenly realized that nothing else was important. Only tomorrow’s battle was important. He needed to defeat the man who was still practicing drawing his sword at this very moment. Only after defeating this person could he solve all of the mysteries, could he see Mingyue Xin again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Zhuo Yuzhen stubbornly stood there, staring at him. Her eyes were filled with grief and hatred. She suddenly said, “Since you don’t care about me at all, why did you insist on me coming?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Even if I shouldn’t have asked you to come, you can still leave now, just the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “It’s not the same anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “How is it not the same?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “It’s not the same, it’s not the same…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as though she hadn’t even heard Fu Hongxue’s question. From her lips, that phrase simply continued without stopping. Who knows how many times she said it? Suddenly, her tears began to flow down her cheeks. Her body fell down as well. The scarlet red cape fluttered open, revealing a scarlet, blood-like color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was real blood. Fresh blood had already dyed her bare torso scarlet. On her entire body, there wasn’t a single part of her body that was whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue jumped up, but his heart had already sunk down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen ground her teeth. “By now, you should understand why it’s not the same anymore…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because I asked you to come, she tortured you like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen chuckled. “Actually, you should have realized long ago that although she didn’t want you to touch her, she didn’t want you to touch any other women, because…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer laughter was even more tragic than crying. She wanted to continue to speak, but could no longer say another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was still asking. “Why? Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen chuckled again. Her eyes lifted up. A strong medicinal smell wafted up from her cloak. Her death wasn’t very painful, because her entire body had already been numbed by madame Zhuo’s medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupposedly, in far away Africa, in the fertile muds of the Nile river, there is a beautiful yet strange flower called the ‘opium’ poppy. Not only could it numb a person’s body, it could also numb a person’s soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome women were just like that flower. The blood flowing within her noble, graceful body, was actually more venomous than the flowers of opium poppies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did she do this? Just because she didn’t want Fu Hongxue to touch another woman?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had only known Fu Hongxue for less than half a day. Why would she be so wildly jealous of him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could there be jealousy without love? How could there be love between people who had only known each other for half a day?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue slowly stood up. He slowly walked over, then gently opened the door. If the door had been bolted from the outside, if the door had been made of iron, he wouldn’t have been surprised. He was already mentally prepared. No matter what happened, no matter what the situation, he was prepared to endure it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnexpectedly, with a light push, the door swung open. There was nobody outside the door, and there was nobody in the long hallway. There was only that monotonous, abrupt sound of a sword being drawn, still continuing without pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed towards the direction of this sound. The hallway was long but winding. There was a long distance between each room. After an unknown number of twists and turns, he finally saw a door. Inside the door, it was quiet. There was no one inside. There also was not the sound of a sword being drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still pushed the door open and went inside. He had once again arrived at the room he had just left. Zhuo Yuzhen, who had been in a pool of blood, had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was still peaceful. Although a person was missing from it, a full table of dishes had been added to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to eat dinner. Six exquisite dishes, all still warm, and a bamboo plate with small steamed buns on it. A pot of polished white rice, and a vat of not-yet-opened wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, he really needed to drink a little wine, but he left again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hallway was the same, and as quiet as before. But his walking style had already changed. Originally, he walked very slowly. Now, he walked a bit faster. Originally, he was walking to the right; this time, he walked to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another unknown number of twists and turns, he once again saw a door. The room inside was still quiet. The carvings on the door were exactly the same as well. Only, when he left earlier, he hadn’t closed the door, while this door was shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed the door open and walked in. He had already warned himself three times to be steady and keep calm. But once he entered the room, he couldn’t help but feel very unwell, because he once again saw that table of dishes. He once again had entered the room he had just left. The dishes were still warm. They seemed even warmer than they were earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut beneath the vat of wine, there was a short note. The writing was very delicate. Clearly, it was a woman’s handwriting!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The bright moon never had a heart. Why search for the moon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little drink can help you sleep soundly. Why don’t you drink alone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue sat down. He had to force himself to sit down, because he had discovered that regardless of how he walked, the result was the same. He would still come back here, would still see that table filled with dishes which seemed to never grow cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also wanted to force himself to eat a bit, but as soon as he lifted up his chopsticks, he found that something was amiss. Of the six dishes earlier, one dish had been squirrel and yellow croaker, while another was sweet and sour spareribs. Although he had only taken one look, he remembered it very clearly. He was always very sensitive to the sour taste of vinegar as well, but now, all six of the dishes were vegetarian. The full pot of rice had turned into a full pot of porridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also finally realized that this room wasn’t the room he had just left. Not only was every room here identical, the utensils and the furniture were identical as well. Even he couldn’t tell if the room he originally was in was this one, or the previous one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bedding on the bed was in a mess. Clearly, someone had slept here. Was the person who had been sleeping on this bed earlier him, or someone else? If it wasn’t him, who was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat type of people lived in this mysterious, strange place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-21\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-23\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/tymyd/tymyd-chapter-22","bookId":1505,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:33:00 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:33:00 AM"}
