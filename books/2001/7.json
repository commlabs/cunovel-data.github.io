Slowly, meticulously, I lifted up my fingers, one by one. There were faint pink indents from the bracelet pressing into my skin. For the last five years, I only took the bracelet off at night and when I showered. Those indents would probably be permanent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like the jagged scar the bracelet hid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI removed my hand completely. The two inch stretch of a deeper pink slashed down the very center of my wrist, over the vein. It had been a deep cut made with broken glass from the picture frame I’d thrown after the first picture had circulated the high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I’d made that cut, it had been the lowest point of my life and I hadn’t been joking around. There would’ve been a matching violent cut on my right wrist if it hadn’t been for the maid hearing the glass break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture had been of me and my best friend; the very same best friend who had been one of the first to turn their back and whisper words like ‘whore’ and ‘liar.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had wanted to end it then. Just check out, because at that point in my life, nothing could’ve been worse than what had happened to me, what my parents had agreed to, and the subsequent fallout. In a matter of months, my life had utterly separated into two ragged chunks: before and after. And I hadn’t been able to see a possible after when the entire school got behind Blaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow? The after seemed endless, but shame burned like a low fire in my belly as I stared at the scar. Suicide was never the answer and if anything, checking out was letting all of them win. I’d learned the lesson all by myself since therapy had never been an option. My parents would’ve rather cut off their legs than suffer through the embarrassment of having a daughter that had tried to commit suicide and needed therapy. More money had exchanged hands to keep my afternoon hospital run quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently my parents were okay with having a daughter labeled a lying whore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I hated seeing the physical embodiment of my weakness, would be beyond humiliated if anyone ever saw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSudden deep laughter from the hallway drew my attention—Cam’s laughter. My head swiveled toward the kitchen. On the stove, the clock read near one in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tugged my sleeve down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t you skip it Friday night?” a feminine voice asked, slightly muffled through the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause and then I heard Cam say, “You know I can’t, sweetheart. Maybe next time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweetheart? Oh! I heard their footsteps round the railing outside the apartment, hitting the stairwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRushing around the couch, I made my way over to the window. Since my apartment was at the end and overlooking the parking lot, all I had to do was wait. And then there they were, a shirtless Cam and a girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA really tall, leggy brunette wearing a cute denim skirt. That was all I could make out from the window as they crossed the parking lot. The girl stumbled but caught herself before Cam had to intervene. They stopped behind a dark colored sedan. I felt like a total peeper watching them, but I was riveted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam said something and laughed when the girl playfully shoved his shoulder. A second later, they hugged and then he stepped back, giving her a little wave before turning back to the apartment building. Halfway back, he glanced up toward our floor, and I jumped back like a total idiot. He couldn’t see me. There was no way without any lights on in my apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed at myself and then quieted when I heard a door shut down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief poured into me, easing the muscles that had been tightening on and off. Seeing him with another girl was… good. Totally reaffirmed the fact that Cam was a very charming, harmless flirt who like to hand out cookies to pretty girls and had a pet tortoise named Raphael. That was good. That was doable. I could handle that because what Brittany and Jacob were suggesting made me itchy and antsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Cam and I would become friends. I was okay with that because it was nice to have more friends like before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I climbed into bed and laid awake, staring at the ceiling, for a moment, a really brief moment, I wondered what it would be like if Cam had been interested in me like that. To have something like that to look forward to. To be giddy and excited whenever he looked at me or when our hands accidentally touched. I wondered what it would be like to be interested in him like that or any guy for that matter. To look forward to dates, to first kisses and all the things that came after that. I bet it would be nice. It would be like before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Blaine Fitzgerald had taken all of that away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStorm clouds were rolling in Thursday morning and it looked like it would be a rainy, cruddy day on campus. Luckily I only had two classes to sloth through, so before I headed out, I grabbed a hoodie and slipped it over my shirt. I thought about changing out of my shorts and flip flops, but decided I was feeling way too lazy to go to that much trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTexting Jacob to see if he wanted me to pick up any coffee before I hit art class, I slipped out of my apartment and made it to the stairwell before Cam’s apartment door flew open and a guy came out, pulling a shirt down over his head. His shaggy, shoulder length blond head poked through, and I recognized him as the guy with Cam’s tortoise—the roommate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment our eyes met, a big smile broke out across his tan face, exposing a row of ultra white teeth. “Hey! I’ve seen you before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze flicked behind him. He’d left the door wide open. “Hey, you are… tortoise guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfusion flickered across his face as his sandals smacked off the cement. “Tortoise guy? Oh, yeah.” He laughed, the skin crinkling around his brown eyes. “You saw me with Raphael, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “And I think you called yourself Señor Fucktard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting out another loud laugh, he joined me on the stairs. “That’s my drinking name. Most days people know me as Ollie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That sounds much better than Señor Fucktard.” I smiled as we rounded the fourth floor landing. “I’m—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Avery?” When my eyes widened, he gave a toothy grin. “Cam told me your name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. So… um, you’re heading to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yo douchebag, you left the door open!” Cam’s voice boomed down the stairwell and a second later, he appeared at the top of the stairs, the black baseball cap on. A lopsided grin appeared as he spotted us and bounded down the steps. “Hey, what are you doing with my girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy girl? What? I almost tripped over my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was explaining to her how I go by two names.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah?” Cam dropped an arm over my shoulders, and my flip flop snagged in the back of my other one. His arm tightened, pulling me to his side. “Whoa, sweetheart, almost lost you there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at you.” Ollie hopped down the steps. “Got the girl tripping all over her feet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam chuckled as he reached up with his free hand and slid the cap around backward. “I can’t help it. It’s my magnetic charm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or it could be your smell,” Ollie retorted. “I’m not sure I heard a shower this morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gasped in mocked outrage. “Do I smell bad, Avery?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You smell great,” I murmured, feeling my face heat. It was the truth, though. He smelled wonderful—a mixture of fresh linen, faint cologne, and something else that was probably all him. “I mean, you don’t smell bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam watched me for almost a moment too long. “Heading to class?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were walking down the steps, but his arm was still around my shoulders and the entire side of my body seemed to tingle like it had fallen asleep. He was so… casual about it. Like it was nothing to him and it probably wasn’t. I remembered how he and the girl had hugged last night, but to me, it was….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Avery?” Cam’s voice lowered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiggled free, and saw the way Ollie’s grin spread. I headed down the stairs, needing distance. “Yeah, I’m heading to art. What about you guys?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam easily caught up with me on the third floor. “We’re going out to breakfast. You should skip and join us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I’ve done enough skipping this week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m skipping,” Ollie announced, “but Cam doesn’t have a class until this afternoon, so he’s a good boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re a bad boy?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOllie’s grin was contagious. “Oh, I’m a bad, bad boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam shot his friend a look. “Yeah, as in bad at spelling, math, english, cleaning up after yourself, talking to people, and I could go on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’m good at the things that count.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what are those things?” Cam asked as we exited the building. Outside the air carried the faint scent of dampness and the clouds looked plump with water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOllie jogged out in front of us and turned so that he was facing us as he walked backward, completely ignoring the red truck trying to back up. He held up a tanned hand and started ticking off his fingers. “Drinking, socializing, snowboarding, and soccer—remember that sport, Cam? Soccer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe easy grin slipped off Cam’s face. “Yeah, I remember it, asshole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOllie just laughed and turned, heading toward where the silver truck was parked. I glanced up at Cam, curious. He stared straight ahead, jaw set and eyes like chips of ice. Without looking down at me, he shoved his hands into his jeans and said, “See you around, Avery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, he joined Ollie over at his truck, and I’d swear the temperature dropped to match the sudden coolness in Cam’s attitude. Didn’t take a genius or an overly intuitive person to figure out that Ollie had touched on a sore spot and Cam hadn’t been in the mood to elaborate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShivering, I hurried to my car and jumped in. Not a second too soon as a big, fat raindrop splatted against the windshield. As I backed out, I glanced over, my eyes finding them. Both guys were standing by the bed of the truck, Ollie smiling and Cam with the same distant, rigid set to his expression as he spoke. Whatever he was telling his friend, he wasn’t happy about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea how I let Cam talk me into him driving and not taking two cars during class, but Saturday night—the night of our assignment—just before dusk, I found myself climbing into the massive silver truck. My stomach had been in knots since Friday night, when Jacob started hounding me about the party he and Brittany were going to. It had been good-natured and I wanted to go, but couldn’t bring myself to really do it. Besides, I had no idea where the house was, it had been late when he’d started texting, and it had been storming again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I was as nervous as a mouse in a room full of hungry cats. As lame as this was, I’d never been in a car with a guy before. Man, even admitting that to myself sounded incredibly pathetic. Like take that little secret to my grave level of pathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam shoved the keys into the ignition as he glanced over at me. The baseball cap was on again, twisted backward. Behind the thick lashes, his eyes glimmered a bright azure. “Ready steady?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wait-for-you-wait-for-you-1/page-7.html","bookId":2001,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM"}
