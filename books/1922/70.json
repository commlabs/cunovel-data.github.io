There was a pause then, \"Is everything all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristopher. I felt awkward being unable to turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Gideon said smoothly, coolly in control. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my horror, he resumed the push and withdrawal of his finger. Not with the deep strokes of before, but slow shallow thrusts that didn\u0027t disturb my skirts. Already aroused to a fever pitch and hovering on the verge of orgasm, my nails dug into his neck. The tension in my body from having Christopher in the room only ramped up the erotic sensations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva?\" Christopher asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed hard. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon adjusted his stance, which moved his c**k inside me and bumped his pelvis against my pulsing clit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Y-yes. We\u0027re just...talking. About. Dinner.\" My eyes closed as Gideon\u0027s fingertip grazed the thin wall separating his penis from his touch. If he nudged my cl*t again, I\u0027d come. I was too wound up to stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon\u0027s chest vibrated against my cheek as he spoke. \"We\u0027d be done sooner if you\u0027d go, so tell me what you need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom\u0027s looking for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Gideon shifted again, rocking into my cl*t at the same moment he gave a quick, deep thrust of his finger into my rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cl**axed. Afraid of the wail of pleasure that wanted out of me, I sank my teeth into Gideon\u0027s hard pectoral. He grunted softly and started coming, his c**k jerking as it pumped thick spurts of scorching se**n into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the conversation was lost beneath the roar of my blood. Christopher said something, Gideon replied, and then the door shut again. I was lifted to sit on the armrest and Gideon started thrusting between my spread thighs, using my body to rub out the rest of his orgasm, growling in my mouth as we finished off the rawest, most exhibitionistic sexual encounter of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, Gideon led me by the hand to a bathroom, where he lightly soaped a washcloth and cleansed between my legs before he paid the same attention to his cock. The way he took care of me was sweetly intimate, demonstrating yet again that as primal as his desire for me was, I was precious to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want us to fight anymore,\" I said quietly from my perch on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed the washcloth down a concealed laundry chute and refastened his fly. Then he came to me, brushing his cool fingertips down my cheek. \"We don\u0027t fight, angel. We just have to learn not to scare the hell out of each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make it sound so easy,\" I grumbled. To call either of us virgins would be ridiculous, yet emotionally that\u0027s just what we were. Fumbling in the dark and too eager, completely out of our depths and self-conscious, trying to impress and missing all the subtle nuances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy or hard, doesn\u0027t matter. We\u0027ll get through this because we have to.\" He pushed his fingers through my hair, restoring order to the disheveled strands. \"We\u0027ll discuss when we get home. I think I\u0027ve discovered the crux of our problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis conviction and determination soothed the restlessness I\u0027d been feeling the last few days. Closing my eyes, I relaxed and enjoyed the tactile delight of having my hair played with. \"Your mother seemed startled that I\u0027m a blonde.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother was, too. Not about me being a blonde,\" I qualified. \"That you\u0027d be interested in one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gideon!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm?\" He kissed the end of my nose and ran his hands down my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not the type you usually go for, am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brow arched. \"I have one type: Eva Lauren Tramell. That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. \"Okay. Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it matter? You\u0027re the woman I\u0027m with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m just curious. People don\u0027t usually stray from their preferred type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping between my legs, he put his arms around my hips. \"Lucky for me that I fit your type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gideon, you don\u0027t fit any type,\" I drawled. \"You\u0027re in a class by yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes sparkled. \"Like what you see, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I do, which is why we really should get out of here before we start screwing like minks again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing his cheek to mine, he murmured, \"Only you could blow my mind in a place that\u0027s always made my skin crawl. Thank you for being exactly what I want and need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Gideon.\" I wrapped my arms and legs around him, holding him as close to me as possible. \"You came here for me, didn\u0027t you? To take me away from this place you hate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d walk into hell for you, Eva, and this is pretty damn close.\" He exhaled harshly. \"I was about to go to your apartment and drag you away with me when I learned you\u0027d come here. You have to stay away from Christopher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you keep saying that? He seems very nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon pulled back, sifting my hair through his fingers. His eyes stayed fiercely locked to mine. \"He takes sibling rivalry to the extreme, and he\u0027s unstable enough to make him dangerous. He\u0027s reaching out to you because he knows he can hurt me through you. You have to trust me on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was Gideon so suspicious of his half-brother\u0027s motives? He had to have a good reason. It was yet another thing he didn\u0027t fully share with me. \"I do trust you. Of course I do. I\u0027ll keep my distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Catching me by the waist, he lifted me off the counter and set me on my feet. \"Let\u0027s grab Cary and get the hell out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe made our way back outside with my hand in his. I was uncomfortably aware that we\u0027d been gone a very long time. The sun was going down. And I was panty-less. My ruined boy shorts were presently stuffed into the front pocket of Gideon\u0027s jeans. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-70.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
