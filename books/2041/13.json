I was already up, being an early riser, but Jill rolled over in bed and put her pillow over her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make it stop,\" she groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI answered and found Eddie on the other end of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m downstairs,\" he said. \"Ready to practice some self-defense before it gets too hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to have to do it without me,\" I said. I had a feeling Eddie was taking his promise to Clarence about training us very seriously. I felt no such obligation. \"I\u0027ve got a ton of homework to do. That, and I\u0027m sure Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s going to make me do a coffee run today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then send Jill down,\" said Eddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over to the cocoon of blankets on her bed. \"That might be easier said than done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, she managed to rouse herself enough to brush her teeth, take aspirin for a headache, and throw on some workout clothes. She bid me farewell, and I promised to check on them later. Not long after that, Ms. Terwilliger called with her coffee demand, and I prepared myself for another day of trying to fit in my own work with hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove over to Spencer\u0027s and didn\u0027t even notice Trey until I was standing right in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s?\" he asked, pointing to the caramel sauce cappuccino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" I looked up. Trey was my cashier. \"You work here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Gotta make spending money somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed him some cash, noting that he\u0027d charged me half price. \"Don\u0027t take this the wrong way, but you don\u0027t look so great,\" I told him. He looked tired and worn out around the edges. Closer inspection showed bruises and cuts as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, I had kind of a rough day yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. That was a leading comment, but there was no one in line behind me. \"What happened?\" I asked, knowing it was expected. Trey scowled. \"That asshole Greg Slade wreaked havoc in football tryouts yesterday. I mean, the results aren\u0027t up yet, but it\u0027s pretty obvious he\u0027s going to get quarterback. He was like a machine, just plowing guys over.\" He extended his left hand, which had some bandage-wrapped fingers. \"He stepped on my hand too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced, remembering Slade\u0027s out-of-control athleticism in PE. The politics of high school football and who was quarterback weren\u0027t that important to me. True, I felt sorry for Trey, but it was the source behind the tattoos that intrigued me. Keith\u0027s warnings about not causing trouble rang back to me, but I was unable to stop myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know about the tattoos,\" I said. \"Julia and Kristin told me about them. And I get now why you were suspicious of mine - but it\u0027s not what you think. Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I\u0027ve heard. Most people think you\u0027re just saying that because you don\u0027t want to tell where you got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a little taken aback by that. I was pretty sure Julia and Kristin had believed me. Were they actually spreading around the opposite? \"I had no idea.\" He shrugged, a small smile on his lips. \"Don\u0027t worry. I believe you. There\u0027s something kind of naively charming about you. You don\u0027t seem like the cheating type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I scolded. \"I\u0027m not naive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a compliment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have these tattoos been around?\" I asked, deciding it was best to move in. \"I heard since last year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed me my coffee, thinking. \"Yeah, but it was the end of last year. School year, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they come from a placed called Nevermore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As far as I know.\" Trey eyed me suspiciously. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just curious,\" I said sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of college kids dressed like rich hobos got in line behind me and regarded us impatiently. \"Can we get some service here?\" Trey gave them a stiff smile and then rolled his eyes at me as I moved away. \"See you around, Melbourne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed back to Amberwood and delivered Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s coffee. I wasn\u0027t in the mood to stay leashed to her all day, so I asked if I could go elsewhere if I kept my cell phone handy. She agreed. The library had too much activity and - ironically - noise for me today. I wanted the solitude of my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I was cutting across the lawn to catch the shuttle, I spotted some familiar figures behind a cluster of trees. I changed direction and found Jill and Eddie squaring off in a small clearing. Micah sat cross-legged on the ground, watching avidly. He waved at me as I approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t realize your brother was a kung-fu master,\" he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not kung fu,\" said Eddie gruffly, never taking his eyes off Jill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same difference,\" said Micah. \"It\u0027s still pretty badass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie feinted, like he was going to strike at Jill\u0027s side. She responded fairly quickly with a block, though not quite fast enough to match him. Had he been serious, he would have hit her. Still, he seemed pleased with her response time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. That would deflect part of a hit, though you\u0027d still feel it. Best is if you can duck and dodge altogether, but that takes a little more work.\" Jill nodded obediently. \"When can we work on that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie regarded her with pride. That expression softened after a few moments of study. \"Not today. Too much sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill started to protest and then stopped herself. She had that worn-out-from-the-light look again and was sweating heavily. She glanced up at the sky for a moment, as though begging it to give us some cloud cover. It remained unresponsive, so she nodded at Eddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. But we\u0027re doing this tomorrow at the same time? Or earlier maybe. Or maybe tonight! Could we do both? Practice tonight when the sun\u0027s going down and then again in the morning? Would you mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie grinned, amused at her enthusiasm. \"Whatever you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling back, Jill sat down beside me, getting into as much shade as possible. Eddie regarded me expectantly. \"What?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you supposed to learn to throw a punch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scoffed. \"No. When would I ever need to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill nudged me. \"Do it, Sydney!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly, I allowed Eddie to give me a quick lesson on throwing a punch without injuring my hand in the process. I barely paid attention and felt like I was mostly providing entertainment for the others. When Eddie finished with me, Micah asked, \"Hey, would you mind showing me some ninja moves too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have nothing to do with ninjas,\" protested Eddie, still smiling. \"Come on up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah leapt to his feet, and Eddie walked him through some rudimentary steps. More than anything, it seemed like Eddie was sizing up Micah and his capabilities. After a while, Eddie grew comfortable and let Micah practice some offensive moves to get rid of an attacker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" protested Jill when Eddie landed a kick on Micah. Micah shrugged it off in a guy kind of way. \"No fair. You wouldn\u0027t hit me when we were practicing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie was caught off guard enough that Micah actually got a hit in. Eddie gave him a look of grudging respect and then said to Jill, \"That was different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m a girl?\" she demanded. \"You never held back with Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Rose?\" asked Micah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another friend,\" explained Eddie. To Jill, he said: \"And Rose has had years more experience than you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s had more than Micah too. You were going easy on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie flushed and kept his eyes on Micah. \"Was not,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were too,\" she muttered. As the boys sparred again, she said quietly to me, \"How am I ever going to learn if he\u0027s afraid of breaking me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the guys, analyzing what I knew of Eddie so far. \"I think it\u0027s more complicated than that. I think he also just believes you shouldn\u0027t have to take the risk - that if he\u0027s doing a good enough job, you shouldn\u0027t have to defend yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s doing a great job. You should have seen him at the attack.\" Her face got that haunted look it did whenever the attack that had driven her into hiding was mentioned. \"But I still need to learn.\" She lowered her voice even more. \"I really want to learn to use my magic to fight too, not that I\u0027ll get much practice in this desert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered, recalling her display from the night before. \"There\u0027ll be time,\" I said vaguely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up, saying I had to go get some work done. Micah asked Eddie and Jill if they wanted to get lunch. Eddie said yes immediately. Jill looked to me for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just lunch,\" said Eddie meaningfully. I knew he still thought Micah was harmless. I didn\u0027t know, but after seeing how infatuated Jill was with Lee, I figured Micah would have to make some pretty aggressive moves to get anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s fine,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill looked relieved, and the group headed off. I spent the day finishing off that miserable book for Ms. Terwilliger. I still thought having to copy the archaic spells and rituals verbatim was a waste of time. The only point I could see for it was that if she ever did need to reference them for her research, she would have an easy computer file to check and not risk damage to the ancient book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was evening by the time I finished that and my other homework. Jill still wasn\u0027t back, and I decided to use the opportunity to check on something that had been bothering me. Earlier in the day, Jill had mentioned Eddie defending her in the attack. I\u0027d felt from the beginning that there was something strange about that initial attack, something that they weren\u0027t telling me. So, I logged onto the Alchemists\u0027 network and pulled up everything we had on the Moroi rebels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, it was all documented. We had to keep track of important events among the Moroi, and this ranked pretty high. Somehow, the Alchemists had gotten pictures of the Moroi Court, with protesters lined up outside one of the administrative buildings. Dhampir guardians were easy to pick out as they mingled and kept order. To my surprise, I recognized Dimitri Belikov - Rose\u0027s boyfriend - among those doing crowd control. He was easy to spot since he was almost always taller than everyone around him. Dhampirs look very human, and even I could admit that he was pretty good-looking. There was a rugged handsomeness to him, and even in a still photograph, I could see a fierceness as he watched the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther protest pictures confirmed what I knew. By far, most people supported the young queen. Those against her were a minority - but a loud and dangerous one. A video from a human news show in Denver showed two Moroi guys nearly getting in a bar fight. They were shouting about queens and justice, most of which wouldn\u0027t make sense to a human observer. What made this video special was that the guy who\u0027d filmed it - some random human with a cell phone camera - claimed he\u0027d seen fangs on both men in the argument. The videographer had submitted his recording claiming he\u0027d witnessed a vampire fight, but no one gave it much credibility. It was too grainy for anything to show up. Still, it was a reminder of what could happen if the Moroi situation spun out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA status check showed me that Queen Vasilisa was indeed trying to get a law passed so that her rule was no longer dependent on there being at least one other person in her royal family. Alchemist experts guessed it would take three months, which was about what Rose had said. The number loomed in my head like a ticking time bomb. We needed to keep Jill safe for three months. And for three months, Vasilisa\u0027s enemies would be trying harder than ever to get to Jill. If Jill died, Vasilisa\u0027s rule would end - along with her attempts to fix the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet none of this was what had really driven me to research. I wanted to know about Jill\u0027s initial attack, the one that no one talked about. What I found wasn\u0027t much help. No Alchemists had been there at the time, of course, so our information was based on what Moroi sources had reported. All we knew was that \"the queen\u0027s sister had been viciously and severely attacked - but had made a full recovery.\" From what I\u0027d observed, that was certainly true. Jill showed no signs of injury, and the attack had occurred a week before she came to Palm Springs. Was that enough time to heal from a \"vicious and severe\" attack? And was an attack like that enough to make her wake screaming?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know but still couldn\u0027t shake my suspicions. When Jill came home later, she was in such a good mood that I couldn\u0027t bear to interrogate her. I also remembered too late that I\u0027d meant to research the case of Clarence\u0027s niece and her bizarre death by throat-slitting. Jill\u0027s situation had distracted me. I let the matter go and called it an early night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow, I thought drowsily. I\u0027ll do it all tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow came much more quickly than I expected. I was woken out of a heavy sleep by someone shaking me, and for a split second, the old nightmare was there, the one about Alchemists carrying me away in the night. Recognizing Jill, I just barely stopped myself from screaming. \"Hey, hey,\" I scolded. There was light outside, but it was purplish. Barely after sunrise. \"What\u0027s going on? What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill looked at me, face grim and eyes wide with fear. \"It\u0027s Adrian. You have to rescue him.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-13.html","bookId":2041,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:07 PM"}
