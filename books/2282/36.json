He keyed in the number on the alarm and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both stepped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy was mounting Firewalker, the great black horse. The dog, Robert, was barking and running around excitedly. Firewalker reared up, and Lucy spoke affectionately to the dog, ordering him back to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog obeyed, but stood by the house barking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Lucy leaned forward, speaking to the horse and nudging him with her heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horse broke into a canter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Firewalker and Lucy raced into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison felt Tyler’s hands on her shoulders. “Did you see that?” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does it mean?” Allison asked. It was chilly outside; she was dressed in a blue flannel nightshirt. Behind her, Tyler wore nothing but pajama pants. He had to be cold, but it seemed that he came closer to warm her. She felt the length of his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was distracting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven more distracting than a ghost who’d come to her bedroom and lured her down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did you see her? How did you see her?” Tyler asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I woke up. She was at the foot of my bed. She wanted me to follow her,” Allison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she wanted was to lean back in his arms. She wanted to trust him. She wanted to forget everything that was going on and even herself—to relish the feel of him and forget the world and indulge in nothing but sexual passion and pure carnal pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him swallow behind her. He stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad he been thinking along the same lines?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She wanted you to follow her, and she came out here—and mounted her horse and rode away,” he mused. “She still wants you to follow,” he said after a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison struggled to keep her thoughts where they should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t. I don’t have a ghost horse—or any horse—of my own, and if I did…I don’t know how to ride.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and saw that he was smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did she go when she left here?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know where she went—she carried secrets to the patriots at Valley Forge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “And where is that writer you’ve been emailing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Valley Forge,” she said, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucy wants you to go to Valley Forge,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, what’s up?” Logan had come down. He was wearing a robe—and he was armed and ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler quickly explained. Logan nodded. “Sounds like a field trip to me. But it’s three in the morning. I think you should wait until a normal hour and then go. That is, Allison, if the writer’s willing to see you. If he’s there. You don’t know, do you, if the man still lives in Valley Forge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We communicated not long ago. I don’t think he leaves that often, although he does participate in battle reenactments,” Allison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call him around nine,” Tyler suggested. “And if he’s agreeable, we’ll see him tomorrow. And even if he’s not…Lucy wants you to follow her. She rode to Valley Forge. That’s what we have to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The two of you can leave tomorrow. Jane can continue working with the likenesses and Kat will attend the autopsy. We’ll keep working the records from this angle, and Sean can monitor the house to see what goes on here in your absence. That is, if you’re willing to do all this, Allison?” Logan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoad trip! Alone with Tyler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a good idea. But necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt strangely weak and strong at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Allison?” Tyler prompted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to force herself not to smile. There was nothing to smile about. Two people were dead. They were just going on a research mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, of course,” she said primly. “I’ll do whatever it takes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the household—including Julian, who managed to look sleepy even though he was a ghost—had come outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison noticed that all the other Krewe members were armed. Everyone moved back into the house and gathered in the entry around the screens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ally?” Julian sounded concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine,” she assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t hear you move!” Julian said. “Am I supposed to sleep like that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you love to sleep when you were alive?” Kelsey asked him. “Did you keep late hours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, well, I was always burning the candle at both ends,” he said apologetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine, really. I followed Lucy of my own accord, and I ran the way I did because I didn’t want her to disappear,” Allison explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still, you should have gotten me first,” Tyler said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were right behind me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but you shouldn’t take off without me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t bring your gun,” Allison pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought he flushed slightly at that; he should have been armed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s why you should get me instead of making me bolt out to catch up with you,” Tyler grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s important that none of us go off on our own from now on,” Logan said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane yawned. “I could use some more sleep. Okay if I go back to bed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan nodded. “Go on up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to see what we caught on our digital film,” Sean said, walking over to take his seat by the screens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hit some keys on the computer keyboard, and they saw the film in reverse. Seconds later, it moved forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy appeared at the foot of the stairs as she had before. Then she looked into Angus Tarleton’s study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left the study and hurried up the stairs, where she entered Allison’s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reappeared a moment later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they saw Allison running out and, within a split second, Tyler bursting out of his room to follow her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do have good hearing,” Allison murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched as Lucy, followed by Allison and Tyler, raced to the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean reset the cameras. “The resemblance is really uncanny,” he commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison sighed. “I’m not a Tarleton or a Dandridge. My records prove it. I wasn’t adopted. In fact, my mom had me at the same hospital where Artie Dixon is now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, of course,” Tyler said thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You thinking what I’m thinking?” Logan asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler nodded, studying Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t adopted,” she said, shaking her head. She wasn’t angry, just amused. They were so determined to find a reason for the resemblance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Tyler agreed. “You weren’t adopted. But I’m willing to bet someone in your family was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll look for any possibility when we study the records while you’re gone,” Logan told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Adoption is wonderful, but I know that neither of my parents was adopted, either. One of my best friends in school was, and my dad used to tell her how fortunate she was that her parents had chosen her and loved her so much,” Allison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t thinking about your parents,” Tyler said. “I’m thinking further back. Much further back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” Allison asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean back to Lucy Tarleton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t go to Valley Forge today,” Kelsey told Tyler the next morning as he walked into the pantry to pour a cup of coffee after he’d showered and dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because we have an invitation,” Kelsey told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s easy to understand why you’ve forgotten,” Kelsey said with a wry grin. “Cherry Addison. Remember, yesterday, before all hell broke loose? She invited us to her husband’s showing. You could go to Valley Forge and we could go to the show, but I believe all our suspects will be there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Valley Forge is only about twenty miles north of the city,” Tyler said. “It’s a day trip for a lot of people visiting Philly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but what if you do find something there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler frowned. He wanted to get to Valley Forge, but seeing all the suspects in one place at one time was too good an opportunity to miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are they still having the show?” Tyler asked. “Sarah Vining died yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not enough to stop this, with the gallery set up and all the invitations sent out. Even if it conflicted with a funeral, which it won’t, I’m not sure the Addisons would have stopped it,” Kelsey said. “And at Kat’s request, they’re holding Julian’s and Sarah’s bodies for at least a few days, so…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey handed Tyler a cup of coffee. “Your call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What time is the showing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I called Mrs. Addison this morning. Cocktails and hors d’oeuvres at six. Her husband, George, the artist, will be there, of course, to meet with his adoring fans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand he’s good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll find out, won’t we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess so. Kat’s going back to the morgue, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey nodded. “I’m going to watch the house with Jane and Sean. Jane’s still working, but you’ll want to see the images she’s come up with so far. I’ve spelled Sean a few times. He’s equally convinced we’ve got to pay attention to the cameras—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We do,” Tyler interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Logan is going to the records office to see what he can discover.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” Tyler said. “I’m heading down to the police station to talk to Jenson. When Allison wakes up, will you tell her what’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will. Anything else you want her to know or do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ask her to print out the missing article—she believes she can find it online,” Tyler said. “And ask her to call Martin Standish and see if we can set something up for tomorrow.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-uninvited-krewe-of-hunters-8/page-36.html","bookId":2282,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:29 PM"}
