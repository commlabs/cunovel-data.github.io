And Penteney, junior, is the Major Penteney who takes such an interest in Lady Riversreade\u0027s Home—and in Lady Riversreade. As I suggested last night, he was a Territorial officer—so now he\u0027s back at his own job. Now then, Matherfield, let\u0027s arrange our plan of campaign. You, of course, have your official credentials—I\u0027m a deeply interested person, the man who chanced to witness Hannaford\u0027s death.

Matherfield was beginning to chafe when, at last, an elderly clerk conducted them up to an inner room wherein one cold-eyed, immobile-faced man sat at a desk, while another,, scarcely less stern in appearance, in whom Hetherwick immediately recognised the Major Penteney pointed out by Rhona, stood, hands in pockets, on the hearthrug. Each stared silently at the two callers; the man at the desk pointed to chairs on either side of his fortress. He looked at Matherfield.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Blenkinsop, I presume?\" began Matherfield, with a polite bow to the desk. \"And Mr. Penteney?\" with another to the hearthrug.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just so,\" agreed Blenkinsop. \"Precisely!

He picked up Hetherwick\u0027s card and glanced from it to its presenter. \"Mr. Guy Hetherwick,\" he remarked. \"Does Mr. Hetherwick also call on behalf of the police?

So, in his way, has Mr. Hetherwick. We\u0027re convinced that Hannaford was murdered by poison, and that whoever poisoned him also poisoned the man Granett at the same time. Now, as either you or some person—a client, I suppose—behind you is so much concerned in bringing Hannaford\u0027s murderer to justice as to offer a big sum for necessary information, we think you must know a great deal, and I suggest to you, gentlemen, that you ought to place your knowledge at our disposal.

As for Penteney, he maintained the same attitude which he had preserved ever since the visitors entered the room, lounging against the mantelpiece, hands in pockets, and his eyes alternately fixed on either Hetherwick or Matherfield. There was a brief silence; at last Blenkinsop spoke abruptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think we have anything to say,\" he said. \"What we have to say has been said already in the advertisement.

For example, gentlemen, there is the curious fashion in which this affair is mixed up with Lady Riversreade!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In spite of their evidently habitual practice of self-control, the two solicitors could not repress signs of astonishment.

I, too, believe that this Mrs. Whittingham is now Lady Riversreade, and I may tell you that I\u0027m in full possession of all the facts relating to the Sellithwaite affair—an affair of obtaining a diamond necklace, worth about four thousand pounds, by means of a worthless cheque, and——\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Blenkinsop suddenly rose from his chair, holding up a hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A moment, if you please!\" he said. \"Penteney,\" he continued, turning to his partner, \"a word with you in your room.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Matherfield glanced triumphantly after the retreating pair, and laughed when a door had closed on them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s got \u0027em, Mr. Hetherwick!\" he exclaimed. \"They see that we know more than they reckoned for.

And Blenkinsop immediately turned to his callers. His manner had changed; he looked now like a man who is anxious to get a settlement of a difficult question.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We have decided to talk freely to you,\" he said at once. \"That means, to tell you everything we know about this matter. You, Mr. Matherfield, as representing the police, will, of course, treat our communication confidentially. I needn\u0027t ask you, Mr. Hetherwick, to regard all that\u0027s said here, as—you know! Now, to begin with—just get one fact, an absolutely irrefutable fact, into your minds at once. Lady Riversreade is not the woman who was known as Mrs. Whittingham at Sellithwaite ten years ago, nor did Hannaford believe that she was either!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What?\" exclaimed Matherfield. \"But——\" he turned to Hetherwick. \"You hear that?\" he went on. \"Why, we know——\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let Mr. Blenkinsop go on,\" said Hetherwick quietly. \"He\u0027s explaining, I think.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just so,\" agreed Blenkinsop. \"And I\u0027m beginning by endeavouring to clear away a few mistaken ideas from your minds. Lady Riversreade is not Mrs. Whittingham. Hannaford did not think she was Mrs. Whittingham. It was not Lady Riversreade\u0027s portrait that Hannaford cut out of the paper.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hetherwick could not repress a start at that.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Whose was it, then?\" he demanded. \"For I certainly believed it was!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Blenkinsop stooped and drew out a drawer from his desk. From a bundle of documents he produced a newspaper, carefully folded and labelled. Opening this, he laid it before the two visitors, pointing to a picture marked with blue pencil. And Hetherwick at once saw that here was a duplicate of the portrait in his own pocket-book. But there was this important difference—while Hannaford had cut away the lettering under his picture, it was there in the one which Blenkinsop exhibited. He started again as he read it—Madame Anita Listorelle.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s the picture which Hannaford cut out of the paper,\" said Blenkinsop. \"It is not that of Lady Riversreade.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then it\u0027s that of a woman who\u0027s her double!\" exclaimed Matherfield. \"I\u0027ll lay anything that if you asked a hundred men who\u0027ve seen Lady Riversreade if that\u0027s her picture, they\u0027d swear it is!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I see,\" said Hetherwick, disregarding his companion\u0027s outburst, \"that this purports to be a portrait of a Madame Listorelle, who is described in the accompanying letterpress as a famous connoisseur of precious stones. Now, in relation to what we\u0027re discussing, may I ask a plain question?
