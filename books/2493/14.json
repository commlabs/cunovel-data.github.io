When did all this happen?\" Randi asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded. \"That\u0027s a great question. Looks like the Graysheets have been playing with transference and spacial issues for a long time. When they discovered this other world had been decimated by natural disaster, but the people that survived it... they appeared... resilient in a way that would not have been possible here. Evolutionary challenge,\" he shrugged, his emphasis on the last two words obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the dudes with the gills?\" Sophie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded. \"Them or someone like them. Whatever it was, it got them thinking that the genetic diversity within that gene pool would be a fine mix with the discovered markers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff studied John. \"Wait a sec, that\u0027s not all, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn\u0027s face kinda fell. \"No,\" he said quietly. \"It appears they\u0027ve manipulated their history as well. The Zondoraes wanted to acquire a fresher source so they used this Transference passage they named the Pathway. They manipulated it for both distance and... time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit!\" Bry said, slapping his forehead. \"So these clowns went back in time, screwed around with shit they shouldn\u0027t have, to what...?\" he looked at everyone, realization dawning, \"so they could \u0027grow people\u0027 for future advancement in our world? Now!? That\u0027s utter bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I call it, bro,\" Tiff said and they did a high five to clench the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh. I shook my head at the Weller pair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded. \"Pretty much. And,\" he raised his finger, \"they used electromagnetic pulse technology to construct the domes. It\u0027s really brilliant actually...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe rolled our eyes as John went into a lengthy discussion about the implementation of the most modern and environmentally intelligent choices for the dome people\u0027s daily living, steam-powered everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, they live in this sauna of a dome and don\u0027t have lights and showers and crap?\" Tiff asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn laughed and shook his head. \"No, I think they intended for them to live without interference for an indefinite time frame, then there would be degradation of the dome from some unknown cause, and the people of the domes would be gradually integrated into the outside, living in an environment which had recovered from whatever tragedy occurred years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a sec,\" I began slowly, \"there\u0027s some stuff that doesn\u0027t make sense.\" All eyes fell on me and Jade stood, molding her body to mine. \"Who caused the problem with the dome?\" I asked, thinking of the holes all over the walls. \"Why would the Zondorae brothers care so much to construct all of these dome-things, then let them get ruined?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, \"Actually, they\u0027re spheres. They\u0027re partially buried underneath the earth\u0027s surface. Thermal nuclear energy helps with stabilizing the temperature, the operational systems, pulse, all of it. Once they got what they needed, they were just going to wash their hands of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group looked at John.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"I guess it doesn\u0027t make much difference if it\u0027s a dome or a sphere to you guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all shook our heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" John huffed, sort of irritated his friends weren\u0027t interested in the finer details of dome/sphere construction, \"remember the badasses we trounced when we were there on our informative visit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe nodded. \"Dead or alive?\" Tiff laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn smiled grimly at her joke. \"Both. They\u0027re criminals from our world. These idiots left salt quartz. It directly breaks the pulse rhythm that allows the sphere to rejuvenate itself...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does?\" Sophie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded. \"Yes, it\u0027s so fascinating! You see...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my hand, staving off a tech rant. \"John, come on, stop with the shiny thing and get to the point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was like a dog with a ball thrown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn grinned. \"Alright. Anyways, it\u0027s on a monthly cycle in which the pulse-signal \u0027reboots\u0027. When this happens, the interior environment is cleansed, the older air released to the outside, and new air drawn and filtered for the interior. It also strengthens the walls by drawing on the electromagnetic fields of the earth through the pulse system interlay that is integrated within the structure itself.\" John looked at each of us expectantly. Seeing some confusion but mostly understanding he went on, \"What it means is that somehow, the criminals we ran into, must\u0027ve gotten a hold of these salt crystals, used them as pseudo weapons to damage the sphere and the hapless residents are sitting ducks for this criminal contingent to come in and take over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI palmed my chin, thinking about all the sleazebag variables. Finally I said, \"We\u0027re gonna have to stop this. Shut down this Pathway thing, make it so they can\u0027t return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s na√Øve, Caleb,\" Archer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcher expounded, \"They\u0027ll just send some other scientists to do another dirty job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"No. We need to destroy their access, fix the dome,\" he looked at John, \"sphere... and put the Graysheet dudes on notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex and Bry laughed. \"You and what army?\" Bry asked, his muscular arms folded over his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed. \"This is where the sissy-sucking-titty-babies get off the train, guys.\" I let my eyes sweep the group, challenging all that were there. \"Parker has been a problem... an enigma,\" I said, pulling out the terminology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy chortled in the background and I silenced him with a stare. \"But this time, maybe we can do something for the good of both worlds. We weren\u0027t meant to skip all this evolution, right John?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"No. They\u0027ve used an environmental challenge from a world that\u0027s not ours, applied it to a legitimate genetic discovery and made a new species of people with that stolen genetic code.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" Randi asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Us,\" Alex answered, pulling her inside the cradle of his huge body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friends fell into an uneasy silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn\u0027s final comment made the decision an easy one for me. \"And the girl...\" John began and I instantly intuited which one he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The redhead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s the key to all this. The Queen is center stage in their plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, John?\" Jade asked, a furrow appearing between her brows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was the one they got the genetic material from. She has the properties of both indigenous peoples there,\" John responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So... what is she?\" Bry frowned at Tiff. \"I mean,\" she began again, giving him the piss off look, \"I know she is the \u0027Queen of Ohio\u0027,\" Tiff said, rolling her eyes. \"But besides that handy little detail... so what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s their genetic messiah,\" John answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They call her the Key,\" John elaborated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The key to what, dude?\" Jonesy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn shrugged like it was obvious. \"Control,\" John said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara\u0027s world\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe return of the youngest Travelers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very sphere Clara had sought in her time of need had ultimately betrayed her with a creature more insidious than Prince Frederic. Aye, more mad but more cleverer as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara frowned, looking over her shoulder at the additional Band. How would a mere dozen of the Band neutralize the threat of the dredges of Kentucky? Had King Otto lost total control? Did Caesar rule even now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBracus, Philip, Edwin and Matthew used the key that Clara always carried to unlock the portal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew turned to Clara, seeing the worry etched upon her features, knowing full well what had put it there. Her concerns were his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does not move, Clara. Perhaps another key?\" he asked, looking at the key in his huge hand, polished brass and large.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew it was the very key for the portal, having procured its fashioning after the last siege.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara came to his side, studying the key that lay there. \"Nay, this is the one, I am certain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew and Bracus looked at one another. \"They have damaged the locks? Mayhap barring our entrance, anticipating our return?\" Bracus speculated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, it makes no sense. That weasel of a royal has his sights set on Clara,\" Matthew glowered at his own words. \"Yet, he bars our eventual entrance?\" He shook his head, negating the possibility of such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It be something else,\" Edwin said. \"Someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, a coincidence of magnitude occurred:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinking into their space in a flash of iridescent light that was at once blinding as it was beautiful, like a bubble set in the sun with water upon it, the Travelers burst into existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColor washed over the Outside, sealing the grave markers in a multitude of pale colors that rippled and swarmed, causing their milky whiteness to glow in phosphorescence for a moment, then vanishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew and the rest of the Band moved the women behind them. Rowenna shoved past Bracus and stood at his side while he frowned down at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wipe that look from your face, Dear Heart,\" she said mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBracus sighed, stubborn woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Clara gazed upon the young Travelers she felt a hope spark in her heart. Mayhap these young ones could aid them if there be any wish of resolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a move to go forward to meet the young man who controlled the foulness that was death but Matthew put his hand around her arm in wariness. \"Caution be the order of the day, Clara,\" he said in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" she responded even as she walked the three horse lengths to where the young man stood, her mind on her people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Randi and she nodded her head. \"We don\u0027t have to touch but it makes it easier on the send-off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ya make it sound like it\u0027s some kind of rocket ship!\" Tiff said, smacking her gum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry rolled his eyes. \"Get rid of the GD gum now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Tiff, what if it gets in your hair,\" Sophie said without guile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey narrowed their eyes at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Randi, shoot the juice before we have a bitch-slap-fest,\" Jonesy said. All female eyes fell on his dumb ass like a lead weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, not in the least concerned that he\u0027d pissed off the girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppressed a smile with supreme effort. The effort was ugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade gave me a look, not entirely pleased that I found Jonesy even remotely funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandi huffed. \"Okay... right.\" She looked at the anxious eyes, interpreting Jonesy\u0027s comments for what they really were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlowing off anxiety like wayward steam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a big deal. Traveling between worlds, saving another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded at Randi and John did too. We squeezed our linked hands together and with a surge of heat and light, zapped into the frozen darkness that marked our transport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur entry into the sphere world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the young woman with the red hair. The Queen, I reminded myself. I approached her cautiously, my eyes flicked to the huge dude behind her, his eyes steady on my approaching figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way I was messing with this chick with a guy that was six foot seven and two hundred forty plus. As I drew closer to Queen Clara, I studied his outfit. Intimidating-much, he had so many weapons hanging off him I could hardly see his clothes. My eyes went back to the Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood waiting for me as I came to stand in front of her. After a moment of mutual study she smiled and it was breathtaking, the abuse of her face, the blood and sweat covering her from head to toe... she still managed to look regal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could totally see her royalty, it didn\u0027t matter what she wore. She held herself with grace and purpose. Queen Clara narrowed that purpose on me and asked softly, \"What say you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared... what? I couldn\u0027t understand her and turned to John.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s she asking, John?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know... but, it sounds like some kind of late, 19th century diction. Not exactly, but around there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at how everyone was dressed. Weird... old-fashioned. Uh-huh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, ah... we\u0027re here to help fix your dome,\" Caleb said and pointed to the sphere wall and corrected himself, \"I mean, your sphere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel came to stand beside Clara. \"He speaks as a fragment somewhat however...\" Clara shrugged helplessly, \"I cannot make sense of most of his speech.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These guys don\u0027t get what we\u0027re saying, dude,\" Jonesy said, restating the obvious. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-weeps-death-5/page-14.html","bookId":2493,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM"}
