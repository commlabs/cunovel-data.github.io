{"id":84851,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not discuss the things you do to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and give her that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoulder bumps me hard and walks away. I pinch the bridge of my nose and pray for the courage and strength to get through the next hour and a half. I walk fast to catch up to her. I don’t want her in there without me. The meatheads will be on her instantly. Then I will have to kill them. Then I will go to jail. Then the next meathead will ask her out. The thought pisses me off and I nudge her shoulder back, \"In this place, you get what you give.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins, \"Well then, let\u0027s play. I have some serious shit I\u0027d love to give back to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help but smile. She makes me laugh with how confident and strong she acts. It\u0027s like she forgets that I see the girl in the corner with the dead eyes. She doesn’t wear that face anymore but I can still see that girl. She no longer runs, now she fights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks ready to rumble until she sees the rest of the gym. She looks over at Doris, a female I have questioned the sexuality of many times. She looks like a man and Sarah gives her the most disturbed look. I nudge her again, \"Don’t look so horrified. She is a pro female boxer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leans in and whispers, \"Heavy weight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and shove her arm. She winces and I see red marks forming where I pushed her. I forget myself in this place. It amps me up. I offer her an apologetic look, \"Sorry. I get pretty hyped in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks nervous so I pick up the pace to where Lance has the junior class starting. She looks like one of the kids compared to the rest of us. She won\u0027t have an issue fitting in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get to where Lance and the boys are and she laughs at something. I look around but there is nothing I see funny. She looks like she is losing it a little. I frown and look back at Lance. He puts a hand out and points, \"You must be Sarah.\" He claps his hands and beams at her. I don’t know how he knows she is coming. I can only assume it was Stuart. Lance is the nicest old man ever. I know he will teach her to defend herself and have fun with it. He has a natural way of making people feel welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles but I can see the nerves. She\u0027s on edge until he smiles, \"I\u0027m Lance, in case Eli there hasn’t told you, and this is beginner\u0027s boxing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys look at her up and down and nod. I cock an eyebrow and their faces fall. They\u0027ve seen me fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngelo sneaks up behind her and grabs her shoulders. \"You boys go easy on Tinkerbell here, okay? You still have a chance to run away, Tink.\" He slaps her on the ass and winks at me. He\u0027s dead and he knows it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance laughs, \"If that’s gonna offend you, Tink, you\u0027re gonna need to toughen up. Or take a seat on the pine over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at me to defend her. I nod subtly. He\u0027s dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance claps his hands again. \"Three laps around the gym. Fast. I want a quick warm up.\" He looks right at me. I sigh and glance at Angelo. I want to kill him now while I\u0027m angry but Lance is saying no with his look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah ignores us and starts stretching. I watch her ass with the kids as she starts warming up. She takes off and I run after her butt. I want to say I was actively participating, but I was watching her butt, until she tore off. I lost sight of her but suddenly she was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still can\u0027t catch me, huh?\" She shouldered me and kept running. I pick up my pace but she is an elite runner. I\u0027m almost wheezing when I cross the line, behind Lance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins and bumps into me again, \"Somebody let an old man kick his ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the ring, Tink.\" Lance points at her. He sees my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs, \"Lance…uhm…sir. My name is Sarah.\" I smile but he doesn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waves her off, \"We all have nicknames here. I\u0027ll never remember Sarah. But with your hair in that bun, you look like Tinkerbell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks back at me, \"What\u0027s his nickname?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance looks confused, \"That’s Eli. We don’t nickname him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe points at Angelo kicking the crap out of Stan in the ring next to us, \"\"Him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winks, \"Angelo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What his real name?\" she asks and climbs into the ring. I laugh harder. I\u0027ve never heard of anyone here having a nickname.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance looks confused, but I know he\u0027s messing with her, \"Angelo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance throws tape at her. \"Tape up.\" She looks at it like it has a face and is about to talk to her. I laugh and walk over, taking the tape. I wrap her hands and stuff it in my pocket, \"For later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe believes me. I laugh and walk away, leaving her there to blend in. Besides, I have to go get hot and sweaty so she can watch me. Nicky is in the far corner shadow boxing. I nod at him. He smiles. He\u0027s just massive but I grin as I walk up. I can take him and he knows it, but it\u0027ll be a dirty fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at her. He nods, \"That your girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I am trying so hard and not getting anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"That’s ‘cause you\u0027re crazy. You gotta be sweet and cook. Chicks dig guys who cook and walk their little shit dogs and who take them shopping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him and decide to keep it on his level, \"She doesn’t have a dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"And you have a butler who cooks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs harder, \"Stu told me it’s the best food in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, \"It\u0027s true. I\u0027m never going to get her to love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrinkles his thick nose that\u0027s been broken several times, \"Love, forget that. Take your shirt off and we\u0027ll box. She\u0027ll want to rape your ass at the end of this match.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cock an eyebrow, \"Firstly, ass raping is not my thing. I mean it might be yours, and I\u0027m not judging. Secondly...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, whoa. I meant she\u0027ll… you know… attack you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and pull my shirt off. He sees my scars for the first time and winces, \"Damn dude, you are too beat up. Lucky thing though, girls love scars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod once and pull my gloves on. He is wrong. Girls love normal, not scarred freaks like him and me and Stuart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe start our fight off slow. Getting warmed and stretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods at me, \"Your girl is hot though, I will say that. That, and Angelo is talking to her, so maybe you wanna find a new girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fists respond. He backs up as I fly at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes a hard hit to the left side of his face and staggers back. He gets his balance and winks at me, \"She was looking, that was a good one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile my mouth guard at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe fight for another round but the air is broken with Lance screaming, \"COME ON, TINK!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and jump the ropes down onto the ground. I see Angelo and Lance laughing as I get closer. She is swatting one of the kids with her gloves. He hits her once hard. I growl as she staggers back. Lance shoots me a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah shakes her head, looks at him with a set of eyes I wouldn’t wish on anyone, and dives for him. She tackles him to the ground hitting and spitting all over him. I can\u0027t understand her but she is flailing and losing her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops hitting and starts saying something but piles of spit are coming out of her mouth guard. The kid is crying but the rest of us are dying with laughter. Lance takes a knee, he laughs so hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid gets away from her, wiping his face of spit and tears. She looks mortified, \"I want out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and try not to vibrate as I hold back my laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives me the fiercest glare ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to kill Stuart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake her to the gym, yeah. Her eye is swelling shut when she walks over to me with her lip sticking way out. I wrap a sweaty arm around her and lead her back to my tee shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" My voice is still high-pitched because I am laughing without actually letting it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"If you want to laugh, just do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make a whistle sound in my throat and shake my head, \"No, babe. I\u0027m good.\" The good comes out really high. She rolls her eyes and I lose it. The laugh tears from me and tears slip down my cheeks. I shake my head, trying desperately to speak, \"Wha-wha-what was th-tha-that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. I grab my shirt and wipe my eyes. She walks down the hallway past the ring where Nicky is still waiting for me to fight him. He shakes his head at me, \"They don’t dig guys who laugh at them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flip him the bird and follow her down the hallway. I pull on my shirt and catch up. I can\u0027t talk but I can stay calm as long as she doesn’t want to talk about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are there showers?\" she asks, looking sad and swollen and defeated. It melts my laughter. I wrap around her and shake my head, \"I don’t want you naked in here. Come with me.\" I grab our stuff and take her to the Tahoe. We jump in the back and Stuart drives us to my place. He doesn’t talk to us; it\u0027s weird. I feel creepy, sitting in the back seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops outside of my apartment and I pull her out, along with our bags. She looks like she might protest, but I don’t give her the chance. The lobby guy smiles until he sees her black eye. Then he gives me a shitty look. I press the elevator and ignore it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we\u0027re in the elevator, I kiss the top of her head and pull her into my arms. She smells like sweat and herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens and I drag her to the ensuite in my room. I pull off her shirt and pants and attempt to pull the sports bra off, but step back after a second, \"That seems like it wants to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs, \"I can do it.\" She does something that resembles dislocating her shoulders. I shake my head and drop to my knee, pulling her panties down and then taking off her socks. I resist the urge to bury my face between her legs in the dark-blonde mat. I stand and turn around. I push the plug in inside the massive corner tub and start the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pour in some of the bubble bath that my decorator used as a prop but that came from a special boutique. It smells like lavender. I make sure the water is really warm and add some of my muscle-relaxing bath salts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at her confused look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe points, \"You have a lot of these?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk, \"I do. They relax the muscles. I don’t normally do bubbles. Those are for special occasions.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-26.html","bookId":1889,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM"}
