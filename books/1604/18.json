{"id":92418,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull an arrow and crouch low to the ground. I shut my mind off. I try to not think when I\u0027m scared shitless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can hear Jake behind me walking, no doubt completely upright and picking his teeth with a piece of grass. If he starts humming I decide to shoot him myself. The grass on the side of the highways is long. As I slip through it the wind plays with it, making it whisper. The birds are not the kind who warn you of prey, they\u0027re scavengers. They want you to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long grass sways and plays with my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is beating faster when my foot touches the gravel on the side of the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at Will. He nods. Jake\u0027s lips curl into a smile. I can\u0027t help but want to smile with him. I see myself back at the cabin for the briefest of seconds. Images of he and I laying on the couches fill my mind. I smile remembering the way we tried not to get caught staring at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind snaps back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and listen to the wind. There is no sound. I climb out of the huge ditch and walk quickly and silently up onto the broken asphalt. It\u0027s started to crack from the weather and lack of care. Where my foot steps first it crumbles. My eyes scan every inch of the deserted highway. Burned out cars, sit staggered along the long straight road. The people caught in the traffic jams when the tidal waves were coming or the bombs were dropping to contain the sick. They fled from their vehicles. They left everything and ran. I remember running. My father had waited too long in his friend\u0027s bunker. It was the only mistake he ever made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head back to focusing. I slip between an old burnt SUV and the skeleton of a small car. The hood of the car is lifted and the battery is gone. Not uncommon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which way?\" Jake asks louder than I would like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhhhh.\" Will whispers soothingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gravel on the other side is a welcome sight. When my feet touch the grass I break into a run. The bushes hit me in the face when I enter the forest. I run until I see the tree I want. I climb it and sit with my arrow pulled and at the ready. I scan the highway and the ditch vigorously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake is huffing and puffing like the big bad wolf below my tree, \"Oh man you can run. Holy shit. I thought your leg was hurt. Whoa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake.\" Will is back to being Business Will. There is no fun with him, only survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t take my eyes from the road. Nothing moves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am about to climb down but I wait one more second. I see the bushes across the highway move. I pull the arrow back tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looks like an animal. I can\u0027t see it clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see something.\" My voice is low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Animal. Dog maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down through the thick branches at Will\u0027s look and raise and eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trackers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t finish the sentence and my eyes are scanning across the highway again. The animal is gone. Nothing moves. I climb down fast and turn to face the dense woods, \"That way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake looks pained, \"Seriously. We\u0027re going to run some more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him and nod, \"Think about what it\u0027s like for Anna right now. She\u0027s terrified. She thinks the breeder camps are what we all think. She is waiting for her turn no doubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flinches, \"Jesus Em. Easy with the visuals. She\u0027s my little sister for Christ\u0027s sake. I\u0027m not bitching. My leg is just killing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare, \"Is it bleeding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head and looks down at his pants, \"No but it hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Climb the tree and wait for us.\" I hand him the water bottle from my belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head and looks at Will who is stoic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will I\u0027m not staying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill licks his lips and thinks for a second, \"You can\u0027t hold us up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake rolls his eyes and sighs, \"Let\u0027s just go.\" He points into the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold the water bottle out for one more second but he doesn’t take me up on the offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and start to run. My leg is sore and my stomach is empty. In my haste I never stocked up. Anna has been hard on my rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the sun is setting, we are where I want to be. Jake hasn’t complained and Will is starting a small fire. I take my bow and find a nice quiet spot to sit and wait for something to make a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence of the woods is alarming. I\u0027ve never been in the woods here. I\u0027m exhausted but I focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the crunch of a stick. I raise my arrow in the direction I heard it. A large hare hops over a branch and sniffs the wind. It\u0027s ears twitch. It smells me. I release the arrow anticipating the hop it does. The arrow slices through the neck of the rabbit. It tries to move for a second and stops. I wish this isn’t my life for the seconds it takes me to retrieve my arrow. I gut the hare where I killed it. I never bring it back with all its guts. Leaving guts outside the cabin proved to be a mistake. I skin it quickly with the skinning knife my granny had always kept in the cabin. I leave the animal\u0027s remains and carry the carcass back to the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the cracking of the wood when I get close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill is standing over the fire and Jake is sitting on a log next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So is there something between you two?\" Will asks but doesn’t move his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake shrugs, \"I don\u0027t know. She\u0027s a tough one to get to know. We kissed. It was a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill looks at him and smiles, \"I hear that. You remember the Laura Croft movies where Angelina Jolie was all hot and quiet but would kill anything that moved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake laughs and points, \"Yes. Exactly. Jesus, give her some pouty lips and bam, Laura Croft.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel my insides trembling. I don’t remember the movies they\u0027re talking about. I can\u0027t help but want to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill laughs and shakes his head, \"But what a bitch though hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab a rock from where I\u0027m standing and toss it back a few yards. They can\u0027t see me if I crouch down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s back. Manners.\" Will speaks low and starts poking the fire. I stand and walk from the bushes. I just want to throw the stupid hare down and leave them there, but my stomach is growling. I am exhausted. I will stay as long as it takes to eat and then I\u0027m sleeping in a tree. Maybe if I\u0027m lucky I will fall in my sleep and wake up in heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill holds out a small sack, \"I have some potatoes from the camp and tinfoil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Okay.\" I feel awkward. Kissing them both was obviously bad, but having them call me a bitch after they kissed me is awful. Having Jake say it was a mistake is killing me. I can\u0027t look in his eyes. I walk around him and find a good stick to make a spit with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI search the ground around the fire until I find a good branch. I strip the small branches and leaves from it. I smirk and I shove the stick into the open neck. I am imagining it\u0027s one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a scary little thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown at Jake who is watching me get the hare on the spit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a compliment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t stop frowning. It doesn’t feel like a compliment. Even if it was it wouldn’t stop the pain of the kiss being a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI build a spit with rocks and branches and twine from my backpack. Will has sliced the potatoes and laid them in the tinfoil. He places them high on a rock with a flat surface in the fires circle of rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill glances at me, \"So what\u0027s the plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get captured and free us both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"I know you can it\u0027s just funny that’s all. You\u0027re willing to sacrifice yourself to save my sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s the first person I\u0027ve met that I liked. Genuinely.\" It\u0027s a dig at them both. Fuck them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raises his eyebrows, \"Fair enough.\" He looks hurt. The image of the girl in the short shorts doesn’t leave my mind easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake looks hurt, \"What am I chopped liver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, my granny used to say that if I hugged my grampy first. I hate that I\u0027m smiling. I hate that he makes me smile so easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins at me and I remember his hands on me. I can\u0027t stop staring at his lips. It makes me feel sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill clears his throat, \"So how will you get captured?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"Just act lost near the area.\" I glance at Jake who is still staring at me. His grin hasn’t left his face. I dig my stick in the dirt and draw a circle. I hit a rock and dirt goes flying up at Jake on his stump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. He wipes his face clean, \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill laughs, \"Stop being a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake shakes the dirt out of his hair, \"You did that on purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands up with the stick in them, \"I didn’t, I swear.\" I wish I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t think you should go in there, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dig the stick again, \"I have to.\" I don’t say that I led them straight to her. I don’t say that it\u0027s all my fault. I don’t have to. We all know it\u0027s true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill turns the hare on the spit slowly. The smells are starting to make my stomach make noises I haven’t heard since before I found the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill looks around, \"When you get captured you need a way out.\" He gets up from the fire and mutters, \"Jake turn the hare.\" He goes to a tree and rips off a branch. He sits next to me on the log. The warmth of his body touching mine sets my nerves on fire. I swear there is electricity where our arms and legs touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bends down and draws a rectangle. In each of the corners he makes small boxes, \"There is a section that is for the women who are pregnant or about to be impregnated. This is probably where you\u0027ll go. Then this wing is for the younger girl who can\u0027t have babies yet. This is for the women with the babies. This is where the little girls are kept. Girls they raise to be breeders.\" He moves the stick to the other side and makes a smaller box, \"This is where the men are, if there are any men. Sometimes they don’t have any there.\" He clears his throat nervously and draws an X in the middle but off to one side, \"This is the fertility lab. This is where the lab coats and doctors and cleaners all stay. This is your only chance. They will have a dump somewhere near the clinic. The garbage goes every few days.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-18.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM"}
