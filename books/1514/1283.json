Meanwhile, at the top of the altar, there was a skinny figure quietly seated like a statue. Currently, his body felt somewhat icy cold and his breath was so soft that it was nearly inaudible. If it was not because it was still possible to vaguely detect a trace of Life Qi from him, it was likely that everyone would think that this person was merely a lifeless corpse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThere was no sound in this strange place.

This should be the fourth year he had spent in this place. In other words, he had trained for four years. Other than the first year, where he was refining his Mental Energy, he had spent the remaining three years attempting to form a Divine Palace. However, without exception, all his attempts had ran into failure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough he had been repeatedly analyzing the reason behind his failures since the beginning, and had reached a relatively perfect state, for some unknown reason, the Divine Palace that he formed only possessed the right form.

Meanwhile, his eyes were filled with doubt and confusion. Even after fretting over it for such a long time, he made little headway with the problem. Therefore, all he could do was to sigh, before he shut his eyes and prepared to make another attempt.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Huh?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, just as he was about to make another attempt, he was suddenly startled. Then, he glanced at the stone floor on the ground. At that spot, there were some intersecting marks.

Meanwhile, there was a dot, which was connected to several deep scars.

Then, he once again shut his eyes. However, a moment later, he suddenly opened them again. As he once again looked at those random marks, a tinge of doubt flashed across his eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis dot seemed somewhat similar to his Niwan Palace. Meanwhile, these interconnected marks had destroyed it. Could it be that the Divine Palace was not remodeled from the Niwan Palace… Instead, one must completely destroy it in order to build a new one?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was… to destroy then create?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong’s heart was pounding violently. Destroy his Niwan Palace first? What a joke? One’s Niwan Palace was formed naturally at birth. Once it was destroyed, it would cause one’s spirit to drift off. Moreover, the end result was something that he could not handle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf his Niwan Palace was broken and his Divine Palace was not formed, wouldn’t that mean that all his Mental Energy attainment would simply vanish?

Meanwhile, he was clearly struggling with this decision in his heart. This continued for a long time before he finally gently inhaled a breath of air. Following which, he suddenly clenched his hand before a determined glint flashed across his dark black eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf he did not possess strong determination, how could he possibly attain great strength?

Shutting both his eyes, a thought passed through his mind before he arrived in front of his Niwan Palace. Currently, his Niwan Palace was just like a tiny speckle of light, that was roaming around gently. Meanwhile, powerful Mental Energy ripples were being emitted from it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong’s mind was observing that speckle of light. Then, a thought passed through his mind before the mighty Mental Energy within his Niwan Palace began to shrink and adhere together at a frightening pace. Within a short moment, all the Mental Energy within his Niwan Palace had turned into a human head sized Mental Energy ball. This ball appeared solid-like and its surface was as smooth as a mirror. Moreover, the terrifying fluctuations within caused even peak experts, who had passed two Reincarnation Tribulations, to tremble in fear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen this condensation reached its limits, all of a sudden, the Mental Energy ball began to tremble violently. Meanwhile, cracks began to appear on its surface before they started to grow. Following which, many destructive rays of light shot out from within.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen the intensity of these light rays reached their limits, a bright sun seemingly rose within Lin Dong’s Niwan Palace. Subsequently, a destructive fluctuation spread before his entire Niwan Palace exploded.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong’s body began to tremble violently at this moment. Following which, his Niwan Palace exploded before all the Mental Energy within began to surge forward uncontrollably like floodwaters.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong forcefully endured the intense pain within his head, as he quickly collected the Mental Energy, which had became extremely wild and violent after they were no longer restrained by his Niwan Palace. After all, if he allowed this frightening Mental Energy to go on a rampage within his body, it was likely that he would be shattered into pieces even though he was protected by the Primal Dragon Bone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eResplendent purple-gold light swept across the place. Meanwhile, the Primal Dragon Bone within Lin Dong’s body had also detected a hint of danger. A low and deep dragon roar sounded, before the purple-gold light transformed into numerous large purple-gold dragons. After which, they formed a dragon barrier and trapped all the rampaging Mental Energy within.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt this moment, the three Ancestral Symbols have also appeared. Following which, they surrounded the Mental Energy and prevented anything from escaping.

After all, his Niwan Palace was destroyed and it was impossible for him to restrain his Mental Energy indefinitely in this fashion. Therefore, if he was unable to create a “Divine Palace”, he would lose control of his Mental Energy and his spirit would also vanish. At that time, he would end up suffering a massive blow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough he was in dire straits, Lin Dong was someone who had experienced numerous life and death situations. Hence, he did not panic. A thought passed through his mind before he began to maneuver his Mental Energy and merge them together to form a Divine Palace, just like what he did within his Niwan Palace previously.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eVast and mighty Mental Energy surged. After which, they slowly merged together. At this moment, his Mental Energy was like a flowing liquid.

However, this was evidently a massive project. Therefore, in spite of Lin Dong’s abilities, he still ended up exhausting quite a lot of time. Fortunately, Lin Dong was in this training ground and no one would disturb him in a place like this. Otherwise, the consequences would be quite dire if he lost control of his Mental Energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTime slowly passed.

Meanwhile, wild joy involuntarily surged within his heart.

Faintly, a glint vaguely flashed from the futon in the process.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMoreover, the instant that flash occurred, an extremely ancient voice seemingly sounded within Lin Dong’s heart, “Zenith.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis voice, that appeared suddenly, caused Lin Dong’s body to stiffen. However, even before he could think about where this voice came from, a eureka moment violently flashed across his mind, “Zenith Sensing Art?!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Is that what’s missing?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis thought appeared in Lin Dong’s mind. Without further ado, he quickly immersed himself within the Zenith Sensing Art. A long while later, traces of Primal Chaos Light finally shot forth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThat Primal Chaos Light landed on his Divine Palace. After which, his Divine Palace emitted a clear roar. At this moment, the seemingly dead Divine Palace seemed to possess life. In fact, light was flowing on the surface of the Divine Palace, while lifeforce radiated from it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRumble.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMental Energy was flowing within the Divine Palace. In fact, it appeared as though they had faintly formed a basic cycle. Moreover, Lin Dong realized that the moment his Divine Palace was formed, it seemed to have established a divine connection with that mysterious and profound Zenith, as traces of Primal Chaos Light continuously gushed towards it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMental Energy churned. Those traces of Primal Chaos Light began to merge with Lin Dong’s Mental Energy.

Therefore, he gradually calmed his mind down before he quietly guarded his Divine Palace. Regardless of how violent his Mental Energy churned, Lin Dong knew that the Divine Palace would be able to truly replace his Niwan Palace after his Mental Energy completed their transformation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever… it seemed like this process would require a relatively long period of time.
