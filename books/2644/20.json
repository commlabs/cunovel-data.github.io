That and Anna in a blouse with damn little underneath it to conceal her full breasts and clad in skirts that begged to be snatched to her hips as he turned her to a wall?...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you dressed to go out?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The maid who brought my bath up told me there\u0027s going to be dancing tonight. I love to dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ken you canna go tonight. Too risky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d say that, but I am asking you to please let me go.\" She took his hand between hers and clasped them to her chest, exactly as Court had instructed at the posting house. \"I know you\u0027ll keep me safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you forgotten the danger you\u0027re in? You just opened the door without asking - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the knock is really high and hard that means you. And I haven\u0027t forgotten - that\u0027s why it\u0027s so important to go tonight. MacCarrick, it was made very clear to me when I was shot how short life can be, and if you knew how much I have to make up for, you\u0027d let me go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked so young, so eager, and damn it, there was a hint of desperation in her eyes. He\u0027d wondered how she could lightly brush off the attacks, and now understood she hadn\u0027t at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you let me pretend for one night that I don\u0027t have this hanging over me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally said, \"You\u0027ll have your night, then. But you canna go out like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" She glanced down at her blouse and skirt, then frowned at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrubbed a hand over his mouth and muttered, \"Your hair\u0027s down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled coyly and confided, \"I know it is,\" as if she\u0027d pulled off a bold coup to have it free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only the young women wear it so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hand on her hip. \"I am a young woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a lady, as you like to remind me incessantly. So you should dress as one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, of course.\" She twisted her hair around behind her, tying it into a knot, just like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhaled as though put out, then offered his arm to escort her down. Once on the street, he braced for the torture of her breasts grazing him, fearing she\u0027d discovered today to do that on purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill he walked proud to have a lady like her by his side. Even as he wanted to kill the men who ogled her, and envied him....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome children ran by, laughing, and she smiled after them. \"Thank you for taking me out, MacCarrick,\" she said with a sigh, resting her head against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was so pleasing and the gesture so welcome that he almost regretted one of his reasons for agreeing to do so tonight - he planned to give her something more to think about when she stared out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnal¨ªa was determined to enjoy herself tonight and as she and MacCarrick walked to the center of the village, the music, the laughter, and the excitement around them helped relax her. As did the glasses of wine MacCarrick had gotten for her, though he didn\u0027t touch a drop. She felt warm and reckless and dimly noted that she couldn\u0027t seem to stop touching him. \"MacCarrick, do you think I look pretty?\" Where had that question come from? Did she care about the answer? Yes. Yes, she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know very well how you look,\" he said, but ran his gaze over her appreciatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a laugh, she asked, \"Am I the type of woman who could bring you to your knees?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her gaze. \"Depends,\" he began in a low, husky tone, \"on the context.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look in his eyes made her shiver, though she didn\u0027t understand what he was implying. \"Context? Then right now, right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now, right here, you\u0027re the type of woman that drives a man to drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a mock scowl to match his. \"Take me to dance, MacCarrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face fell. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Canna keep watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Of course, he wouldn\u0027t be able to. She thought about returning to the inn, but just then a daring young man marched up and asked her to dance. She glanced back at MacCarrick, but he appeared as though he couldn\u0027t care less, which vexed her, so she accepted. As she\u0027d known it would, her hair fell loose with the first turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, she danced with man after man. The whole experience was heady, though she had the regrettable habit of comparing each partner to the Highlander. As if he were the template others should aspire to? His manner was gruff, and she\u0027d certainly seen more handsome, genteel men. Still, she wished he would look at her as these men did. As if they were besotted. As if they were on the verge of spontaneous poetry. MacCarrick always seemed to be studying her, yet never letting her know what he had decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut life was short and she was young. Another man swept her into a dance and she laughed - not a practiced ladylike laugh but a full-hearted one. And why not? Wasn\u0027t she already ruined? She\u0027d been kidnapped by a gang of mercenaries. In fact, barring pirates, she couldn\u0027t call up a scenario where one could possibly be more ruined than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung and ruined - there was a lot of freedom in that. Salut to young and ruined! She laughed again at her thoughts, and the man leaned in to whisper in her ear that she was lovely beyond words and that he wanted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, how adorable -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wrenched from him, leaving the man stumbling. MacCarrick had a viselike grip on her good arm and was hauling her away. The men she\u0027d danced with actually booed him until he turned back. She didn\u0027t see the look he gave them, but whatever it was made them quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. Quiet and a good deal paler than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you taking me?\" Anna asked with a hint of slurring in her voice. \"I was enjoying myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt bet she was. Tonight he\u0027d recognized that while she was with him he would kill any other man who touched her. \"What did he tell you?\" he asked as he cut through the park, pulling her along to their inn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. \"Pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt stopped and faced her. \"The man dancing with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, him,\" she said with a grin. \"He told me I was lovely and that he wanted me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hid his clenched hands behind him, fought to control his tone. \"A fine idea. I\u0027ll take my payment now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at him. \"Your payment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My kiss. I want it. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Well, you are due, I suppose,\" she said, shocking him. He\u0027d expected her to beg out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then put your arms around my neck.\" Damn, if she didn\u0027t do just that. \"And bring your lips to mine.\" She stood on her toes to reach him. He\u0027d wanted to go slow, to teach her - not frighten her as he had at the lodge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he found his lips on hers, hard and intent, and when he flicked his tongue against her lips, she gasped. At once he touched his tongue to hers, tasting the sweet wine she\u0027d been liberally drinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed at his chest and broke away, breathless. \"You can\u0027t do that! That\u0027s not right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a French kiss. We\u0027re in France.\" It was then that he noticed her choker was not on her neck. This was the first time she\u0027d left it behind, and it signified something, he knew it, but then when she mouthed \"Ohhh,\" he set right back, saying against her lips, \"Kiss me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitantly did, with the tiniest stroke of her tongue. Then she broke away again, a look of wonderment on her face. \"That felt nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was harsh. \"Then let\u0027s do it instead of talking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, of course.\" She closed her eyes again and offered her lips up to him. He took them, kissing her, savoring her. When she lapped at his tongue, pleasure shot through him, making him squeeze her hips and grind her against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA last haze of sense returned to him. They were in the center of the park. No privacy. By the time they reached the inn, she would realize what she was doing. He knew her. He knew that tonight nothing would cool her ardor like the sight of a bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scanned the area and saw a stone grotto only a few yards away. He took her elbow and led her inside, wondering if she would break away now, if she would come to her senses, but he didn\u0027t wonder for long. She reached up and kissed him, as she grasped his arms and squeezed the muscles there. He laid his hands on her face as he deepened the kiss, then slipped them down, glancing past the tips of her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moaned against him and her hand flitted low on his torso. Without thought and greedy for her touch after her torture today, he took it and placed it against the ridge in his trousers. She froze and broke the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shouldn\u0027t do that,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\u0027 curious? You doona have to do more. Just feel me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip, appearing to weigh his request, then she leaned up to kiss his chest in the V of his shirt. While he tried not to groan, she adjusted her hand on him - because she hadn\u0027t removed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her lips again as he dipped beneath the hem of her skirt and worked his hands up the sides of her thighs. He continued up, hungry to put his fingers inside her for the first time, to watch her come, but she stiffened and locked her legs together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, MacCarrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open your legs for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I-I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was an innocent, he reminded himself, but he\u0027d still hoped he could seduce her into giving him anything he wanted. \"If you let me, I\u0027ll make you feel even better than the kiss did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe removed her hand from him and put her forehead against his chest, shaking her head, as if she regretted that she couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowling his frustration, he rasped against her neck, \"Then tell me I can kiss your breasts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it will please you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve thought about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every night since I met you.\" He was kissing lower and lower until he reached the line of her bodice. \"Anna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finally whispered \"Yes,\" he tugged the cloth down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the first mere brush of his lips against her nipple, her head fell back and she moaned. He\u0027d known how much she would love this, had suspected he could make her come just from pinning her arms over her head and slowly tonguing her. And he\u0027d hated the impossibility that a man like him would ever witness it. Now he suckled hard, savoring her flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God,\" she cried, and his cock pulsed with need. He put her hand back on him and forced her to rub it up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe alternately sucked at the crest and flicked his tongue until she arched her back, offering. When she was in this state, he put his hand behind her head and pushed her against the grotto wall, pressing her hand between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MacCarrick, what do you want of me?\" she whispered wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did he want? Everything and nothing. With Annal¨ªa, he\u0027d bloody well take whatever he could get. \"I want to see you come tonight. One way or another.\" When she frowned in confusion, and removed her hand, his lips found hers, but she turned her face from him. \"I can\u0027t think. My head\u0027s spinning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew she couldn\u0027t think - or else she\u0027d deny him. He hated that he was the type of man a fine lady like her shouldn\u0027t - wouldn\u0027t - consider for anything more. He pressed his hand against her skirt between her legs to palm her through the material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wh-What are you doing?\" Her eyes opened wide, meeting his own, and she let out a tremulous breath. He leaned down to press his lips to the top of her breast just as he stroked his fingers against her. \"Oh, my Lord,\" she moaned and relaxed into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me tae keep touchin\u0027 you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she nodded eagerly, he made some sound of amusement, then said, \"No\u0027 so ladylike right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer whole body went rigid, and she pushed at his chest. She snatched up her blouse and swatted at his hand, though he resisted releasing her. When she peered down at his hand, shoved into her skirts, her face and chest colored, her eyes widening in horror. Too late, he remembered how she\u0027d reacted the last time he\u0027d made a comment like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumiliated. She\u0027d reacted as if she\u0027d been hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his hand away. \"Anna, I should no\u0027 have said that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but it\u0027s true, isn\u0027t it?\" She gave him a tight, false smile that didn\u0027t reach her eyes. And he knew the bloody choker would come back the next day like a collar. He hated the damn thing now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to know who\u0027d hurt her - besides himself. Who\u0027d hurt her originally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he wouldn\u0027t mind knowing why he wanted to kill that person. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1/page-20.html","bookId":2644,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM"}
