We must think on this carefully. Robb should have our best counsel before he makes his decision.”\u0026nbsp; “It may come down to practicalities,” said Maester Luwin. “Which lord he most needs to court. The riverlands are part of his realm, he may wish to cement the alliance by wedding Lady Hornwood to one of the lords of the Trident. A Blackwood, perhaps, or a Frey-”\u0026nbsp; “Lady Hornwood can have one of our Freys,” said Bran. “She can have both of them if she likes.”\u0026nbsp; “You are not kind, my prince,” Ser Rodrik chided gently.\u0026nbsp; Neither are the Walders. Scowling, Bran stared down at the table and said nothing.\u0026nbsp; In the days that followed, ravens arrived from other lordly houses, bearing regrets. The bastard of the Dreadfort would not be joining them, the Mormonts and Karstarks had all gone south with Robb, Lord Locke was too old to dare the journey, Lady Flint was heavy with child, there was sickness at Widow’s Watch. Finally all of the principal vassals of House Stark had been heard from save for Howland Reed the crannogman, who had not set foot outside his swamps for many a year, and the Cerwyns whose castle lay a half day’s ride from Winterfell. Lord Cerwyn was a captive of the Lannisters, but his son, a lad of fourteen, arrived one bright, blustery morning at the head of two dozen lances. Bran was riding Dancer around the yard when they came through the gate. He trotted over to greet them. Cley Cerwyn had always been a friend to Bran and his brothers.\u0026nbsp; “Good morrow, Bran,” Cley called out cheerfully. “Or must I call you Prince Bran now?”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “Only if you want.”\u0026nbsp; Cley laughed. “Why not? Everyone else is a king or prince these days. Did Stannis write Winterfell as well?”\u0026nbsp; “Stannis? I don’t know.”\u0026nbsp; “He’s a king now too,” Cley confided. “He says Queen Cersei bedded her brother, so Joffrey is a bastard.”\u0026nbsp; “Joffrey the Illborn,” one of the Cerwyn knights growled. “Small wonder he’s faithless, with the Kingslayer for a father.”\u0026nbsp; “Aye,” said another, “the gods hate incest. Look how they brought down the Targaryens.”\u0026nbsp; For a moment Bran felt as though he could not breathe. A giant hand was crushing his chest. He felt as though he was falling, and clutched desperately at Dancer’s reins.\u0026nbsp; His terror must have shown on his face. “Bran?” Cley Cerwyn said. “Are you unwell? It’s only another king.”\u0026nbsp; “Robb will beat him too.” He turned Dancer’s head toward the stables, oblivious to the puzzled stares the Cerwyns gave him. His blood was roaring in his ears, and had he not been strapped onto his saddle he might well have fallen.\u0026nbsp; That night Bran prayed to his father’s gods for dreamless sleep. If the gods heard, they mocked his hopes, for the nightmare they sent was worse than any wolf dream.\u0026nbsp; “Fly or die!” cried the three-eyed crow as it pecked at him. He wept and pleaded but the crow had no pity. It put out his left eye and then his right, and when he was blind in the dark it pecked at his brow, driving its terrible sharp beak deep into his skull. He screamed until he was certain his lungs must burst. The pain was an axe splitting his head apart, but when the crow wrenched out its beak all slimy with bits of bone and brain, Bran could see again. What he saw made him gasp in fear. He was clinging to a tower miles high, and his fingers were slipping, nails scrabbling at the stone, his legs dragging him down, stupid useless dead legs. “Help me!” he cried. A golden man appeared in the sky above him and pulled him up. “The things I do for love,” he murmured softly as he tossed him out kicking into empty air.\u0026nbsp; \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1522/45497.html","bookId":1301,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:57:22 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:57:22 AM"}
