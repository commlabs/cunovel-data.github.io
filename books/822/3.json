{"id":19189,"no":3,"title":"THE WATERLOO VETERAN","content":"Is Waterloo a dead word to you? the name of a plain of battle, no more? Or do you see, on a space of rising ground, the little long-coated man with marble features, and unquenchable eyes that pierce through rolling smoke to where the relics of the old Guard of France stagger and rally and reach fiercely again up the hill of St. Jean toward the squares, set, torn, red, re-formed, stubborn, mangled, victorious beneath the unflinching will of him behind there,—the Iron Duke of England?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Or is your interest in the fight literary? and do you see in a pause of the conflict Major O\u0027Dowd sitting on the carcass of Pyramus refreshing himself from that case-bottle of sound brandy? George Osborne lying yonder, all his fopperies ended, with a bullet through his heart? Rawdon Crawley riding stolidly behind General Tufto along the front of the shattered regiment where Captain Dobbin stands heartsick for poor Emily?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Or maybe the struggle arranges itself in your vision around one figure not named in history or fiction,—that of hour grandfather, or his father, or some old dead soldier of the great wars whose blood you exult to inherit, or some grim veteran whom you saw tottering to the rollcall beyond when Queen Victoria was young and you were a little boy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For me the shadows of the battle are so grouped round old John Locke that the historians, story-tellers, and painters may never quite persuade me that he was not the centre and real hero of the action. The French cuirassiers in my thought-pictures charge again and again vainly against old John; he it is who breaks the New Guard; upon the ground that he defends the Emperor\u0027s eyes are fixed all day long. It is John who occasionally glances at the sky with wonder if Blucher has failed them. Upon Shaw the Lifeguardsman, and John, the Duke plainly most relies, and the words that Wellington actually speaks when the time comes for advance are, \"Up, John, and at them!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How fate drifted the old veteran of Waterloo into our little Canadian Lake Erie village I never knew. Drifted him? No; he ever marched as if under the orders of his commander. Tall, thin, white-haired, close-shaven, and always in knee-breeches and long stockings, his was an antique and martial figure. \"Fresh white-fish\" was his cry, which he delivered as if calling all the village to fall in for drill.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So impressive was his demeanor that he dignified his occupation. For years after he disappeared, the peddling of white-fish by horse and cart was regarded in that district as peculiarly respectable. It was a glorious trade when old John Locke held the steelyards and served out the glittering fish with an air of distributing ammunition for a long day\u0027s combat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I believe I noticed, on the first day I saw him, how he tapped his left breast with a proud gesture when he had done with a lot of customers and was about to march again at the head of his horse. That restored him from trade to his soldiership—he had saluted his Waterloo medal! There beneath his threadbare old blue coat it lay, always felt by the heart of the hero.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why doesn\u0027t he wear it outside?\" I once asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He used to,\" said my father; \"till Hiram Beaman, the druggist, asked him what he\u0027d \u0027take for the bit of pewter.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What did old John say, sir?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Take for the bit of pewter!\u0027 said he, looking hard at Beaman with scorn. \u0027I\u0027ve took better men\u0027s lives nor ever yours was for to get it, and I\u0027d sell my own for it as quick as ever I offered it before.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027More fool you,\u0027 said Beaman.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027You\u0027re nowt,\u0027 said old John, very calm and cold, \u0027you\u0027re nowt but walking dirt.\u0027 From that day forth he would never sell Beaman a fish; he wouldn\u0027t touch his money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It must have been late in 1854 or early in 1855 that I first saw the famous medal. Going home from school on a bright winter afternoon, I met old John walking very erect, without his usual fish-supply. A dull round white spot was clasped on the left breast of his coat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Locke,\" said the small boy, staring with admiration, \"is that your glorious Waterloo medal?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re a good little lad!\" He stooped to let me see the noble pewter. \"War\u0027s declared against Rooshia, and now it\u0027s right to show it. The old regiment\u0027s sailed, and my only son is with the colors.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he took me by the hand and led me into the village store, where the lawyer read aloud the news from the paper that the veteran gave him. In those days there was no railway within fifty miles of us. It had chanced that some fisherman brought old John a later paper than any previously received in the village.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ay, but the Duke is gone,\" said he, shaking his white head, \"and it\u0027s curious to be fighting on the same side with another Boney.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All that winter and the next, all the long summer between, old John displayed his medal. When the report of Alma came, his remarks on the French failure to get into the fight were severe. \"What was they ever, at best, without Boney?\" he would inquire. But a letter from his son after Inkermann changed all that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Half of us was killed, and the rest of us clean tired with fighting,\" wrote Corporal Locke. \"What with a bullet through the flesh of my right leg, and the fatigue of using the bayonet so long, I was like to drop. The Russians was coming on again as if there was no end to them, when strange drums came sounding in the mist behind us. With that we closed up and faced half-round, thinking they had outflanked us and the day was gone, so there was nothing more to do but make out to die hard, like the sons of Waterloo men. You would have been pleased to see the looks of what was left of the old regiment, father. Then all of a sudden a French column came up the rise out of the mist, screaming, \u0027Vive l\u0027Empereur!\u0027 their drums beating the charge. We gave them room, for we were too dead tired to go first. On they went like mad at the Russians, so that was the end of a hard morning\u0027s work. I was down,—fainted with loss of blood,—but I will soon be fit for duty again. When I came to myself there was a Frenchman pouring brandy down my throat, and talking in his gibberish as kind as any Christian. Never a word will I say agin them red-legged French again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Show me the man that would!\" growled old John. \"It was never in them French to act cowardly. Didn\u0027t they beat all the world, and even stand up many\u0027s the day agen ourselves and the Duke? They didn\u0027t beat,—it wouldn\u0027t be in reason,—but they tried brave enough, and what more\u0027d you ask of mortal men?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With the ending of the Crimean War our village was illuminated. Rows of tallow candles in every window, fireworks in a vacant field, and a torchlight procession! Old John marched at its head in full regimentals, straight as a ramrod, the hero of the night. His son had been promoted for bravery on the field. After John came a dozen gray militiamen of Queenston Heights, Lundy\u0027s Lane, and Chippewa; next some forty volunteers of \u002737. And we boys of the U. E. Loyalist settlement cheered and cheered, thrilled with an intense vague knowledge that the old army of Wellington kept ghostly step with John, while aerial trumpets and drums pealed and beat with rejoicing at the fresh glory of the race and the union of English-speaking men unconsciously celebrated and symbolized by the little rustic parade.\n\u003cbr\u003e OLD JOHN MARCHED IN FULL REGIMENTALS\n\u003cbr\u003e OLD JOHN MARCHED IN FULL REGIMENTALS\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After that the old man again wore his medal concealed. The Chinese War of 1857 was too contemptible to celebrate by displaying his badge of Waterloo.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then came the dreadful tale of the Sepoy mutiny—Meerut, Delhi, Cawnpore! After the tale of Nana Sahib\u0027s massacre of women and children was read to old John he never smiled, I think. Week after week, month after month, as hideous tidings poured steadily in, his face became more haggard, gray, and dreadful. The feeling that he was too old for use seemed to shame him. He no longer carried his head high, as of yore. That his son was not marching behind Havelock with the avenging army seemed to cut our veteran sorely. Sergeant Locke had sailed with the old regiment to join Outram in Persia before the Sepoys broke loose. It was at this time that old John was first heard to say, \"I\u0027m \u0027feared something\u0027s gone wrong with my heart.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Months went by before we learned that the troops for Persia had been stopped on their way and thrown into India against the mutineers. At that news old John marched into the village with a prouder air than he had worn for many a day. His medal was again on his breast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was but the next month, I think, that the village lawyer stood reading aloud the account of the capture of a great Sepoy fort. The veteran entered the post-office, and all made way for him. The reading went on:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The blowing open of the Northern Gate was the grandest personal exploit of the attack. It was performed by native sappers, covered by the fire of two regiments, and headed by Lieutenants Holder and Dacre, Sergeants Green, Carmody, Macpherson, and Locke.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The lawyer paused. Every eye turned to the face of the old Waterloo soldier. He straightened up to keener attention, threw out his chest, and tapped the glorious medal in salute of the names of the brave.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"God be praised, my son was there!\" he said. \"Read on.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sergeant Carmody, while laying the powder, was killed, and the native havildar wounded. The powder having been laid, the advance party slipped down into the ditch to allow the firing party, under Lieutenant Dacre, to do its duty. While trying to fire the charge he was shot through one arm and leg. He sank, but handed the match to Sergeant Macpherson, who was at once shot dead. Sergeant Locke, already wounded severely in the shoulder, then seized the match, and succeeded in firing the train. He fell at that moment, literally riddled with bullets.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Read on,\" said old John, in a deeper voice. All forbore to look twice upon his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Others of the party were falling, when the gate was blown to fragments, and the waiting regiments of infantry, under Colonel Campbell, rushed into the breach.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a long silence in the post-office, till old John spoke once more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The Lord God be thanked for all his dealings with us! My son, Sergeant Locke, died well for England, Queen, and Duty.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nervously fingering the treasure on his breast, the old soldier wheeled about, and marched proudly straight down the middle of the village street to his lonely cabin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The villagers never saw him in life again. Next day he did not appear. All refrained from intruding on his mourning. But in the evening, when the Anglican minister heard of his parishioner\u0027s loss, he walked to old John\u0027s home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There, stretched upon his straw bed, he lay in his antique regimentals, stiffer than At Attention, all his medals fastened below that of Waterloo above his quiet heart. His right hand lay on an open Bible, and his face wore an expression as of looking for ever and ever upon Sergeant Locke and the Great Commander who takes back unto Him the heroes He fashions to sweeten the world.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1867/54028.html","bookId":822,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:47:21 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:47:21 AM"}
