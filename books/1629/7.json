The Great God Om, although currently the small god Om, ate a lettuce leaf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll my life, Brutha thought, I\u0027ve known that the Great God Om-he made the holy horns sign in a fairly half-hearted way?-was a . . . a . . . great big beard in the sky, or sometimes, when He comes down into the world, as a huge bull or a lion or . . . something big, anyway.

Let there be another leaf:”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha pulled one off the nearest plant.

And you are. That\u0027s what it says in the Book of Ossory. He was one of the Great Prophets, you know. I hope,” Brutha added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who told him I was omnipotent?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No I didn\u0027t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, he said you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t even remember anyone called Ossory,” the tortoise muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You spoke to him in the desert,” said Brutha. “You must remember. He was eight feet tall? With a very long beard? And a huge staff? And the glow of the holy horns shining out of his head?” He hesitated. But he\u0027d seen the statues and the holy icons. They couldn\u0027t be wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never met anyone like that,” said the small god Om.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe he was a bit shorter,” Brutha conceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ossory. Ossory,” said the tortoise. \"No . . . no . . . can\u0027t say I-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said that you spoke unto him from out of a pillar of flame,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, that Ossory,” said the tortoise. “Pillar of flame. Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you dictated to him the Book of Ossory,” said Brutha. “Which contains the Directions, the Gateways, the Abjurations, and the Precepts. One hundred and ninety?three chapters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t think I did all that,” said Om doubtfully. “I\u0027m sure I would have remembered one hundred and ninety-three chapters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you say to him, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As far as I can remember it was \u0027Hey, see what I can do!\u0027 ” said the tortoise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha stared at it. It looked embarrassed, insofar as that\u0027s possible for a tortoise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even gods like to relax,” it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hundreds of thousands of people live their lives by the Abjurations and the Precepts!” Brutha snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well? I\u0027m not stopping them,” said Om.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you didn\u0027t dictate them, who did?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t ask me.

So I suppose you didn\u0027t give him the Book of Creation, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What Book of Creation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean you don\u0027t know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then who gave it to him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know! Perhaps he wrote it himself!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha put his hand over his mouth in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thaff blafhngf!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha removed his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said, that\u0027s blasphemy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blasphemy? How can I blaspheme? I\u0027m a god!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t believe you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hah!

The tortoise hung its head sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. All right. Not much of one, I admit,” it said. “If I was better, you\u0027d have been just a pair of sandals with smoke coming out.” It looked wretched. “I don\u0027t understand it. This sort of thing has never happened to me before. I intended to be a great big roaring white bull for a week and ended up a tortoise for three years. Why? I don\u0027t know, and I\u0027m supposed to know everything. According to these prophets of yours who say they\u0027ve met me, anyway. You know, no one even heard me? I tried talking to goatherds and stuff, and they never took any notice! I was beginning to think I was a tortoise dreaming about being a god. That\u0027s how bad it was getting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps you are,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your legs to swell to tree trunks!” snapped the tortoise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But-but,” said Brutha, “you\u0027re saying the prophets were . . . just men who wrote things down! ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s what they were!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but it wasn\u0027t from you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some of it was, perhaps,” said the tortoise. “I\u0027ve . . . forgotten so much, the past few years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But if you\u0027ve been down here as a tortoise, who\u0027s been listening to the prayers? Who has been accepting the sacrifices? Who has been judging the dead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know,” said the tortoise. “Who did it before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha stuck his fingers in his ears and opened up with the third verse of Lo, the infidels flee the wrath of Om.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a couple of minutes the tortoise stuck its head out from under its shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” it said, “before unbelievers get burned alive . . . do you sing to them first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. A merciful death. Can I say something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you try to tempt my faith one more time-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tortoise paused. Om searched his fading memory. Then he scratched in the dust with a claw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I . . . remember a day . . . summer day . . . you were . . . thirteen . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dry little voice droned on. Brutha\u0027s mouth formed a slowly widening O.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he said, “How did you know that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You believe the Great God Om watches everything you do, don\u0027t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a tortoise, you couldn\u0027t have-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you were almost fourteen, and your grandmother had beaten you for stealing cream from the stillroom, which in fact you had not done, she locked you in your room and you said, \u0027I wish you were-\u0027 ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere will be a sign, thought Vorbis. There was always a sign, for the man who watched for them. A wise man always put himself in the path of the God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strolled through the Citadel. He always made a point of taking a daily walk through some of the lower levels, although of course always at a different time, and via a different route. Insofar as Vorbis got any pleasure in life, at least in any way that could be recognized by a normal human being, it was in seeing the faces of humble members of the clergy as they rounded a corner and found themselves face-to-chin with Deacon Vorbis of the Quisition. There was always that little intake of breath that indicated a guilty conscience. Vorbis liked to see properly guilty consciences. That was what consciences were for. Guilt was the grease in which the wheels of the authority turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rounded a corner and saw, scratched crudely on the wall opposite, a rough oval with four crude legs and even cruder head and tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. There seemed to be more of them lately. Let heresy fester, let it come to the surface like a boil. Vorbis knew how to wield the lance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the second or two of reflection had made him walk past a turning and, instead, he stepped out into the sunshine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was momentarily lost, for all his knowledge of the byways of the church. This was one of the walled gardens. Around a fine stand of tall decorative Klatchian corn, bean vines raised red and white blossoms towards the sun; in between the bean rows, melons baked gently on the dusty soil. In the normal way, Vorbis would have noted and approved of this efficient use of space, but in the normal way he wouldn\u0027t have encountered a plump young novice, rolling back and forth in the dust with his fingers in his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis stared down at him. Then he prodded Brutha with his sandal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What ails you, my son?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere weren\u0027t many superior members of the hierarchy he could recognize. Even the Cenobiarch was a distant blob in the crowd. But everyone recognized Vorbis the exquisitor. Something about him projected itself on your conscience within a few days of your arrival at the Citadel. The God was merely to be feared in the perfunctory ways of habit, but Vorbis was dreaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How very strange,” said Vorbis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hissing noise made him look round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small tortoise near his foot. As he glared, it tried to back away, and all the time it was staring at him and hissing like a kettle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked it up and examined it carefully, turning it over and over in his hands. Then he looked around the walled garden until he found a spot in full sunshine, and put the reptile down, on its back. After a moment\u0027s thought he took a couple of pebbles from one of the vegetable beds and wedged them under the shell so that the creature\u0027s movement wouldn\u0027t tip it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis believed that no opportunity to acquire esoteric knowledge should ever be lost, and made a mental note to come back again in a few hours to see how it was getting on, if work permitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned his attention to Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a hell for blasphemers. There was a hell for the disputers of rightful authority. There were a number of hells for liars. There was probably a hell for little boys who wished their grandmothers were dead. There were more than enough hells to go around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the definition of eternity; it was the space of time devised by the Great God Om to ensure that everyone got the punishment that was due to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Omnians had a great many hells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, Brutha was going through all of them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-gods-discworld-13/page-7.html","bookId":1629,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM"}
