It\u0027s us and them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my circle of hugs and warmth grows and it\u0027s not just him and me. I feel Anna join and Jake. Then Sarah who is nervous of the wolf and hugs me only. Will hovers over us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a deadly shot Anna. You deserve that rifle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up at him and smiles, \"Someone had to keep Jake alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake laughs. Will smiles but I can see the hurt the comment causes on his face. She doesn’t mean it the way he takes it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo sits with his eyes closed and his mouth in his wolf smile. He loves the pets and strokes Anna and I are giving him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed you too. I missed you bad. Where\u0027s Meg?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes open. He whines. I sigh, \"Christ, is she gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nuzzles into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak wolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh at Sarah\u0027s bewildered face, \"No I speak Leo. He doesn’t speak wolf either. He speaks me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold his massive face and look into his yellow wolf eyes, \"Buddy is Meg gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licks his lips and whines. I feel sick. He\u0027s anxious. Something isn’t right. I look up at Will, \"Do the camps get attacked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill looks like he might say no, but he stops himself and nods, \"Once. It was a long time ago. Not that camp but another one. Why, is he saying that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"He\u0027s anxious and I left him with Meg. He left food and a bed to come find me. Seems weird. He\u0027s lost weight. He\u0027s been hunting for himself. He leans out when he hunts alone. Sometimes when I would camp out in one of our houses he would stay in the woods nearby and hunt. He would always lean out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill looks toward the mountain, \"We need to get going then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to stay one night but the dead men scattered about the yard make me rethink that plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anna go close off the bunker and Jake close up the house. I\u0027ll get Leo some water and refill the water bottles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill smiles, \"I\u0027ll stay guard and Sarah can give me a hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles at him. She likes him a lot. I wonder if she feels safe with him the way I do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stay focused on his blue eyes for a second and then force myself up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run my fingers along Leo\u0027s fur as we walk to the huge well. I pump the primer and then lift and pump the handle. I always let the first few pumps of water leave the spout and spill on the ground. Leo knows not to drink them too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waits patiently. I pull the pan I leave lying around the well house, out of its hiding spot. I rinse it and fill it with the cold water after about fifteen wasted pumps. Leo laps it up fast. He looks when the shallow bowl is empty. I fill it three times before he doesn’t seem interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fill the water bottles in my backpack. I drink one full bottle of the fresh clean water and then refill it. Anna comes over and drinks one and lets me refill it too. Jake joins Will and Sarah. His limp is still pronounced. I wonder if it\u0027ll ever be better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe leave the farm in a way that makes me feel odd. We walk and talk and snack on the jerky I had stored the last time I was stocking my supply cupboards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo doesn’t seem to like it either. He is restless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI worry about Meg. We pass by the meeting tree. I can see Leo has slept here. The grass and branches around it are in the shape of one of his nests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turn the opposite way of my cabin and my heart tugs. I want to go home. Leo stands there for a second and whines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe trots after me and keeps perfect pace with me for a while. Soon he relaxes and starts to trust I am not going anywhere and moves ahead. He scouts perfectly. He is silent and sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe move along the hillside without talking. I have given Jake a dirty look every time he started talking to Sarah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up as we near the camp to see the scout in the tree. Will waves and the scout shouts down, \"Holy shit look what the cat dragged in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill waves and laughs, \"Actually it\u0027s what the wolf dragged in.\" He looks back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo raises at lip at Will. I stroke his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camp is bustling, just as it was when we left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary comes running up and I hear the squeal of the little white haired brat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolfie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo curls into me. The little monster comes barreling at us. Before I have a chance Anna has his little arms, \"The wolf is going to bite you. We trained it to bite little kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns and growls at Leo who growls back. The little monster cries and runs away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna gives me a look. I\u0027ve warned her about the little monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. Mary gives me an evil stare. I laugh harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He means no harm.\" Her voice is soft and insulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe runs to her and hugs her. He fake cries and snuggles into her. He looks back at us and makes the production even louder. I roll my eyes, \"Mary this is Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill cuts me off, \"And my sister Anna and my brother Jake.\" Mary smirks at Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake blushes. I feel funny. She kissed me and now she\u0027s eyeballing the guy who I happen to like a lot. I feel angry. I don’t know why. Mary isn’t my girlfriend and Jake isn’t my boyfriend but the idea of them being together hurts me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks over and kisses Will on the cheek, \"Well come home and welcome to the rest of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay I\u0027ve had enough. I walk away and head to the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo is clinging to me. He keeps looking back at the bratty kid in Mary\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at him, \"I know buddy. I won\u0027t let him hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur tent looks smaller than I remember it. I open the flap and feel heat rise in my face instantly. Meg is in the embrace of a guy I would guess is somewhere around thirty. Before I wait for explanations or introductions. Meg\u0027s eyes flicker on me and she starts screaming, but I can\u0027t stop the momentum. I leap into the tent and rip him away from her. I\u0027m choking him on the ground and she is tearing at my arms. Leo is in the tent and growling. His slobber is falling all over the man\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands go up in the air. He tries to choke words out but I\u0027m holding his throat with all my might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emma sweet mother of all things holy stop trying to kill him. He\u0027s my boyfriend. Eric honey this is Emma. Emma. EMMA!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore her and smash his head down on the soft cushy pillows. I wish it were a rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo leans in closer. I understand his anxiousness. He knows this pervert has been taking advantage of Meg. She probably kicked him out of the tent. I want to throw up thinking about this asshole hurting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"EMMA!\" A man\u0027s angry voice fills the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel arms grabbing me. Strong hands lift me off of him but I kick. My boot lands square in his face. I hear the crunch. Blood gushes from his face. His hands fly to protect his face but I get a few more kicks off before I\u0027m dragged from the man\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg is in my face slapping me, \"STOP EMMA! STOP!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growl, \"He\u0027s an old man Meg. He\u0027s taking advantage of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary is in my face. She pets my cheeks, \"Emma, Meg\u0027s turned sixteen. She is allowed to choose her lovers at sixteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kick Meg in the thigh with my boot, \"She lied to you. She doesn’t turn sixteen yet. She\u0027s still fifteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary looks at Meg who blushes. Mary looks pissed at her but looks back at me, \"You have no right to attack anyone Emma. Not here. We are a peace camp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill shakes me from behind and grips my arms tighter, \"Emma call him off.\" I can still see the tent wiggling. I know Leo is probably eating the bleeding man. I wait and let him suffer for a few more seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill grips me harder and I scream as my arms go up my back. Leo is out of the tent before I have to call him. He jumps at Will and knocks us both to the ground. He is growling in Will\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg cries, \"Leave him be Emma. You aint my momma. Eric? Baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her and point, \"Get him out of my tent. I will kill him before you turn sixteen Meg.\" I get back on my feet. Leo still has Will on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bleeding half naked man stumbles out of the tent. His arm has a good bite mark on it that is seeping a slow stream of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glares at me, \"Crazy bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fucking pervert.\" I spit at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe comes at me but I am ready. I punch him in the eye. He screams again and stumbles back. I leap at him but my body is caught mid air. Jake holds me to him and covers my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meg is it? Get your friend out of here.\" Meg is on her knees crying. I want to choke her, not to death. Just till she loses her memory and forgets he exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary steps in the way, \"No let me. Eric and I have some talking to do. This isn’t his first offense in this area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill gets Leo off of him and grabs my arm, ripping me out of Jake\u0027s embrace, \"Jesus Christ you are insane sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake laughs, \"She was raised by wolves Willy boy. What do you expect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. It isn’t bitter or angry, it is a real laugh. It bolts from my body and I double over from it. It feels like a release similar to crying. I feel a cramp in my guts I laugh so hard. Leo looks scared and nudges me. He has never seen me laugh like this. Tears pour from my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill shoves me, \"You are insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake catches me. I don’t feel the pain of the rejection from Will. I know I will later but for now I laugh and it feels good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eighteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tears bother me. I can\u0027t stand that she\u0027s upset they can\u0027t be together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not like Romeo and Juliet moron. He\u0027s, like, an old man and shit. He\u0027s a pervert.\" Anna is trying to talk sense to her. She sounds like Jake as she talks. Meg ignores her and howls in pain. Sarah holds her tightly and strokes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It aint easy to find a good man who\u0027ll take care of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel my nails cutting into my palms. \"You don’t need a man. I\u0027ll take care of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg cries louder, \"I hate you Emma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and look at Sarah, \"You ready for a swim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods. She seems intimidated again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same thing is going to happen to you if you date old guys. I kill old perverts.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-29.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM"}
