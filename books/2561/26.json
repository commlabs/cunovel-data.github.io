{"id":112205,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\u003cp\u003ePart IV\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHANGE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slept intermittently and woke early next morning to find myself sprawled across the settee in Clare\u0027s dark living room. She lay asleep in my arms and for a long time I did nothing. I lay perfectly still and relaxed in her warmth and listened to the soft sounds of her steady breathing. Having her so close was reassuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had waited together in the darkness for hours the previous evening, just sitting there waiting for something\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;anything\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;to happen. But nothing did. The power remained off and I remained unable to summon up the courage to get off my backside and go back home. It was easier to stay where I was and the excuse of looking after Clare and Penny was, in my own mind, enough justification for my actions. Just before two o\u0027clock Clare had finally drifted off to sleep. My nerves and creeping anxiety had eventually been overtaken by tiredness an hour or so later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the cold grey light of day poured through the half-open curtains I began to remember everything that had happened previously, and the shock of recollection flooded over me like a torrent of ice-cold water. Any last vestiges of comfort, sleep and tiredness quickly disappeared and I knew that I needed to get up and get moving. I gently lifted Clare\u0027s sleeping body from on top of me and, taking care not to wake her, I slid off the sofa and stumbled over to the window. The world outside seemed reassuringly dull and overcast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith trepidation I climbed the stairs towards Penny\u0027s room. My heartbeat quickened nervously as I gently pushed the bedroom door open. I found the little girl in much the same state as she had been when Clare and I had last checked on her shortly after midnight. She lay on top of her bedclothes\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;cold but breathing steadily\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;covered with just a single blanket. Her angry fever had lessened although her forehead was still clammy. In the harsh light of morning, however, the extent of the horrific damage she\u0027d inflicted (both to herself and her bedroom) was painfully apparent. All around me the carpet was covered with a layer of smashed and now useless toys, and strips of wallpaper hung down, torn angrily from the walls. Penny\u0027s skin was bruised and she was smeared with traces of dried blood which had run freely from untreated cuts and grazes. I couldn\u0027t even begin to imagine what could have caused such a normally calm and placid little girl to have turned like this. There wasn\u0027t a single reason I could think of to explain why such a normally intelligent, bright and loving child should act with such anger and irrational spite and venom. As I stood and stared into her sleeping face I thought about the other people I had seen yesterday\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;James, Stephanie and Siobhan. I knew that I couldn\u0027t afford to stay hidden in the house and do nothing any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leant down and gently touched the side of Penny\u0027s neck with my outstretched right hand, cautiously checking for a steady pulse. I quickly found one and, as I pulled my hand back, her eyes flickered open. She silently turned her head to look at me and stared angrily. Instinctively I backed away from the bed. Thankfully she lay still and did not react in any other way. Her eyes remained wide\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;huge, dark pupils\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but she seemed to be looking through me and past me, not directly at me. I made my way back downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClare was awake when I returned to the living room, sitting waiting on the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How is she?\u0027 she whispered anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A little better I think,\u0027 I replied honestly. \u0027She just opened her eyes. She\u0027s calmer and her temperature\u0027s gone down.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thank God for that,\u0027 she sighed with relief clear on her face. \u0027Did she say anything to you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No. I think she knew I was there with her but she didn\u0027t say anything.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI deliberately chose not to tell Clare about the way Penny had looked through me. I could still see those cold, emotionless eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good,\u0027 she said, standing up and stretching. \u0027I\u0027ll go up and see her in a few minutes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So how are you feeling this morning?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Fine,\u0027 I replied, giving little away. \u0027You?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m all right.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Has the power come back on?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t even thought to check. I flicked the nearest light switch on and off a few times but nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Still dead,\u0027 I sighed dejectedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClare walked into the kitchen, continuing to talk to me as she went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So what are we going to do now?\u0027 \u0027What do you mean?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do we still need to get a doctor out to see Penny or should we wait and see if...? Shit...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s the matter,\u0027 I asked, concerned. I followed her into the other room and found her standing next to the cooker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Bloody gas is off as well.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You sure?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over to the stove and tried the controls. She was right. I waited for the hiss of the gas but there was nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What the fucking hell is going on here?\u0027 I cursed, tired, irritated and unnerved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the cooker back from the wall and checked that it was still connected. Everything looked okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Forget it,\u0027 Clare said from the other side of the room. \u0027Look.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up and saw that she was standing at the sink, holding the kettle under the cold tap. The tap was full on but just a pathetic trickle of water was coming from it. Ten seconds later and the trickle had dried up to nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel panic and uncertainty beginning to rise up in my throat like bile. I wanted to sit down and try and look for a rational explanation but I couldn\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t speak. For a few seconds I couldn\u0027t even move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s happening?\u0027 Clare asked. Her throat sounded dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I mumbled pathetically. \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed, put down the kettle and began to look around the room for answers. Then she looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ve got to do something,\u0027 she said. \u0027We can\u0027t just sit here. Something\u0027s happening and we need to find out what...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know, but...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But what?\u0027 she snapped angrily. \u0027But fucking what? What is going on?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took an unsteady step towards her and then stopped. She turned away from me and leant over the sink and looked out of the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I said before quickly running out of things to say. \u0027Look, maybe we should...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped speaking. Clare\u0027s body tensed. Her attention had obviously been caught by something she\u0027d seen outside. From where I was I couldn\u0027t see what it was. Rather than tell me, she ran over to the back door, unlocked it and pushed her way outside. I followed close behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 I shouted after her. \u0027What is it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer. She didn\u0027t have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanging heavily in the sky, at a distance of maybe ten miles from the house, was an alien ship. Seemingly identical to the first ship we\u0027d seen in the summer just passed, the huge vessel hung silently over the land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Fucking hell...\u0027 I began before my mouth dried. \u0027What the hell is that doing here? I thought their rescue ship wasn\u0027t due for another few months...?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked a little way further away from the house and out into the garden. Turning back to look over the roof of the building behind me, I saw that there was a second noiseless ship in the sky, this one much closer. Both of the machines were vast and impervious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 Clare demanded desperately. \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake, Tom...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that I couldn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold, autumnal rain had begun to fall. I wiped my face dry as I walked the length of Clare\u0027s garden towards a low stone wall which separated her property from the fields beyond. I climbed the wall, jumped down and then ran into the middle of the nearest field, hoping to get a better view of the alien ship closest to the house. When I turned back I froze with sudden, bitter fear. I could see another five ships, all watching and waiting ominously from seemingly random positions in the dark and overcast sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling vulnerable and exposed, I ran back to the house. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-26.html","bookId":2561,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:57:51 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:57:51 AM"}
