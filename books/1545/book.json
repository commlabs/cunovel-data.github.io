Are Percy and Annabeth up to the task of rescuing stolen goods from a fire-breathing giant who doesn\u0027t take kindly to intruders? How exactly are Leo, Piper, and Jason supposed to find a runaway table, dodge a band of party-loving Maenads (who just might be a little psychotic), and stave off a massive explosion...all in one hour or less? With his trademark wit and creativity, Rick Riordan answers these questions and more in three never-before-seen short stories that provide vital back-story to the Heroes of Olympus and Percy Jackson books. Original art, enlightening character interviews and profiles, puzzles, and a quiz add to the fun in this action-packed collection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-demigod-diaries.jpg","author":"Rick Riordan","type":"Adventure","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-demigod-diaries.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:02:02 PM"}
