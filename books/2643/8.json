This Matthew fellow, who is obviously not the Matthew that we knew, seems to have left out quite a little bit. Like everything from the time Joshua was born to the time he was thirty!!! No wonder the angel brought me back to write this book. This Matthew fellow hasn\u0027t mentioned me yet, but I\u0027m still in the early chapters. I have to ration myself to keep the angel from getting suspicious. Today he confronted me when I came out of the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are spending a lot of time in there. You don\u0027t need to spend so much time in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, cleanliness is very important to my people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t bathing. I would have heard the water running.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided that I needed to go on the offensive if I was going to keep the angel from finding the Bible. I ran across the room, leapt onto his bed, and fastened my hands around his throat - choking him as I chanted: \"I haven\u0027t been laid in two thousand years. I haven\u0027t been laid in two thousand years. I haven\u0027t been laid in two thousand years.\" It felt good, there was a rhythm to it, I sort of squoze his throat a bit with every syllable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused for a moment in choking the heavenly host to backhand him across his alabaster cheek. It was a mistake. He caught my hand. Then grabbed me by the hair with his other hand and calmly climbed to his feet, lifting me into the air by my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you have not been laid in two thousand years? What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow, ow, ow, ow,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe angel set me on my feet, but kept his grasp on my hair. \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means that I haven\u0027t had a woman in two millennia, aren\u0027t you picking up any of the vocabulary from the television?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the TV, which, of course, was on. \"I don\u0027t have your gift of tongues. What does that have to do with choking me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was choking you because you, once again, are as dense as dirt. I haven\u0027t had sex in two thousand years. Men have needs. What the hell do you think I\u0027m doing in the bathroom all of that time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" the angel said, releasing my hair. \"So you are...You have been...There is a...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get me a woman and maybe I won\u0027t spend so much time in the bathroom, if you get my meaning.\" Brilliant misdirection, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A woman? No, I cannot do that. Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet? Does that mean...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh look,\" the angel said, turning from me as if I was no more than vapor, \"General Hospital is starting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, my secret Bible was safe. What did he mean by \"yet\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least this Matthew mentions the Magi. One sentence, but that\u0027s one more than I\u0027ve gotten in his Gospel so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur second day in Jerusalem we went to see the great Rabbi Hillel. (Rabbi means teacher in Hebrew - you knew that, right?) Hillel looked to be a hundred years old, his beard and hair were long and white, and his eyes were clouded over, his irises milk white. His skin was leathery-brown from sitting in the sun and his nose was long and hooked, giving him the aspect of a great, blind eagle. He held class all morning in the outer courtyard of the Temple. We sat quietly, listening to him recite from the Torah and interpret the verses, taking questions and engaging in arguments with the Pharisees, who tried to infuse the Law into every minute detail of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToward the end of Hillel\u0027s morning lectures, Jakan, the camel-sucking husband-to-be of my beloved Maggie, asked Hillel if it would be a sin to eat an egg that had been laid on the Sabbath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you, stupid? The Lord doesn\u0027t give a damn what a chicken does on the Sabbath, you nimrod! It\u0027s a chicken. If a Jew lays an egg on the Sabbath, that\u0027s probably a sin, come see me then. Otherwise don\u0027t waste my friggin\u0027 time with that nonsense. Now go away, I\u0027m hungry and I need a nap. All of you, scram.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua looked at me and grinned. \"He\u0027s not what I expected,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knows a nimrod when he sees - uh - hears one, though,\" I said. (Nimrod was an ancient king who died of suffocation after he wondered aloud in front of his guards what it would be like to have your own head stuck up your ass.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boy younger than us helped the old man to his feet and began to lead him away toward the Temple gate. I ran up and took the priest\u0027s other arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rabbi, my friend has come from far away to talk to you. Can you help him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man stopped. \"Where is your friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why isn\u0027t he talking for himself? Where do you come from, kid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nazareth,\" Joshua said, \"but I was born in Bethlehem. I am Joshua bar Joseph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah, I\u0027ve talked to your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, almost every time she and your father come to Jerusalem for a feast she tries to see me. She thinks you\u0027re the Messiah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua swallowed hard. \"Am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHillel snorted. \"Do you want to be the Messiah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua looked at me as if I might have the answer. I shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know,\" Josh finally said. \"I thought I was just supposed to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think you\u0027re the Messiah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I should say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s smart,\" Hillel said. \"You shouldn\u0027t say. You can think you\u0027re the Messiah all that you want, just don\u0027t tell anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if I don\u0027t tell them, they won\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. You can think you\u0027re a palm tree if you want, just don\u0027t tell anyone. You can think you\u0027re a flock of seagulls, just don\u0027t tell anyone. You get my meaning? Now I have to go eat. I\u0027m old and I\u0027m hungry and I want to go eat now, so just in case I die before supper I won\u0027t go hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he really is the Messiah,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah,\" Hillel said, grabbing my shoulder, then feeling for my head so he could scream into my ear. \"What do you know? You\u0027re an ignorant kid. How old are you? Twelve? Thirteen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you, at thirteen, know anything? I\u0027m eighty-four and I don\u0027t know shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re wise,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m wise enough to know that I don\u0027t know shit. Now go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I ask the Holy of Holies?\" Joshua said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHillel swung at the air, as if to slap Joshua, but missed by a foot. \"It\u0027s a box. I saw it when I could still see, and I can tell you that it\u0027s a box. And you know what else, if there were tablets in it, they aren\u0027t there now. So if you want to talk to a box, and probably be executed for trying to get into the chamber where it\u0027s kept, you go right ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breath seemed to be knocked out of Joshua\u0027s body and I thought he would faint on the spot. How could the greatest teacher in all of Israel speak of the Ark of the Covenant in such a way? How could a man who obviously knew every word of the Torah, and all the teachings written since, how could he claim not to know anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHillel seemed to sense Joshua\u0027s distress. \"Look, kid, your mother says that some very wise men came to Bethlehem to see you when you were born. They obviously knew something that no one else knew. Why don\u0027t you go see them? Ask them about being the Messiah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you aren\u0027t going to tell him how to be the Messiah?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Hillel reached out for Joshua, but this time without any anger. He found Joshua\u0027s cheek, and stroked it with his palsied hand. \"I don\u0027t believe there will be a Messiah, and at this point, I\u0027m not sure it would make a difference to me. Our people have spent more time in slavery or under the heels of foreign kings than we have spent free, so who is to say that it is God\u0027s will that we be free at all? Who is to say that God concerns himself with us in any way, beyond allowing us to be? I don\u0027t think that he does. So know this, little one. Whether you are the Messiah, or you become a rabbi, or even if you are nothing more than a farmer, here is the sum of all I can teach you, and all that I know: treat others as you would like to be treated. Can you remember that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua nodded and the old man smiled. \"Go find your wise men, Joshua bar Joseph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat we did was stay in the Temple while Joshua grilled every priest, guard, even Pharisee about the Magi who had come to Jerusalem thirteen years before. Evidently it wasn\u0027t as big an event for others as it was for Josh\u0027s family, because no one had any idea what he was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he\u0027d been at it for a couple of hours he was literally screaming into the faces of a group of Pharisees. \"Three of them. Magicians. They came because they saw a star over Bethlehem. They were carrying gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Come on, you\u0027re all old. You\u0027re supposed to be wise. Think!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeedless to say, they weren\u0027t pleased. \"Who is this boy who would question our knowledge? He knows nothing of the Torah and the prophets and yet berates us for not remembering three insignificant travelers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the wrong thing to say to Joshua. No one had studied the Torah harder. No one knew scripture better. \"Ask me any question, Pharisee,\" Joshua said. \"Ask anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn retrospect, after having grown up, somewhat, and having lived, died, and been resurrected from the dust, I realize that there may be nothing more obnoxious than a teenager who knows everything. Certainly, it is a symptom of the age that they think they know everything, but now I have some sympathy for those poor men who challenged Joshua that day at the Temple. Of course, at the time, I shouted, \"Smite the sons-a-bitches, Josh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was there for days. Joshua wouldn\u0027t even leave to eat, and I went out into the city to bring him back food. First the Pharisees, but later even some of the priests came to quiz Joshua, to try to throw him some question about some obscure Hebrew king or general. They made him recite the lineages from all the books of the Bible, yet he did not waver. Myself, I left him there to argue while I wandered through the holy city looking for Maggie, then, when I couldn\u0027t find her, for girls in general. I slept at the camp of my parents, assuming all the time that Joshua was returning each night to his own family, but I was wrong. When the Passover feast was over and we were packing up to leave, Mary, Joshua\u0027s mother, came to me in a panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Biff. Have you seen Joshua?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe poor woman was distraught. I wanted to comfort her so I held my arms out to give her a comforting embrace. \"Poor Mary, calm down. Joshua is fine. Come, let me give you a comforting embrace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Biff!\" I thought she might slap me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s at the Temple. Jeez, a guy tries to be compassionate and what does he get?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had already taken off. I caught up to her as she was dragging Joshua out of the Temple by the arm. \"You worried us half to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have known you would find me in my father\u0027s house,\" Joshua said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you pull that \u0027my father\u0027 stuff on me, Joshua bar Joseph. The commandment says honor thy father and thy mother. I\u0027m not feeling honored right now, young man. You could have sent a message, you could have stopped by the camp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua looked at me, his eyes pleading for me to help him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to comfort her, Josh, but she wouldn\u0027t have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater I found the two of them on the road to Nazareth and Joshua motioned for me to walk with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother thinks we may be able to find at least one of the Magi, and if we find that one, he may know where the others are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary nodded, \"The one named Balthasar, the black one, he said he came from a village north of Antioch. He was the only one of the three that spoke any Hebrew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t feel confident. Although I\u0027d never seen a map, \"north of Antioch\" sounded like a large, unspecific, and scary place. \"Is there more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the other two had come from the East by the Silk Road. Their names were Melchior and Gaspar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s off to Antioch,\" Joshua said. He seemed completely satisfied with the information his mother had given him, as if all he needed were the three Magi\u0027s names and he\u0027d as much as found them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You\u0027re going to go to Antioch assuming that someone there will remember a man who may have lived north of there thirteen years ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A magician,\" Mary said. \"A rich, Ethiopian magician. How many can there be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there might not be any, did you think of that? He might have died. He might have moved to another city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case, I will be in Antioch,\" Joshua said. \"From there I can travel the Silk Road until I find the other two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t believe my ears. \"You\u0027re not going alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Josh, you\u0027re helpless out in the world. You only know Nazareth, where people are stupid and poor. No offense, Mary. You\u0027ll be like - uh - like a lamb among wolves. You need me along to watch out for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do you know that I don\u0027t? Your Latin is horrible, your Greek is barely passable, and your Hebrew is atrocious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. If a stranger comes up to you on the road to Antioch and asks you how much money you are carrying, what do you tell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That will depend on how much I am carrying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No it won\u0027t. You haven\u0027t enough for a crust of bread. You are a poor beggar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s not true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary put her arm around her son\u0027s shoulders. \"He has a point, Joshua.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua wrinkled his brow as if he had to think about it, but I could tell that he was relieved that I wanted to go along. \"When do you want to leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did Maggie say she was getting married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before then. I don\u0027t want to be here when it happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me either,\" Joshua said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so we spent the next few weeks preparing for our journey. My father thought I was crazy, but my mother seemed happy to have the extra space in the house and pleased that the family wouldn\u0027t have to put up a bride price to marry me off right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ll be gone how long?\" Mother asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s not a terribly long journey to Antioch, but I don\u0027t know how long we\u0027ll be there. Then we\u0027ll be traveling the Silk Road. I\u0027m guessing that that\u0027s a long journey. I\u0027ve never seen any silk growing around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, take a wool tunic in case it gets cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was all I heard from my mother. Not \"Why are you going?\" Not \"Who are you looking for?\" Just \"Take a wool tunic.\" Jeez. My father was more supportive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can give you a little money to travel with, or we could buy you a donkey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the money would be better. A donkey couldn\u0027t carry both of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who are these fellows you\u0027re looking for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Magicians, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you want to talk to magicians because...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Josh wants to know how to be the Messiah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right. And you believe that Joshua is the Messiah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but more important than that, he\u0027s my friend. I can\u0027t let him go alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what if he\u0027s not the Messiah? What if you find these magicians and they tell you that Joshua is not what you think he is, that he\u0027s just a normal boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027ll really need me to be there, then, won\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father laughed. \"Yes, I guess he will. You come back, Levi, and bring your friend the Messiah with you. Now we\u0027ll have to set three empty places at the table on Passover. One for Elijah, one for my lost son, and one for his pal the Messiah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, don\u0027t seat Joshua next to Elijah. If those guys start talking religion we\u0027ll never have any peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came down to only four days before Maggie\u0027s wedding before Joshua and I accepted that one of us would have to tell her we were leaving. After nearly a whole day of arguing, it fell upon me to go to her. I saw Joshua face down fears in himself that would have broken other men, but taking bad news to Maggie was one he couldn\u0027t overcome. I took the task on myself and tried to leave Joshua with his dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wuss!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I tell her that it\u0027s too painful to watch her marry that toad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, you\u0027re insulting toads everywhere, and second, what makes you think it\u0027s any easier for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re tougher than I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t try that. You can\u0027t just roll over and expect me to not notice that I\u0027m being manipulated. She\u0027s going to cry. I hate it when she cries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Josh said. \"It hurts me too. Too much.\" Then he put his hand on my head and I suddenly felt better, stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t try your Son of God mumbo jumbo on me, you\u0027re still a wuss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it be so, so be it. So it shall be written.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it is now, Josh. It\u0027s written now. (It\u0027s strange, the word \"wuss\" is the same in my ancient Aramaic tongue as it is in this language. Like the word waited for me these two thousand years so I could write it down here. Strange.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie was washing clothes in the square with a bunch of other women. I caught her attention by jumping on the shoulders of my friend Bartholomew, who was gleefully exposing himself for the viewing pleasure of the Nazarene wives. With a subtle toss of my head I signaled to Maggie to meet me behind a nearby stand of date palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Behind those trees?\" Maggie shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bringing the idiot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said, and she handed her washing to one of her younger sisters and scampered to the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised to see her smiling so close to the time of her wedding. She hugged me and I could feel the heat rise in my face, either from shame or love, like there was a difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re in a good mood,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? I\u0027m using them all up before the wedding. Speaking of which, what are you two bringing me for a present? It had better be good if it\u0027s going to make up for who I have to marry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was joyful and there was music and laughter in her voice, pure Maggie, but I had to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I was only joking,\" she said. \"You guys don\u0027t need to bring me anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re leaving, Maggie. We won\u0027t be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed my shoulder and forced me to face her. \"You\u0027re leaving? You and Joshua? You\u0027re going away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, before your wedding. We\u0027re going to Antioch, and from there far into the East along the Silk Road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing. Tears welled up in her eyes and I could feel them rising in mine as well. This time she turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should have told you before, I know, but really we only decided at Passover. Joshua is going to find the Magi who came to his birth, and I\u0027m going with him because I have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wheeled on me. \"You have to? You have to? You don\u0027t have to. You can stay and be my friend and come to my wedding and sneak down to talk to me here or in the vineyard and we can laugh and tease and no matter how horrible it is being married to Jakan, I\u0027ll have that. I\u0027ll at least have that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt as if I\u0027d be sick to my stomach any second. I wanted to tell her that I\u0027d stay, that I\u0027d wait, that if there was the slightest chance that her life wasn\u0027t going to be a desert in the arms of her creep husband that I could hold hope. I wanted to do whatever I could to take away even a little bit of her pain, even up to letting Joshua go by himself, but in thinking that, I realized that Joshua must have been feeling the same thing, so all I said was \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about Joshua, wasn\u0027t he even going to say good-bye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wanted to, but he couldn\u0027t. Neither of us can, I mean, we didn\u0027t want to have to watch you marry Jakan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cowards. You two deserve each other. You can hide behind each other like Greek boys. Just go. Get away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to think of something to say, but my mind was a soup of confusion so I hung my head and walked away. I was almost out of the square when Maggie caught up to me. I heard her footsteps and turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him to meet me behind the synagogue, Biff. The night before my wedding, an hour after sunset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure, Maggie, he - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him,\" she said. She ran back to the well without looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I told Joshua, and on the night before Maggie\u0027s wedding, the night before we were to leave on our journey, Joshua packed some bread and cheese and a skin of wine and told me to meet him by the date palms in the square where we would share supper together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to go,\" Joshua said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going. In the morning, when you do. What, you think I\u0027d back out now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, tonight. You have to go to Maggie. I can\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I mean, why?\" Sure I\u0027d been heartbroken when Maggie had asked to see Joshua and not me, but I\u0027d come to terms with it. Well, as well as one ever comes to terms with an ongoing heartbreak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to take my place, Biff. There\u0027s almost no moon tonight, and we are about the same size. Just don\u0027t say much and she\u0027ll think it\u0027s me. Maybe not as smart as normal, but she can put that down to worry over the upcoming journey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to see Maggie, but she wants to see you, why can\u0027t you go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really don\u0027t know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then just take my word for it. You\u0027ll see. Will you do this for me, Biff? Will you take my place, pretend to be me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be lying. You never lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027re getting righteous on me? I won\u0027t be lying. You will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. In that case, I\u0027ll go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there wasn\u0027t even time to deceive. It was so dark that night that I had to make my way slowly through the village by starlight alone, and as I rounded the corner to the back of our small synagogue I was hit with a wave of sandalwood and lemon and girl sweat, of warm skin, a wet mouth over mine, arms around my back and legs around my waist. I fell backward on the ground and there was in my head a bright light, and the rest of the world existed in the senses of touch and smell and God. There, on the ground behind the synagogue, Maggie and I indulged desires we had carried for years, mine for her, and hers for Joshua. That neither of us knew what we were doing made no difference. It was pure and it happened and it was marvelous. And when we finished we lay there holding each other, half dressed, breathless, and sweating, and Maggie said, \"I love you, Joshua.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Maggie,\" I said. And ever so slightly she loosened her embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t marry Jakan without - I couldn\u0027t let you go without - without letting you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows, Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she really pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Biff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-oh.\" I thought she might scream, that she might leap up and run away, that she might do any one of a hundred things to take me from heaven to hell, but after only a second she nuzzled close to me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for being here,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left at dawn, and our fathers walked with us as far as the gates of Sepphoris. When we parted at the gates my father gave me a hammer and chisel to carry with me in my satchel. \"With that you can make enough for a meal anywhere you go,\" my father said. Joseph gave Joshua a wooden bowl. \"Out of that you can eat the meal that Biff earns.\" He grinned at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the gates of Sepphoris I kissed my father for the last time. By the gates of Sepphoris we left our fathers behind and went out into the world to find three wise men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come back, Joshua, and make us free,\" Joseph shouted to our backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go with God,\" my own father said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, I am,\" I shouted. \"He\u0027s right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua said nothing until the sun was high in the sky and we stopped to share a drink of water. \"Well?\" Joshua said. \"Did she know it was you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Not at first, but before we parted. She knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she angry at me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she angry at you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dog!\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really should ask that angel what he meant about you not knowing a woman, Joshua. It\u0027s really important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know now why I couldn\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll miss her,\" Joshua said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no idea,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every detail. I want to know every detail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you aren\u0027t supposed to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what the angel meant. Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now. Not while I can still smell her on my arms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua kicked at the dirt. \"Am I angry with you, or happy for you, or jealous of you? I don\u0027t know? Tell me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh, right now, for the first time I can remember, I\u0027m happier being your friend than I would be being you. Can I have that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, thinking about that night with Maggie behind the synagogue, where we stayed together until it was nearly dawn, where we made love again and again and fell asleep naked on top of our clothes - now, when I think of that, I want to run away from here, this room, this angel and his task, find a lake, dive down, and hide from the eye of God in the dark muck on the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lamb-the-gospel-according-to-biff-christ-s-childhood-pal/page-8.html","bookId":2643,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:20 PM"}
