I turned toward her doorway, and Laurel said, “Just go to your banquet, Jere. I’ve got it covered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. “Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A thousand percent. Beat it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sped all the way to Mara’s house. She came out as soon as I pulled into her driveway. She was wearing that red dress I liked and she looked nice, and I was about to tell her so, but then she said, “You’re late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut my mouth. Mara didn’t speak to me for the rest of the night, not even when we won Cutest Couple. She didn’t feel like going to Patan’s party afterward and neither did I. The whole time we were out, I was thinking about my mom and feeling guilty for being gone so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got to Mara’s house, she didn’t get out right away, which was her signal that she wanted to talk. I shut off the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, what’s up? Are you still mad at me for being late, Mar?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked pained. “I just want to know if we’re going to stay together. Can you just tell me what you want to do, and then we’ll do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honestly, I can’t really think about this kind of stuff right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But if I was going to have to say whether or not I think we’ll be together when we’re at school in the fall, long distance—” I hesitated, and then I just said it. “I would probably say no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara started crying, and I felt like a real piece of shit. I should’ve just lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what I thought,” she said. Then she kissed me on the cheek and ran out of the car and into her house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that’s how we broke up. If I’m going to be completely honest, I’ll admit that it was a relief not to have to think about Mara anymore. The only person I had room in my head for was my mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got home, my mom and Laurel were still up playing cards and listening to music. For the first time in days, I heard my mom laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel didn’t leave the next day. She stayed all week. At the time, I didn’t wonder about her job, or all the other stuff she had going on at home. I was just grateful to have an adult around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter thirty-eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us walked back to the house. The sun was hot on my back and I thought about how nice it would be to lay out on the beach for a while, to sleep the afternoon away and wake up tan. But there wasn’t any time for that, not when we needed to get Conrad ready for his midterms by tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got inside, Conrad fell onto the couch and Jeremiah sprawled out on the floor. “So tired,” he moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat my mother did for us, for me, was a gift. Now it was my turn to give one back. “Get up,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of them moved. Conrad’s eyes were closed. So I threw a pillow at Conrad and jabbed Jeremiah in the stomach with my foot. “We have to start studying, you lazy bums. Now get up!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad opened his eyes. “I’m too tired to study. I need to take a power nap first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too,” Jeremiah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing my arms, I glared at them and said, “I’m tired too, you know. But look at the clock; it’s already one. We’re gonna have to work all night and leave really early tomorrow morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging, Conrad said, “I work best under pressure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously, Belly. I can’t work like this. Just let me sleep for an hour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah was already falling asleep. I sighed. I couldn’t fight the both of them. “Fine. One hour. But that’s it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stalked into the kitchen and poured myself a Coke. I was tempted to take a nap too, but that would be setting the wrong example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile they slept, I kicked the plan into gear. I got Conrad’s books out of the car, brought his laptop downstairs, and set up the kitchen like a study room. I plugged in lamps, stacked books and binders according to subject, put out pens and paper. Last, I brewed a big pot of coffee, and even though I didn’t drink coffee, I knew mine was good, because I brewed a pot for my mother every morning. Then I took Jeremiah’s car and drove to McDonald’s to pick up cheeseburgers. They loved McDonald’s cheeseburgers. They used to have cheeseburger-eating contests and they’d stack them up like pancakes. Sometimes they let me play too. One time, I won. I ate nine cheeseburgers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let them sleep an extra half hour—but only because it took me that long to get things set up. Then I filled up Susannah’s spray bottle, the one she’d used to water her more delicate plants. I sprayed Conrad first, right in the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” he said, waking up right away. He wiped his face with the bottom of his T-shirt, and I gave him another spray just because.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rise and shine,” I sang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I walked over to Jeremiah and sprayed him, too. He didn’t wake up though. He had always been impossible to wake up. He could sleep through a tidal wave. I sprayed and sprayed and when he just rolled over, I unscrewed the top of the bottle and poured the water right down the back of his T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally woke up and stretched his arms out, still lying down on the floor. He gave me a slow grin, like he was used to being woken up this way. “Morning,” he said. Jeremiah might have been hard to wake up, but he was never a grouch when he finally did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not morning. It’s almost three o’clock in the afternoon. I let you guys sleep an extra half an hour so you better be grateful,” I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am,” Jeremiah said, reaching his arm out for me to help him up. I grudgingly gave him my hand and helped heft him up. “Come on,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed me into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the—,” Conrad said, looking around the room at all his things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah clapped his hands together and then he held one hand up for a high five, which I gave him. “You’re amazing,” he said. Then he sniffed and spotted the greasy white McDonald’s bag and lit up. “Yes! Mickey D’s cheeseburgers! I’d know that smell anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smacked his hand away. “Not yet. There is a reward system in place here. Conrad studies, and then he gets food.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah frowned. “What about me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Conrad studies, and you get food.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad raised his eyebrows at me. “A reward system, huh? What else do I get?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flushed. “Just the cheeseburgers.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-not-summer-without-you-summer-2/page-44.html","bookId":2724,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM"}
