Fifty thousand bloodstained dollars in tight bundles. Another big chunk of Ruger’s drug money. Polk had counted the money and as he turned over each bill he saw at least one drop of old, dried blood. Fifty thousand dollars, and a half-pound bag of coke to sweeten the deal. And the note: FOR SERVICES RENDERED. Vic’s little joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic has smirked as he handed it over, had given Polk a neat little bow and a sly wink, like he was giving a dollar to a kid, sending him off to the movies so he could screw his big sister. That kind of a sly wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottle was almost empty and so was Polk. He nursed the whiskey and listened to the Dead and watching the dying outside. Beside him the pistol ached to be held, it longed to be kissed. There should always be a last kiss, he reflected, after you’ve collected your blood money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight Pine Deep’s Dead End Drive-In lived up to its name. Every single car was an island of death. Shattered windows, doors standing open, upholstery splashed with blood, the gravel around the cars littered with shreds of torn clothing, cracked eyeglasses, broken cell phones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePine Deep’s nature made the slaughter so successful; the tourists believed what was happening was a joke, all part of the show. By the time the truth of it was impossible to deny, half of the them were dead; the rest fled and were hunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps because he was on a stage and had a different perspective on the events as they unfolded, or perhaps he’d been in too many movies that dealt with this exact sort of thing, Ken Foree alone managed to keep his head. He knew the difference between stunts and real violence. When he witnessed the slaughter he knew that this was no stunt. He didn’t know what it was, but it was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs one of the mindless Dead Heads began crawling over the edge of the stage, Foree snatched up the heavy microphone stand and swung the weighted steel base with every ounce of strength he possessed. The disk-shaped base crushed the creature’s skull. As it fell dead, he leapt down from the stage and charged the second creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen that one went down he started shouting for the patrons to run, and when those who could still move got into gear he led them in a mad dash to the projection booth. He was able to cram eighty people in the concrete pillbox. That’s all that could make it before he had to slam the steel door in the face of five more of the shambling killers. The projection window had metal shutters, and Foree slammed them shut and threw the slide bolts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creatures beat on the door and screamed in rage and hunger. The people packed inside screamed, huddling down in the dark, pressing their hands to their ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe person nearest him clutched his sleeve. “Can they get in?” she begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said, “no, they can’t get in.” He hoped he wasn’t lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow pointed his shotgun directly at Ruger’s grinning face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead, hotshot—splatter me and you splatter junior here.” Ruger gave the kid a fierce shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside Crow, LaMastra braced himself against the wall and aimed down the stairs at the four vampires who clustered at the lower landing. Five others milled hungrily behind Ruger. The trap was a good one and they had walked right into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, well,” murmured Ruger, “this is a hoot. I’m so happy to see you I could shit daffodils.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child, a thin boy of about nine, struggled against the white hands that held him, but he might as well have been trying to work loose from iron shackles. The killer kept one arm wrapped around the kid’s body, pinning his arms; with the other hand he traced little lines across the boy’s slender throat. The kid winced and wriggled helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let him go,” Crow said, twitching the barrel of the shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure, I’ll get right on that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let him go and then you can have me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuger shook his head. “I already have you, asshole. Both of you. And soon as I’m done kicking your ass I’m going to go upstairs and take that broke-nose bitch of yours. Oh, don’t look surprised. You think I don’t know she’s here? I can smell that piece of farm-girl snatch a mile off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to kill you,” Crow said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What…again?” Everyone laughed at that except the living. “Unless you haven’t figured it out by now, dickweed, you can’t kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Third time’s the charm, Karl. Let the boy go, then you and me can dance a bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or,” Ruger said, enjoying this, “we could just tear your arms off and beat you with them. Really, no joke. We’ve already done that tonight. Twice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three times, boss,” someone said, and they all cracked up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crow…” LaMastra said under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me something, Karl…what’s with all the fireworks and shit. What’s the point? This part of some bullshit evil master plan? You think tearing down a small town like this makes you—what, some kind of vampire king or some shit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuger pretended to be interested. “Actually we do have a master plan. And, funnily enough, it’s actually pretty darned evil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? Like what? You take over Pine Deep and then you turn it into a vampire tourist trap?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, dumbass, we take over Pine Deep and then we take over the whole shitting world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Crow’s turn to laugh. “Yeah, right. And when the National Guard start dropping napalm on your ass, what then? You going to hide behind a kid then, too, you cowardly piece of shit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuger’s smile didn’t falter. “Don’t worry, boy, we have plans for that. The Man has plans for everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. Put the kid down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blow me.” Ruger gave the kid’s throat a quick squeeze; the kid winced again, his face screwed up; he bared his teeth as he fought against the killer’s iron grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crow…” LaMastra said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be a pussy, Karl. You’re supposed to be the übertough guy…put the kid down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, can’t do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuger pushed the kid forward and took a step down toward Crow. Below, the vampires moved up a couple of steps, smiling at how Ruger was playing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaMastra flinched away from them so that he and Crow were tight back-to-back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rock and a hard place,” mocked the killer. “You can’t kill the kid, and that popgun can’t kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be too sure,” Crow said, putting some edge to his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuger’s smile flickered just the faintest bit. “Well, well, you think you have some kind of secret weapon to use against the big bad vampires. Oooo…scary. Look at me ready to piss myself I’m so scared.” He jostled the kid as he took another step. “Let me guess…silver bullets?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not that dumb, Karl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not that smart. So…what is it? Holy water? I wash my dick with holy water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take a sniff, jackass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe killer’s smile flickered again, longer this time. The other vampires shifted uncomfortably, and still they all took another step down toward Crow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, well, you still can’t shoot, smartass.” Ruger lifted the kid off the floor to provide maximum coverage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch me,” Crow said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he fired the shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuger was startled, but he was fast. So incredibly fast. He watched Crow’s eyes, saw the tightening of his finger, and then he threw the boy at Crow as he dodged sideways. The blast caught the kid in the chest and flung his small body backward against the other vampires. Ruger ducked back behind one of the others, shoving two of them into the path of Crow’s next shot. Then he was gone up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“NO!” screamed LaMastra as he watched the child’s body tumble down the stairs. The vampires stared, as stunned as the detective was, but Crow jacked a round and the sound of it broke the tableau. He fired and the closest vampire was hurled back against the other, his face torn away. Garlic-soaked pellets hit the creatures behind them and they screamed in fear and agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow spun around and fired past LaMastra down the stairs. “Vince! Snap the hell out of it! Kill the bastards!” He fired again and that broke the detective’s trance. They both opened up as the vampires, caught between Ruger’s orders and the reality that these men had weapons that could kill their kind, hesitated. That was enough for Crow. In the narrow confines of the stairwell the two shotguns cut them to ribbons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was over except for the echoes of thunder that rolled up and down the concrete tower. Crow sagged back and sat down hard on the blood-slick steps, not caring that he sat between the outstretched legs of a dead monster. LaMastra stood over him, chest heaving as he stared at the carnage. He shifted the shotgun to his left hand, grabbed Crow by the front of the shirt, jerked him to his feet, and slammed him against the wall with such force that Crow felt the world explode in a blinding fireworks display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bastard!” he screamed. “You sick murderous bastard!” With each word he banged Crow against the blood-splattered wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vince…!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should have let that son of a bitch kill you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vince!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shot that kid!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow had just about enough of it. As LaMastra hauled him forward and began to slam him back again, Crow crunched the stock of the shotgun hard against the side of LaMastra’s ribs and at the same time pivoted his whole body sharply around. The speed of the pivot and the force of the blow spun LaMastra into the wall; then it was the sergeant who crashed into the wall, and Crow brought the barrel of his shotgun up under LaMastra’s chin hard enough to lift the detective onto his toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The kid was already dead, you stupid shit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaMastra blinked. “W—what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was a vampire! He was part of Ruger’s trap. Christ, do you think I’d actually kill a kid, for Christ’s sake?” He stepped back, resisting the urge to butt-stroke LaMastra with the shotgun stock, but he knew that would only be transference for what he was feeling. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-moon-rising-pine-deep-3/page-75.html","bookId":2569,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:26 PM"}
