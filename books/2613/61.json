Using my hand, she picked up the pink rubber glove. Her voice spoke in my mind. I will honor your wishes—for now—taking this glove as a signal you wish to have this body to yourself. But it is only through my courtesy. The time is coming when, whatever either of us wishes, we must work together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sparkling fingers still tingled with power. As I pulled the glove over them, I knew I was doing so only with Ceridwen’s permission. The goddess’s voice faded, yet her words were distinct. Two more gifts have I given you today: your privacy and the child’s life. Do not take them for granted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I felt the threat that laced her tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t realize how badly my hands were shaking until Kane took both of them in his. “Are you all right?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA goddess had taken up residence in my body and was keeping count of the “gifts” she’d bestowed upon me—each one, I was sure, with miles of strings attached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Hellion, its essence still burned into my arm, laid claim to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Old Ones remained at large. Tina was missing. Mab’s bloodstone had shattered. The war between the realms still loomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet somehow, with Kane’s hands holding mine, I could look into his eyes and believe that nothing was insurmountable. No trace of tortured hellhound lingered in those gray eyes. In them, I saw intelligence and loyalty, steadiness and strength. I saw belief in me. I saw love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever was coming, we’d face it together. How many times had he told me that? But now I could see it. And I think he saw the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I said. “I’m all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if there was any hint of contradiction—a whisper in my mind, a twinge in my demon mark—I didn’t pay attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane put his arm around me.
