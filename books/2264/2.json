It was like they were bouncing around in the hollowed walls that were once my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head and neck were soaked from their tears as wails of the word \"Mommy\" filled my dark hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe moved like an ocean of misery, rocking and swaying into each other, like we rode painful torrents of heartache. The blinding pain inside of me would never go away. Betrayal was a terrible feeling; it overshadowed the grief tenfold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, babies,\" I whispered when I ran out of tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you too. Can we go home and have eggs?\" Jules asked and wiped her little chubby cheeks. She was so matter-of-fact. I laughed and wiped my face. I could at least be grateful, their pain was never going to be as bad as mine was. I would guarantee they would be spared the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sniffled and smiled and tried to be strong the whole ride home. I parked the van in the driveway and looked at my house. It was nice—fancy even. We lived a good life. I was grateful at least all of that would still be there… our life that we built together. We were two crazy military intelligence officers who fell in love and got pregnant and then married. We were happy against all of the odds that everyone believed would destroy our marriage. No one believed I could be capable of being a housewife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had been cocky in our ability to make a marriage out of nothing; it had been easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, that was because it was a façade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was gone forever, but it still broke my heart every time I saw it in my mind. The fake him with the fake smile would have to live on in our children. My heart was no longer going to allow him to take up space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to shut him out of it. I had to let him and his filth die together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed out of the van and looked at the ringette and hockey gear against the other door. How would I afford it all? The money from the insurance was going to have to last the year until Jules started school full-time and then the rest would have to go to their schooling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the gear and shook my head. Baseball, soccer, dancing, skating, ringette, swimming and hockey. Two kids who played two sports a season. It never felt like too much before, but that was before I needed time scheduled for my daily dose of self-pity and a nap. I closed the van and added it to the list of shit I still didn’t have a plan for, which was everything. I wasn’t going to make it past his funeral, I was sure of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom opened the door and smiled at me. She hugged Jules and rubbed Mitch\u0027s head. She was my godsend. I wished Dad were there for the second I had to watch them embracing. Her eyes were sweet and kind, soft brown and gentle, but they looked worried. She nodded at me, \"There is a man in the office. A Mr. Wilkes. He was James\u0027 attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed and cringed inwardly. I didn’t want to see anyone. I wanted a hot bath and a glass of red and to be left with my tears and my plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know a Mr. Wilkes,\" I said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he’s in the office. I\u0027ll make them some supper.\" She pulled the kids in the house and smiled at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I called after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and walked away, \"Worry about the important stuff, Evie.\" She walked into the kitchen and started making noise. The kid’s spoke to her about their day, she made things normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed my coat down and walked down the hall to the office. I swallowed and opened the door to the study. An older man with glasses and a wrinkled face put his fingers to his lips, like he was pretending to scratch, \"Mrs. Evans, it\u0027s so nice to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t understand, but I went along with it and nodded, \"Yes. How are you?\" The question felt forced and awkward. I hadn’t played this game in a long time, and just the thought of it made my insides ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled gently and placed a package in my hands. He leaned in and whispered softly, \"Meet me outside in five minutes. We can take a walk. Don\u0027t bring the package. Leave it in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach sunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled back and spoke in a loud voice, \"Everything you need is in the package; the instructions are there. Everything is explained. Have a nice evening.\" He nodded and walked from the room. He was the first person not to tell me he was sorry for my loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the door and I took a deep breath. I looked around the room and wondered what he was whispering for, who he was, and what on earth I was holding? Was I being brought back in? Could they do that? Could I do it? It would solve my money issues, but I needed to be a mom for my children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and sat in the chair behind me; the government could do anything they wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis whispering and telling me not to bring the envelope, made me wonder if it was bugged. I could only assume if it was bugged, I was being brought back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sickness rolling around inside of me, as I slid my finger along the taped edge and braced myself for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared down into the huge envelope. It contained three small things; a phone, a Visa card, and a smaller envelope. The name on the Visa was an old name I had used once in Bangladesh, on a mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy world spun. I felt as if I were outside of myself looking in. I stared at the name so long, my eyes fuzzed out on the letter. Macy Green…she was a dead travel agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened, making me jump up as I placed the envelope on the shelf next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want dinner too?\" Mom asked, giving me a weird smile. She looked around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and walked past her, \"I need some air.\" I walked down the hall and grabbed my coat. I pulled it on and looked back at her, \"Be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head and watched me for a second, before her kind look returned. She knew the routine. I could see it in her eyes. She had played this game for a long time too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned in and kissed her cheek, \"Thanks.\" What I didn’t say was thanks for not asking and not needing to know. She never did, even when it had been my dad with the secrets and lies. She smiled and pretended everything was fine. She trusted. I couldn’t help but wonder, which parent had been right. The blind one who smiled through it all, or the one building the wall of bullshit. Having been on both sides, I preferred to know what I was facing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands wrapped around my head, squeezing and holding me there, with a tremble. She whispered, \"Hurry back. I\u0027ll keep a plate warm for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled back and walked through the front door. Mr. Wilkes waited across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDressed in a trench coat and dark slacks, he looked like a lawyer, but I didn’t know what to expect from him. He could be one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy arms crept across my body, wrapping around me before I could even stop myself. I was holding myself together. I was vulnerable. I didn’t need to hide it; he already knew it, if he had been watching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’re in a situation,\" his bold words stunned me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped and watched his face for a sign of anger or violence. I would have to run, I was pretty sure I couldn’t fight anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for me to hear his words and process them before he continued, \"I\u0027m not sure what your husband did for a living, beyond his day job. I\u0027m not sure what you know, but I am sure you\u0027re in a terrible bind.\" He started walking away from me but continued talking as he walked, \"He has left you a rather large pile to clean up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jogged and caught up, \"What do you mean?\" Am I not being brought back in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"I can\u0027t say, but I do know that there is a man who requested that package be delivered to you. Your husband owed him everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed hard and tried to imagine how that was possible. Had he been gambling? After the other deeds I had learned about, gambling seemed like a rather small thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me with emotions filling his stare, \"The man who now owns you…is trouble.\" He looked around us, nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, \"No one owns me, Mr. Wilkes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored me and continued, \"He is the worst of the worst. He owns your house, your van, your life. He has information on you, crucial information. He can make it look like you have done things. I have seen it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped walking. The words wouldn’t sink in, I wouldn’t let them. I didn’t have any responses. I was already over my head in the debris my marriage had created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced back at me casually, \"Do you understand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at my neighbor\u0027s houses and turned around, \"Your husband did something. I don’t know what. But the man who sent that package, is the one who now owns your life. You\u0027re alive because he says it\u0027s okay for you to be alive.\" He looked wicked in the gloomy, dim light of dusk, as it fell upon my lush and rich neighborhood. It felt clandestine—something I had not felt in a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, \"What?\" Of course, I had heard of it. People disappearing because of the intel they had or being tried as traitors for crimes we all knew they hadn’t committed. It was like the military’s version of a ghost story. \"Is the man military?\" I asked. I could be tried as a traitor for the things I had done before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"I would imagine something along those lines, or drugs, or weaponry. I am guessing, but I\u0027m just a lawyer and a messenger.\" His words remained cold, but his eyes warmed to me. He took a step forward and put his hands on my arms. He gripped and looked into my eyes deeply, \"You are in danger. Your husband is dead and his debt is now yours. Do you understand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy military training slowly crept back in. I nodded, like a good soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, but I could see the panic in his eyes, \"You have tonight to run. Take your kids and your mother and run. Be fast and silent and find a new life. You know how to do it. You know how to disappear. As of Sunday, they\u0027re coming for you. You will be contacted either by that phone or by messenger at your dead husband\u0027s funeral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a step back, \"What am I going to do?\" My heart was in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head and I watched him shut the emotion off, \"I wanted to warn you. I knew your father. He was a good man and because of him, I wanted you to have the chance to run. I know very little of the details. What I do know is, if you get wrapped up in this, it will be bad for you. You and your kids and your dear mother.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-2.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
