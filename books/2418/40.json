Nobody\u0027s making you a new identity this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a one-night head start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to get up, but I caught her wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur eyes locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it to you, Tres?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People leave things behind by accident,\" I said. \"But not you. Not that journal. Not the photograph George must\u0027ve found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tugged against my grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You left a trail,\" I said, \"because you wanted to. You run again, you\u0027ll just leave another trail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absurd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it yourself, Ines. You don\u0027t get away without a fight. You haven\u0027t had yours yet. Turn around and face what you left behind, take the consequences. Or you can run away again, talk tough about how you\u0027re somebody new, somebody who doesn\u0027t need help. If you\u0027re somebody new, then maldicion. You and Sandra Mara would\u0027ve gotten along just fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flashed murderously. \"I won\u0027t risk my child. You can\u0027t promise Michael will be safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at your son. Tell me he\u0027s safe right now, in that cave he\u0027s been making.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God damn you,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody can guarantee Michael will be safe, Ines. You might as well realize it here, where you\u0027ve got some friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I — I can\u0027t, Tres. I wish—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of little sneakers hushed her. The boys crashed into us, showing off their spoils. Their arms glittered with holographic stickers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let go of Ines\u0027 wrist and forced a smile. I complimented Jem on his Felix the Cat. The waitress brought our check and left us with a few more admonishing comments about what nice boys we had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael climbed onto his mother\u0027s lap. He was a little large for the task, but he just about managed a fetal position. He tucked his head against Ines\u0027 chest and began picking at a silvery low-rider decal on his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go home,\" he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes stroked his hair. Sweat had plastered it into curls over his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will,\" she promised. \"It\u0027ll be like a sleep-over. In the new apartment. And\u0026nbsp; tomorrow—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael turned his face into her bright shirt, rubbed his nose back and forth, then looked up at her again. \"No. Home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You took it down, I bet,\" he muttered. \"You said you wouldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes\u0027 hand closed over Michael\u0027s on her chest. Her mouth began to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael,\" I said. \"We\u0027re inviting you and your mom over to Jem\u0027s house,\u0026nbsp; kiddo. You can have your sleep-over there. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurled against his mother, Michael just looked at me, his eyes as pale blue as his murdered father\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem, however, perked up instantly. He started filling Michael in on all the games they could play once they got into his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart—\" Ines interrupted hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Michael didn\u0027t want to hear her. He was too busy listening to Jem\u0027s descriptions of Sega-Wonderland. The little frown didn\u0027t leave his face, but he kept his eyes on Jem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Ines. \"If you can\u0027t beat them...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes for one second, two. When she looked at me again, I couldn\u0027t shake the impression that her irises were dark, fractured prisms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps just for tonight,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem and I rode together in the Barracuda, leading the way back toward Erainya\u0027s. Every few seconds, I checked the rearview mirror. Each time I was surprised to find Ines\u0027 headlights still behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we drove, Jem told me how super-funny Michael was. Jem wanted to make a sheet cave like his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s the best idea, Bubba.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem disagreed. He told me how cool Michael\u0027s setup had been inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said Michael had been trying to make the cave bigger and bigger, so that someday he would never have to come back out again. Someday, Michael would close up the entrance and just disappear. It hadn\u0027t worked out that way, but Jem still figured it was a great plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Bubba,\" I told him. \"I think maybe Michael\u0027s mom was right to take down the sheets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem was unconvinced. He said that, according to Michael, that wasn\u0027t even his real mom. His real mom had disappeared down the sheet cave years and years and years ago. That\u0027s where Michael had been going — following his mom into the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlans were discussed. Erainya cursed and slapped the air a lot. Jem and Michael were sent off to play video games. Ines was force-fed a platter of Greek food to make up for the dinner she hadn\u0027t eaten, then browbeaten into taking the main bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Ines was changing clothes and the children were playing in Jem\u0027s room, Erainya broke out a Heineken and the keys to her gun cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" Erainya said to me. \"You go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI insisted on checking the boys one more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough his bedroom doorway, I watched Jem sitting at his PlayStation, engrossed in a 3-D jungle with flying, basketball-dribbling dinosaurs. Michael wasn\u0027t participating. He sat cross-legged a few feet behind Jem, a stack of Jem\u0027s old Nickelodeon magazines and toy-store circulars by his side. Michael was cutting out the pictures with safety scissors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove slowly all the way home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at 90 Queen Anne, I stared reluctantly at the phone for several minutes, then called Ana DeLeon\u0027s work number, got her voice mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left a cryptic message — I had new information, I might be able to share it soon, but first we needed to talk. Preferably over another pitcher of margaritas. DeLeon didn\u0027t call back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Brooke Army Medical Center. No change in George\u0027s condition. Then I lay down on my futon and burned my eyes out reading The Woman in White. By page 200, I still couldn\u0027t fall asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it would\u0027ve been easier if the Suitez family across the street had had another party and lulled me with the familiar sounds of Freddy Fender or Narcisco Martinez. Or if Mrs. Geradino\u0027s Chihuahuas had yapped at the moon. Or if Gary Hales\u0027 upstairs TV had blared out a John Wayne movie on the night-owl theater. These noises I could\u0027ve dealt with. But not dead quiet on a Saturday night in San Antonio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Johnson had no insomnia worries. He\u0027d curled up happily on my crotch, closed his eyes, and proceeded to increase his body temperature by a hundred degrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the ceiling. I counted the inches that the moonlight advanced across my wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the ventilator in George\u0027s hospital room, about Zeta lying in his jail cell, looking out olive-green bars at more rows of olive-green bars, his eyes empty and maybe his thoughts just as hollow. I thought of Ana DeLeon the night before, in those few moments when the ice in her demeanor had melted. Mostly, I thought about Ines and Michael Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I slid Robert Johnson as gently as I could off my crotch. I got up and dressed — black sweats, black T-shirt, black Nikes, a fanny pack with a few select tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rumble of the Barracuda\u0027s engine seemed obscenely loud in the nighttime quiet. I headed down Broadway, past a group of low-rider Chevies in the Lions Club lot, a few teenagers smoking and talking outside Taco Cabana, the usual late-night crowd at Earl Abel\u0027s Coffee Shop. Otherwise, the town had shut down. I drove south, under I-35, past Southern Music, then turned right on Jones. Unless Del Brandon had another nighttime transaction under way, I planned on resolving some unanswered questions tonight. If possible, I also planned on finding something I could use to nail Del Brandon\u0027s fat ass to his Super-Whirl. RideWorks looked closed up, even the office. There were no cars on the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI parked at the gates, got out of the car, and was just examining the chain and padlock when headlights swung onto Camden behind me, about fifty yards back. The obvious didn\u0027t occur to me — that I should get back in the Barracuda and get the hell out of there. Instead, stupidly, I squandered five or six seconds watching the white van pull up alongside the Barracuda. Before it had even come to a stop the side door slid open and five Latino men unloaded. One was Chicharron — still a Child of the Night in his black leather and silver, his trench coat conveniently covering the damage Ralph\u0027s fan-throwing practice had done to his arms. The self-confident burn in Chich\u0027s eyes told me he\u0027d coked himself up just enough to make this encounter enjoyably bloody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis four friends were the teenagers I\u0027d met at the Poco Mas — Porkpie, with the hat and loose-cut cholo threads, his Taurus P-11 drawn with no preliminaries this time. The other three formed a right flank — all smooth young faces and wispy black beards, jeans, white tank tops, expensive sneakers. I focused on little differences — one had a hairnet. One a gold nose ring. The third held a length of bike gear chain. No visible guns except for Porkpie\u0027s. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you\u0027re a professor.\" Chicharron smiled at me with what looked like artificially pointed teeth. \"For a teacher, you learn slow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said nothing. With Porkpie\u0027s Taurus trained on me, there didn\u0027t seem much point, I chose to stay standing, back to the gate, arms free, George\u0027s car between me and them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChich kept smiling, measuring me. He wouldn\u0027t be sure if I was carrying a gun or not, if I were alone or not. He\u0027d want to be sure my situation was really as hopeless as it looked, that I\u0027d truly been stupid enough to drive out here on my own, unarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured toward the Barracuda. \"Nice wheels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nice guy used to drive them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNosering cracked his knuckles. Hairnet and his friend with the gear chain both glanced over at the vampire, waiting for a signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny,\" Chich said. \"I start asking around, I didn\u0027t have no problem finding some people wanted to hurt you. Maybe we do you, then we go looking for your friend Ralph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorkpie said, \"One round. Chest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChich held up his fingers for patience. His smile widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You scared of the odds?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy only chance was to keep it close-range, keep them thinking I was a nothing job — blood sport. And then hope like hell to surprise them. The private eye as moron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorkpie chambered a round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah,\" Chich said. \"Get him in the van.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe news that they preferred me alive failed to comfort me. It only meant they preferred the bloodstain to be somewhere of their choosing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHairnet and Bikechain went around either side of the Barracuda. Nosering pulled a blackjack. He opened my passenger\u0027s-side door, stepping onto the seat like it was a doormat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChicharron leaned against his van and watched. Porkpie\u0027s gun kept making a warm spot in my gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no intention of waiting to be surrounded on three sides. I stepped toward the hood of the Barracuda to meet Bikechain. He was the least prepared, his hands committed to the chain, probably thinking he would garrote me while I was busy with the others. Before he could change his strategy I feinted a punch at his face, forced his hands up, then shoulder-butted him in the sternum with my full body weight. I turned and ducked as his friend\u0027s blackjack slashed air next to my ear. I grabbed the blackjacker\u0027s pierced nose between my thumb and forefinger and yanked. The blackjacker screamed, dropped his sap. I dropped the bloody nose ring, then rolled the guy with the hairnet over my shoulder and onto the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI retreated, stepping over Bikechain, putting my back to the RideWorks gate, now fifteen feet away from the Barracuda. Porkpie\u0027s gun was still aimed at me. Chich was still smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy who\u0027d had the nose ring was making a hand-tent around his face, blood striping his chin and speckling his white T-shirt. The guy with the hairnet was getting up off the street. Bikechain limped forward, rewinding the chain around his fist. He scraped the gear links across the Barracuda\u0027s red paint job, then kept coming. His friends were close behind. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-40.html","bookId":2418,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM"}
