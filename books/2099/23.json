Cassie watched it through the large bay window in Diana\u0027s living room. It was better than staring down at the magenta ink of Scarlett\u0027s name on Suzan\u0027s family tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to initiate her,\" Melanie said. \"Nothing matters more than defeating the hunters, especially after what they did to Suzan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we know she has ulterior motives and can\u0027t be trusted,\" Nick said. \"Remember, she wanted Cassie\u0027s place in the Circle so she could use our Circle\u0027s power for her own agenda. She\u0027d be as bad as initiating Black John himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie scoffed at Nick. \"That\u0027s an overstatement if I\u0027ve ever heard one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie wanted this conversation to stop. The sky outside had settled to a deep purple and the clouds rolled and shifted in ever-changing shapes. Cassie saw a heart and then a castle, and then nothing, just a sheet of gray. Her mind wandered and an image flashed into view: herself back at the Mission House on the brink of killing Scarlett. But this time she\u0027d gone through with it. She completed the killing spell and Scarlett\u0027s eyes had glassed over the way Suzan\u0027s had up on the roof, and then she stiffened to a lifeless statue. Cassie imagined exactly what it would feel like for Scarlett to be gone forever - how the Circle would be free at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it, Cassie thought. That was the solution. She would have to kill Scarlett. Then they could take their chances with another lost family member to be next in line for the Circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then she shook the idea from her mind. No, she told herself. Send light to that dark thought, and cast it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie knew she had to fight off every evil intention the moment it appeared now, before it could really get to her and take hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie,\" Adam said. \"Are you okay? You\u0027re as pale as a ghost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine.\" But the faintness of Cassie\u0027s voice gave her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See,\" Melanie said. \"Even Cassie is weaker now. I told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not weaker,\" Cassie shot back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Melanie was adamant. \"Yes, you are. We all are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just see about that.\" Chris directed his attention to the bowl of fruit on Diana\u0027s coffee table. \"Who wants to see me levitate an apple?\" he asked. But seconds passed and nothing happened. The apple didn\u0027t move, and Chris grew more and more frustrated as the clock continued to tick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie crossed her arms over her chest, looking smug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe if we both try,\" Doug said, going to his brother\u0027s side. He focused his attention on the fruit as well. With their combined powers, the apple began to shiver. It lifted from the bowl for a brief second, but then it dropped back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot.\" Chris was breathless with fatigue. \"We almost had it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for proving just how powerless we are,\" Nick said. He looked worriedly at Cassie. \"We may actually be weaker than we were before you came to town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie returned her gaze to the window and took a deep breath. It was becoming more and more clear that their only option wasn\u0027t destroying Scarlett. It was going against all logic and asking her to join them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can barely do the simplest everyday magic with an incomplete Circle,\" Melanie said. \"Let alone anything strong enough to fight off the hunters. I say we initiate Scarlett, defeat the hunters, and then figure out what to do with her later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, \u0027figure out what to do with her later\u0027?\" Diana narrowed her eyes at Melanie. \"Once she\u0027s initiated, we\u0027re bound to her. You know that. Using her and then betraying her would compromise the integrity of our Circle. Not to mention our self-respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s probably what Scarlett will do to us, Cassie thought, but saying so would only make things worse. She stood up and took the center of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no good decision to make here,\" she said. \"Only a less bad one. As much as I hate to admit this, I think we do need Scarlett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick\u0027s jaw tightened as he ground his teeth. \"I don\u0027t want her as a member,\" he said. \"There must be another option.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Scarlett or no one,\" Adam said, refusing to make eye contact with Nick as he addressed the group. \"We don\u0027t have to trust her, but I think we do have to initiate her. You know what they say about keeping your enemies close. Well, we can\u0027t keep her much closer than in our Circle. At least she\u0027ll be somewhere we can keep an eye on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" Nick said. \"So we can have a front-row seat as she takes control of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now hold on.\" Diana raised her arms to quiet both of them. \"There are eleven of us and one Scarlett. What makes you so sure it\u0027ll be that easy for her to take control of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Sean said. \"One bad seed can\u0027t spoil the bunch, otherwise Faye would have ruined our Circle long ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye glared at Sean as Diana continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My point is, we know what Scarlett is capable of, so we\u0027re less likely to fall for any of her tricks. And don\u0027t forget, we have the Master Tools back in our possession.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick considered Diana\u0027s argument for a few seconds before conceding. \"Fine,\" he said. \"If Cassie\u0027s willing to take a chance on Scarlett, then I\u0027m with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we all agree, then?\" Adam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody spoke out to disagree, which was as close to consensus as they were going to get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. It\u0027s settled,\" Adam said. \"Cassie and I will take care of telling Scarlett the news and bringing her back to New Salem tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the group started to split up and head home for the night, the full impact of the decision sunk in. Had she really agreed to bring the other girl Adam\u0027s soul was connected to back into her life? The girl who had tried to kill her, and whom she had tried to kill? It was like restriking a dulled match just to see what would burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie reached for Adam\u0027s hand and squeezed it. \"I\u0027ll catch up with you a little later,\" she said. \"I want to have a word with Diana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam kissed her on the lips without question, so she didn\u0027t have to explain exactly why she wanted to speak to Diana. She didn\u0027t have to justify her father\u0027s Book of Shadows shoved deep into the bottom of her tote bag. She simply waited for everyone to trickle out of Diana\u0027s house until it was just the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you left with Adam,\" Diana said, when she realized Cassie had been lingering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we talk?\" Cassie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana nervously glanced around the living room even though they were alone, perhaps because she thought Cassie was going to ask her about Max. \"Let\u0027s go up to my bedroom,\" she said, leading Cassie to the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a long time since Cassie and Diana hung out on Diana\u0027s bed sharing secrets. After only a few moments of sitting there, Cassie was overwhelmed with longing for those simpler times. Before Scarlett had entered their lives, and even further back, before Adam had become an issue between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana huddled close to Cassie and asked, \"Do you think Suzan\u0027s father knew about Laura Forsythe? Or that she\u0027d had a daughter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My guess is he never knew Scarlett existed,\" Cassie said. \"But even if he did, it\u0027s ancient history now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana nodded. \"It\u0027s just so strange, how connected we all are, even when we don\u0027t know it. And even when we don\u0027t want to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie sensed Diana was referring to more than just their familial lines. \"I get the feeling you\u0027re thinking about Max,\" she said. \"And the silver cord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana got quiet and Cassie had the urge to tell her all about the cord between Adam and Scarlett. She wanted to cry about it on Diana\u0027s shoulder until she delivered some typical words of Diana wisdom that would make it all better. Unfortunately, there were more pressing issues to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie dug through her bag until she retrieved her father\u0027s book. She held it out to Diana. \"Will you hold on to this for me? To keep it away from me for a little while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana eyed the book carefully, and then gently accepted it from Cassie\u0027s hands. \"Of course. But why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLines of worry creased Diana\u0027s forehead as Cassie described how she had felt on the roof when she used dark magic against the hunters. Cassie also told her what had happened with Scarlett in Stockbridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went into a trance,\" Cassie said. \"And I almost killed Scarlett. I know it\u0027s because of the book. It\u0027s doing things to my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana nodded gravely. \"Like Adam said, you\u0027re bound to the book now. And we still don\u0027t fully understand what that means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the worst part,\" Cassie said, \"is that it feels really good when I\u0027m like that. It\u0027s the most seductive pleasure - I can\u0027t even describe it. And it\u0027s only afterward, after I snap out of it, that I feel bad.\" Cassie looked down, ashamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\" Diana put her arm around her. \"We\u0027ve all succumbed to temptation at one time or another. Even when we know it can be damaging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m afraid one of these days I\u0027ll take it too far. What if I do something I can\u0027t take back - or worse, what if I can\u0027t get myself back? Every time it happens I feel like I\u0027m going in deeper and deeper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to worry,\" Diana said. \"I\u0027ll keep the book safe, and together we\u0027ll keep you safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie felt better already. If there was anyone on earth who could be trusted with the book, it was Diana. But she still felt the need to give Diana a stern warning. \"You have to let me know if anything out of the ordinary happens, do you understand? If you start feeling strange, or if it seems to be speaking to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana nodded solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that happens, we\u0027ll find something else to do with it,\" Cassie said. \"I don\u0027t want you going through what I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither do I,\" Diana said, trying to make light of the heavy situation. \"Trust me. I\u0027ve had my fair share of transgressions lately as it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And whatever you do,\" Cassie said, \"don\u0027t let Faye know you have it. In fact, don\u0027t let anybody know. Not even Adam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana hesitated but then agreed. \"It\u0027ll be our secret.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-hunt-the-secret-circle-5/page-23.html","bookId":2099,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:21 PM"}
