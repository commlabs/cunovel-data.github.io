It was time to begin her day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later, Jennifer walked downstairs into the dining room to join Joshua for breakfast. He was not there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Mackey came in from the kitchen. \"Good morning, Mrs. Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning. Where\u0027s Joshua?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He seemed so tired that I thought I\u0027d let him sleep a little longer. He doesn\u0027t have to start back to school until tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer nodded. \"Good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ate her breakfast and went upstairs to say good-bye to Joshua. He was lying in his bed, sound asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer sat on the edge of the bed and said softly, \"Hey, sleepyhead, do you want to say good-bye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly opened one eye. \"Sure, friend. \u0027Bye.\" His voice was heavy with sleep. \"Do I have to get up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Tell you what. Why don\u0027t you laze around today? You can stay inside and have fun. It\u0027s raining too hard to go outdoors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded drowsily. \"Okay, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes closed again and he was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer spent the afternoon in court, and by the time she finished and arrived home it was after seven o\u0027clock. The rain, which had been a drizzle all day, was coming down in torrents, and as Jennifer drove up the driveway, the house looked like a besieged castle surrounded by a gray, churning moat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Mackey opened the front door and helped Jennifer out of her dripping raincoat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer shook the damp out of her hair and said, \"Where\u0027s Joshua?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked at Mrs. Mackey with concern. \"Has he been sleeping all day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heavens, no. He\u0027s been up and around. I fixed his dinner, but when I went upstairs to get him he had dozed off again, so I just thought I\u0027d let him be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer went upstairs into Joshua\u0027s room and quietly entered. Joshua was asleep. Jennifer leaned over and touched his forehead. He had no fever; his color was normal. She felt his pulse. There was nothing wrong except her imagination. She was letting it run away with her. Joshua had probably been playing too hard all day and it was natural that he was tired. Jennifer slipped out of the room and returned downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you make some sandwiches for him, Mrs. Mackey? Leave them at the side of the bed. He can have them when he wakes up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer had dinner at her desk, working on briefs, preparing a trial deposition for the next day. She thought about calling Michael to tell him she was back, but she was hesitant about speaking to him so soon after the night with Adam...He was too perceptive. It was after midnight when she finished reading. She stood up and stretched, trying to relieve the tension in her back and neck. She put her papers in her attache case, turned out the lights and went upstairs. She passed by Joshua\u0027s room and looked in. He was still asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sandwiches on the stand beside the bed were untouched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning when Jennifer went down to breakfast, Joshua was there, dressed and ready for school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, darling. How are you feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. I was really tired. Must have been that Mexican sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must have been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Acapulco\u0027s really neat. Can we go back there on my next vacation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why not. You glad to be getting back to school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of the afternoon, Jennifer was taking a deposition when Cynthia buzzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to disturb you, but there\u0027s a Mrs. Stout on the line and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoshua\u0027s homeroom teacher. \"I\u0027ll take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer picked up the telephone. \"Hello, Mrs. Stout. Is anything wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no, everything\u0027s fine, Mrs. Parker. I didn\u0027t mean to alarm you. I just thought I might suggest to you that it would be a good idea if Joshua got more sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He slept through most of his classes today. Miss Williams and Mrs. Toboco both mentioned it. Perhaps you could see to it that he gets to bed a bit earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer stared at the telephone. \"I - yes, I\u0027ll do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she replaced the receiver and turned to the people in the room watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"Excuse me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried out to the reception room. \"Cynthia, find Dan. Ask him to finish the deposition for me. Something has come up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All - \" Jennifer was already out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drove home like a madwoman, exceeding the speed limit, going through red lights, her mind filled with visions of something terrible having happened to Joshua. The drive seemed interminable and when her house appeared in the distance, Jennifer half expected to see the driveway filled with ambulances and police cars. The driveway was deserted. Jennifer pulled up beside the front door and hurried into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joshua!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in the den watching a baseball game on television.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Mom. You\u0027re home early. Did you get fired?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer stood in the doorway staring at him, her body flooding with relief. She felt like an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have seen the last inning. Craig Swan was fantastic!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel, son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer put her hand on his forehead. He had no fever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure you\u0027re all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I am. Why do you look so funny? You worried about something? You want to have a man-to-man talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"No, darling, I just - does anything hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned. \"I\u0027ll say. The Mets are losing six to five. You know what happened in the first inning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began an excited replay of his favorite team\u0027s exploits. Jennifer stood there looking at him, adoring him, thinking, Damn my imagination! Of course he\u0027s all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You go on and watch the rest of the game. I\u0027ll see about dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer went into the kitchen, lighthearted. She decided to make a banana cake, one of Joshua\u0027s favorite desserts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes later, when Jennifer returned to the study, Joshua was lying on the floor, unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ride to Blinderman Memorial Hospital seemed to take forever. Jennifer sat in the back of the ambulance clutching Joshua\u0027s band. An attendant was holding an oxygen mask over Joshua\u0027s face. He had not regained consciousness. The ambulance\u0027s siren was keening, but the traffic was heavy and the ambulance went slowly while curious people gaped through the windows, staring at the white-faced woman and the unconscious boy. It seemed to Jennifer a sickening violation of privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t they use one-way glass in ambulances?\" Jennifer demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attendant looked up, startled. \"Ma\u0027am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing...nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter what seemed an eternity, the ambulance pulled up at the emergency entrance at the back of the hospital. Two interns were waiting at the door. Jennifer stood there helpless, watching as Joshua was removed from the ambulance and transferred to a gurney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn attendant asked, \"Are you the boy\u0027s mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat followed was a blurred kaleidoscope of sound and light and movement. Jennifer watched Joshua being wheeled down a long, white corridor to an X-ray room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to follow, but the attendant said, \"You\u0027ll have to check him in first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thin woman at the front desk was saying to Jennifer, \"How do you plan to pay for this? Do you have Blue Cross or some other form of insurance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer wanted to scream at the woman, wanted to get back to Joshua\u0027s side, but she forced herself to answer the questions, and when they were over and Jennifer had filled out several forms, the woman allowed Jennifer to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried down to the X-ray room and went inside. The room was empty. Joshua was gone. Jennifer ran back to the hallway, looking around frantically. A nurse passed by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer clutched her arm. \"Where\u0027s my son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse said, \"I don\u0027t know. What\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joshua. Joshua Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you leave him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He - he was having X rays - he - \" Jennifer was beginning to be incoherent. \"What have they done with him! Tell me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse took a closer look at Jennifer and said, \"Wait here, Mrs. Parker. I\u0027ll see if I can find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came back a few minutes later. \"Dr. Morris would like to see you. Come this way, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer found that her legs were trembling. It was difficult to walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" The nurse was staring at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth was dry with fear. \"I want my son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came to a room filled with strange-looking equipment. \"Wait here, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Morris came in a few moments later. He was a very fat man with a red face and nicotine stains on his fingers. \"Mrs. Parker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Joshua?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Step in here a moment, please.\" He led Jennifer into a small office across from the room with the strange-looking equipment. \"Please sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer took a seat. \"Joshua is - it\u0027s - it\u0027s nothing serious, is it, Doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know yet.\" His voice was surprisingly soft for a man of his size. \"I need some information. How old is your son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s only seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only had slipped out, a reprimand to God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he in an accident recently?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vision flashed through Jennifer\u0027s mind of Joshua turning to wave and losing his balance and hitting the pilings. \"He - he had a water skiing accident. He bumped his head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor was making notes. \"How long ago was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - a few - a few days ago. In Acapulco.\" It was difficult to think straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he seem all right after the accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He had a lump on the back of his head, but otherwise he - he seemed fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you notice any lapse of memory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any personality changes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No convulsions or stiff neck or headache?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor stopped writing and looked up at Jennifer. \"I\u0027ve had an X ray done, but it\u0027s not enough. I want to do a CAT scan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a new computerized machine from England that takes pictures of the inside of the brain. I may want to make some additional tests afterward. Is that all right with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If-if-if\" - she was stammering - \"it\u0027s necessary. It-it won\u0027t hurt him, will it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I may also need to do a spinal puncture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was frightening her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced the question out of her mouth. \"What do you think it is? What\u0027s the matter with my son?\" She did not recognize the sound of her own voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d prefer not to make any guesses, Mrs. Parker. We\u0027ll know in an hour or two. He\u0027s awake now, if you\u0027d like to see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nurse led her to Joshua\u0027s room. He was lying in bed, a pale small figure. He looked up as Jennifer entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi there.\" She sat at the edge of his bed. \"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of funny. It\u0027s like I\u0027m not here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer reached out and took his hand. \"You\u0027re here, darling. And I\u0027m with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see two of everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did - did you tell the doctor that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. I saw two of him. I hope he doesn\u0027t send you two bills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer gently put her arms around Joshua and hugged him. His body seemed frail and shrunken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t let me die, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were suddenly stinging. \"No, Joshua, I won\u0027t let you die. The doctors are going to make you well and then I\u0027m going to take you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. And you promised we can go back to Acapulco sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. As soon as - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Morris came into the room with two men wearing white jackets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d like to begin the tests now, Mrs. Parker. They won\u0027t take long. Why don\u0027t you wait in here and make yourself comfortable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer watched them take Joshua out of the room. She sat on the edge of the bed, feeling as though she had been physically beaten. All the energy had drained out of her. She sat there, staring at the white wall, in a trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later a voice said, \"Mrs. Parker - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked up and Dr. Morris was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please go ahead and do the tests,\" Jennifer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her oddly. \"We\u0027ve finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked at the clock on the wall. She had been sitting there for two hours. Where had the time gone? She looked into the doctor\u0027s face, reading it, searching for the small, telltale signs that would reveal whether he had good news or bad news for her. How many times had she done this before, reading the faces of jurors, knowing in advance from their expressions what the verdict would be? A hundred times? Five hundred? Now, because of the panic raging within her, Jennifer could tell nothing. Her body began to shake uncontrollably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Morris said, \"Your son is suffering from a subdural hematoma. In layman\u0027s terms, there has been a massive trauma to his brain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer throat was suddenly so dry that no words could come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wh - \" She swallowed and tried again. \"What does that - ?\" She could not finish the sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to operate immediately. I\u0027ll need your permission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was playing some kind of cruel prank on her. In a moment he was going to smile and tell her that Joshua was fine. I was just punishing you, Mrs. Parker, for wasting my time. There\u0027s nothing wrong with your son except that he needs sleep. He\u0027s a growing boy. You mustn\u0027t take up our time when we have patients to look after who are really ill. He was going to smile at her and say, \"You can take your son home now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Morris was going on. \"He\u0027s young and his body seems strong. There\u0027s every reason to hope the operation will be a success.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to cut open her baby\u0027s brain, tear into it with his sharp instruments, perhaps destroy whatever it was that made Joshua, Joshua. Perhaps - kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" It was an angry cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t give us permission to operate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - \" Her mind was so confused she could not think. \"Wh - what will happen if you don\u0027t operate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Morris said simply, \"Your son will die. Is the boy\u0027s father here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam! Oh, how she wanted Adam, how she wanted to feel his arms around her, comforting her. She wanted him to tell her that everything was going to be all right, that Joshua was going to be fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jennifer replied finally, \"he\u0027s not. I - I give you my permission. Go ahead with the operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Morris filled out a form and handed it to her. \"Would you sign this, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer signed the paper without looking at it. \"How long will it take?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t know until I open - \" He saw the look on her face. \"Until I begin the operation. Would you like to wait here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" The walls were closing in on her, choking her. She could not breathe. \"Is there a place where I can pray?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a small chapel with a painting of Jesus over the altar. The room was deserted except for Jennifer. She knelt, but she was unable to pray. She was not a religious person; why would God listen to her now? She tried to quiet her mind so that she could talk to God, but her fear was too strong; it had taken complete possession of her. She kept berating herself mercilessly. If I only hadn\u0027t taken Joshua to Acapulco, she thought...If I hadn\u0027t let him go water skiing...If I hadn\u0027t trusted that Mexican doctor...If. If. If. She made bargains with God. Make him well again and I\u0027ll do anything you ask of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe denied God. If there was a God, would he do this to a child who had never harmed anyone? What kind of God lets innocent children die?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, out of sheer exhaustion, Jennifer\u0027s thoughts slowed and she remembered what Dr. Morris had said. He\u0027s young and his body seems strong. There\u0027s every reason to hope the operation will be a success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was going to be all right. Of course it was. When this was over, she would take Joshua away someplace where he could rest. Acapulco, if he liked. They would read and play games and talk...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen finally Jennifer was too exhausted to think any longer, she slumped into a seat, her mind a dazed blank, empty. Someone was touching her arm and she looked up and Dr. Morris was standing over her. Jennifer looked into his face and had no need to ask any questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lost consciousness. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-49.html","bookId":2357,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM"}
