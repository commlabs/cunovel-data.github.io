Long was intent on the flickering screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz said gruffly, \"I\u0027m shoving up the thermostat. It\u0027s all right - we can spare the power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong nodded. \"If you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz took a hesitant step forward. Space was clear, so to hell with sitting and looking at a blank, green, pipless line. He said, \"What\u0027s the Grounder been talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"History of space travel mostly. Old stuff, but he\u0027s doing it well. He\u0027s giving the whole works-color cartoons, trick photography, stills from old films, everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to illustrate Long\u0027s remarks, the bearded figure faded out of view, and a cross-sectional view of a spaceship flitted onto the screen. Hilder\u0027s voice continued, pointing out features of interest that appeared in schematic color. The communications system of the ship outlined itself in red as he talked about it, the storerooms, the proton micropile drive, the cybernetic circuits...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Hilder was back on the screen. \"But this is only the travel-head of the ship. What moves it? What gets it off the Earth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone knew what moved a spaceship, but Hilder\u0027s voice was like a drug. He made spaceship propulsion sound like the secret of the ages, like an ultimate revelation. Even Rioz felt a slight tingling of suspense, though he had spent the greater part of his life aboard ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHilder went on. \"Scientists call it different names. They call it the Law of Action and Reaction. Sometimes they call it Newton\u0027s Third Law. Sometimes they call it Conservation of Momentum. But we don\u0027t have to call it any name. We can just use our common sense. When we swim, we push water backward and move forward ourselves. When we walk, we push back against the ground and move forward. When we fly a gyro-flivver, we push air backward and move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing can move forward unless something else moves backward. It\u0027s the old principle of \u0027You can\u0027t get something for nothing.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now imagine a spaceship that weighs a hundred thousand tons lifting off Earth. To do that, something else must be moved downward. Since a spaceship is extremely heavy, a great deal of material must be moved downwards. So much material, in fact, that there is no place to keep it all aboard ship. A special compartment must be built behind the ship to hold it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Hilder faded out and the ship returned. It shrank and a truncated cone appeared behind it. In bright yellow, words appeared within it: MATERIAL TO BE THROWN AWAY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now,\" said Hilder, \"the total weight of the ship is much greater. You need still more propulsion and still more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship shrank enormously to add on another larger shell and still another immense one. The ship proper, the travel-head, was a little dot on the screen, a glowing red dot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz said, \"Hell, this is kindergarten stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to the people he\u0027s speaking to, Mario,\" replied Long \"Earth isn\u0027t Mars. There must be billions of Earth people who\u0027ve never even seen a spaceship; don\u0027t know the first thing about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHilder was saying, \"When the material inside the biggest shell is used up, the shell is detached. It\u0027s thrown away, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outermost shell came loose, wobbled about the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then the second one goes,\" said Hilder, \"and then, if the trip is a long one, the last is ejected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship was just a red dot now, with three shells shifting and moving, lost in space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHilder said, \"These shells represent a hundred thousand tons of tungsten, magnesium, aluminum, and steel. They are gone forever from Earth. Mars is ringed by Scavengers, waiting along the routes of space travel, waiting for the cast-off shells, netting and branding them, saving them for Mars. Not one cent of payment reaches Earth for them. They are salvage. They belong to the ship that finds them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz said, \"We risk our investment and our lives. If we don\u0027t pick them up, no one gets them. What loss is that to Earth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" said Long, \"he\u0027s been talking about nothing but the drain that Mars, Venus, and the Moon put on Earth. This is just another item of loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll get their return. We\u0027re mining more iron every year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And most of it goes right back into Mars. If you can believe his figures, Earth has invested two hundred billion dollars in Mars and received back about five billion dollars\u0027 worth of iron. It\u0027s put five hundred billion dollars into the Moon and gotten back a little over twenty-five billion dollars of magnesium, titanium, and assorted light metals. It\u0027s put fifty billion dollars into Venus and gotten back nothing. And that\u0027s what the taxpayers of Earth are really interested in-tax money out; nothing in\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen was filled, as he spoke, with diagrams of the Scavengers on the route to Mars; little, grinning caricatures of ships, reaching out wiry, tenuous arms that groped for the tumbling, empty shells, seizing and snaking them in, branding them MARS PROPERTY in glowing letters, then scaling them down to Phobos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was Hilder again. \"They tell us eventually they will return it all to us. Eventually! Once they are a going concern! We don\u0027t know when that will be. A century from now? A thousand years? A million? \u0027Eventually.\u0027 Let\u0027s take them at their word. Someday they will give us back all our metals. Someday they will grow their own food, use their own power, live their own lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But one thing they can never return. Not in a hundred million years. Water!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mars has only a trickle of water because it is too small. Venus has no water at all because it is too hot. The Moon has none because it is too hot and too small. So Earth must supply not only drinking water and washing water for the Spacers, water to run their industries, water for the hydroponic factories they claim to be setting up-but even water to throw away by the millions of tons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is the propulsive force that spaceships use? What is it they throw out behind so that they can accelerate forward? Once it was the gasses generated from explosives. That was very expensive. Then the proton micropile was invented-a cheap power source that could heat up any liquid until it was a gas under tremendous pressure. What is the cheapest and most plentiful liquid available? Why, water, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Each spaceship leaves Earth carrying nearly a million tons-not pounds, tons-of water, for the sole purpose of driving it into space so that it may speed up or slow down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our ancestors burned the oil of Earth madly and wilfully. They destroyed its coal recklessly. We despise and condemn, them for that, but at least they had this excuse-they thought that when the need arose, substitutes would be found. And they were right. We have our plankton farms and our proton micro-piles,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there is no substitute for water. None! There never can be. And when our descendants view the desert we will have made of Earth, what excuse will they find for us? When the droughts come and grow-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong leaned forward and turned off the set. He said, \"That bothers me. The damn fool is deliberately- What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz had risen uneasily to his feet. ldquo;I ought to be watching the pips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell with pips.\" Long got up likewise, followed Rioz through the narrow corridor, and stood just inside the pilot room. \"If Hilder carries this through, if he\u0027s got the guts to make a real issue out of it-Wow!\";\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had seen it too. The pip was a Class A, racing after the outgoing signal like a greyhound after a mechanical rabbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz was babbling, \"Space was clear, I tell you, clear. For Mars\u0027 sake, Ted, don\u0027t just freeze on me. See if you can spot it visually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz was working speedily and with an efficiency that was the result of nearly twenty years of scavenging. He had the distance in two minutes. Then, remembering Swenson\u0027s experience, he measured the angle of declination and the radial velocity as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yelled at Long, \"One point seven six radians. You can\u0027t miss it, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong held his breath as he adjusted the vernier. \"It\u0027s only half a radian off the Sun. It\u0027ll only be crescent-lit.\" He.increased magnification as rapidly as he dared, watching for the one \"star\" that changed position and grew to have a form, revealing itself to be no star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m starting, anyway,\" said Rioz. \"We can\u0027t wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got it. I\u0027ve got it.\" Magnification was still too small to give it a definite shape, but the dot Long watched was brightening and dimming rhythmically as the shell rotated and caught sunlight on cross sections of different sizes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of many fine spurts of steam squirted out of the proper vents, leaving long trails of micro-crystals of ice gleaming mistily in the pale beams of the distant Sun. They thinned out for a hundred miles or more. One spurt, then another, then another, as the Scavenger ship moved out of its stable trajectory tory and took up a course tangential to that of the shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s moving like a comet at perihelion!\" yelled Rioz. \"Those damned Grounder pilots knock the shells off that way on purpose. I\u0027d like to-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore his anger in a frustrated frenzy as he kicked steam backward and backward recklessly, till the hydraulic cushioning of his chair had soughed back a full foot and Long had found himself all but unable to maintain his grip on the guard rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a heart,\" he begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Rioz had his eye on the pips. \"If you can\u0027t take it, man, stay on Mars!\" The steam spurts continued to boom distantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio came to life. Long managed to lean forward through what seemed like molasses and closed contact. It was Swenson, eyes glaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwenson yelled, \"Where the hell are you guys going? You\u0027ll be in my sector in ten seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz said, \"I\u0027m chasing a shell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my sector?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It started in mine and you\u0027re not in position to get it. Shut off that radio, Ted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship thundered through space, a thunder that could be heard only within the hull. And then Rioz cut the engines in stages large enough to make Long flail forward. The sudden silence was more ear-shattering than the noise that had preceded it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz said, \"All right. Let me have the \u0027scope\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both watched. The shell was a definite truncated cone now, tumbling with slow solemnity as it passed along among the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a Class A shell, all right,\" said Rioz with satisfaction. A giant among shells, he thought. It would put them into the black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong said, \"We\u0027ve got another pip on the scanner. I think it\u0027s Swenson taking after us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz scarcely gave it a glance. \"He won\u0027t catch us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shell grew larger still, filling the visiplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz\u0027s hands were on the harpoon lever. He waited, adjusted the angle microscopically twice, played out the length allotment. Then he yanked, tripping the release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, nothing happened. Then a metal mesh cable snaked out onto the visiplate, moving toward the shell like a striking cobra. It made contact, but it did not hold. If it had, it would have snapped instantly like a cobweb strand. The shell was turning with a rotational momentum amounting to thousands of tons. What the cable did do was to set up a powerful magnetic field that acted as a brake on the shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother cable and another lashed out. Rioz sent them out in an almost heedless expenditure of energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get this one! By Mars, I\u0027ll get this one!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith some two dozen cables stretching between ship and shell, he desisted. The shell\u0027s rotational energy, converted by breaking into heat, had raised its temperature to a point where its radiation could be picked up by the ship\u0027s meters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong said, \"Do you want me to put our brand on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suits me. But you don\u0027t have to if you don\u0027t want to. It\u0027s my watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong clambered into his suit and went out of the lock. It was the surest sign of his newness to the game that he could count the number of times he had been out in space in a suit. This was the fifth time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went out along the nearest cable, hand over hand, feeling the vibration of the mesh against the metal of his mitten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe burned their serial number in the smooth metal of the shell. There was nothing to oxidize the steel in the emptiness of space. It simply melted and vaporized, condensing some feet away from the energy beam, turning the surface it touched into a gray, powdery dullness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong swung back towards the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside again, he took off his helmet, white and thick with frost that collected as soon as he had entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing he heard was Swenson\u0027s voice coming over the radio in this almost unrecognizable rage: \"...straight to the Commissioner. Damn it, there are rules to this game!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz sat back, unbothered. \"Look, it hit my sector. I was late spotting it and I chased it into yours. You couldn\u0027t have gotten it with Mars for a backstop. That\u0027s all there is to it-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou back, Long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe signal button raged at him, but he paid no attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to the Commissioner?\" Long asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a chance. He just goes on like that because it breaks the monotony. He doesn\u0027t mean anything by it. He knows it\u0027s our shell. And how do you like that hunk of stuff, Ted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty good? It\u0027s terrific! Hold on. I\u0027m setting it swinging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe side jets spat steam and the ship started a slow rotation about the shell. The shell fallowed it. In thirty minutes, they were a gigantic bolo spinning in emptiness. Long checked the Ephemeris for the position of Deimos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a precisely calculated moment, the cables released their magnetic field and the shell went streaking off tangentially in a trajectory that would, in a day or so, bring it within pronging distance of the shell stores on the Martian satellite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRioz watched it go. He felt good. He turned to Long. \"This is one fine day for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Hilder\u0027s speech?\" asked Long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Who? Oh, that. Listen, if I had to worry about every thing some damned Grounder said, I\u0027d never get any sleep. Forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think we should forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re nuts. Don\u0027t bother me about it, will you? Get some sleep instead.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-3.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
