{"id":95161,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u003cp\u003eWe retired to the great room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes , retired. That\u0027s how Junior Thurman phrased it. I\u0027m fairly certain I\u0027d never retired to any room, let alone a great room. But, if sitting in comfy chairs and holding my wine and trying to pretend to be normal was retiring, then there was a first for everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we sat, I sent a thought over to Allison for her to shield her own thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked why and I told her to just do it, that I would explain later. She shrugged, and I sensed her mind closing to me, exactly the way I had taught her to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood girl, I thought, although she wouldn\u0027t be able to hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe great room was, well, great. It had a soaring ceiling crisscrossed with thick beams. It had arches and a brick fireplace and oversized furniture. The room was something to behold. And, apparently, to retire in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, through the stacked windows framed with heavy curtains, the tall evergreens were now swaying violently, although I doubted the others could see them in the darkness. A storm was moving in. A big one, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s getting blustery out there,\" said Edwin, the young man who might have been handsome if not for the perpetual smile on his face. He could see the trees as well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blustery?\" said Allison next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d had two glasses of wine. She was also smaller than me and hadn\u0027t eaten much at dinner. I suspected the wine had gone straight to her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior Thurman, who\u0027d been texting on his too-big cell phone, set it aside and looked up at her. He was holding a glass of sherry. I was fairly certain I\u0027d never before seen anyone drink a glass of sherry in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother first, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a word we like to use up here,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe said jovially enough. He had a strong, resonant voice that seemed to fill the great room. His wife nodded. She had quit looking at me. Now she was staring down into her own glass of wine, legs tucked under her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior went on: \"Blustery is just our way saying that we\u0027re getting some nasty weather out there, nasty even for the Northwest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just call it a shit-storm where I\u0027m from,\" said Allison, and immediately looked like she regretted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kids who\u0027d been playing cards nearby looked up. Junior frowned a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin, I saw, grinned even bigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where are you from, Allison?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior asked pleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Texas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" said Junior without elaborating, as if that answered everything. He turned his attention back to me. \"Samantha, from where do you know my dear niece?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve known Tari since we were in college,\" I said, reciting the script. Tara was \"Tari\" to friends and family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior nodded. He held the glass of sherry loosely in his hands. The rich vermillion color caught some of the ambient light. From here, the liquid looked like blood. My stomach growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sick, ghoulish stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Did you two have many classes together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One or two,\" I said, \"until I dropped out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why would you do a thing like that?\" asked Patricia, Junior\u0027s wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got pregnant,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twins,\" said Allison, jumping in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior nodded, as if that made perfect sense. I nearly frowned at Allison. We hadn\u0027t discussed me having twins. She\u0027d drunkenly embellished the story. Tara was looking concerned, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twins,\" said Mrs. Thurman. \"How delightful. What are their names?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tammy and Anthony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not, you know, identical,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid Allison, slurring her words slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Thurman regarded Allison curiously. \"I gathered that.\" She turned back to me. \"And you\u0027ve kept in touch with our Tari all this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On and off,\" I said, lying easily. It was, after all, what investigators did. We often lied to get our information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We reconnected through Facebook,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblurted Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, so you\u0027re friends on Facebook?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003easked Edwin. He continued smiling. He seemed to be getting a kick out of all of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw where this was going, and saw where Allison had screwed up. I said, \"I don\u0027t think so, not yet. We just emailed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees and looked directly at me. His face was angular, his cheekbones high. His lips were a little too full, even for me. He said, \"Maybe we can be friends on Facebook.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I said. \"Depends how friendly you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and sat back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just love Facebook,\" said Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just last week a friend of mine sent me this cat video...I swear to God that little booger was clapping. Clapping! A kitten! Can you believe it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, no one could. Or they were too dumbfounded to speak. Junior shifted his considerable gaze from me to her. The president of Thurman Hotels was also, apparently, the leader of the family, too. \"And how do you know our Tari?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m just here for the ride,\" said Allison, sitting back and kicking her Uggs comfortably. She snapped her gum. \"I\u0027m with Sammie here. Where she goes, I go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cute,\" said Patricia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to change the subject. \"This is a beautiful home,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older couple sitting near the roaring fireplace sat forward. Elaine Thurman, sister of the deceased. She smiled brightly. Her aura, I saw, was bluish and yellow, which told me she was a woman very much at peace with herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer aura also had a black thread woven through it. Grieving, obviously. This was, after all, the one-year anniversary of her brother\u0027s drowning. She said, \"The home has been in my family for generations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve all been coming out to Skull Island for over seventy-five years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is it called Skull Island?\" asked Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin leaned forward again. \"There\u0027s a Native American burial ground on the other side of the island. It\u0027s supposedly cursed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skull Island and curses,\" said Allison, elbowing him. \"Where\u0027s Scooby- Doo and Shaggy, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich had been, of course, my exact thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the curses are just legends,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid Calvin Thurman, or Cal, one of the uncles. He was, I suspected, dying of a cancer. I knew this because of the dark spot of his kidney, a dark spot that was, literally, like a black hole, sucking in the color of his surrounding aura. Indeed, he leaned away from it, taking pressure off it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t even know, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held my gaze closely, and something seemed to pass between us. His eyes, I was certain, were trying to communicate something to me. He said, \"Although there have been a few cases of unfortunate deaths.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t talk about those,\" snapped Junior. \"Not to strangers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" said Cal, apparently not intimidated at all by his wife\u0027s nephew, president of the company or not. He looked again at me. \"It\u0027s in all the papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone can find that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued looking at me. I looked at him. His eyes, I was certain, were pleading with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about the deaths,\" I said uncomfortably. I had, of course, come across three such deaths in my own research of Skull Island. Were there some that I had missed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Junior\u0027s glowering stare finally cowered old Cal. He sighed deeply and winked at me. \"Catch me later after I\u0027ve had a few of these\" - and he held up his Scotch - \"and I\u0027ll tell you all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. I laughed. No one else laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, Junior Thurman announced that tomorrow we would hold a memorial for his late father, George Thurman, whose death I had, unknown to the family, been hired to investigate. Junior went on: His late father had passed at this time last year, and he wanted to have a ceremony at the chapel located in the mausoleum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, the conversation quickly turned to business. Tara turned and talked to me about my kids. All the while, I was aware of glances from various family members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, some weren\u0027t glancing. Some were openly staring. Like Edwin Thurman. Edwin with his perpetual grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatricia, not so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the trees continued to sway and bend and appeared ready to snap, all while a sheet of rain swept over the grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome to Skull Island. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-15.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
