Her helmet’s head-up display showed that Chief Mendez and Tom were fol owing her, the only two icons at close range. Tom’s bio readout showed his pulse was raised. She decided to risk taking her eyes off the passage and turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What have we got, Lucy?” Tom caught up with her and put his hand on her shoulder. “You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did he think she wouldn’t be? She waved him away. Something had come down this passage and she couldn’t turn back until she’d found and identified it, and—if necessary—neutralized it. She checked her display for EM or thermal signatures ahead, but there was nothing. The ground was definitely flat and smooth like terrazzo. Now she’d started to trust her proprioception rather than her eyes, she picked up speed and started walking at a pace she thought of as cautious-normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to fetch Halsey in here to evaluate this,” Mendez said. Lucy kept moving. “Hold it here, Lucy. We’l secure a perimeter in case whatever it is decides to come back. You hear me, Petty Officer? Hold it here. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy halted. She couldn’t shake the feeling that if she didn’t hunt down whatever had fled, it would come back for them al . Get it before it gets us. She stood staring into the black void, wondering what kind of material could absorb light so completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trouble with staring at a featureless surface was that it soon stopped being featureless. She could now see pinprick flashes of light and brightly colored moving shapes like mingling currents of dye. It was just her optic nerve trying to make sense of the absence of light, but she couldn’t stop her brain from pouncing on the phantoms and reshaping them. Suddenly it was a twisting path with a tantalizing hint of lights ahead, and movement, and people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the colored lights became the afterimage of a white-hot explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy had been here before. Part of her knew it wasn’t happening, but it couldn’t stop the animal core of her reacting to it. She was in a maze of pipes, in a Covenant refinery, and she could even see the coolant leaking and bubbling on the floor ahead of her. Tom was to her right. They were the last two Spartans left alive from Beta Company and now they were going to die as wel . She was twelve years old; scared, running on autopilot, trying to gulp in a breath that never reached her lungs because the pounding pulse in her throat was choking her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen hands grabbed her shoulders and spun her around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her fist with no idea why, no thought involved. Only the crack of a visor against her own faceplate stopped her. She could stil see the coolant pipes in her peripheral vision, fading and drifting, and then they were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Luce, get a grip.” Tom stil had hold of her shoulders. He knocked his helmet against hers a couple more times. “It’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like long minutes and Lucy was certain she’d moved a few meters. But it was seconds and she was stil rooted to the same spot, just facing in the opposite direction. Her bio readouts must have spiked and scared the hel out of everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay. I get it too,” Tom stepped back as if he was satisfied she wasn’t going to lose it. “Just take it easy. Breathe. It’s not real. Any of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were times when Lucy wished she could answer him, but there were no words left inside her now. After seven silent years, she didn’t talk and she didn’t scribble notes. Her head was ful of things that nobody else would understand or want to hear. At first she’d had nothing to say in the hours after she’d escaped from the sabotaged refinery with Tom, and then she’d had things she’d wanted to say that were too painful. The heavy silence settled like silt in her chest, a little more each day, and each time she tried to work up to talking it was harder to find words that conveyed the images in her head, and then even her inner voice faded away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t imagine speaking now. She didn’t know where to start. It was just as wel that Tom could work out what was going on in her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Lucy.” She was suddenly aware of Olivia striding toward her with Mark and Ash at her heels. They’d have seen her bio signs spiking, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Couldn’t you find the light switch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh tapped his knuckles against her armor and Olivia gave her a rough hug. When Lucy looked past her, Halsey was framed in the dim scatter of lights at the far end of the passage. For a moment she looked like she was standing in front of a decorated Christmas tree. It was a sharp little echo of buried memories, and then it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Environmental controls,” Halsey cal ed. Her voice didn’t echo. Lucy could hear her even with her helmet on. “Come here. Look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy hung back as the others headed for the entrance and stood a meter inside the passage, just in case whatever it was she’d heard decided to return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s got to get past me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt won’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalsey was running one hand over the il uminated Forerunner symbols on the wal s. After a few moments of frowning at the lights as if they were being wil ful y stubborn, she held out the cylinder to Kel y.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here, hang on to this for me.” She took out her datapad and unfolded it like a piece of origami into a laptop format. That didn’t appear to satisfy her and she folded it up again into a datapad. Then she carried on running her hand along the symbols. “Okay, perhaps it’s not environmental. I’ve found a symbol for humidity. This might be control ing storage conditions, so one of these could activate lights or orientate us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know that?” Mendez asked, al suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalsey flipped the screen and held it toward the wal . “I just do. Let’s see what my database makes of this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you wouldn’t dream of keeping anything else from us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chief, I won’t lecture you on the wisdom of stones and glass houses, so just accept that I don’t know how I know yet. I’m not hiding anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy expected a scientist like Halsey to be more disturbed about random hunches. She backed away into the passage and set her helmet to record, just in case she picked up something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Luce…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom’s voice in her helmet was a quiet warning. She gave him an I’m-okay gesture, diver-style, and carried on. He could stil see her bio readout so that would keep him happy until she came back. Normal pulse and respiration. See? I’m fine. I can handle this. I’m not crazy. Just low blood sugar. Fatigue. I ought to eat something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Luce, wait up. I’m coming. Damn it, you know better than that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved across to the wal and held her rifle one-handed, skimming her left hand across the surface to orient herself, and suddenly she felt much better. The ground beneath her boots was smooth and level. Even if she couldn’t see it she had a better idea of where she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to find where this leads. Something’s in here. Something’s waiting for us. If we found our way in—so might the Elites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Lucy had a lifetime of scores to settle. She didn’t think there was anything wrong with her judgment at al .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she stopped and looked over her shoulder, the faint light from the entrance had gone. She turned back, almost giddy because there was nothing to orient her. But the squad’s bio signs were al visible on her HUD, so she hadn’t lost comms signals, and she wasn’t alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One-Zero-Four to Bravo-Zero-Nine-One.” It was Fred on the radio now. “Lucy, where the hel are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should have known he wouldn’t get an answer, but if she could see his bio readout, he could see hers. He’d know she was fine. If the others wanted to faff around and look for the light switch, fine, but someone had to secure this passage. She was about to flash back a status signal when she col ided with something that bounced her back a couple of steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, she’d walked into a wal . That was what came of not concentrating on the task in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it, Lucy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart rate must have blipped. She transmitted status-OK, then put her hand out ahead of her to feel her way around the obstruction. When her fingers touched it, it felt exactly like the side wal she’d been using for orientation, but then it yielded and her hand went through something soft. It was almost as if she’d put her hand into a closet and found a pile of towels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept … except her whole body passed through it. The wal brushed past her. It was the only way she could describe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the wal engulfed her, the squad bio readouts in her HUD winked out. She tried to turn back. Too late: sudden pressure popped her ears, the ground dissolved under her, and she fel , pitching forward. Her helmet bounced away. It cracked loudly against something but she couldn’t see where it had rol ed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the lights came on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t yel a warning. She couldn’t transmit a status report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she stil had her rifle, and now she could see where to aim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHANGAR DECK, UNSC PORT STANLEY: APPROXIMATELY TEN HOURS FROM NEW LLANELLI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“History’s not my subject.” Vaz bent over a crate of Covenant rifles and wondered whether ONI had paid for them or looted them. The hangar deck was a warehouse of crates stacked either side of a smal dropship that looked like a civilian patrol vessel, although its matte gray stealth coating said otherwise. “But I recal that things like this often end very badly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi loomed over him. “So you do speak.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was rich coming from her. She hadn’t said more than a few words since the meeting with Parangosky. Vaz had already chalked that up to Spartans believing too much of their own PR, because everybody knew that they were winning the war single-handed. It was official. The UNSC media people had decided it was great for morale to tel the civvies al about the Spartans and what a superhuman job they were doing of saving Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat didn’t go down wel with ODSTs. Vaz suspected it didn’t go down wel with al the other average, unglamorous grunts who were doing their fighting and dying behind the scenes, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I talk,” Vaz said at last. “If I have something to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t read her expression at al . Even Mal hadn’t tried to flirt with her, and that was a first. Naomi was just odd. Vaz had expected Spartans to be like the heroic PR image presented to the media, fearless and godlike, gazing nobly into the distance with one boot on a pile of dead hinge-heads. They weren’t supposed to be awkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer looks didn’t set him at ease, either. It wasn’t so much the sharp features as her pale, translucent skin and platinum hair. They reminded him of nightmarish folk tales his grandmother told him as a kid, where female demons who looked like ice princesses dined on the giblets of unwary children. There wasn’t much happily-ever-after in Russian fairy tales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, I’m ODST. I’m a big boy now. This is insane. Stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “You have to know how much gas to pour on a fire,” she said, not even looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded a bit zen. But they were up to their elbows in a crate of identity-tagged Sangheili rifles, so he decided they were back on the topic of the wisdom of arming hinge-heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How come they’re short of arms?” he asked. “I don’t recal that being a problem when they were blowing our heads off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Covenant civil war. The Great Schism. It cost them a lot of ships and equipment. And once they drove out the Prophets, they lost their supply chain. And their command and control.” Naomi was suddenly transformed into something like a regular woman. This was obviously her pet subject. Her pack-ice eyes lit up. “So most of the rank and file don’t have access to serious hardware now, and they’re too disorganized to use it effectively anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So are they stil fighting the Brutes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some. As far as we know.” She seemed to be working up a sweat, puffing a bit as she heaved crates around. Without that power-assisted Mjolnir armor she had to rely on raw muscle, just like him, but he stil didn’t think he’d beat her at arm wrestling. She was genetical y enhanced and it showed. “That’l spread them thinner than the butter on a Navy sandwich.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she said that, as soon as she even brushed close to griping, Vaz felt her change from the terrifying Baba Yaga into one of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in uniform griped about everything al the time. It was one of those fundamental things that bonded ships and armies. When the griping stopped, officers worried. Vaz relaxed a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s one feud we won’t need to stir up.” Al the weapons were invisibly tagged to make them trackable, the transponder material worked into the metal itself. Vaz examined one of the energy swords to see if he could detect it on a casual inspection. “Wil the hinge-heads fal for the tracking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ve lost their Prophets and Engineers so they’re not so technical y hot now. But even if they spot it, I doubt they’l care. They’l think they can pick us off later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi suddenly jerked her head up, frowning. Vaz strained to listen and caught the sound of two Elites chattering on the radio. It had to be a recording of voice traffic intercepted before they entered slipspace, but it stil had the power to make his flesh crawl. He wasn’t going to shake it that easily. Nobody who’d fought those things at close quarters ever would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fol owed the sound, squeezing between the stowed drop pods, and ended up outside a smal fire-control compartment aft of the dropship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hatch was open. When he stuck his head inside, he found Phil ips with his boots up on the console, fingers meshed behind his head, and eyes shut. His datapad sat in his lap. Its screen was flickering with rapidly scrol ing lines of text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaz waited for him to notice someone was there. It took a ful minute. Phil ips just opened his eyes and didn’t even look startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dialect variation,” he said. “Good stuff, this ONI eavesdropping kit.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-glasslands-halo-8/page-12.html","bookId":1639,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:30 PM"}
