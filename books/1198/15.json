Smell that!” cried Bob, as he hurried out in answer to the first mess call of the day. “Bacon, or I’m a sinner!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Breakfast call was sounded at 6:15 and half an hour was allowed for it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As soon as the mess call had sounded each man, acting under the directions of his squad leader, got his mess kit, consisting of plate, cup, knife, fork and spoon. Later the boys needed no instructions in producing these implements of “warfare.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The signal being given, they marched to the kitchen where there was dished out to each one what was to be the first meal of the day. This proved to be steamed rice and milk, bacon, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, buttered toast, bread and coffee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With this as a starter the boys marched into the mess hall and sat down at long tables to eat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How goes it, Chunky?” asked Ned, as he noticed his stout chum beginning to eat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [118]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Tell you better when I’ve had my second or third helping,” was the somewhat mumbled reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Talk it out, Chunky,” advised Jerry. “Don’t scramble your reply; leave that to the eggs you’re sailing into.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Huh, I’ll sail clear through these, and then some.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Can you have as much as you like?” asked a rather timid lad next to Ned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All you want, son, and more,” answered the squad leader, who was walking about, and who had overheard the question.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As each one finished he took his mess kit down to the end of the hall, where there was a kettle of scalding water, and washed his cutlery and dishes. There are no official dishwashers in the army, save those who serve in the officer’s mess.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, do you feel better?” asked Ned, as he and Jerry filed out with Bob.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Lots,” was the answer. “What call’s that?” he inquired, as another bugle note blared out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sick call and fatigue,” answered Jerry, who was learning the army orders and regulations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This call came at 6:45 and gave opportunity for such as were physically disabled in any way to escape drill for the day. If a man is not feeling physically fit in the morning he so reports to his first sergeant, who places the name on a list. Then, when the proper call comes, and all who are[119] in need of medical attention are collected, an officer marches them to an infirmary.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of course, this applies only to those slightly “under the weather.” In case of a very ill recruit the doctor goes to him, instead of having him go to the medical man. If a man is taken ill, or feels the need of medical attention at any time other than the official sick call, an officer is detailed to take him to the doctor, or the doctor comes to him, at any hour it may be necessary.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fortunately there were very few who responded to sick call the first morning in Camp Dixton. When it was over, at 6:50 o’clock, came the first call for the day’s drill. Five minutes later came the assembly, which meant that every man, not excused, must be in line. Then the drill began. It was to last an hour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were six drills during the day (or were at Camp Dixton), besides guard-mount in the late afternoon. Between the drills came dinner, of course. But the new soldiers were impressed with the drills. There were so many of them, and when there was no drill there was a school of instruction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Drills, or the assembly calls for them, came at the following hours: 8:15, 9:30, 10:45, 1:00, and 2:15. At 3:30 came a school of instruction, which lasted an hour. There was guard-mount, too, which is another sort of drill, at 5:00. This[120] lasted half an hour, and mess call for supper sounded shortly after 5:30, followed by retreat, meaning that the main part of the day was over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From supper time till the call to quarters, which sounded at 9 P.M., the recruit was allowed to do about as he pleased, though sometimes there was instruction in the evening. The call to quarters was the signal for all lights to be out in the squad room, though it was not necessary for all the soldiers to be there at that hour. They were, however, expected to be there at ten o’clock when taps were sounded, this being a bugle call for all lights to be out, and every one in bed, except the officers and sentries.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, I don’t see where we’re going to have an awful lot of time to scrabble around and have fun,” said Bob, in a half-growling tone, as he looked over the printed list of the camp schedule. “We have from four-thirty to five-forty-five with nothing to do, if we’re not in the guard-mount stunt, and then we have time after supper. But that isn’t much.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Say, what do you think you’re on—a vacation?” asked Jerry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, no, not exactly,” answered Bob slowly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not exactly! I should say not! Most emphatically—not! You’re here, and so we all are, to do our duty and beat the Germans, and if it takes all day I’m willing!” went on Jerry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [121]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As has been mentioned there are many kinds of drills in the army, but the new recruits, such as Ned, Bob, and Jerry, found, according to their squad leader, that the physical drill was the most important one for them at first. Later on would come rifle drill, drill in the trenches, bayonet practice, machine gun drill, rushes with hand grenades and so on. There seemed to the boys to be no end to it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The boys of course, began at the very bottom to learn about army work, and one of the first things they were told was in regard to different formations, or units. The squad is the smallest unit of the infantry, to which branch of the service the three chums were attached. A squad consists of eight men, seven privates and a leader, who is, generally, a corporal. This squad is the foundation of the army, and the members of it generally stay together, sleeping, eating and fighting in unison with other squads.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After the squad comes the platoon, which is made up of from two to six squads, and the men are in charge of a lieutenant with a couple of non-commissioned officers to help him. Four platoons make a company, and this is in charge of a captain, with two lieutenants to aid him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The battalion of four companies comes next and a major commands a battalion, while three battalions usually make up a regiment, which is[122] commanded by a colonel, with a number of staff officers to advise and aid him. It takes two regiments of infantry to make a brigade, which is in charge of a brigadier general. Next comes a division, which is the largest group in the army, and is made up in various ways, from infantry and artillery and machine gun battalions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I wonder what’s up?” said Ned, as he walked with his chums to the designated place. None of them was in uniform, as yet. That would come later.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What do you mean—up?” asked Jerry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I mean it looks as though we were going to listen to a speech,” went on Ned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And this was just what was going to happen. The captain of the company to which they were temporarily assigned, had gathered the recruits about him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I want to tell you a few things before we begin the physical drill,” he said, “so you will appreciate the importance of it. If I did not, you might think that some of it was of little use. But I want to say that it all has a value that has been tried and proved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You know the army that is to help whip Germany is just like a big machine. You are all parts in that machine, and every part, no matter how small, must work in perfect unison with every other part, or there will be failure. To begin[123] with, you must be physically fit to stand much hard work, and this drill is to get you in good condition.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Some of the motions you are made to go through may seem foolish to you, but they are all for some good purpose. You have muscles which, ordinarily, you seldom use. It is to bring out these muscles, and make them fit for service, that certain motions and practice are necessary. You’ll be surprised on finding what a little exercise will do for certain weak and flabby muscles that you have. They will be waked up and made to do their duty.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the boys found, before the day was over, that their captain spoke the truth, and with a knowledge that could not be questioned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, look who’s here,” said Bob to Ned in a low voice, as they had a little respite from twisting and turning and stooping and rising.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Who?” asked Ned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That Pug Kennedy we had the row with in the train. They’re going to put him in our squad, I’m afraid.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s bad,” said Jerry. “But still it won’t do to kick. This is only temporary, and he may be changed, or we may. Don’t give up the ship now.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pug Kennedy was, indeed, put in the squad with[124] the three Cresville friends, and his unpleasant face grinned at them as the drill went on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pug Kennedy lived up to his reputation. He was a “scrapper,” and he did little but growl at every new order. He did not see any reason for this, nor sense in that, and only the fact that he did his growling in a low voice saved him from being disciplined. The officers did not hear him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was three or four days after the arrival of Ned, Bob, and Jerry at Camp Dixton that Bob came hurrying up to his chums with a pleased look on his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What is it, Chunky?” asked Ned. “Have you managed to squeeze another mess call into the day’s program?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No. But we’re going to get into uniforms to-day. I just heard our captain say so,” answered the stout lad. “Now we’ll look like real soldiers!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bob was right. A few minutes later came the call for the recruits to line up and proceed to the quartermaster’s department to be measured for uniforms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now this is something like!” exclaimed Bob.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1662/49029.html","bookId":1198,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:34:10 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:34:10 AM"}
