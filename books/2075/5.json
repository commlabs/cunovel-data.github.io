It was barely a month past that Damon and I tried to save Katherine\u0027s life, and her blood saved ours. Barely a month since I was a living, warm-blooded human, who sustained himself on meals of meat and vegetables, cheese and wine - and who slept in a feather bed, with clean linen sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it feels like a lifetime, and by some definitions, I suppose it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just as quickly as my fortunes turned after New Orleans, leaving me to live as a vagrant in a rocky hollow in the park, here I am at a proper desk under a leaded window, a thick rug at my feet. How quickly I am slipping back into human ways!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sutherlands seem like a kind family. I picture tempestuous Bridget and her long-suffering older sister as mirror versions of Damon and myself. I never appreciated how harmless Damon\u0027s and my father\u0027s fights were back when they were just about horses and girls. I was always terrified one of them would say or do something that would end forever what semblance of a family we had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that my father is dead and my brother and I are . . . what we are, I realize how much more serious things can get, and how simple and easy life was before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn\u0027t even stay here, even tonight. I should sneak out the window and flee to my place of exile. Being enfolded in the warm, living embrace of the Sutherland family for any amount of time, no matter how short, is dangerous and deceptive. It makes me feel like I could almost belong to the world of humans again. They don\u0027t realize they have welcomed a predator into their midst. All that would need to happen is for me to lose control once, to slip from my room right now and take my fill of one of them, and their lives would be filled with tragedy - just as mine became when Katherine arrived on our doorstep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFamily has always been the most important thing to me, and I would be lying if I didn\u0027t admit how comforting it is to be among people who love one another, if only for one borrowed night. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time since I\u0027d left New Orleans, I rose with the sun, intent to slip out of the mansion and disappear into the morning mists before anyone came to wake me. But it was hard to resist the pull of crisp linen sheets, the soft mattress, the shelves of books, and the painted ceiling of my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter admiring the fresco of winged cherubs above me, I pushed off the soft covers and forced myself out of bed. Every muscle in my body rippled under my pale skin, full of strength and Power, but every bone in my rib cage showed. The Sutherlands had taken my clothes to be washed but hadn\u0027t given me a nightshirt. I enjoyed the feeling of morning sunlight on my flesh, the glowing warmth fighting with the chill in the room. Though I\u0027d never forgive Katherine for turning me into a monster, I was grateful at least for her lapis lazuli ring that protected me from the sun\u0027s otherwise fatal rays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe window was open the slightest bit, ushering a cool breeze into the room and setting the diaphanous curtains aflutter. Though temperature no longer affected me, I closed the window, locking the latch with some puzzlement. I could have sworn all the windows had been shut tight last night. Before I had time to further consider the matter, the tell-tale thump of a heartbeat sounded close by, and after a light knock, the door cracked open. Lydia stuck her head in, then immediately blushed and looked away from my nearly naked form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father was afraid you might try to leave without saying good-bye. I was sent to make sure you didn\u0027t charm a maid into helping you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hardly in a state to sneak away,\" I said, covering my chest with my arms. \"I will need my pants to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry will be up shortly with your trousers, freshly pressed,\" she said, keeping her eyes on the ground. \"In the meantime, there is a bathing room just down the hall to the right. Please feel free to refresh yourself, and then come down to breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, feeling trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, Stefan.\" Lydia looked up briefly and met my eye. \"I do hope you\u0027ll be able to locate a shirt as well.\" Then she smiled and slipped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally came downstairs for breakfast, the entire Sutherland clan was waiting for me - even Bridget, who was alive and stuffing toast into her face like she hadn\u0027t eaten in a fortnight. Except for a slight paleness to her complexion, it was impossible to tell that she\u0027d nearly died the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone turned and gasped as I approached. Apparently, I cut a different figure from the hero in shirtsleeves the night before. With freshly polished fine Italian shoes, neat pants, a new clean shirt, and a borrowed jacket Winfield had sent up for me, I was every inch the gentleman. I\u0027d even washed my face and combed my hair back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cook made you some grits, if you like,\" Mrs. Sutherland said, indicating a bowl of gloppy white stuff. \"We don\u0027t usually indulge, but thought our Southern guest might.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, ma\u0027am,\" I said, taking the empty seat next to Bridget and eyeing the spread on the large wooden table. After my mother passed away, Damon, my father, and I made it a habit to dine casually with the men who we employed on the plantation. Breakfast was often the simple stuff of workers, hominy and biscuits, bread and syrup, rashers of bacon. What was laid out at the Winfield residence put to shame the finest restaurants in Virginia. English-style toast in delicate wire holders, five different types of jam, two kinds of bacon, johnnycakes, syrup, even freshly squeezed orange juice. The delicate plates had blue Dutch patterns, and there was more silverware than I was accustomed to seeing at a formal dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWishing I still had a human appetite - and ignoring the fire in my veins that thirsted for blood - I pretended to dig in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much obliged,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this is my little sister\u0027s savior,\" said the one woman in the room I didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allow me to introduce the eldest of my daughters,\" Winfield said. \"This is Margaret. First married. And first with grandchildren, we\u0027re hoping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Papa,\" Margaret admonished, before turning her attention back to me. \"Pleased to meet you.\" Where Bridget was full of life and the plumpness of youth and Lydia was the elegant, cultivated one, Margaret had something of a practical and inquisitive good sense, an earthiness that showed in questioning blue eyes. Her hair was black and inclined to straightness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were just discussing what prompted my child\u0027s rash actions,\" Winfield said, bringing the conversation back to the previous night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why I ran off,\" Bridget pouted, drawing deeply from a cup of orange juice. The older sisters gave each other looks, but their father leaned closer, worry lines marring his forehead. \"I just felt that I absolutely had to leave. So I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was foolish and dangerous,\" her mother reprimanded, shaking her napkin. \"You could have died!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am glad to see you are doing so well today,\" I said politely. Bridget grinned, displaying teeth that had little bits of orange pulp stuck in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. About that.\" Margaret spoke up, tapping her egg spoon on the side of her plate. \"You say you found her covered in blood in the park?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" I answered warily, taking the smallest piece of bacon on my plate. This sister sounded more astute than the others and wasn\u0027t afraid to ask uncomfortable questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a lot of blood, and Bridget\u0027s dress was torn.\" Margaret pressed, \"Did you find it odd that there was no actual wound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh,\" I stammered. My mind raced. What could I say? The blood was someone else\u0027s?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought there was a knife wound last night,\" Mrs. Sutherland said, pursing her lips and thinking. \"But it was just clotted blood, and wiping it down cleared it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret pierced me with her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she was afflicted with a nosebleed . . . ?\" I mumbled lamely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re saying that you didn\u0027t see any attacker when you came upon my sister?\" Margaret asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Meggie, you and your interrogations,\" Winfield said. \"It\u0027s a miracle that Bridge is all right. Thank goodness Stefan here found her when he did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Of course. Thank goodness,\" Margaret said. \"And what were you doing in the park last night by yourself?\" she continued smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Walking,\" I said, same as I had answered her father the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bright light of morning, it struck me as odd that Winfield had asked me nothing more than my name and why I\u0027d been in the park. In times like these, and after his daughter had just suffered a great blow, it was hardly standard to accept a stranger into one\u0027s home. Then again, my father had offered refuge to Katherine when she\u0027d arrived in Mystic Falls, playing the part of an orphan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nagging piece of me wondered if our story could have ended differently, if the entire Salvatore brood would still be alive, if only we\u0027d pressed Katherine for answers about her past, rather than tiptoeing around the tragedy she\u0027d claimed had taken her parents\u0027 lives. Of course, Katherine had Damon and me so deeply in her thrall, perhaps it would have made no difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret leaned forward, not politely giving up the way Winfield had the night before. \"You\u0027re not from around here, I take it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m from Virginia,\" I answered as she opened her mouth to form the next, obvious question. In a strange way, it made me feel better to offer this family something real. Besides, soon enough I would be out of this house, out of their lives, and it wouldn\u0027t matter what they knew about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whereabouts?\" she pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mystic Falls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never heard of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fairly small. Just one main street and some plantations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was some shuffling movement under the table, and I could only assume that either Bridget or Lydia was trying to give Margaret a good kick. If the blow was successful, Margaret gave no sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you an educated man?\" she continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am. I planned to study at the University of Virginia. The war put a stop to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"War is good for no one,\" Winfield said as he stabbed a piece of bacon with his fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The war put a stop to much casual travel back and forth between the states,\" Margaret added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that to do with anything?\" Bridget demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your sister is suggesting that it\u0027s an odd time for me to come north,\" I explained. \"But my father recently died. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the war?\" Bridget demanded breathlessly. Lydia and Mrs. Sutherland glared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indirectly,\" I answered. A war had claimed my father\u0027s life, a war against vampires - against me. \"My town . . . it burned, and there was nothing left for me anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you came north,\" Lydia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To try your hand at business, maybe?\" Winfield suggested hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere was a man with three daughters, three beautiful daughters, but no sons. No one to share cigars and brandy with, no one to push and encourage and compete with in the world of business. I was both worried and amused by the gleam in his eye when he looked at me. Surely there were families with sons in Manhattan who would make for more auspicious marital alliances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever I can do, I aim to make my way in the world on my own,\" I replied, taking a sip of coffee. I would have to, without Lexi or Katherine to guide me. And if I ever saw Damon again, the only thing he would guide me toward was a newly sharpened stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you living?\" Margaret continued. \"Do you have family here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat, but before I had to tell my first real lie, Bridget groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meggie, I\u0027m bored of this interrogation!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hint of a smile bloomed on Lydia\u0027s lips, and she quickly hid it behind her napkin. \"What would you prefer to talk about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yourself?\" Margaret said with an arched brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, actually!\" Bridget said, looking around the table. Her eyes glowed as green as Callie\u0027s, but with her petulance on full display, she no longer reminded me of my lost love. \"I still don\u0027t know why I ran out on the party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret rolled her eyes. Lydia shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, you should have seen the looks I got!\" she started up, waving her knife in the air for emphasis. \"Flora\u0027s dress was the worst, especially considering she\u0027s a newly married woman. And my new sash - oh no, was it ruined last night? I would hate to have it ruined! Mama! Was it on me when Stefan brought me home? We have to go back to the park and look for it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about we go back to the park and look for the person who tried to kill you,\" Margaret suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve already had a discussion with Inspector Warren about it. He promises a thorough investigation,\" Mrs. Sutherland said. \"But, Bridget, you must promise not to run off from the Chesters\u0027 ball this evening or I will be forced to stand watch over you in your bedroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget crossed her arms over her chest with a huff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And neither shall you run off,\" Mrs. Sutherland said more pointedly to Lydia. The middle sister blushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lydia has fallen in love with an Italian count,\" Bridget confided, her pout evaporating as she indulged in gossip. \"We all hope he asks her hand in marriage - wouldn\u0027t that be splendid? Then we\u0027d all be like royalty, sort of, and not just rich merchants. Imagine, Lydia a countess!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinfield laughed nervously. \"Bridget . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget fluttered her thick eyelashes. \"It\u0027s so wonderful that Lydia has a suitor, much less a count. After Meggie was wed, I was afraid Mother and Papa would become traditional and not let me marry until Lydia did and who knew how long that was going to take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lydia is . . . particular,\" Mrs. Sutherland said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh really, Mama,\" Bridget rolled her eyes. \"As if anyone even had an interest before. And now she has a count. It\u0027s really . . . it\u0027s really not fair, you know, if you think about it . . . if I had a proper coming out . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted in my seat, at once embarrassed for everyone, and yet glad to be involved in something as ordinary as a family squabble. This was the first time I\u0027d been among company since leaving Lexi in New Orleans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So many handsome, strange men in our lives these days,\" Margaret said, somewhere between whimsy and warning. \"What an odd coincidence, Mr. Salvatore. Perhaps I needn\u0027t make the grand tour, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush now, Margaret,\" Winfield said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And actually I have no one to go to the Chesters\u0027 with anyhow, Mama,\" Bridget was continuing, actually growing red in the face as if she was trying quite hard to cry. She looked at me sidelong the entire time. \"I am sure Milash won\u0027t escort me after last night. . . . I am in dire need of rescue. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget widened her green eyes at her father. Winfield frowned and stroked his muttonchops thoughtfully. In that moment, Bridget seemed as powerful as a vampire, able to compel her father to her every wish. Margaret put a hand to her head as if it ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Salvatore will take you,\" Winfield said, gesturing at me with a fork full of biscuit. \"He\u0027s rescued you once; I\u0027m sure he\u0027s a gentleman who wouldn\u0027t leave you in distress again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes were turned on me. Bridget perked up, smiling at me like a kitten just offered a bowl of cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI balked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I haven\u0027t the proper attire . . .\" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that is solved easily enough,\" Mrs. Sutherland said with a knowing smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once again,\" Lydia murmured, too low for anyone else to hear, \"we are holding poor Mr. Salvatore at our mercy. With pants.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-the-craving-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-5.html","bookId":2075,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:33:20 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:33:20 AM"}
