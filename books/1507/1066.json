{"id":53391,"no":1066,"title":"Chapter 1062: Boiling Sea!","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[/expand]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao shot toward Seajacket Island with lightning speed. Now that he was eternally within the Immortal Emperor Realm, he truly looked like a lightning bolt as he sped forward, dazzlingly fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a speed that even the early Ancient Realm couldn’t achieve, and was more akin to someone with six or seven extinguished Soul Lamps. And that... was while he was still under the pressure of the Ninth Sea!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he left the Ninth Sea, his speed would be even greater!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he shot along beneath the surface of the water, he only continued to move faster and faster, causing raging waves to roll out on the sea’s surface. Killing intent raged in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flickered with coldness. It had been a very long time since he had been this angry, since he had itched with the desire to kill. At the moment, it didn’t matter who got in his way, they would fall victim to his rage and his desire to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKidnapping friends to use as hostages was taboo in the cultivation world. Few people would dare to do such a thing. Everyone had friends and relatives, so if people engaged in such practices, it would lead to... widespread chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, it was a tactic rarely employed, a bottom line not to be crossed, a principle not often violated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, Long Tianhai had done just that very thing, and it caused Meng Hao to be filled with the desire to slaughter the entire Demonic Cultivator Horde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not some pious and devout individual. If people left him alone, he would do nothing to them, but now, he had been provoked. Any sense of guilt he felt regarding the situation with the Demonic Cultivator Horde was now completely gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You people deserve to die, and die you shall!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flickered with coldness as he sped forward. However, that coldness could not cover up the concern he felt in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he had avoided developing romantic feelings toward Chu Yuyan, it would be impossible for him to deny that she occupied a place deep in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she only existed in Xu Qing’s shadow, and was almost invisible, Meng Hao could never forget all of the things that had occurred between the two of them. His choice was Xu Qing, but that didn\u0027t mean he was willing to let Chu Yuyan get hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter less time passed than it takes half an incense stick to burn, a rumbling sound echoed out across the surface of the sea as Meng Hao burst out into the open air. Now that the pressure of the Ninth Sea was gone, his energy rocketed up, and he glowed with the glory of the Immortal Emperor Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, and a sound like that of muffled thunder echoed out in all directions. The sea around him, and even the air, seemed to cave in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took one breath for him to absorb all of the energy of Heaven and Earth in the area. He used this to ignite his cultivation base and, eyes glowing coldly, he shot off... moving even faster than he had when below the surface of the water!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA piercing scream could be heard as he shot through the air with even increasing speed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonic booms spread out behind him, leaving circular clouds that shook Heaven and Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he appeared, his aura spread out, and the sea beasts of the Ninth Sea detected it. It only took a moment for numerous beasts to charge toward him from all directions. The first creature to appear was a mass of tentacles that whipped toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surface of the sea was aboil as huge shapes rose up from underneath the water. It was as if an infinite number of sea beasts were now glaring at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, the tentacles were bearing down on him as dozens of sea beasts charged in attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scram!” he said, not even taking the time to pay attention to them or slow down a bit. His words were like thunder, shaking all creation. Because he was in the Immortal Emperor Realm, his single word became a tempest that swept out in all directions over the surface of the sea, smashing everything it touched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance, a huge depression appeared in the sea, like a crater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea beasts let out bloodcurdling screams as they were slammed into the surface of the water and destroyed. Blood spurted out everywhere and countless tentacles were shredded to pieces. Instantly, the dozens of attacking sea beasts’ blood stained the water red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao continued on, not having reduced his speed in the slightest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was virtually impossible to even count how many sea beasts resided in the Ninth Sea. To them, Meng Hao’s aura was something that instantly caused insane rage and hatred to burst out within them. It only took a moment for the sea to seethe as even more sea beasts raced toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong them were three who were comparable to the peak of the Immortal Realm. They were enormous in size and had surging energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looking to die?!” Meng Hao said, his eyes flickering with killing intent. He waved a finger, instantly causing hundreds of thousands of mountains to drop down from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese mountains were the manifestation of his Mountain Consuming Incantation. With his Immortal Emperor cultivation base, the hundreds of thousands of huge mountains linked together into a mountain chain which was far more powerful than any of the sea beasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crush them to death!” Meng Hao’s eyes flickered with murder as the hundreds of thousands of mountains smashed down toward the surface of the sea. Countless miserable shrieks could be heard as the sea beasts’ bones were crushed, and their blood sprayed out in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao sped forward at top speed, crushing anything that got in his way. The slaughter was tremendous, and yet, it did nothing to ease the fury in his heart; instead, it caused his anxiety to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact remained that there were simply too many sea beasts in the Ninth Sea. Kill ten, and a hundred would take their place. Kill hundreds, and thousands would replace them. Kill thousands, and tens of thousands would appear!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere didn\u0027t seem to be any end in sight. Massive rumblings echoed out, along with powerful roars. A huge shell shot up from the seafloor, surrounded by an army of seahorses. All of them slammed into Meng Hao’s hundreds of thousands of mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom rang out as the shell was cracked, and yet did not shatter. It fought back against the mountains, during which time, countless other sea beasts flew past them to attack Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was so furious he started laughing, and then coldly said, “It\u0027s been a long time since I\u0027ve collected Demon hearts!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes flickering with killing intent, he performed an incantation gesture, causing the hundreds of thousands of mountains to vanish. What reappeared in their place was, shockingly, a gigantic, indescribably huge Blood Demon head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had crimson skin, bright red eyes, and a shocking, solitary horn. It was fully 30,000 meters tall, and was not illusory, but rather, corporeal. Now that Meng Hao was the Immortal Emperor, his divine abilities had undergone Heaven-shaking, Earth-toppling transformations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant the Blood Demon head appeared, its eyes glowed bright red, and it threw its head back and roared. Suddenly, the head split into two, and then four, and then eight, and then sixteen. In the blink of an eye... more than a thousand Blood Demon heads had appeared, each one vicious and fierce. Meng Hao swished his sleeve, and 1,000 Blood Demon heads shot toward the surrounding Sea Demons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiserable shrieks rang out from the mouths of the sea beasts. As soon as a Blood Demon head touched a sea beast, the sea beast would rapidly wither, and would be killed in body and spirit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin only a few breaths of time, a massive slaughter was carried out. Thousands of sea beasts were all killed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumerous Sea Demon hearts flew out, which Meng Hao collected with the flick of a sleeve. At the same time, he never stopped moving. He continued to speed forward, surrounded by the numerous Blood Demon heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on what he could sense, he was getting much closer to Chu Yuyan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s just up ahead!” He shot forward amidst rumblings like that of thunder. All of a sudden, a huge arm shot up from the ocean up ahead. It was blue and covered with seaweed, and as soon as it appeared, it shot toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the sea around him churned as countless enraged sea beasts shot out. This time, there were more than 10,000, causing huge waves to spread out across the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao could see Seajacket Island off in the distance. However, the roiling sea between him and the island was filled with tens of thousands of additional sea beasts. In fact, there appeared to be almost 100,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e100,000 sea beasts would be enough to cause any Immortal Realm cultivator to be filled with terror. Even someone in the mid Ancient Realm would begin to pant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were even some extraordinarily strong Sea Giants among them, whose heads broke the surface of the water to stare to stare coldly at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Meng Hao saw the 100,000 sea beasts, he smiled coldly. It was a smile filled with a brutal desire to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If all 100,000 of these sea beasts die here today, then maybe a bit of my rage can be sated!” With that, he extended his right hand, within which appeared, shockingly... a globe of flame!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Essence of Divine Flame!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Essence of Divine Flame was fused into one of Meng Hao’s Immortal meridians, becoming a trump card that he could use in battle. Intense, blistering heat radiated out as soon as it appeared, and the Sea Giant which had been reaching out toward him suddenly began to tremble. The other sea beasts in the area were also shaking, and an intense sensation of mortal crisis rose up in their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey weren’t very intelligent, but that didn’t make them any less afraid of dying. Just as they began to back up, Meng Hao viciously tossed the Essence of Divine Flame down toward the Ninth Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Essence of Divine Flame turned into a streak of dazzling flame that slammed into the water. Sea beasts began to scream and back up, but unfortunately for them, it was too late!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Essence of Divine Flame sank into the water, and instantly, roiling heat exploded out. The surface of the water began to steam as intense heat caused the sea water to begin to boil!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, the temperature of the water reached an unbelievable level. This was not ordinary water, and it was not an ordinary temperature. It was so intensely hot that it could snuff out the life forces of mighty beings. This entire part of the sea was now so hot that it was beginning to evaporate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nearest sea beasts screamed miserably as they were boiled alive, causing their bodies to fall apart into pieces. It didn\u0027t matter how tough their armored hides were, they became bright red!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gigantic shell could do nothing to fight back, and a miserable shriek could be heard as it was annihilated!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intensity of the heat set the entire sea in the area into a boil. Bloodcurdling screams rang out in all directions. The Sea Giant screamed and the sea beasts struggled. All was in vain. It only took a brief moment... for the entire area to turn into a gigantic kettle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Sea was the water, and the Essence of Divine Flame provided the heat. The sea was being used to stew up some seafood!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1061\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1063\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1062","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
