Her best chance for getting voice mail instead of speaking to someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I’m so glad! Such a relief. Where is she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She didn’t say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Butterworth shook her head, smiling. “That Tina certainly is a pistol, isn’t she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s something, all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of asking if I could search Tina’s room, but I doubted Mrs. Butterworth would let me. Besides, there was no point. Tina hadn’t been back here since she left yesterday afternoon. The sword would be wherever she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe the house mother would have a clue about that. “Do you know where Tina likes to hang out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I don’t know. The usual teen places, I suppose. I just supervise the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeen hangouts—in Deadtown? There was no such thing. Only a handful of teenagers and children had been caught in the plague zone. Like Tina and her friend. I had no idea where they went, besides school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe her friend could help. “Can I talk to Jenna?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Butterworth smiled. “That Jenna. She and Tina are like this.” She held up two twined fingers. “It’s so nice for the young ones when they have a friend. But Jenna’s not here, dear. She didn’t come home, either. Wherever one of those girls is, you’ll find the other as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI TRUDGED AROUND DEADTOWN FOR A WHILE, TRYING TO think where Tina could be. I was alone on the empty streets. The werewolves were on retreat. Vampires couldn’t come out into the daylight, and most zombies didn’t dare. Stores were closed, everything was shuttered and silent. Deadtown was shut down for the day and, true to its name, wouldn’t come back to life until after sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCraning my neck, I scanned the tall buildings that housed Boston’s paranormal population. Blackout shades blocked every window. Tina could be behind any one of them, but I’d never find her. Trying to locate a zombie here would be like groping, blindfolded, to find one particular grain of sand on a mile-long beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopeless, I wandered the streets until it was time to go meet Gwen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQUINCY MARKET, NEAR BOSTON’S WATERFRONT, HAS BEEN a marketplace for nearly two hundred years. The Colonnade is the food hall, a central building made of granite, two stories tall and more than five hundred feet long. Visitors walk up a few steps and past massive granite columns to get inside, where they can stroll down the long central aisle and buy food ranging from sushi to cannoli to New England clam chowder, from kebabs to enchiladas to ice cream. On either side of the Colonnade are two other long, rectangular buildings, less grand, called North Market and South Market. These hold restaurants, clothing shops, jewelry and housewares stores, and carts where tourists can buy all kinds of souvenirs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a beautiful, crisp, clear October day, and the market was packed. Tourists and locals jostled each other as they milled around, wandering through the pedestrian areas and in and out of buildings. I was glad I’d gotten there early; I’d had to wait more than half an hour to snag a table for five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sitting in a pizzeria in North Market, with a good view of the open brick plaza in front of the Colonnade, a favorite spot for street performers. Right now, a one-man band played there, while “living statues”—Samuel Adams in bronze makeup, the Statue of Liberty in copper green—posed stiffly as passersby stopped to see if they’d blink. Occasionally, one or the other would move suddenly, making half the audience jump. I spotted Gwen and the kids when Zachary ran up and poked the Statue of Liberty. Gwen dragged him away, and thirty seconds later they stood in the doorway. I waved them over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAct like everything’s normal, I reminded myself as the older kids ran over, followed by a frazzled-looking Gwen, who carried Justin on her hip. In just a few hours, they’d be safely back in Needham. I smiled, hoping it didn’t look like a grimace, and gave Maria a hug and a kiss on the top of her head. Zack shook my hand, all grown up at five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d already asked for a high chair for Justin, and as Gwen got him settled, Maria and Zack argued about what kind of pizza to get. Maria didn’t like anything spicy; Zack didn’t like anything that remotely resembled a vegetable. We settled on a large plain cheese pizza for the kids and a small one with artichoke hearts and black olives for Gwen and me. Sodas all around—no caffeine for the kids, though. “They’ve had enough stimulation for one day,” Gwen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe produced three small boxes of crayons, and the kids got busy drawing pictures on the backs of their paper place-mats. She watched them for a moment, then smiled at me. “I should’ve been a Boy Scout,” she said. “With kids, my motto has become ‘Be prepared.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat back in her chair, blew out her cheeks, and smiled at me. “Hey, I like your necklace.” She motioned at the amulet. “You never wear jewelry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. It was a gift from a friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe chatted about normal stuff, Gwen doing most of the talking: how the kids were doing in school, Maria’s soccer games—this was her first year in the Youth Soccer League—neighborhood gossip, Nick’s hopes for a promotion at work. When the pizzas came, she chose a skinny slice from the plain and cut it into small pieces for Justin, who immediately started smearing tomato sauce all over his face. Zack wouldn’t let his mom cut up his pizza for him; after one slice, his face wasn’t much cleaner than his baby brother’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what have you guys been doing all morning?” I asked. “You left awfully early—I tried to call around eight, but you were already gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGwen’s eyes slid away from mine. “Oh, we—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We went to the hospital an’ saw a doctor!” Zack shouted. “We got stuck with needles this big”—he held his hands about ten inches apart—“an’ it hurt!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zachary.” Gwen’s voice held a warning tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria whacked her brother under the table. “Shut up, dummy! Mom said we’re not supposed to tell,” she said in a stage whisper loud enough to be heard two tables over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGwen smiled in a tight-lipped way that said she didn’t want to talk about it. Fine with me. I was more than happy to avoid the details of the kids’ medical charts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it dawned on me. Oh, no. “Gwen, you didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to discuss this now, Vicky. Not in front of the kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sheila Gravett is not interested in helping you. I don’t care what lies she told you.” My voice was rising, but I couldn’t help it. “The woman has no ethics. You know how those werewolf experiments turned out. What’s next—a Cerddorion clone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does that mean?” asked Maria, eyes wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. Okay, Gwen was right. I shouldn’t be scaring the kids with tales of medical abuse. But talking about it was one thing—actually taking them to Gravett, letting her poke and prod them, was another. I glared at Gwen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t mean anything, honey,” I said, smoothing a strand of Maria’s blonde hair behind her ear. “I just got carried away. I don’t like doctors.” I wrinkled my nose to show my distaste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me either!” proclaimed Zack. “ ’Specially not the kind with needles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She just drew some blood samples, Vicky. That’s all she needed. I doubt we’ll ever hear from her again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t so sure. Gravett was greedy and ambitious. She didn’t care if her research caused harm. And she’d lied to a mother about her intentions regarding her kids. If Gravett would stoop that low, she was capable of anything. Gwen had cooperated this far, and I’d bet she’d have trouble getting rid of Gravett in the future. We’d have to talk about it, but not now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSearching for a topic that would get the kids’ minds on something else, I asked about their Halloween plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom won’t let us watch the parade!” Zack’s brow furrowed with the injustice of it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you want to go home so you can go trick-or-treating? You’ll get better loot that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trick-or-treat was last night. Tonight’s some stupid Halloween party at church. It’ll prob’ly be like Sunday school with costumes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t say ‘stupid,’ ” Gwen admonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ll have a haunted house,” Maria said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what? Bobby told me the Boston parade is gonna have real zombies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not this year, Zack,” I said. “Zombies aren’t allowed in the parade. They have to stay in their own part of town. Anyway, zombies aren’t all that scary—they’re a lot like regular people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, except their skin is rotting and their noses are falling off and they got blood in their eyeballs!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much I could say to that. It was a pretty accurate description.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria pointed outside at the plaza. “Look!” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZack turned so fast he must’ve given himself whiplash. “What? You mean that guy selling Halloween balloons?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I saw—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, look!” Zack shouted. “Somebody’s doin’ juggling! Can we go watch, Mom? Pleeeeeease?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh. Indoor voice, Zack.” She turned to look outside. “If he’s still there after we’ve finished eating, we can go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, now. I want to go now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustin, bouncing up and down in his seat, echoed, “Now! Now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo indoor voices from either kid. They’d been good all through the meal. Let them have some fun. “We’re pretty much done anyway, Gwen. You take the kids over there. I’ll get the bill and come join you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” she said, standing. “Bathroom first, kids. We’ve got sticky faces to wash.” With all three of them in tow, she disappeared in the back of the restaurant. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deadtown-deadtown-1/page-48.html","bookId":2609,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:34:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:34:25 PM"}
