Then, with a startled grunt, he sat up. A package of needles exploded in his head and he slumped down on the cold floor, hands pressed to his throbbing skull. A clicking sound filled his throat as he lay there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes he pulled himself up slowly by gripping the edge of the bench. The floor undulated beneath him as he held on tightly, eyes closed, legs wavering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later he managed to stumble into the bathroom. There he threw cold water in his face and sat on the bathtub edge pressing a cold, wet cloth to his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had happened? He kept blinking and staring at the white-tiled floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up and walked slowly into the living room. It was empty. The front door stood half open in the gray of early morning. She was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he remembered. He struggled back to the bedroom, using the walls to guide him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe note was on the bench next to the overturned microscope. He picked up the paper with numbed fingers and carried it to the bed. Sinking down with a groan, he held the letter before his eyes. But the letters blurred and ran. He shook his head and pressed his eyes shut. After a little while he read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow you know. Know that I was spying on you, know that almost everything I told you was a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m writing this note, though, because I want to save you if I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was first given the job of spying on you, I had no feelings about your life. Because I did have a husband, Robert. You killed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now it\u0027s different. I know now that you were just as much forced into your situation as we were forced into ours. We are infected. But you already know that. What you don\u0027t understand yet is that we\u0027re going to stay alive. We\u0027ve found a way to do that and we\u0027re going to set up society again slowly but surely. We\u0027re going to do away with all those wretched creatures whom death has cheated. And, even though I pray otherwise, we may decide to kill you and those like you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose like me? he thought with a start. But he kept reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll try to save you. I\u0027ll tell them you\u0027re too well armed for us to attack now. Use the time I\u0027m giving you, Robert! Get away from your house, go into the mountains and save yourself. There are only a handful of us now. But sooner or later we\u0027ll be too well organized, and nothing I say will stop the rest from destroying you. For God\u0027s sake, Robert, go now, while you can!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know you may not believe this. You may not believe that we can live in the sun for short periods now. You may not believe that my tan was only make-up. You may not believe that we can live with the germ now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m leaving one of my pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took them all the time I was here. I kept them in a belt around my waist. You\u0027ll discover that they\u0027re a combination of defebrinated blood and a drug. I don\u0027t know myself just what it is. The blood feeds the germs, the drug prevents its multiplication. It was the discovery of this pill that saved us from dying, that is helping to set up society again slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelieve me, it\u0027s true. And escape!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgive me, too. I didn\u0027t mean to hit you, it nearly killed me to do it. But I was so terribly frightened of what you\u0027d do when you found out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgive me for having to lie to you about so many things. But please believe this: When we were together in the darkness, close to each other, I wasn\u0027t spying on you. I was loving you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe read the letter again. Then his hands fell forward and he sat there staring with empty eyes at the floor. He couldn\u0027t believe it. He shook his head slowly and tried to understand, but adjustment eluded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked unsteadily to the bench. He picked up the small amber pill and held it in his palm, smelled it, tasted it. He felt as if all the security of mason were ebbing away from him. The framework of his life was collapsing and it frightened him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet how did he refute the evidence? The pill, the tan coming off her leg, her walking in the sun, her reaction to garlic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sank down on the stool and looked at the mallet lying on the floor. Slowly, ploddingly, his mind went over the evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d first seen her she\u0027d run from him. Had it been a ruse? No, she\u0027d been genuinely frightened. She must have been startled by his cry, then, even though she\u0027d been expecting it, and forgotten all about her job. Then later, when she\u0027d calmed down, she\u0027d talked him into thinking that her reaction to garlic was the reaction of a sick stomach. And she had lied and smiled and feigned hopeless acceptance and carefully got all the information she\u0027d been sent after. And, when she\u0027d wanted to leave, she couldn\u0027t because of Cortman and the others. He had awakened then. They had embraced, they had--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis white-knuckled fist jolted down on the bench. \"I was loving you.\" Lie. Lie! His fingers crumpled up the letter and flung it away bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage made the pain in his head flare hotly and he pressed both hands against it and closed his eyes with a groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he looked up. Slowly he slid off the stool and placed the microscope back on its base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of her letter wasn\u0027t a lie, he knew that. Without the pill, without any evidence of word or memory, he knew. He knew what even Ruth and her people didn\u0027t seem to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked into the eyepiece for a long time. Yes, he knew. And the admission of what he saw changed his entire world. How stupid and ineffective he felt for never having foreseen it! Especially after reading the phrase a hundred, a thousand times. But then he\u0027d never really appreciated it. Such a short phrase it was, but meaning so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBacteria can mutate. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-am-legend/page-19.html","bookId":2455,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:13 PM"}
