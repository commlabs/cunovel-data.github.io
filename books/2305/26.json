Trailing a respectful distance behind her horse, he followed her through the massive side gate and around the back of the house to the stable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man came forward to help her dismount. His gaze moved over Falkon, his expression blatantly disapproving as he took the stallion\u0027s reins and led it into the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come along, Number Four,\" Ashlynne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fell into step behind her. The new house was even more impressive than the old one, he mused, and wondered if, one day, she would be sorry she had left it all behind for a man who had nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached the front of the house, she turned to face him. \"Wait here. I\u0027m going inside to tell Kerolena that I\u0027ve decided to go shopping in the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, she was back, followed by a tall, sour-faced man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon recognized him as one of Hassrick\u0027s bodyguards, but he had eyes only for Ashlynne. She had changed her riding clothes for a green dress that made her eyes glow like emeralds, and a pair of low-heeled white boots. She had a large bag slung over one shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go, Number Four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obeyed without question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sour-faced man opened the door of the shuttle and handed Ashlynne inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Brill,\" she said coolly. \"Get in, Number Four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon ducked inside and sat in the rear seat. A moment later, the shackles on his ankles snapped together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrill slid into the driver\u0027s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took the better part of two hours to reach Partha. It was a large city laid out in concentric circles. The shopping area was in the center. It was a beautiful city. The buildings, made of white sandstone and glass, reflected the sun\u0027s light, so that the whole city seemed to sparkle. The streets were wide, lined with trees, trees that had almost become extinct only a few decades ago. Fortunately, the people of Partha had realized their value before it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrill parked the shuttle on the landing strip, exited the vehicle and opened the door for Ashlynne. She released the shackles on Falkon\u0027s hands and feet and stepped out of the craft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon followed her. He stood to one side, his head bowed, his hands clasped, trying to look properly submissive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Brill, I think I left my bag on the floor.\" She smiled at him. \"Would you get it for me, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a grunt, Brill leaned into the vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as his back was turned, Ashlynne pulled the stun gun from her pocket and fired it at his back. He dropped to the ground like a rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you get that from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"It\u0027s the one I took from Gasman\u0027s quarters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve had it all this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No. Niklaus took it from me. I found it in his room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced around, afraid someone might take notice of what was going on, but luckily, the area was deserted, at least for the moment. \"What are we going to do about him?\" she asked, nodding at Brill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon found a length of rope in the back of the shuttle. He quickly lashed Brill\u0027s hands and feet together; then, slinging the big man over his shoulder, he carried him to a large recycling receptacle and dumped him inside. The man landed with a resounding thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry,\" Ashlynne called, and climbed back into the shuttle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon scrambled into the driver\u0027s seat, hit the controls and the shuttle shot forward. It was a remarkably speedy craft, easy to handle. He looked over at Ashlynne and grinned. \"Nice work, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned back at him. \"Thank you. Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Nardin. We can get a transport to Cherlin Four from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cherlin Four? What\u0027s there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s a darf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a who, not a what, and he owes me a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was remarkably easy to find transport. There was a cruiser preparing to leave for Cherlin Four when they arrived. Ashlynne signed for the necessary credits, and ten minutes later, they were on their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne took hold of Falkon\u0027s hand as the ship lifted off. She had packed one of Niklaus s shirts in her bag and Falkon had slipped it on before they entered the space port. The shirt was dark blue, with a high neck and long sleeves, effectively covering the collar and cuffs that marked him as a slave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t said anything to him before, but she didn\u0027t care for space travel. The wild flight from Enjine Base Nine had been her first experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had hoped it would be her last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon looked over at her and smiled. \"You all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"How long will it take us to get there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should arrive tomorrow afternoon.\" He squeezed her hand. \"You\u0027ll like Darf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you meet him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon chuckled. \"I met Darf about four years ago in a run-down cantina on Cherlin Four. A couple of drunken Hodorians were giving him a hard time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had him shoved up against a wall. One of them had a knife. They were laughing at him, said they were going to shave his whole body so they could see what was under all that hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I was a little drunk myself and looking for a fight, so...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you went to his rescue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Those Hodorians are big, but soft. When they were gone, Darf and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI celebrated our victory. By the time the bottle was empty, we were good friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You\u0027ll like Chaney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne nodded uncertainly. In her sheltered life, she had rarely met people from exotic planets. She had seen pictures of other races: the hairy people of Cherlin Four, the yellow-skinned people of Cenia, the giants of Andoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon squeezed her hand reassuringly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, sweetheart. People are pretty much the same all over, no matter what they look like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flight to Cherlin Four was uneventful. Ashlynne stared at the tele- screen located on the back of the seat in front of her, but her mind was elsewhere. Brill had probably made his way back to the house by now. No doubt he had contacted Niklaus. One thing she was sure of - Niklaus wouldn\u0027t let her go without a fight. He wanted the mine. That was why he had married her. Not because he had promised her father, not because he wanted her, but because of the mine. But it would never be his. She had seen to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late afternoon when they arrived on Cherlin Four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne couldn\u0027t help staring as they made their way through the space port. Cherlin Four had been designated by the Confederation as the neutral planet for this quadrant, and people of every race and culture intermingled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiants and dwarfs moved side by side. She had never realized people came in so many sizes and colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, they found a shuttle for hire. Falkon gave the driver directions, then climbed into the backseat beside Ashlynne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, they were underway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon frowned as the driver kept glancing at him. \"Something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those shackles you wear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon cursed softly as he tugged the sleeve of his shirt down over the cuff on his left wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get them off you, I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Ashlynne leaned forward. \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Expensive, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. Can you do it now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shuttle made a sudden turn, snaking back the way they had come. A quarter of an hour later, the driver stopped in front of a rather disreputable- looking building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne looked at Falkon. \"I don\u0027t like this,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me the gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slid it to him while the driver exited the shuttle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coming, are you?\" the driver asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this place?\" Ashlynne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Live here, I do.\" The driver opened the shuttle door. \"Coming, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Falkon said. He got out of the vehicle, turned, and offered Ashlynne his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver led the way. Ashlynne stayed close to Falkon, her heart\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epounding with trepidation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was just what Ashlynne expected: small, dark, and dirty. A large spotted hound growled at them from a corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver waved at a dingy couch. \"Down, sit,\" he said. \"Back soon will I be.\" And so saying, he left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne glanced at the couch, and remained standing. So did Falkon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shouldn\u0027t have come in here,\" Ashlynne whispered. She sent a wary glance at the dog. The animal stood in the corner, hackles raised, teeth bared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver emerged a few minutes later carrying a long, silver metal tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pay first you must,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much?\" Falkon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To my account, one thousand credits.\" The driver punched his account number into a grimy-looking comport, and Ashlynne made the necessary transfer of funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon lifted his arms. \"Get busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver nodded, and then, in a quick move, he drew a knife and pressed the point into Falkon\u0027s belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon had been expecting something like that and he was ready for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalming the stun gun, he fired it at point blank range. The knife and the silver tube clattered to the floor; the driver dropped down beside them, paralyzed from head to foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon picked up the silver tube and turned it over in his hands. There was a single switch at one end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does it work?\" Ashlynne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure.\" Sitting down on the edge of the couch, he pressed the tube against the shackle on his right foot and depressed the switch. The shackle on his ankle opened and fell to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn moments, he was free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted a hand to his throat, turned his head from side to side, sighed with pleasure at being able to move without the edge of the collar pressing into his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne glanced down at the driver. \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, Falkon grabbed her hand and they left the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne glanced up and down the deserted street. \"Now what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon opened the door of the shuttle. \"Get in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t argue. \"I\u0027ll say one thing,\" she murmured as she closed the door. \"Being with you is never boring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne peered out the window while Falkon parked the shuttle. The house, which was round, was located in the middle of a patch of stubby yellow-green grass. Several shaggy sheep grazed in the shade of an enormous tree, the likes of which Ashlynne had never seen. The leaves, a peculiar burnt orange in color, were huge and diamond-shaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed Falkon up the narrow pathway that led to the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand in his. \"Relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if they don\u0027t like me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rapped sharply on the door. It swung open a few moments later to reveal a tall male covered from head to foot with pale beige hair. He was,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne thought, rather homely, with his wiry hair and pale yellow eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Falkon! Bless the stars, what are you doing here?\" The Cherlin threw his arms around Falkon. \"Damn, I\u0027m glad to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy, Darf,\" Falkon said, laughing. \"You\u0027re gonna smother me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarf backed off. \"I forget how weak you humans are,\" he said, a grin spreading over his face. His gaze rested on Ashlynne. \"Now, who\u0027s this pretty little thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon slid his arm around Ashlynne\u0027s shoulders. \"Ashlynne, this is Darf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarf, Lady Ashlynne of Myrafloures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarf stared at Falkon, his expression one of surprise, and then respect as he bowed to Ashlynne. \"Pleased to make your acquaintance, my lady,\" he said. \"Welcome to our home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darf,\" called a female voice, \"who\u0027s at the door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarf clapped Falkon on the arm. \"What are you waiting for? Come on in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed their host inside, where they were met by a female with curly brown hair. Her eyes were also yellow, though of a brighter, more golden hue than her husband\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Falkon!\" she squealed, and hurled herself into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female was as pretty as the male was homely, Ashlynne thought, only then noticing that neither of the Cherlin wore clothing. Covered as they were with hair, she supposed there was no need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe living room was large and airy. There were fur rugs on the floor, modernistic paintings on the walls, a shelf of vidbooks and movies, another shelf filled with a variety of exotic animals and fish carved from ebony wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon introduced her to Darfs wife, Chancy, who also bowed to Ashlynne, then fluttered around, inviting them to sit, asking if they wanted something to eat or drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne declined, but Falkon accepted a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" Darf said, when they were all settled, \"tell us everything. Last we heard, you had been sent to the mines of Tierde. We feared you had been killed in the attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously not,\" Falkon replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChancy leaned forward, her eyes alight. \"Tell us, Falkon, how did you get away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have time,\" Chancy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Darf said, \"start at the beginning.\" He glanced at Ashlynne, a speculative gleam in his eyes. \"And don\u0027t leave anything out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Chancy exclaimed an hour later, \"that\u0027s some story.\" She looked at Ashlynne and smiled. \"We are expecting our first child, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that right?\" Falkon said. \"Congratulations, you two. I know you\u0027ve been trying for quite a while.\" He grinned at Darf. \"I was beginning to wonder about your... ah...\" He glanced at Ashlynne and Chancy. \"Virility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarf punched Falkon\u0027s shoulder. \"Very funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When is your baby due?\" Chancy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure,\" Ashlynne replied. \"In about six months, I think. Yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any day now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne nodded. \"You don\u0027t look it,\" she said, then blushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChancy laughed good-naturedly as she ran a hand over her hairy belly. \"I can hide quite a bit under all this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarf ruffled his wife\u0027s hair. \"So, Falkon, how long are you two going to stay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. Have you heard anything of Daccar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarf grunted. \"Your home is at peace for the first time in thirty years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon looked stunned. \"I don\u0027t believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarf nodded. \"There was a battle with the Romarians shortly after you were captured. Your people allied with the barbarians of Swernolt and emerged victorious. Daccar, Swernolt and Romariz signed a treaty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon swore under his breath. A treaty with Romariz. It was unthinkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these months, he had thought of nothing but vengeance. \"Have you heard anything of an alliance between Romariz and Cenia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarf shook his head. \"No, but I heard through a reliable source that Drade has been seen on Hodore in the company of the Cenian ambassador.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drade.\" Falkon\u0027s hands clenched as he imagined them around his enemy\u0027s throat. He should have kept that damnable collar. He\u0027d like to see Drade squirming on the ground, just once, his body writhing in agony. Just once before he killed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Falkon?\" He turned his head to see Ashlynne staring at him, her brow furrowed with concern. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should let it go,\" Darf said quietly. \"There\u0027s nothing to be gained from revenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t there?\" Falkon met his friend\u0027s gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you risk your future, or Ashlynne\u0027s future, to avenge the past? Vengeance will serve no purpose. It will not bring Maiya or your daughter back to you, nor ease the pain of their loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalkon looked at Ashlynne and knew his friend spoke the truth. What was past was past, and could not be resurrected. And Ashlynne... As much as he yearned to avenge Maiya\u0027s death, he would not put Ashlynne\u0027s life, or the life of their unborn child, in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak wisely, as always,\" Falkon said. Not long ago, he had wished for a chance to spend the rest of his life with Ashlynne. Now that he had that chance, he would be a fool to throw it away. Sliding his arm around her waist, he drew her close. \"To hell with Drade,\" he said, and felt a sense of peace wash over him as Ashlynne looked into his eyes and smiled. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-captive/page-26.html","bookId":2305,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:40 PM"}
