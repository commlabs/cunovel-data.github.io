I removed my Browning, hoping sand hadn\u0027t gotten lodged in the barrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second shot thunked near my shoes. I jerked my exposed legs in closer as an earsplitting echo followed the shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, that was close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlindly, I eased my arm around the boulder, let loose with two shots of my own in the general proximity of the spot I had seen the reflection. The two shots were to give the shooter something to think about. I had seven more to be more careful with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy return fire seemed to work. The shooting from above stopped, at least for the time being. I lay there behind the boulder, trying to make myself as small as possible - a difficult task at best - alert for any sounds or movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I saw movement, but not the kind I expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen feet away, emerging from the shadows of a smaller boulder, probably awakened by the gunshots - that is, if they even slept - was a tarantula. From my perspective, with my face pressed against the hot sand, the thing looked gargantuan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gargantuan tarantula took a few steps in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy skin crawled, and if I wasn\u0027t currently under gunfire attack I might have jumped up and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt continued toward me. Slowly, deliberately....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. Sweat rolled from my temple and into my right eye, momentarily blurring the little monster. When my vision cleared, I saw that it had stopped. Now, slowly, it raised its two hairy front legs up into the air. Like a referee signaling a touchdown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore movement behind it -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve got to be kidding me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIssuing out of a hole at the base of the boulder, as if straight from Hell, were dozens and dozens of tarantulas. All huge. All hairy, and all moving purposely toward me, like something out of a horror movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike something out of a horror movie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, this was a horror movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the water bottle next to me exploded, spraying me with water and briefly confusing the spiders. I had actually forgotten about the gunfight. Hell, the gunfight was almost a welcome distraction at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, tried to focus. They were just spiders, right? Were tarantulas even poisonous? I think some were. How about California desert tarantulas? And since when did California have tarantulas?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother shot. As the bullet ricocheted off the boulder near my head, something touched my hand. I jerked my hand away just as a particularly fat and hairy spider tumbled onto its back, its legs kicking at the air furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet Jesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gathered myself, mentally considered my choices, realized I didn\u0027t have many, and then did the only thing I could think of. I fired a single shot from around the boulder. The blast sent the tarantulas scurrying - and me scurrying, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood suddenly, fired two more shots up into the cliff, and dashed off toward the north cliff wall. A single shot exploded in the sand near my feet. I had surprised the shooter. Hell, I had surprised myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing hard, sweating even harder, I pulled up next to the curving cliff face, partially out of the shooter\u0027s line of fire. Still, he was somewhere above me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, I thought he was a he.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical male bias.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy skin was still crawling. I think I was going to have the heebie-jeebies for a week, if I survived that long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA jutting rock buttress partially shielded me from the sun and, hopefully, from the shooter. I waited there another ten minutes without incident. Incident being, of course, gunshots and tarantulas. Now there\u0027s a band name for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping to the shadows of the cliff trail, I slowly worked my way back up the steep face. Already, I was regretting not having the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no more gunshots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr giant, hairy bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about halfway up the cliff face when I heard it: the sudden roar of an engine. Recklessly, I pocketed my pistol, scrambled up the rest of the way as fast as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I crested the cliff ridge, I saw a blue Rawhide truck hauling ass out of here, kicking up about a mile\u0027s worth of dust in its wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over at my car; it appeared unmolested. Hopefully, it still had some gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, sitting in the hot seat, I slipped the key into the ignition. Praying hard, I turned the key. The engine started with a roar. I still had more than half a tank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother\u0027s cemetery, late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been drinking all evening. Cindy was away in Santa Barbara with some girlfriends. Not a bad idea since I tended to spend the weekends watching football.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone for the weekend, I was free to drink. Whoopee. Only I didn\u0027t want to get so drunk that I couldn\u0027t enjoy football. That would just be stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck football.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, now I knew I was drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the engine still running, I was parked along Vicente Street, next to the cemetery\u0027s entrance. My lights were off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cemetery was massive and rolling, covering many dozens of acres. Lots of dead bodies here. Of those bodies, I wondered how many had been murdered. And of those murders, I wondered how many went unsolved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least one, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould be an interesting, if not macabre, poll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was after hours. The cemetery was black and empty. Through the low wrought-iron fence, I could see the gentle sweep of the landscape, which was populated with black oak trees. There were no tombstones in this cemetery; rather, brass nameplates embedded in the grass. Those who cared did not allow the grass to overgrow the nameplate. I was one of those who cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if ghosts haunted the cemetery. If so, I wondered how many were now watching the Mustang and the drunken man inside and if they remembered what it was like to get drunk. I wondered if I really believed in ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn this night, with the full moon shining overhead, with too much alcohol coursing through my veins, it was easy to believe in ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank from a warm can of beer nestled between my legs. The beer tasted horrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass inside my car was steaming over. My leather seats were cold to the touch. I was sweating, could feel it collecting above my brow. Soon it would roll down my cheeks and nose. I always sweat when I drink too much. Not sure why. Maybe it excites me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished the beer and crumpled it in my hand. I picked up the bouquet of flowers from the seat next to me and stepped out of the Mustang. The cool night air felt heavenly against my hot skin. A soft breeze swept through the graveyard, rustling the branches of the many trees. That is, I hoped it was a breeze, and not some poor lost soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing one hand to pivot, I jumped the low fence, kicking my legs up and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side, I staggered down the grassy slope, crossing over the final resting places of the dead, mumbling drunken apologies, until I stopped in front of a familiar nameplate near a small oak tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared down in numbed silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brass plate glistened in the residual city light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday was November 2nd, my mother\u0027s birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no flowers on her grave, of course, for she had no family and no friends, other than me. I set the bouquet across the grave, in the area of her chest and her clasped hands\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and saw my mother as I always remembered her: beautiful and radiant, smiling warmly down at me, alive and healthy. I imagined her taking the flowers from me and kissing me on the cheek, then holding me at arm\u0027s length, cocking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Jimmy, they\u0027re beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes. The cemetery was empty. The grass looked black, and my mother\u0027s nameplate was hidden now in a blur of tears. She was down there somewhere, beneath my feet. The woman who loved me with all her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Happy birthday, ma.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-mummy-case-jim-knighthorse-2/page-12.html","bookId":2352,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:49 AM"}
