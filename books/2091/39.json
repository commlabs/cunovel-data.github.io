He didn\u0027t find me funny. Imagine that? \"You lie to everyone else, but you cannot lie to me. I have hunted these beasts for longer than you have both been alive. Unless...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered us. \"Unless one or both of you are possessed by the demon werewolf.\" His gaze lowered to Adam\u0027s bloody arm. \"I don\u0027t suppose you were shot with silver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a matter of fact - \" I began, and Adam elbowed me in the ribs. \"Hey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who de hell are you, mister?\" Adam demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will be happy to tell you as soon as you prove you aren\u0027t evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how are we supposed to do that?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, in the good old days, I would just shoot you and see if you exploded. But as everyone has been telling me, that causes too many questions. I hate questions. So I have come up with another way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached into his pocket and pulled out a huge silver crucifix, throwing it at me before I knew what he was up to. I had no choice but to catch the thing or let it hit me in the nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No smoke,\" Mandenauer said. \"You live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy silver fleur-de-lis chain had disappeared down my shorts. I tugged it free. \"I could have shown you this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh well.\" He shrugged and glanced at Adam. \"Are you wearing one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man lifted a brow in my direction. \"If you please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already done this test,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humor me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed the cross to Adam\u0027s nonbloody bicep, then lifted a brow in Mandenauer\u0027s direction. \"No smoke, no flame, no explosion. Happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man lowered his gun. \"Ecstatic. Now where is the beast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What beast?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a cage in the swamp. You have been hunting from a tree. You understand about the silver. If I didn\u0027t know better, I\u0027d say you were one of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jager-Suchers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My German is a little rusty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hunter-searchers,\" Adam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer\u0027s gaze narrowed. \"You know of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a little German. My guess is you hunt things no one else believes in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ja.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll find nothing here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know better. Even without the physical evidence, the newspaper reports of disappearances and deaths, the rabies concern, there\u0027s what I know about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" I squeaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diana Malone, obsessed since her husband\u0027s untimely death with finding evidence of a paranormal creature and clearing his name. For the past four years you have traversed the globe searching. But at last I think you have found one. My question is, why are you not calling the national media?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tightened my lips and kept quiet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could it be because you\u0027re in love with the thing?\" His gaze turned to Adam. \"Lycanthropes are accomplished at the physical. They will do anything, say anything, to keep themselves alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hinting that I\u0027ve allowed myself to be seduced to the dark side?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has happened before,\" Mandenauer muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just showed you that silver doesn\u0027t affect him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps the beast in the swamp is a different kind of beast from the one I am used to. Perhaps whatever hunts beneath the crescent moon in the Crescent City has grown strong enough to survive the usual methods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his gun, and I stepped in front of Adam again. \"No. I mean, yes. But... hell. Adam, I think we should tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sent a man down here a few weeks ago,\" Mandenauer continued as if we\u0027d said nothing. \"He saw wolves where they did not belong, led by a black wolf with all too human blue eyes. Then my man disappeared. Now I learn he was strangled not far from here. Do you know anything about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to sweat - actually I\u0027d been sweating all along, it was hot, but the sweat trickling down my back turned cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Adam hadn\u0027t told me so, I was pretty sure he\u0027d been responsible for the strangulation. What would Mandenauer do if he discovered Adam had killed one of his operatives to protect the evil, murdering loup-garou? Edward Mandenauer might appear too old to do much of anything, but in his eyes I recognized a steely resolve, a lack of compassion reminiscent of the beasts he hunted, and that made me nervous. Because even my grandpa could fire a gun. Maybe Adam was right and we should keep quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can cure lycanthropy,\" Mandenauer murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam\u0027s sharply indrawn breath was drowned out by my blurted, \"You can?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me, but there is someone I would call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to Adam, hope making me babble. \"This could be the break you\u0027ve been looking for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or a trap.\" He lowered his voice. \"He said he\u0027s a hunter. All he knows is how to kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue. Why should we trust someone who\u0027d walked out of the swamp? He could be anyone. I stilled. Or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were in the army, Ruelle,\" Mandenauer continued. \"Elite Special Forces. A team known as Company Z - last resort You were assassins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\" Adam demanded. \"No one is supposed to know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have worked for the government most of my life,\" Mandenauer said. \"Even now, though I am in complete charge of my unit, I receive my funding from them.\" He pulled a cell phone off his belt and tossed it to Adam. \"You must have a contact, a friend, still in the employ of Uncle Sam. Call him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you are who you say you are, no one will tell me anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will if I say so. Call your friend; have him access my file, then type in A-I-R-A-M when asked for security clearance. After be relates the information, you can decide if you want to tell me the truth. But remember, I will either kill or cure whatever I find here. It is your choice which it will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam\u0027s gaze met mine and I shrugged. What could it hurt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed the instructions, then listened as his contact recited the information in Mandenauer\u0027s file. Adam disconnected, appearing a little shell-shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is who he says he is,\" Adam confirmed. \"He runs some Special Forces monster-hunting unit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean werewolf-hunting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to my contact, there are a lot more than werewolves out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught my breath. \"Simon was right all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And often quite helpful to us,\" Mandenauer murmured. \"We monitored his Internet and library usage, his book purchases - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed. The Patriot Act could be a real pain in the ass. Although this seemed to be slightly beyond the realm of the rightly paranoid Homeland Security Force. Just what kind of power did Mandenauer wield?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your husband was very good at weeding the truth from the lies,\" he continued. \"Often we followed him, and on more than one occasion we eliminated what he found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those times he said he\u0027d discovered something, but when he took me to see it, it wasn\u0027t there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe times I\u0027d wondered about his sanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We killed the beasts before they killed someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the night he died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d always wondered what had really happened. Not that it made any difference. Dead was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon had died from a fall. His body had been broken, marked, torn. Then, I hadn\u0027t thought to check for bite marks. If there\u0027d been one -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened. The Simon I\u0027d seen at the window of Adam\u0027s shack could very well be running around the swamp on four paws. And if Mandenauer actually had a cure -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart leaped with hope, even as my gaze went to Adam. What would I do? I loved them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to Mandenauer. \"Was one of your agents there that night? Did they see what happened to Simon? Is he - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out there killing people? No. We made certain he would not rise again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was bitten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced. \"But you said you could cure lycanthropy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The developments are recent. I am sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Adam. He smiled softly. He understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t save Simon before he was attacked?\" Adam asked. \"What kind of army are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best that we can be. But sometimes even the best are too late. All the Juger-Suchers can do is continue to fight as we\u0027ve been fighting since the war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"War?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"World War Two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam and I exchanged glances. The idea that monsters had been multiplying for sixty years was disturbing, to say the least\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had better explain what you mean by that,\" Adam ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man collapsed onto the stump where Frank had been. \"I was sent to Berlin to find out what Hitler was up to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hitler,\" Adam muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I hate that guy,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer\u0027s lips twitched. He didn\u0027t seem like a man who would smile much or laugh ever, but I\u0027d been wrong about the nature of a man before. I took Adam\u0027s hand in mine, some of my tension easing when he not only let me, but held on, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fuhrer ordered Josef Mengele to create a werewolf army.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mengele was the one who performed the experiments on the Jews?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the Gypsies and those lacking in their mental capabilities, and anyone else Hitler did not like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means he had plenty of test subjects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had no shortage,\" Mandenauer muttered. \"Mengele was given a laboratory in the Black Forest By the time I discovered this, D-day came and went Hitler panicked and ordered Mengele to release what he\u0027d created into the world. I was only able to watch as unimaginable atrocities emerged from the trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the werewolf army?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has been multiplying ever since, as have all the other beasts he created.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer didn\u0027t answer at first; then he clapped his hands on his knees and rose. \"One problem at a time.\" He fixed Adam with a stare. \"I can help you, if you will help me. What is going on in New Orleans that has left so many dead and so many others undead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam took a deep breath and began to tell Mandenauer the history of his family and the curse. He revealed everything, except that he had a son. The old man listened without interrupting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Edward Mandenauer was spooky, he seemed to know what he was doing, and while his story about the Black Forest was far-fetched, it was also plausible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no problem imagining that Hitler might demand a werewolf army; I found it easy to believe Mengele would concoct monsters. He had, after all, been one of them. And it made perfect sense that those horrors had been released into the world to wreak havoc for the next half-century and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d always known Hitler was far too evil to just die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My grandpere wasn\u0027t made by Mengele,\" Adam finished. \"But by a voodoo queen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all the monsters came out of the Black Forest,\" Mandenauer explained. \"There are things walking the earth so ancient it is beyond the scope of our minds. Every culture has its myths, legends, and monsters. Each day new beasts are born and others mutate by accident or design.\" He spread his hands. \"Magic, if you will. What worked to kill them once, does not a second time. This is why my Jager-Suckhr society is getting larger with each passing year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a wonder I\u0027ve never caught wind of you,\" Adam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are a secret society.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet you told me\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am sure you can keep my secret as you have kept your grandfather\u0027s for so long. I\u0027ve sent agents here before. None of them were able to discover anything until this one. And they all disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they got tired of working for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men held each other\u0027s eyes like two alpha wolves over a fresh kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" the old man conceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both turned away at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew as well as Mandenauer did that Adam had taken out those he\u0027d sent But the Jager-Sucher didn\u0027t seem angry about it. Instead, he appeared intrigued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you give me a chance to end the curse?\" Mandenauer pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam rubbed his forehead, his hair swinging forward to cover his face as he considered the request If the cure didn\u0027t work, Mandenauer would most likely kill Henri, then Adam. From the looks of Mandenauer, he\u0027d probably kill Luc and only lose a single night\u0027s sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right\" Adam murmured. \"I\u0027ll give you one chance at a cure, but I won\u0027t let you kill him. I\u0027ll kill you first\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can try,\" Mandenauer said, and pulled out his cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he gave orders to someone named Elise, Adam beckoned me. \u0027I\u0027m going after Grandpere. I want you to take Luc out of town. In case de miracle cure doesn\u0027t work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or in case it\u0027s bogus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and brushed my hair off my cheek. \"Great minds, cher\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right\" I agreed. \"But I need to know if the cure is successful; then I can bring Luc home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam lifted his chin in Mandenauer\u0027s direction. \"He\u0027ll know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So will you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t contact me until you\u0027re certain de cure has worked, and if it hasn\u0027t you need to disappear. If Mandenauer kills Henri, I\u0027ll be searching for you, and I won\u0027t be me anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered Henri\u0027s cold eyes, his vicious words, the blood he\u0027d spilled just for kicks. I didn\u0027t want to see Adam like that. I\u0027d do anything to keep his son from seeing it Still -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t hurt Luc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadness flickered over Adam\u0027s face. \"Wolves are very good parents, but werewolves could care less about their young. To them a child is just another midnight snack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise me.\" His voice was urgent; his gaze, intense. \"Promise you\u0027ll take care of him if I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes gentled. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer ended his call. \"My assistant is on her way. She has the cure and will meet us at your mansion hi - \" He glanced at his watch. \"Three hours. Is that enough time for you to locate the beast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll have to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam stared into my face. I answered his unspoken question with a faint smile, and he kissed me on the forehead, men disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring Mandenauer\u0027s curious gaze, I touched the place where Adam\u0027s lips had brushed. A good-bye if ever I\u0027d felt one. I guess he wasn\u0027t as confident as Herr Mandenauer that the cure would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man still watched me. \"I have to run some errands,\" I said, and headed for the mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer followed. I hoped he didn\u0027t plan to stick to me like gum on a shoe until Adam came back. If he did, I\u0027d have to take drastic measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes searched the underbrush for a great big branch or maybe a rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo distract him, and because I was curious, I kept asking questions. \"What is this cure? A serum? A pill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Although Elise has invented an antidote that can restore the bitten if they are injected before the first change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which would be handy if you were around some when you were attacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shot me a speculative look. \"My point exactly. Most people aren\u0027t, and they don\u0027t realize they\u0027ve been infected until it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what do you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is where the cure comes in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Mandenauer didn\u0027t answer, and I glanced at him. \"A big secret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shall see,\" he said cryptically, which only made me more nervous. \"Elise has also invented a serum that will fade the bloodlust under the full moon,\" he continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did it help with the - \" I wasn\u0027t sure how to explain the soul-deep evil I\u0027d sensed. \"Henri appeared human, but he wasn\u0027t. Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer nodded. \"Lycanthropy is a virus, passed through the saliva when a werewolf bites a human. The virus destroys their humanity, leaving behind pure wickedness. What we call the demon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I\u0027d been right about possession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Henri wasn\u0027t bitten,\" I said. \"Does he have the virus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he make others by biting them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I assume the curse created the infection. It is impossible to know without testing him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he isn\u0027t like the others will the cure work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also impossible to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the mansion. The police had gone. The place was deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be back as quickly as I can,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer studied me with faded yet sharp blue eyes. \"It is good that you leave him. Even if the loup-garou is cured, your lover will never be normal. There are too many memories, too many secrets, too many deaths.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought I was hitting the road because I was afraid of what Adam might become, or the problems he might have adjusting to all that he\u0027d done to protect an evil thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFine by me. The old man could believe anything he liked as long as he didn\u0027t prevent me from climbing into the car and leaving him behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I doubted Mandenauer would follow, since he didn\u0027t want to miss Henri, I wasn\u0027t going to take any chances, so I drove around and around the area before I headed for the mobile home. By the time I got there, noon had come and gone. I knocked on the door, and when no one answered, I tried the knob. Just like the last time, it turned in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped inside and saw the blood. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-39.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
