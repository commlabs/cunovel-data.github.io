{"id":90086,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\u003cp\u003eA quick trip to the Intranet revealed that Arianna Beasly\u0027s in-laws owned a home in the Garden District, while her family, the Favreaus, still lived in the French Quarter. The calendar might read century twenty-one, but in New Orleans the old ways prevailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original Favreaus had come to Louisiana before the area\u0027s purchase was a gleam in Thomas Jefferson\u0027s eye. Back then, the upper-crust French resided in the Quarter, eventually the Spanish did, too. However, when the Americans showed up, they were shunned miserably. Kind of like what happens in France today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing Americans, they\u0027d taken their filthy money and built the American Quarter, which began in the business district and stretched into what is now known as the Garden District\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmericans - gotta love \u0027em. Bigger is always better, and if we can\u0027t buy what we want, we\u0027ll just build what we want and call it superior to the original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Beasly would be considered a Creole, a descendant of Europeans born in the colonies. That and the family residence in the high tax bracket of the Quarter explained the crypt at St. Louis Cemetery Number One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt the Beaslys owned a crypt in the more modern Lafayette Cemetery Number One, which bordered the Garden District. Perhaps Arianna had chosen to be buried with her side of the family. Not uncommon. Around here, where you were buried was almost as big of a deal as where you were born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt any rate, Cassandra and I rang the bell at a gorgeous nineteenth-century home on Burgundy Street. The door was opened by a tiny, wizened old lady sporting a ferocious scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do not have ghosts, good day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to slam the door, but I blurted, \"We came to talk about Mrs. Beasly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman hesitated, blinking through thick bifocals. Considering the murky state of her gray eyes, her cataracts were the problem, not her prescription.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re friends of Arianna\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Cassandra answered before I could say, Not really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra shot me a silencing glare as the elderly woman invited us inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I was rude, but there are stories about this house, and all those damnable ghost walk tours stop outside and stare at us. Some rude people even ring the doorbell and ask to see the room where it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where what happened?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The murder, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Cassandra said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman tottered to her chair, and Cassandra took the opportunity to whisper, \"There\u0027s always a murder or a ghost around here. That\u0027s not what we came for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue. If we got started on the ghost stories in the French Quarter, we\u0027d never get to the werewolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem awfully young to know my Arianna.\" She motioned for us to take seats nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was your...\" I hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis woman resembled Mrs. Beasly around the eyes and mouth, but was she a sister, an aunt, a mother? Once people bit ancient I was no good at determining their generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Granddaughter. I\u0027m Marie Favreau.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027am.\" I nodded respectfully, earning a small smile. \"Mrs. Beasly and I met at the library. I was sorry to hear about her... accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Favreau\u0027s lips lost the smile and pressed together as if she wanted to keep the words inside. But she couldn\u0027t \"That was no accident\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra and I exchanged glances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How so?\" Cassandra asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Favreau looked around, then beckoned us closer. \"We wouldn\u0027t have buried her so quickly, without benefit of a church service, if we were only talking about a dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we talking about?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made an odd motion with her arthritic fingers -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;half sign of the cross, kind of an FU. I wasn\u0027t sure what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protection against evil,\" Cassandra murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Favreau considered her with a contemplative expression. \"You know the old ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you know why we stuffed her mourn with monkshood and drew a pentagram on her chest\" Mrs. Favreau continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monkshood?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolfsbane,\" Cassandra translated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made sense. I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I hadn\u0027t seen anything in Mrs. Beasly\u0027s mouth but teeth and hadn\u0027t gotten a gander at her chest. Considering she was ashes, I\u0027d have to take Granny\u0027s word for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loup-garou,\" Mrs. Favreau whispered, and made the sign of the FU again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we were getting somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bitten must be encased in cement and properly prepared or they\u0027ll rise and walk as a wolf,\" she continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid she rose anyway,\" Cassandra said gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered how long we\u0027d had before Mrs. Beasly turned into a wolf. Now we\u0027d never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Favreau went white. \"She\u0027ll come for me. She\u0027ll know I\u0027m the one who had her buried that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax,\" I said. \"She\u0027s dead for good this time. Shot with silver, we think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman slouched in her chair, shaking fingers pressed to her mouth. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t matter as long as she\u0027s truly dead. She wasn\u0027t Arianna anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembering Mrs. Beasly\u0027s sharp teeth and propensity for drooling, I had to agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know of the loup-garou?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only the legend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve never seen a werewolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes, took a breath, then opened them again. \"We take care to bury certain bodies in certain ways so the dead don\u0027t walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What ways?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If a person is killed by an animal, monkshood and a pentagram.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any animal?\" I pressed. \"Not just canine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me over the tops of her glasses, and despite the murky cataracts, I could swear she saw right through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wolf creates the werewolf. Other animals create other monsters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther monsters? Terrific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One problem at a time,\" Cassandra murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must have been hyperventilating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there is suspicion of vampirism, garlic and a cross. Salt for zombies. If you think their spirit may walk, bury the dead with Apache tears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Cassandra for clarification again. I wasn\u0027t disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obsidian,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Favreau sniffed. \"Better safe than sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do the methods usually work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I really wanted to know: Was there something special about Arianna Beasly that had made her rise despite the precautions? Or did all the bitten do so, but no one ever knew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never had occasion to try the practice until now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your friends?\" Cassandra asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An acquaintance of mine was forced to bury her husband with garlic and a sixteenth-century crucifix made in Provence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that worked?\" I leaned forward in my chair. \"Her husband stayed dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could I speak with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She fell off her balcony a few days later. Broke her neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-oh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dear Mend\u0027s child was bitten by a rat.\" Mrs. Favreau frowned. \"My Mend had a heart attack not long after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother nasty pattern. I had a sneaking suspicion that those who\u0027d been the recipients of the \"precautions\" visited the ones who\u0027d imposed them as soon as they became undead. Lucky for Mrs. Favreau her granddaughter had exploded in a burning ball of fire. Lucky for us all, I was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote to self - leave off the monkshood, garlic, salt, obsidian, and pentagrams. They didn\u0027t work anyway. Silver, on the other hand, might be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother.\" Another tiny white-haired woman stood in the doorway. She bustled in, casting Cassandra and me a curious glance. \"Isn\u0027t it time for your nap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be napping forever soon enough,\" Mrs. Favreau grumbled. \"I was just visiting with some Mends of Arianna\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newcomer\u0027s face fell. \"My little girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I knew Arianna Beasly had a mother, everyone did, it hadn\u0027t occurred to me I\u0027d meet her today. Although why it hadn\u0027t, since I was speaking with Arianna\u0027s grandmother, I wasn\u0027t quite sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo have three generations alive at the same time is achievement enough. To have them alive at this age was pretty darned amazing. Of course they weren\u0027t all alive anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re sorry for your loss,\" I said, feeling keenly how useless those words were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said, though she didn\u0027t look grateful. She looked a little pissed. \"Now I have to get Mother some lunch and a nap. She isn\u0027t as young as she used to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to ask how old she was, how old they both were, but I didn\u0027t dare. Such questions would be considered rude even above the Mason-Dixon Line. Down here, I just might find myself drawn and quartered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, Anne.\" The older woman patted the younger on the hand. \"Arianna is at peace.\" She tottered toward the door, stopping in the entryway. \"Someone shot her with silver. She went kaboom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled over us as Mrs. Favreau disappeared down the hall. Uncertain of what to expect, I cast a cautious glance toward the other woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother-in-law\u0027s a little - \" She twirled one finger around her ear in the universal hand signal for nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Cassandra murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was telling you the werewolf story, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stilled. \"That\u0027s not true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne gave a short bark of laughter. \"You believed her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra made a staying motion with her hand when I would have spoken. \"We shouldn\u0027t have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This might be New Orleans, but that doesn\u0027t mean we\u0027re all lunatics. My daughter was not bitten by a werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Cassandra said. \"Then why did you bury her so fast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnne\u0027s laughter died and something nickered in her eyes before she turned and headed for the front door. We had little choice but to follow. I guess our welcome had runout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise, as we filed onto the porch she answered the question. \"We buried Arianna so quickly because my mother-in-law insisted. She was hysterical. It was easier to do as she wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door closed behind us. Cassandra and I stood in the brutal afternoon sun until someone said, \"Psst\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie Favreau beckoned from the corner of me house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I did see a werewolf once,\" she whispered as we joined her. \"I was a child. My papa took me to Mardi Gras. We were coming home and down an alleyway I saw a man and his dog. My papa said the man had drunk too much wine, so he was resting, with his good friend Mr. Dog to watch over him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe passed a frail, shaking hand over her eyes, as if she were seeing it all again. \"Then Mr. Dog began to eat the man\u0027s face. I screamed and the animal glanced up. He was not a dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But that\u0027s not why I screamed and screamed as my papa scooped me into his arms and ran with me all the way home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother!\" Anne\u0027s voice came from the rear of the house. \"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait\" I reached out, and she tilted her head expectantly. \"Why did you scream?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill went over me, which was downright amazing considering the blistering heat of the sun. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mink you do.\" She glanced over her shoulder, men back. \"Though the form may be that of a wolf, a werewolf always retains its human eyes.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-23.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
