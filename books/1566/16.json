He was definitely offering to help him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you ask. that once more,\" said Harry, \"I\u0027m going to stick this sprout--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m only checking!\" said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrow\u0027s kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Snape was offering to help him!\" said Harry. \"He said he\u0027d promised Malfoy\u0027s mother to protect him, that he\u0027d made an Unbreakable Oath or something--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An Unbreakable Vow?\" said Ron, looking stunned. \"Nah, he can\u0027t have... Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m sure,\" said Harry. \"Why, what does it mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you can\u0027t break an Unbreakable Vow...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You die,\" said Ron simply. \"Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental,\" said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. \"Only time I\u0027ve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum, Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, passing over Fred\u0027s left buttock--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\" said Fred\u0027s voice as the twins entered the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aaah, George, look at this. They\u0027re using knives and everything. Bless them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be seventeen in two and a bit months\u0027 time,\" said Ron grumpily, \"and then I\u0027ll be able to do it by magic!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But meanwhile,\" said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, \"we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a -- whoops-a-daisy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made me do that!\" said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. \"You wait, when I\u0027m seventeen--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,\" yawned Fred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,\" said George, \"what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called--unless our information is faulty--Lavender Brown?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. \"Mind your own business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a snappy retort,\" said Fred. \"I really don\u0027t know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know was... how did it happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What d\u0027you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she have an accident or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Careful, now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron!\" she said furiously. \"Don\u0027t you ever let me see you throwing knives again!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" said Ron, \"let you see,\" he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fred, George, I\u0027m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" said George.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, as Charlie isn\u0027t coming home, that just leaves Harry and Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"--that\u0027ll make Ginny\u0027s Christmas--\" muttered Fred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"--everyone should be comfortable. Well, they\u0027ll have a bed, anyway,\" said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?\" asked Fred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Weasley turned away before she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s busy, I expect, at the Ministry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or he\u0027s the world\u0027s biggest prat,\" said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. \"One of the two. Well, let\u0027s get going, then, George.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you two up to?\" asked Ron. \"Cant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we\u0027ll be free too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t think we can do that,\" said Fred seriously. \"It\u0027s very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"--and if you want people to help you, Ron,\" added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, \"I wouldn\u0027t chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We\u0027re off to the village, there\u0027s a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous... almost like real magic...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gits,\" said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. \"Would\u0027ve only taken them ten seconds and then we could\u0027ve gone too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t,\" said Harry. \"I promised Dumbledore I wouldn\u0027t wander off while I\u0027m staying here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah,\" said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, \"Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep,\" said Harry. \"I\u0027m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore\u0027s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pity you didn\u0027t hear what Malfoy\u0027s actually doing, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, \"Course, you know what they\u0027ll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They\u0027ll say Snape isn\u0027t really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy\u0027s up to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn\u0027t hear him,\" said Harry flatly. \"No one\u0027s that good an actor, not even Snape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah... I\u0027m just saying, though,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry turned to face him, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I\u0027m right, though?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I do!\" said Ron hastily. \"Seriously, I do! But they\u0027re all convinced Snape\u0027s in the Order, aren\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he\u0027s doing...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn\u0027s party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly non-verbal goodbye just behind him at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying \"I told you so,\" which he had done several times to Ron already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to his back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasley\u0027s favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called \"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\" Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestina\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come and stir my cauldron,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if you do it right\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll boil you up some hot, strong love\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo keep you warm tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We danced to this when we were eighteen!\" said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. \"Do you remember, Arthur?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mphf?\" said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. \"Oh yes ... marvelous tune...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about this,\" he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. \"Be over soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Has it been busy at the Ministry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I wouldn\u0027t mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we\u0027ve made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater--only don\u0027t repeat that, Harry,\" he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?\" asked Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I know Dumbledore\u0027s tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan... I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he\u0027s about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma... but the top levels want to look as though they\u0027re making some progress, and \u0027three arrests\u0027 sounds better than \u0027three mistaken arrests and releases\u0027... but again, this is all top secret...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t say anything,\" said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called \"You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I checked, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley at once. \"I went and searched the Malfoys\u0027 house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn\u0027t have been there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you\u0027d looked... but this is something different... well, something more ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin\u0027s head turn a little toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina\u0027s crooning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my poor heart, where has it gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s left me for a spell...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has it occurred to you, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"that Snape was simply pretending--?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy\u0027s up to?\" said Harry quickly. \"Yeah, I thought you\u0027d say that. But how do we know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t our business to know,\" said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. \"It\u0027s Dumbledore\u0027s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" said Harry, \"just say--just say Dumbledore\u0027s wrong about Snape --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore\u0027s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Dumbledore can make mistakes,\" argued Harry. \"He says it himself. And you--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked Lupin straight in the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"--do you honestly like Snape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I neither like nor dislike Severus,\" said Lupin. \"No, Harry, I am speaking the truth,\" he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expression. \"We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he \u0027accidentally\u0027 let it slip that you\u0027re a werewolf, so you had to leave!\" said Harry angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he didn\u0027t dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are determined to hate him, Harry,\" said Lupin with a faint smile. \"And I understand; with James as your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on Dumbledore\u0027s orders that Severus questioned Draco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... and now you\u0027ve torn it quite apart\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll thank you to give back my heart!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eez eet over?\" said Fleur loudly. \"Thank goodness, what an \u0027orrible --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we have a nightcap, then?\" asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. \"Who wants eggnog?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you been up to lately?\" Harry asked Lupin, as Mr, Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027ve been underground,\" said Lupin. \"Almost literally. That\u0027s why I haven\u0027t been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a give-away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been living among my fellows, my equals,\" said Lupin. \"Werewolves,\" he added, at Harry\u0027s look of incomprehension. \"Nearly all of them are on Voldemort\u0027s side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was... ready-made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, \"I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing--and sometimes killing--to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come they like Voldemort?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,\" said Lupin. \"And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Greyback?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t heard of him?\" Lupin\u0027s hands closed convulsively in his lap. \"Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children... bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people\u0027s sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin paused and then said, \"It was Greyback who bit me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" said Harry, astonished. \"When--when you were a kid, you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, knowing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback\u0027s insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you are normal!\" said Harry fiercely. \"You\u0027ve just got a--a problem--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin burst out laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my \u0027furry little problem\u0027 in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: this last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Half-Blood what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prince,\" said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are no Wizarding princes,\" said Lupin, now smiling. \"Is this a title you\u0027re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being the \u0027Chosen One\u0027 would be enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing to do with me!\" said Harry indignantly. \"The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I\u0027ve got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,\" said Lupin reminiscently. \"There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn\u0027t move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad used it,\" said Harry. \"I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin\u0027s smile was a little too understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said, \"but he wasn\u0027t the only one. As I say, it was very popular... You know how these spells come and go...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,\" Harry persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not necessarily,\" said Lupin. \"Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.\" He looked into Harry\u0027s face and then said quietly, \"James was a pure-blood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him \u0027Prince.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbandoning pretense, Harry said, \"And it wasn\u0027t Sirius? Or you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Harry stared into the fire. \"I just thought--well, he\u0027s helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old is this book, Harry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dunno, I\u0027ve never checked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,\" said Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing \"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\" which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley\u0027s expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron\u0027s attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been published. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father\u0027s friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s got to be joking...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" asked Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s from Lavender,\" said Ron, sounding revolted. \"She can\u0027t honestly think I\u0027d wear ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter. Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words: \"My Sweetheart\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice,\" he said. \"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you tell them,\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \"I--I--I\u0027ll--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stutter at me?\" said Harry, grinning. \"Come on, would I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could she think I\u0027d like something like that, though?\" Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, think back,\" said Harry. \"Have you ever let it slip that you\u0027d like to go out in public with the words \u0027My Sweetheart\u0027 round your neck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... we don\u0027t really talk much,\" said Ron. \"It\u0027s mainly...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Snogging,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yeah,\" said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, \"Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dunno,\" said Harry. \"They were at Slughorn\u0027s party together, but I don\u0027t think it went that well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry\u0027s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys\u0027 Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label reading \"To Master, From Kreacher\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry stared at it. \"D\u0027you reckon this is safe to open?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t be anything dangerous, all our mail\u0027s still being searched at the Ministry,\" replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?\" asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hermione would,\" said Ron. \"But let\u0027s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice,\" said Ron, roaring with laughter. \"Very thoughtful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather have them than that necklace,\" said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch\u0027s hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fred and George gave them to me! Aren\u0027t they beautiful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we\u0027re washing our own socks,\" said George, waving an airy hand. \"Parsnips, Remus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, you\u0027ve got a maggot in your hair,\" said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Ow \u0027orrible,\" said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, isn\u0027t it?\" said Ron. \"Gravy, Fleur?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are as bad as zat Tonks,\" said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. \"She is always knocking --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I invited dear Tonks to come along today,\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. \"But she wouldn\u0027t come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I haven\u0027t been in contact with anybody very much,\" said Lupin. \"But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tonks\u0027s Patronus has changed its form,\" he told him. \"Snape said so anyway. I didn\u0027t know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, \"Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional upheaval ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looked big, and it had four legs,\" said Harry, struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. \"Hey ... it couldn\u0027t be--?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arthur!\" said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. \"Arthur--it\u0027s Percy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arthur, he\u0027s--he\u0027s with the Minister!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy\u0027s wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment\u0027s painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, \"Merry Christmas, Mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Percy!\" said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must forgive this intrusion,\" he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. \"Percy and I were in the vicinity--working, you know -- and he couldn\u0027t resist dropping in and seeing you all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else\u0027s heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stony-faced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, come in, sit down, Minister!\" fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. \"Have a little purkey, or some tooding... I mean --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, my dear Molly,\" said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house. \"I don\u0027t want to intrude, wouldn\u0027t be here at all if Percy hadn\u0027t wanted to see you all so badly...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Perce!\" said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... we\u0027ve only looked in for five minutes, so I\u0027ll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I don\u0027t want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden... ah, that young man\u0027s finished, why doesn\u0027t he take a stroll with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour\u0027s pretense that he did not know Harry\u0027s name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, all right,\" said Harry into the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour\u0027s talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine,\" he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. \"Fine,\" he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful!\" said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass through the door ahead of him. \"We\u0027ll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I\u0027ll be off. Carry on, everyone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys\u0027 overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charming,\" said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. \"Charming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,\" said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. \"Did you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Harry truthfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Natural, of course, natural, after what you\u0027ve been through... especially what happened at the Ministry ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, so he went on, \"I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has--most understandably, as I say--prevented this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Harry said nothing, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rumors that have flown around!\" said Scrimgeour. \"Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted... all these whispers of a prophecy... of you being \u0027the Chosen One\u0027...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, and the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we\u0027ve discussed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you, have you...\" said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. \"And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, but that\u0027s between us,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour\u0027s tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, \"Oh, of course, if it\u0027s a question of confidences, I wouldn\u0027t want you to divulge... no, no ... and in any case, does it really matter whether you are the Chosen One or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t really know what you mean, Minister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,\" said Scrimgeour with a laugh. \"But to the wizarding community at large... it\u0027s all perception, isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s what people believe that\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People believe you are the Chosen One, you see,\" said Scrimgeour. \"They think you quite the hero--which, of course, you arc, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,\" he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, \"the point is, you are a symbol of hope for many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named--well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can\u0027t help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, \"Funny little chaps, aren\u0027t they? But what say you, Harry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t exactly understand what you want,\" said Harry slowly. \"\u0027Stand alongside the Ministry\u0027... What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,\" said Scrimgeour. \"If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impression. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: so Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So basically,\" he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, \"you\u0027d like to give the impression that I\u0027m working for the Ministry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,\" said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly. \"\u0027The Chosen One,\u0027 you know... it\u0027s all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are happening...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,\" said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, \"won\u0027t that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry\u0027s up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, \"well, yes, that\u0027s partly why we\u0027d like --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t think that\u0027ll work,\" said Harry pleasantly. \"You see, I don\u0027t like some of the things the Ministry\u0027s doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would not expect you to understand,\" he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. \"These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dumbledore\u0027s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn\u0027t think Stan should be in Azkaban either,\" said Harry. \"You\u0027re making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, \"I see. You prefer--like your hero, Dumbledore--to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to be used,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some would say it\u0027s your duty to be used by the Ministry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and others might say it\u0027s your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,\" said Harry, his temper rising now. \"You\u0027re doing what Barty Crouch did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we\u0027ve got Fudge, pretending everything\u0027s lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we\u0027ve got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you\u0027ve got the Chosen One working for you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re not the Chosen One?\" said Scrimgeour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you said it didn\u0027t matter either way?\" said Harry, with a bitter laugh. \"Not to you anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shouldn\u0027t have said that,\" said Scrimgeour quickly. \"It was tactless --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it was honest,\" said Harry. \"One of the only honest things you\u0027ve said to me. You don\u0027t care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you\u0027re winning the war against Voldemort. I haven\u0027t forgotten, Minister....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn\u0027t so keen to be pals last year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottom-most branches of the rhododendron bush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is Dumbledore up to?\" said Scrimgeour brusquely. \"Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No idea,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you wouldn\u0027t tell me if you knew,\" said Scrimgeour, \"would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I wouldn\u0027t,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can\u0027t find out by other means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can try,\" said Harry indifferently. \"But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I\u0027d have thought you\u0027d have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he\u0027s not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore\u0027s still Headmaster. I\u0027d leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,\" said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses, \"Dumbledore\u0027s man through and through, aren\u0027t you, Potter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry. \"Glad we straightened that out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-harry-potter-6/page-16.html","bookId":1566,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:42:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:42:28 PM"}
