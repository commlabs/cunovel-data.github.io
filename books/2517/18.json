She moves to the window of the room and puts her back against it, folds her arms over her front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou think I regret it? she says. Living didn’t used to amount to much. Now it counts. I used to be a secretary for a real estate attorney. Now I’m a survivor of the apocalypse and a whore. I endure where others don’t. It matters. Just breathing means something now. Have you got a problem with whores?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses cringes, chastened. He looks down at his dirty, brutish hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot as a general rule, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the woman softens a bit. She comes and sits on the edge of the bed, where Moses lies on his back looking at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou and that redhead, she says. You two are together somehow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe and the Vestal? Huh-uh. She’s just my charge is all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re a hired gun?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomethin like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what are you being paid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses goes silent. He gazes at the ceiling. He ponders when was the last time he laid beneath a roof and called it home. The world, for him, just keeps going on and on and on, long after he thought it ever would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, he says and reaches for the woman. Lay here and just let me get some shut-eye for a bit. Then we’ll get down to business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he wakes in the morning, there is a tumult downstairs. He rushes down thinking that his brother has got into trouble again – but this time it’s not the riot of threat but rather the riot of laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the sitting room, on a burgundy couch, he finds the Vestal Amata making merry with a passel of men. Townsmen – a number of the faces Moses recognizes as those of the men who were holding their rifles at the ready when they rolled into town. The redhead herself is lying across two of their laps, her bare feet resting on the arm of the couch, her toes wiggling playfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere he is, she says of Moses to the men. My Rock of Gibraltar. Come on in, Gibraltar. The boys and I have had quite a night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of the other girls sit in the room also, but Moses sees that they are distinctly unhappy with this redheaded interloper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrucie there gave my feet a nice hot salt bath, says the Vestal and points to a tough-looking man who nonetheless flushes when she says his name. Men are lovely, she continues. You try to pay them back in kindness, but they just give so much it’s difficult to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiggles her toes again, and Moses wants to chop them off and put them in a jar like bloody fireflies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe goes over to the Vestal, takes her by the arm and lifts her from the laps of the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, there, mister, says one of the men, a note of warning in his voice. They have already become possessive of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses gets ready for a fight, but the Vestal defuses it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s okay, boys, she says. He is my saviour, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll save you, one man says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, me too, says another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men laugh, and the Vestal laughs with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know the rule, boys, she says. Only one saviour per girl. Let me talk to my Gibraltar in private for just a little sec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes her into a small parlour down the hall and shuts the door behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell was that? he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the boys, she says and smiles slyly. Her eyelids are heavy, and she steadies herself against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou been drinking, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were locked in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pinky promised not to bolt. They gave me my freedom. Said they would watch me. It cost me a groaning or two, but they ain’t a bad bunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks down at her, horrified. Her toes are still wriggling against the plush rug, and it makes him feel sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s the matter? she says. You need a little touch, too? I figgered you got enough last night, but p’raps that matronly lady didn’t quite satisfy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her hand between his legs, and he swats it away disgusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut – but, he stutters, the things you said last night . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs high and clear, slapping her palms against his chest as though he were a drum, an instrument in her own perverse and ritualistic dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh hush, she says. You knew we were just playin, ain’t you? Come on, ol Mosey – this girl was raised in establishments of ill repute. I cut my eye teeth on a big-boss cherry picker when I wasn’t hardly twelve years of age. The celebrations of the flesh ain’t nothing new to me. You want to be a bad boy? Well, then I can sure as anything be a bad girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushes her away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re a liar, he says. You ain’t honest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stands for a moment looking surprised, but then she wobbles and leans against an oak desk – and a mild smile of resignation grows on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoney, she says, honest ain’t the half of what I’m not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaves her there and fetches his brother from upstairs. Abraham is sleepy-looking and irritated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow come it’s so early? he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re gettin out of here, Moses says. She’s a whore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho’s a whore?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on. We’re taking her to Colorado Springs and we’re gettin shut of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, in the sitting room, it looks like there will be a fight when the men discover Moses and his brother want to take the Vestal away, but the girl mollifies the men with sickening sweetnesses and they relent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in front, Moses is stopped by the woman who shared his bed the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo easy on her, she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s it your business? he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt isn’t. I’m just telling you. Womanhood’s a tricky thing. You’re always walking a tightrope between what men want and what they think they want. It’s a long fall either way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trials of bitchery ain’t nothing to me, he says. I choose not to excel. I turn my back on em.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he does. And on the woman herself. And he does not speak again until he and his brother and the Vestal Amata are well gone out of the small town of Dolores, the frozen highway stretched out before and behind them like a bad thought you can’t escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto the mountains they drive, and there are very few dead here. They are buried beneath the snow – dead permanent or frozen in grotesque animation, it makes no difference, for they are no threat. The evergreens are dense here, and the snow is old fall, collected deep. The road is somewhere beneath them, they know because they observe the cut through the trees – but they cannot see the tarmac until it is revealed behind them in parallel tracks from the tyres. Should they get stuck, should they slip off into a ditch, they are aware that they will likely die – too deep into the wilderness are they now to walk their way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Moses drives slowly. Abraham sits beside him in the passenger seat and the Vestal sleeps deeply, curled into a ball across the back seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou gonna tell me why we had to get out of that town so quick? Abraham asks. I didn’t do nothing untoward. I was lookin forward to sleeping in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t you, Moses replies. It was her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns to look at her. She is far gone into sleep after her night of carousing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl’s a whore, he goes on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho? The Vestal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s a whore’s why she took to that place like it was her foster home. There ain’t a drop of holiness in her. She’s had the purity all sold out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a whore? Like a professional?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe good as told me it. She ain’t to be trusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbraham cranes his neck to look at the girl sleeping in the back seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn honest to God whore, huh? he says. If I’d knowed that before . . . You reckon I could bang her now, Mose? It being her vocation and all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses says nothing in response. The world is a grim and empty place. The appetites of the dead – Moses knows they ain’t nothing to the icy hearts of living men. All gone to naught, like a frozen hand laid over some Eden, all the blossoms of the true and holy shrivelled to sumpy weed and iced over to knotted hard and fragile things. And maybe what happened was that all the pure and good got raptured up while what remains is a populace gone all ugly and cankered at the seams. His own blood, too. His brother not excepted, nor himself neither. For the pursuit of good is a constant labour, and he ain’t always got the strength in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun is directly overhead when the car breaks down. They are shaken by an enormous pothole hidden by the snow, and then the car skews a little. Something in the undercarriage knocks loud, and they are stopped dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brothers climb out and Abraham looks under the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe axle’s broke, he says. We’re not goin anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses looks up and down the road, but there’s nothing to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a goddamn trial is what it is, he says. How do you feel about freezin to death, brother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Abraham says, it sure ain’t the way I thought I would go. But it seems clean at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClean? You got some mind on you, Abe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brother takes this as a compliment and beams wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the rear door of the car opens and the redhead climbs out, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes and yawning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow come we’re stopped? she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe axle’s broke, Abraham tells her and smiles. We’re dyin clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe casts a look of confusion at Moses, but he does not meet her gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, he says to both of them. We might as well go forward cause we know there ain’t anything behind. Don’t take nothing you don’t need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they bundle themselves up and walk forward through the deep snow, raising their faces to the noontime sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe there are a handful of blessings left in the world after all, because it is only a quarter of an hour before they find a cut through the trees to their left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it? says the Vestal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooks like it could be a path, Abraham says. Mose?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould be, Moses says. Could be there’s something at the end of it. Could be it’s nothin at all. You want to chance it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMight as well, Abraham says. After all, we can see there ain’t nothing for miles in the direction we’re headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they follow the cut through the trees, climbing up an incline to a plateau where they find a clearing in the woods. In the middle of the clearing is a small cabin with a collapsed chimney and a sagging porch. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/exit-kingdom-reapers-2/page-18.html","bookId":2517,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:22:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:22:34 PM"}
