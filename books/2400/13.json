I decide to ignore it for now and just concentrate on what’s going right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I’m walking down the stairs, my phone rings. I stare at it in my hand, my heart leaping to my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s Thayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel, who’s in front of me, spins around and looks at me curiously. “Everything okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um . . .” I stammer, at a loss for a second. “Yeah. I’ll be right with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run back up the stairs to my room and shut the door tight, wondering if Laurel’s going to have her ear pressed to the door. Cautiously, I say, “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sutton, I’m sorry.” Thayer sounds choked and urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inhale sharply. “Sorry for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I miss you so much,” he continues. “I don’t want us to be apart. I should never have told you I needed space. Not talking to you has been torture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart catches in my throat. Across the room, the image of Garrett is still on my computer screen. His eyes twinkle at me. His smile makes my heart do a cartwheel. I picture him at home right now, composing one of his sweet, poignant, happy little texts. Texts he sends promptly, not six hours later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I feel that same pull for Thayer I always do. “Come home, then,” I challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThayer pauses. “I . . . can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?” I demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thayer, at the very least, let me tell Mads where you are,” I demand. “She’s going crazy with worry. Can’t I give her something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not now. I’ll tell her myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why can’t I tell her now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs. “Because I’m somewhere, getting help. And I just need time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Help for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words come out in a rush. “I can’t explain. Not right now. But I will, I promise . . . when things are different for me. Please just know that I’m doing the best thing for me, and for us, for the long run.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare out the window. What does that mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to come back a changed person.” Thayer’s voice cracks slightly. “I’m going to be ready to be your boyfriend, for real.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny flare of hope blooms in my chest. For real. Two weeks ago, that was all I wanted to hear from him, but now it might be too little, too late. There’s Garrett to think about now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I can’t keep myself from asking in a small voice, “So, you didn’t run off with Mary?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mary?” The line crackles. “God, no, Sutton. Absolutely not. You’re the only one I want to be with.” He pauses again, and I hear the steady rhythm of his breathing. “So, what do you say? Will you wait a little bit longer for me? We’ll find a way to be together, soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart pounds. What should I do? Who do I choose? The boy who’s here, who’s cute and stable and sweet? Or the boy who’s sexy and mysterious . . . but also mysteriously absent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait for a beat before bringing the phone back to my ear. And then I clear my throat and say what I never imagined saying before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know, Thayer,” I say. “I just don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sutton, what do you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go,” I say quickly, the words clogging my throat. Then I hang up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe let Thayer go, for real. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/true-lies-the-lying-game-0/page-13.html","bookId":2400,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:26 AM"}
