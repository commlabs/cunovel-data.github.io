Or was it because you were in the neighborhood and had a hankering for coffee and a croissant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already told you why,\" he said sharply. \"To clear up any misconceptions from the day you came to see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Misconceptions?\" she repeated. \"You couldn\u0027t have made your feelings any more obvious if I\u0027d asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierre waited a heartbeat before responding. \"Then we understand each other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, actually, I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you need me to explain it to you again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should,\" she answered. Impatience seemed to radiate from him, making any kind of rational discussion impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I felt bad about that day and wanted to apologize,\" Pierre said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have felt bad.\" Winter regretted her words immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierre\u0027s jaw hardened. \"I can see it was a mistake to come here. It was an even bigger mistake to think the two of us could communicate. Our relationship didn\u0027t work before and it isn\u0027t working now. I\u0027m afraid we were both fooling ourselves into believing we ever had a chance.\" He stood so abruptly that the chair wobbled before righting itself. \"I won\u0027t say it was good to see you, because it wasn\u0027t. Frankly, this visit told me everything I needed to know,\" he said. \"Everything I needed to remember.\" He started for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, Winter was angry enough to let him go. But almost instantly she realized that if she allowed their conversation to end like this, the memory of it would always stand between them. She had to make at least an effort to reconcile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up and hurried out the door. \"Pierre!\" she called, surprised to see that he was already halfway down the block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pierre,\" she called again, louder this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused, but didn\u0027t turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter quickened her pace until she caught up with him. But then she didn\u0027t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate it when we fight,\" she blurted out, close to tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moi aussi,\" Pierre admitted, his shoulders slumping. \"Me, too. Nothing ever changes with us. I love you and am crazy without you and then we\u0027re together for five minutes and I am crazy with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, too,\" she said in a low voice, \"and yet sometimes I think I could hate you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are not good together,\" he said, looking away from her, every syllable weighted with sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth to disagree and found she couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eW hen I got to the office Wednesday morning, I discovered Macy hard at work on the mural. She had her iPod plugged into her ears and seemed intent on her job. The sketch wasn\u0027t finished, but she\u0027d made significant progress, which told me she\u0027d been at work for several hours. And yet the office had opened just thirty minutes ago. I didn\u0027t understand how she could\u0027ve accomplished so much in such a short time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She talked one of the security guards into letting her in early,\" Linda explained, reading my mind. She followed my gaze as Macy, oblivious to our scrutiny, continued drawing on the wall. \"I don\u0027t know what she said to Larry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarry let Macy into the office?\" That particular guard was a stickler for rules. The fact that Macy had somehow persuaded him to allow her into the locked office was almost impossible to believe. I couldn\u0027t imagine what she\u0027d said to him. For that matter, I\u0027d rather not know. Apparently, I made some movement that alerted Macy to my presence. The instant she saw me, she pulled out her earphones and gave me a dazzling smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Michael.\" I nodded, a bit embarrassed to be referred to by my first name in front of Linda. \"I understand you got here even before the staff,\" I said, striving to sound businesslike. I didn\u0027t want Linda or the others on staff to get any ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to because I wanted to make sure I\u0027d be ready to leave when you were. I plan to finish the sketches today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks like you\u0027ll be able to start painting soon,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked her head to one side. \"The more I thought about how I\u0027d arranged the giraffes and the lion, the less happy I was with the sketch. I\u0027ve already made changes, see?\" She gestured toward the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t really notice that much of a difference, but then I hadn\u0027t paid close attention. Macy had shown me the drawing and I\u0027d approved it. I wasn\u0027t going to stand over her and examine every line she drew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be able to come home with me tonight, won\u0027t you?\" she asked, her eyes imploring. \"To meet Harvey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Linda\u0027s interest and tried to ignore my nurse. The truth was, I\u0027d do just about anything to get out of this. \"You need to make an appointment with a physician who specializes in geriatrics,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy\u0027s eyes grew round. \"Harvey will never keep the appointment. This is the only way. You said you would. You can\u0027t go back on your word now.\" Seeking reinforcements, Macy turned to Linda. \"He promised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promised,\" Linda repeated in a tone that told me she was enjoying this far more than she should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Traitor,\" I whispered. Her support of Macy\u0027s schemes surprised me. It wasn\u0027t like Linda to side with someone else against me. I wasn\u0027t sure I liked this change in my nurse, who seemed to be falling under Macy\u0027s spell. I couldn\u0027t figure out why everyone, including Hannah, thought so highly of her. Macy seemed like a generous young woman and she had a certain quirky charm, but after ten minutes I found her irritating in the extreme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll come, won\u0027t you?\" she pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth, but before I could utter a word, Linda answered for me. \"He\u0027ll be there.\" She shoved a file into my hands and steered me toward the first examination room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, by four-thirty I\u0027d finished my scheduled appointments in record time. Linda had somehow managed to free up the late afternoon so all I had left to do was some minor paperwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I walked out of my office, Macy was waiting for me in the reception area, her purse draped over her shoulder. She wore army-green pants and a yellow T-shirt with a butterfly print on it and a brown vest made of some shiny fabric I couldn\u0027t readily identify. As was often the case, her red hair was a tangle of unruly curls. She lit up like a neon sign the moment she saw me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. I wasn\u0027t keen to meet this neighbor of hers, and my guess was that Harvey felt the same way about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it okay if I ride with you? I took the bus this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI led her across the street to the parking garage, which was a few blocks down from the gym where Ritchie and I worked out. Paul, the parking attendant, saw me with Macy and winked in my direction. It was all I could do not to stop and explain that in spite of what he thought, I wasn\u0027t romantically involved with Macy. But if I made an issue of it I\u0027d only look foolish, so I resisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I pushed the remote button to unlock the doors to my BMW, the lights blinked and Macy laughed softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s so funny?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You. You\u0027re so predictable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The car. It\u0027s such a doctor car. And I bet it\u0027s spotless inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yes, but what\u0027s that got to do with anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, nothing,\" she said. \"It\u0027s just so...you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my tongue to keep from making some remark about how she dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0027d expected, Macy chatted nonstop from the moment she slid into the passenger seat. I heard about her cats and about Harvey and a number of other people, places and things. She bounced from one topic to the next, like Leanne\u0027s friend Gayle, without any detectable rhyme or reason. If I hadn\u0027t known better I would\u0027ve said she was nervous, but that didn\u0027t make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe directed me to her address and when we pulled up I was the one who laughed. The house resembled something out of a fairy tale. It was painted yellow and red. The yard was surrounded by a white picket fence with a gate, and flowers seemed to be blooming everywhere. She had huge pots on the front steps and the flower beds were ablaze with bright purple azaleas. I half expected Cinderella or Snow White to come waltzing out the door, greeting us with some chirpy song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asked, obviously unsure why I was so amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, isn\u0027t it divine? I inherited it from my grandmother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you got your, uh, style from her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some,\" she agreed. \"I repainted it last summer. A few of the neighbors made a bit of a fuss, but they got used to it after a while. Personally, I think it\u0027s inviting, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I was eight, I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, stop,\" she said and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, she had no idea that I was serious. With a sense of resignation I climbed out of the car and shoved my hands in my pockets. Macy was already on the sidewalk, about to open the front gate, when she turned to look at me. \"Don\u0027t worry about Sammy. His bark is worse than his bite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sooner had I stepped onto her property than a huge brown dog of indiscriminate pedigree came rushing toward me at full speed, barking loudly enough to hurt my ears. I braced myself, certain I was about to be tackled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sammy,\" Macy said calmly. \"This is a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSammy stopped in his tracks and stared up at me, his eyes filled with suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead and pet him,\" Macy advised. \"He\u0027s really gentle, but he\u0027s gotten rather protective lately.\" She opened the front door and the second she did three cats raced outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacy bent down and petted each one, murmuring words of affection. \"Meet Snowball, Lovie and Peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a bit silly and, not knowing how else to respond, I waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve been cooped up inside all day,\" she explained as the cats twined themselves around her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led me into the house and, not surprisingly, it looked like a disaster site. She had a number of halffinished paintings propped up against the fireplace--or what I assumed was a fireplace. I didn\u0027t take time to study them, but each seemed different from the others. There was a landscape, a seascape and a still life--a fruit bowl with what appeared to be one huge pomegranate. There was also a portrait of a sleeping cat, the white fluffy one. None of these paintings was completed. This worried me. I hoped she understood that I wasn\u0027t paying her until the mural was done. Apparently, she saw where I was looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a problem finishing...stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about the mural, though,\" she told me cheerfully. \"My car insurance premium is due and I can\u0027t be late,\" she said, then added in a whisper she probably didn\u0027t think I\u0027d hear, \"Again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to hide a smile as I continued to survey the room. A laundry basket sat on her sofa, piled with either clean or dirty clothes, I couldn\u0027t tell which. The diningroom table was covered with books, newspapers, magazines and unopened mail. She\u0027d tried to create orderly stacks, but either the cats had interfered with her efforts or the piles had gotten jumbled on their own. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-29.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
