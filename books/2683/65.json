I immediately pull my pants up and tuck my boner, aching and still stiff and wet, back into my Calvins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s early,\" she groans, racing back into the room. \"Shit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Early for what?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turn around she\u0027s at the closet, tearing through dresses and stacks of sweaters until finally she finds a black ladies\u0027 hat-cool-looking, with a tiny red flower embroidered on its side-and she studies it for a nanosecond before shoving it at me. \"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I\u0027m asking. \"This is your idea of a disguise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him you came by to pick it up for Chloe,\" she says. \"And wipe your face off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren, baby,\" I say. \"Chill out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have come over.\" She starts moving down the hallway. \"I\u0027m an idiot for not throwing you out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we were having a pretty good time,\" I say, following her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s not what we should\u0027ve been doing,\" she yells. \"That\u0027s not what we should\u0027ve been doing,\" she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, don\u0027t say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just find a place to stand and call it a weak moment,\" she says. \"You shouldn\u0027t have come over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, you\u0027ve established that-I get it, okay?\" I follow her into the living room and find a casual place to position myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, stand here,\" Lauren says, tying the sash on her robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if we\u0027re-oh god-talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, what do you want to talk about?\" I ask, calming down. \"How hard you make my dick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just give me that damn hat back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chloe would more likely wear a rotting log around her neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She dates you, so what do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien walks in, holds up the cigar in his hand and says, \"Hey baby, don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s not lit.\" They don\u0027t bother to kiss and in a really serene way Damien nods at me, gives a cute little wave and says, \"Hey Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey Damien.\" I give a cute little wave back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re everywhere today, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everywhere at once-that\u0027s me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor,\" Lauren says. \"Tell Chloe she can return this to me anytime, okay, Victor?\" She hands me back the hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, sure, Lauren.

It\u0027s freezing in the apartment. Everything suddenly seems slightly exhausting, vaguely demanding: the lifting of a spoon, the draining of a champagne flute, the glance that means you should go, even pretending to sleep. There\u0027s a room somewhere and in that room all the tables are empty but all of them are reserved. I check the time. Next to my watch is a stray piece of confetti I\u0027m too tired to brush off and I could really use some chips and salsa since I\u0027m famished. I know who you are and I know what you said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the bar Damien pours himself a shot of Patron tequila and stares forlornly at his cigar. \"She won\u0027t let me smoke in here.\" He pauses. \"Well, not cigars.\" I\u0027m aware for the first time that Damien\u0027s actually sort of really good-looking and in this light I can\u0027t even tell he has extensions; his hair looks thick and black and strong, and I\u0027m touching my jaw, limply, to see if it feels as hollowed out as Damien\u0027s looks. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-65.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
