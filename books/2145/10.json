Cautiously I tiptoed toward the door, my flashlight primed for any maverick vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw nothing. Just my dad\u0027s parked SUV. I was sure it was a hungry raccoon foraging for leftovers in our garbage can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I heard a twig snap.And footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to make a run for it. Our back door was only ten yards away from the garage. All I could think of was Freddy Krueger. Michael Myers.Or hockey-masked Jason. Crazy horror movie stalkers haunted my thoughts. I\u0027d seen far too many scary movies to shake them from my mind,Think kids shows , I thought.Barney .Teletubbies.Dora . Those images frightened me more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I had my keys ready, I\u0027d make it safely inside before anything could cause me bodily harm. I took a deep breath and geared up to charge forth. But before I took my first step, I was caught in a surprising trap. It wasn\u0027t Trevor blocking my escape in the shadow from the garage, or even the most nefarious vampire of all-Alexander\u0027s enemy,Jagger Maxwell. It was Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... It\u0027s just you. Thank goodness!\" I made my way to hug him, but he kept his arms folded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where were you?\" he asked. He stood stern as my father had many times when I\u0027d broken curfew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just went out for a ride,\" I said truthfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By yourself?At night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still early. My bike has a light on it.\" All true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s that for?\" he asked, pointing to my flashlight. \"Were you searching for something?Or rathersomeone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s always good to have extra light. I\u0027m not like you: I can\u0027t see in the dark.\" I grimaced, hoping he\u0027d grin back. His stony expression remained fixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to your house,\" I confessed. \"Everyone in Dullsville, including Matt, Becky, and Trevor, has spotted your parents. All I had was a vague memory of a portrait you\u0027d painted of them. I wanted to see them for myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt awful. My impatience had gotten the best of me once again. I\u0027m not sure how I\u0027d feel if Alexander was sneaking around my house, trying to ogle my parents as if they were subjects in a Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,sideshow. I was no better than the local gossipmongers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited what seemed like an eternity for Alexander\u0027s response. I was so ashamed of myself I barely made eye contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy boyfriend took my wrist and gently drew me to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I might have to place you under arrest for trespassing. But I always go easy on pretty girls who confess,\" he said ominously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew, didn\u0027t you? I\u0027m that predictable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was just a matter of time before I spotted you hiding in our bushes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re not mad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not through with you yet. Are you prepared to accept your punishment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded reluctantly. I wasn\u0027t sure what a vampire\u0027s punishment might be. But I was ready to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sentence you to a thousand kisses,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I begin now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally smiled. I pressed my lips to his and snuggled against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we broke away, I apologized again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay. It\u0027s time that you meet them. But for tonight, you\u0027ll have to settle for me.\" Alexander winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for the next hour I continued to fulfill my sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother letter arrived mysteriously-only this time it was at my house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have mail,\" my mom said when I got home the following day. \"It\u0027s on the kitchen table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t used to receiving cards when it wasn\u0027t my birthday or a holiday. Even if it was a college brochure, I was excited something was addressed to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep purple envelope lay next to our pastel blue salt and pepper shakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn beautiful black calligraphy it read:Miss Raven Madison. Like Alexander\u0027s mail it was devoid of postmarks or stamps. On the back it had a candle-waxed pressed seal of an S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost tore into it when I remembered how Alexander opened his mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom,\" I called. \"Do we have a letter opener?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think there\u0027s one in your dad\u0027s desk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the French doors to my dad\u0027s office. He had a dark oak desk topped with family pictures. I scanned the desk for any sharp objects but didn\u0027t find anything other than a few pens and a golf tee. I was growing antsy and rifled through his desk drawer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, underneath a file folder, I found a gold letter opener, the end in the shape of a tennis racket. I carefully slit open the envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out the note card and read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. and Mrs. Constantine Sterling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erequest the pleasure of jour company\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor dinner this Friday at sunset\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheSterlingMansion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenson Hill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was official. I was finally going to meet Alexander\u0027s parents, and I had the invitation to prove it! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-10.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
