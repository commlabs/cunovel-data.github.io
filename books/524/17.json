She was mistaken, however, in thinking she had found a place of refuge, the hunt still went on. Reuben knew that his kiss had given him a definite position with regard to her, and Naomi knew that he knew. Twice he came over and visited her at Rye. He never attempted to kiss her again, and carefully avoided all talk of love. Indeed, her father was generally in the room. He was much taken with young Backfield, who was ready to talk shipping and harbour-work with him for hours.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s a solider man than ever poor Harry was,\" said old Gasson to Naomi, \"more dependable, I should think. Reckon he\u0027ll do well for himself at Odiam. She\u0027ll be a lucky girl whom he marries.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Naomi had no mother.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben was pleased with the impression he had made. He was now working definitely. At first he had merely drifted, drawn by the charm of the female creature, so delicate, soft and weak. Then commonsense had taken the rudder—he had seen Naomi\u0027s desirableness from a practical point of view; she was young, good-looking, sound if scarcely robust, well dowered, and of good family—fit in every way to be the mother of his children. Since Harry was debarred from marrying her, his brother could even more profitably take his place. Her money would then go direct to his ambition; he realised the enormous advantage of a little reserve capital and longed for a relaxation of financial strain. The Gassons were an old and respected family, and an alliance with them would give lustre to Odiam. Also he wanted children. He was fond of Naomi for her own sake. Poor little chicken! Her weakness appealed to him, and he rather enjoyed seeing her fluttering before his feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Towards the middle of April she came back to the farm to help Mrs. Backfield with her house-cleaning. She clung to the older woman all day, but she knew that Reuben would at last find her alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did. She was laying the supper while Mrs. Backfield finished mending a curtain upstairs, when he marched suddenly into the room. He had come in from the yard, and his clothes smelt of the cow-stalls and of the manure that he loved. His face was moist; he stood in front of her and mopped his brow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m hungry, Naomi. Wot have you got fur me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s eggs....\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot else?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bread ... cheese....\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She could scarcely frame the homely words. For some unaccountable reason she felt afraid, felt like some poor creature in a trap.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot else?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All! But I\u0027m still hungry. Wot more do you think I want?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She licked her lips.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He leaned over the table towards her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot more have you got fur me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nothing, I—I\u0027m going upstairs. Let me pass, please.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe I want a kiss.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no, no!\" she cried, trying to edge between him and the wall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why not?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He put his hands on her shoulders, she felt the warmth and heaviness of them, and was more frightened than ever because she liked it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe I want more than a kiss.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was leaning against the wall, if he had released her she could not have run away. She was like a rabbit, paralysed with fear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He bent towards her and his lips closed on hers. She nearly fainted, but she did not struggle or try to scream. It seemed years that they stood linked by that unwilling kiss. At last he raised his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will you marry me, Naomi?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No—— Oh, no!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No—no—I can\u0027t—I won\u0027t!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Strength came to her suddenly; it was like awaking from a nightmare. She thrust him from her, slipped past, and ran out of the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next morning she returned to Rye. But she could not stay there. Her heart was all restlessness and dissatisfaction. Soon Mrs. Backfield announced that she was coming back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I reckoned she would,\" said Reuben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She arrived in the swale. A tender grey mist was in the air, smeething Boarzell, mingling with the smoke of Odiam chimneys, that curled out wood-scented into the dark. As Naomi climbed from the carrier\u0027s cart which had brought her, she smelled the daffodils each side of the garden path. The evening was full of pale perfumes, of ghostly yellows, massing faintly amidst the grey.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben stood in the doorway and watched her come up the path, herself dim and ghostly, like the twilight and the flowers. When she was close he held out his arms to her, and she fell on his breast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59389.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM"}
