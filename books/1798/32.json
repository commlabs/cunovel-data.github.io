I pull key number 425 out of my pocket and use it and the deposit keys to open the dual lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening the box, I don’t take a second to look at the contents. I take out the single small yellow envelope and silently close the box again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes me thirty seconds, tops, and I’ve got the keys back inside the drawer, with no one the wiser. Just as the drawer rolls shut, I turn to see Nick standing there with Brian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a second, I see something flash in Nick’s eyes, and I think I’m busted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We good?” I ask, nodding at the bags of money on the dolly behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Piece of cake,” Brian says, pushing the dolly out of the vault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick grips his gun tighter, and my fingers start to tingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Less than two minutes,” I say, reminding him we’re running out of time. Nick nods in acknowledgement and makes his way out of the vault behind Brian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I exit the vault, I lean over and hit the button for the police. Remember when I said criminals always play up to the job, never after? This is where my plan begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian wheels the cash out of the lobby and down the small hallway. Nick and I walk over to Paul, letting him know it’s done, so we can get the fuck out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I walk over, I can feel the shift in Nick. He’s just fucked up both of our plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can blink, he’s over by Tessa and pulling her up by her hair off the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put her down!” I shout through the room, my voice echoing off the marble. I raise my gun pointing it as his head, but he pulls Tessa closer, putting his own gun to her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you say you tell me what was in that box, Sparrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally make myself look at Tessa, her gold eyes terrified. I see the look on her face as she realizes who we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nick, what the fuck are you doing! Let’s go, man!” Paul shouts, clearly wanting to get the fuck out of here like Nick should, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not until pretty boy gives up what he’s really after. Because it wasn’t this piece of ass. Was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s got his gun pressed against her head, and tears are streaming down her face. She’s terrified, and she hasn’t spoken a word. My heart is nearly beating out of my chest, but my gun is straight and my aim unwavering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t make me do it, Nick. Let her go. Now.” I don’t want to have to kill him like this, but I will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nick?” Harper says from the floor, but he doesn’t turn to acknowledge her. He shoves his gun harder against Tessa’s temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You tell me what was in that box, or she’s dead. I don’t give two shits about killing this bitch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage boils inside me, but I take a breath and calm myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Close your eyes, little fox.” She looks at me for a half second before doing as I ask. In that quick look, I see that the trust is still there. She may not know what’s going on, but she trusts me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe you should close yours,” Nick says, pulling his trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a moment of complete silence after the sound rings out, before all the women start screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of a second bullet reverberates around us as I pull my trigger and land a shot right between Nick’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore a heartbeat has passed, I’m there in front of him, catching Tessa and holding her face to get her to look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at me, baby. Tessa! Open your eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opens them, looking at me and blinking rapidly. Her ears are probably ringing from the blank going off, and I’m sure she can’t hear what I’m saying. I replaced everyone’s gun but mine with blanks, knowing some stupid shit might happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick her up and throw her over my shoulder. I turn back to look at Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stick to the plan!” I shout at him, and he bolts out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning behind him with Tessa over my shoulder, I make my way out of the bay door in time to see three of my guys loading up the cash as the other two wait with the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slip off to the right and out the side door of the bay before they spot me. Once I’m outside, I see an unmarked car waiting for me. The guys have their money, so they won’t wait around, and I hear the sirens already on their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the driver side door and help Tessa in and over to the passenger seat. When she’s there and finally looks at me, I take off my mask and reach for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the sting of her hand across my face, and though I know I deserve it, it doesn’t make it any easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching into the console, I pull out the insurance I had Sal drop in here for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just relax, little fox. I’ll explain everything soon enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the shock hit her eyes when she realizes what I’ve just done, and she looks down to see the needle in her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will be easier this way, Tessa. I promise. I love you, baby. Just sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no idea how happy I am to see you,” I say, looking up at Dimitri, who’s standing in the doorway to his private plane. “I didn’t think you’d make the trip. I was sure I’d be having a layover somewhere to meet you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri just shoots me a cocky grin. “It’s my little ‘fuck you’ to the FBI, even if they never even know it. Also, I’m a little anxious to get my hands on the package.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps back from the doorway, revealing a tall thin man behind him. “Get their bags. We need to get out of here.” The thin man, who looks to be in his late forties and is dressed in a relaxed suit, darts down the stairs, going straight for my vehicle. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thief-breeding-3/page-32.html","bookId":1798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:25 PM"}
