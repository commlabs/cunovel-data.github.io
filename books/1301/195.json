{"id":10366,"no":195,"title":"CHAPTER 195","content":"“I’ve done no treasons. I only visit the godswood to pray.”\u0026nbsp; “For Stannis. Or your brother, it’s all the same. Why else seek your father’s gods? You’re praying for our defeat. What would you call that, if not treason?”\u0026nbsp; “I pray for Joffrey,” she insisted nervously.\u0026nbsp; “Why, because he treats you so sweetly?” The queen took a flagon of sweet plum wine from a passing serving girl and filled Sansa’s cup. “Drink,” she commanded coldly. “Perhaps it will give you the courage to deal with truth for a change.”\u0026nbsp; Sansa lifted the cup to her lips and took a sip. The wine was cloyingly sweet, but very strong.\u0026nbsp; “You can do better than that,” Cersei said. “Drain the cup, Sansa. Your queen commands you.” it almost gagged her, but Sansa emptied the cup, gulping down the thick sweet wine until her head was swimming.\u0026nbsp; “More?” Cersei asked.\u0026nbsp; “No. Please.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The queen looked displeased. “When you asked about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied to you. Would you like to hear the truth, Sansa? Would you like to know why he’s really here?”\u0026nbsp; She did not dare answer, but it did not matter. The queen raised a hand and beckoned, never waiting for a reply. Sansa had not even seen Ser Ilyn return to the hall, but suddenly there he was, striding from the shadows behind the dais as silent as a cat. He carried Ice unsheathed. Her father had always cleaned the blade in the godswood after he took a man’s head, Sansa recalled, but Ser Ilyn was not so fastidious. There was blood drying on the rippling steel, the red already fading to brown. “Tell Lady Sansa why I keep you by us,” said Cersei.\u0026nbsp; Ser Ilyn opened his mouth and emitted a choking rattle. His poxscarred face had no expression. “He’s here for us, he says,” the queen said. “Stannis may take the city and he may take the throne, but I will not suffer him to judge me. I do not mean for him to have us alive.”\u0026nbsp; “us?”\u0026nbsp; “You heard me. So perhaps you had best pray again, Sansa, and for a different outcome. The Starks will have no joy from the fall of House Lannister, I promise you.” She reached out and touched Sansa’s hair, brushing it lightly away from her neck. \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1522/45621.html","bookId":1301,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:02:59 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:02:59 AM"}
