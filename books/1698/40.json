The blow connects with his nose, and he shouts, bringing both hands up to cover his face. My body jolts with nervous energy and as his eyes squint, I kick him in the groin. He drops to his knees, his gun clattering to the ground. I grab it and press the barrel to the top of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you awake?” I demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifts his head, and I click the bullet into its chamber, raising an eyebrow at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Dauntless leaders…they evaluated my records and removed me from the simulation,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because they figured out that you already have murderous tendencies and wouldn’t mind killing a few hundred people while conscious,” I say. “Makes sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not…murderous!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never knew a Candor who was such a liar.” I tap the gun against his skull. “Where are the computers that control the simulation, Peter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t shoot me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People tend to overestimate my character,” I say quietly. “They think that because I’m small, or a girl, or a Stiff, I can’t possibly be cruel. But they’re wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift the gun three inches to the left and fire at his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis screams fill the hallway. Blood spurts from the wound, and he screams again, pressing his forehead to the ground. I shift the gun back to his head, ignoring the pang of guilt in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now that you realize your mistake,” I say, “I will give you another chance to tell me what I need to know before I shoot you somewhere worse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing I can count on: Peter is not selfless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns his head and focuses a bright eye on me. His teeth close over his lower lip, and his breaths shake on the way out. And on the way in. And on the way out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re listening,” he spits. “If you don’t kill me, they will. The only way I’ll tell you is if you get me out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take me…ahh…with you,” he says, wincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want me to take you,” I say, “the person who tried to kill me…with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do,” he groans. “If you expect to find out what you need to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels like a choice, but it isn’t. Every minute that I waste staring at Peter, thinking about how he haunts my nightmares and the damage he did to me, another dozen Abnegation members die at the hands of the brain-dead Dauntless army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” I say, almost choking on the word. “Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear footsteps behind me. Holding the gun steady, I look over my shoulder. My father and the others walk toward us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father takes off his long-sleeved shirt. He wears a gray T-shirt beneath it. He crouches next to Peter and loops the fabric around his arm, tying it tightly. As he presses the fabric to the blood running down Peter’s arm, he looks up at me and says, “Was it really necessary to shoot him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes pain is for the greater good,” says Marcus calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my head, I see him standing before Tobias with a belt in hand and hear his voice echo. This is for your own good. I look at him for a few seconds. Does he really believe that? It sounds like something the Dauntless would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go,” I say. “Get up, Peter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want him to walk?” Caleb demands. “Are you insane?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I shoot him in the leg?” I say. “No. He walks. Where do we go, Peter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb helps Peter to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The glass building,” he says, wincing. “Eighth floor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leads the way through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk into the roar of the river and the blue glow of the Pit, which is emptier now than I have ever seen it before. I scan the walls, searching for signs of life, but I see no movement and no figures standing in darkness. I keep my gun in hand and start toward the path that leads to the glass ceiling. The emptiness makes me shiver. It reminds me of the endless field in my crow nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What makes you think you have the right to shoot someone?” my father says as he follows me up the path. We pass the tattoo place. Where is Tori now? And Christina?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now isn’t the time for debates about ethics,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now is the perfect time,” he says, “because you will soon get the opportunity to shoot someone again, and if you don’t realize—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Realize what?” I say without turning around. “That every second I waste means another Abnegation dead and another Dauntless made into a murderer? I’ve realized that. Now it’s your turn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is a right way to do things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What makes you so sure that you know what it is?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please stop fighting,” Caleb interrupts, his voice chiding. “We have more important things to do right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep climbing, my cheeks hot. A few months ago I would not have dared to snap at my father. A few hours ago I might not have done it either. But something changed when they shot my mother. When they took Tobias.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear my father huff and puff over the sound of rushing water. I forgot that he is older than I am, that his frame can no longer tolerate the weight of his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I ascend the metal stairs that will carry me above the glass ceiling, I wait in darkness and watch the light cast on the Pit walls by the sun. I watch until a shadow shifts over the sunlit wall and count until the next shadow appears. The guards make their rounds every minute and a half, stand for twenty seconds, and then move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are men with guns up there. When they see me, they will kill me, if they can,” I tell my father quietly. I search his eyes. “Should I let them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares at me for a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go,” he says, “and God help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb the stairs carefully, stopping just before my head emerges. I wait, watching the shadows move, and when one of them stops, I step up, point my gun, and shoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bullet does not hit the guard. It shatters the window behind him. I fire again and duck as bullets hit the floor around me with a ding. Thank God the glass ceiling is bulletproof, or the glass would break and I would fall to my death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne guard down. I breathe deeply and put just my hand over the ceiling, looking through the glass to see my target. I tilt the gun back and fire at the guard running toward me. The bullet hits him in the arm. Luckily it is his shooting arm, because he drops his gun and it skids across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body shaking, I launch myself through the hole in the ceiling and snatch the fallen gun before he can get to it. A bullet whizzes past my head, so close to hitting me that it moves my hair. Eyes wide, I fling my right arm over my shoulder, forcing a searing pain through my body, and fire three times behind me. By some miracle, one of the bullets hits a guard, and my eyes water uncontrollably from the pain in my shoulder. I just ripped my stitches. I’m sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother guard stands across from me. I lie flat on my stomach and point both guns at him, my arms resting on the floor. I stare into the black pinprick that is his gun barrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something surprising happens. He jerks his chin to the side. Telling me to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must be Divergent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All clear!” I shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard ducks into the fear landscape room, and he’s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly I get to my feet, holding my right arm against my chest. I have tunnel vision. I am running along this path and I will not be able to stop, will not be able to think of anything, until I reach the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hand one gun to Caleb and slide the other one under my belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you and Marcus should stay here with him,” I say, jerking my head toward Peter. “He’ll just slow us down. Make sure no one comes after us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope he doesn’t understand what I’m doing—keeping him here so he stays safe, even though he would gladly give his life for this. If I go up into the building, I probably won’t come back down. The best I can hope for is to destroy the simulation before someone kills me. When did I decide on this suicide mission? Why wasn’t it more difficult?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t stay here while you go up there and risk your life,” says Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you to,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter sinks to his knees. His face glistens with sweat. For a second I almost feel bad for him, but then I remember Edward, and the itch of fabric over my eyes as my attackers blindfolded me, and my sympathy is lost to hatred. Caleb eventually nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI approach one of the fallen guards and take his gun, keeping my eyes away from the injury that killed him. My head pounds. I haven’t eaten; I haven’t slept; I haven’t sobbed or screamed or even paused for a moment. I bite my lip and push myself toward the elevators on the right side of the room. Level eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the elevator doors close, I lean the side of my head against the glass and listen to the beeps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. For protecting Caleb,” my father says. “Beatrice, I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator reaches the eighth floor and the doors open. Two guards stand ready with guns in hand, their faces blank. My eyes widen, and I drop to my belly on the ground as the shots go off. I hear bullets strike glass. The guards slump to the ground, one alive and groaning, the other fading fast. My father stands above them, his gun still held out from his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumble to my feet. Guards run down the hallway on the left. Judging by the synchronicity of their footsteps, they are controlled by the simulation. I could run down the right hallway, but if the guards came from the left hallway, that’s where the computers are. I drop to the ground between the guards my father just shot and lie as still as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father jumps out of the elevator and sprints down the right hallway, drawing the Dauntless guards after him. I clap my hand over my mouth to keep from screaming at him. That hallway will end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to bury my head so I don’t see it, but I can’t. I peer over the fallen guard’s back. My father fires over his shoulder at the guards pursuing him, but he is not fast enough. One of them fires at his stomach, and he groans so loud I can almost feel it in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clutches his gut, his shoulders hitting the wall, and fires again. And again. The guards are under the simulation; they keep moving even when the bullets hit them, keep moving until their hearts stop, but they don’t reach my father. Blood spills over his hand and the color drains from his face. Another shot and the last guard is down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad,” I say. I mean for it to be a shout, but it is just a wheeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slumps to the ground. Our eyes meet like the yards between us are nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth opens like he’s about to say something, but then his chin drops to his chest and his body relaxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes burn and I am too weak to rise; the scent of sweat and blood makes me feel sick. I want to rest my head on the ground and let that be the end of it. I want to sleep now and never wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what I said to my father before was right—for every second that I waste, another Abnegation member dies. There is only one thing left for me in the world now, and it is to destroy the simulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push myself up and run down the hallway, turning right at the end. There is only one door ahead. I open it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opposite wall is made up entirely of screens, each a foot tall and a foot wide. There are dozens of them, each one showing a different part of the city. The fence. The Hub. The streets in the Abnegation sector, now crawling with Dauntless soldiers. The ground level of the building below us, where Caleb, Marcus, and Peter wait for me to return. It is a wall of everything I have ever seen, everything I have ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the screens has a line of code on it instead of an image. It breezes past faster than I can read. It is the simulation, the code already compiled, a complicated list of commands that anticipate and address a thousand different outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of the screen is a chair and a desk. Sitting in the chair is a Dauntless soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tobias,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTOBIAS’S HEAD TURNS, and his dark eyes shift to me. His eyebrows draw in. He stands. He looks confused. He raises his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drop your weapon,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tobias,” I say, “you’re in a simulation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drop your weapon,” he repeats. “Or I’ll fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeanine said he didn’t know me. Jeanine also said that the simulation made Tobias’s friends into enemies. He will shoot me if he has to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set my gun down at my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drop your weapon!” shouts Tobias.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did,” I say. A little voice in my head sings that he can’t hear me, he can’t see me, he doesn’t know me. Tongues of flame press behind my eyes. I can’t just stand here and let him shoot me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run at him, grabbing his wrist. I feel his muscles shift as he pinches the trigger and duck my head just in time. The bullet hits the wall behind me. Gasping, I kick him in the ribs and twist his wrist to the side as hard as I can. He drops the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t beat Tobias in a fight. I know that already. But I have to destroy the computer. I dive for the gun, but before I can touch it, he grabs me and wrenches me to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare into his dark, conflicted eyes for an instant before he punches me in the jaw. My head jerks to the side and I cringe away from him, flinging my hands up to protect my face. I can’t fall; I can’t fall or he’ll kick me, and that will be worse, that will be much worse. I kick the gun back with my heel so he can’t grab it and, ignoring the throbbing in my jaw, kick him in the stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe catches my foot and pulls me down so I fall on my shoulder. The pain makes my vision go black at the edges. I stare up at him. He pulls his foot back like he’s about to kick me, and I roll onto my knees, stretching my arm out for the gun. I don’t know what I’ll do with it. I can’t shoot him, I can’t shoot him, I can’t. He is in there somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs me by my hair and yanks me to the side. I reach back and grab his wrist, but he’s too strong and my forehead smacks into the wall. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/divergent-divergent-1/page-40.html","bookId":1698,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:44 AM"}
