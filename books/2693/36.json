If something needs said. But neither one of us jaws on and on just to fill the silence.” He let his arm dangle by hers. “What enlightening things did you learn about other McKays?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA panicked look crossed her face. “I’ll never keep the names straight. I asked your cousin…Keely? If they’d developed a smart phone app for the family tree. I was kidding but her husband seemed serious about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned closer. “To be honest, I’d buy one. Then I’d have a reference point for each new baby and that baby’s siblings. I think I called Colby’s second boy the wrong name for the better part of a year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAinsley laughed softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God I love to hear you laugh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ben.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ainsley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t look at me like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t help it. I’ve been thinking about the first thing I’m gonna do to you after I peel off that sexy skirt. It makes your ass look amazing, by the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze fell to his mouth and she licked her lips. “What idea is winning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a tie right now between smacking your ass until you come, or fucking it until you come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe you said that. Here in your mother’s house, with all your relatives within earshot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile held no guilt whatsoever. “But I didn’t hear you sayin’ no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAinsley cocked her head, acting coy. “Because I’m trying to decide which option holds more appeal for me, Bennett. Not that you’d give me a say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout breaking eye contact, Ben reached for her hand and squeezed before releasing it. “I’ll give you a say, but there is a condition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We leave right fucking now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hazel eyes heated to a molten gold. Those ripe lips curled into a smirk. “I am feeling tired, now that you mention it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took ten minutes to say goodbye, and Ben knew he’d missed people. If it’d been up to him, they would’ve just left, but Ainsley was too polite for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce they were finally in his truck, he said, “Straight to my place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My car is still at the community center. I need to get it and I’ll follow you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept hold of her hand, absentmindedly running his thumb over her knuckles. He’d thought the simple touch would soothe him, would lessen his overwhelming need to pull his truck over and fuck her blind. But it only made him more impatient. He shifted in his seat, trying to combat the pressure from his jeans on his already hard cock. Trying to combat the pressure inside himself he didn’t quite understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been with her last night. Pushing her limits. Mixing it up. Not holding back on his Dom side, but keeping their slap and tickle more focused on the tickle side, than the slap. Using the flogger on the front side of her body. Holding her on edge, waiting for the multi-point sting that never connected. She hadn’t acted frustrated, especially not when he’d set the flogger aside and fucked her, face-to-face. Taking his time, building up, pulling back, dragging out the pleasure for an hour before letting them both come. Afterward, Ainsley had been so exhausted, she’d crawled in his bed and had fallen asleep. And like some kind of lovesick sap, he’d crawled in bed beside her and watched her sleep, unable to stop from touching her even when she wasn’t aware he was doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no fucking idea what was wrong with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe parked next to her car, noticing it wasn’t the only one left in the lot. He took her hand and helped her from the cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe surprised him with a kiss. “Can I just say that I really love how you always open my door? And walk me to my car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s my pleasure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers toyed with the snaps on his shirt. “I can tell you’re antsy. My place is closer than yours. So since I have some say in tonight’s fun and games, can we play there? You could even keep your truck parked here, if you’re worried about someone seeing it parked in my drive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was worried about his reputation? Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was too horny to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eighteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWally and Charo usually greeted her at the door no matter what time she rolled in, complaining loudly, and sniffing her shoes. Not tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAinsley flipped on the lamps in the living room. She shut the shades. She fought the need to tidy up—straighten the fleece blanket draped over the couch, gather the newspaper and mug on the coffee table. How could she be so nervous in her own house?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ainsley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him, definitely in Dom mode now, nonchalantly leaning against the wall. With that look in his eye. The man knew how to smolder. “Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mere twenty steps across the small space and she stood in front of him. More nervous than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBennett ran his knuckles down her cheek. Then he cupped her chin and traced the outline of her lips with his thumb. “Put your mouth on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAinsley didn’t move. Didn’t think. He’d tell her exactly what he wanted her to do. And that was exactly what she wanted. After being in charge all day, she’d gladly let Bennett take charge of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand fell to his waist and he worked his belt buckle, his midnight-blue eyes remained locked on hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered to the carpet. She unzipped his jeans and yanked the denim until the jeans were around his ankles. He’d gone commando. His cock bounced against his belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threaded both his hands through her hair and brought her face to his groin. “Take all of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing her eyes, she let Bennett guide her where he wanted. The wet tip of his cock brushed her lips. She opened her mouth wider, as the hard flesh slipped over her tongue. When the cockhead bumped into her soft palate, she fought the gag reflex until she took his entire length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her head in place and said, “Swallow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer throat muscles constricted around the head and he groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAinsley exhaled and swallowed twice in rapid succession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Christ that’s good. Enough.” Bennett slowly eased back. “Suck me hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands clamped onto his butt cheeks to bring his body closer. His balls bumped her chin. Then she started to suck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBennett broke that tight suction each time as he pulled back until the rim of his cock scraped against her teeth. He permitted her to moisten her lips before he slid his shaft in, again lodging his cock in her throat. “Ah, fuck. I could watch you all night. You’re hot as fire on your knees with my dick filling your mouth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him. Not feeling passive, but powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So pretty.” His fingers lovingly mapped every plane and angle of her face. “So obedient. Make me come, angel.” He kept his hands on her cheeks as he pumped in and out of her mouth with short, fast jabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAinsley worked the tip, flicking her tongue beneath the head as she sucked in opposition to his thrusts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands tightened, his breath quickened and he made a guttural sound as he came in hot spurts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA haze of satisfaction coursed through her as she swallowed. She kept tonguing and sucking until he squeezed her jaw, forcing her to release him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBennett slumped against the wall with a heavy sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remained on her knees, running her fingertips up his naked flanks as she nuzzled his belly. Enjoying touching him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ainsley,” he said in that sex-roughened voice. He wrapped his hands around her biceps and brought her to her feet. His gaze was firmly fixed on her mouth. “I love seein’ your lips lookin’ so shiny and full after you blow me. It’s goddamn sexy.” He leaned forward and brushed his mouth over hers. Twice. Then he murmured, “Get your vibrator.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated long enough that he quirked the one eyebrow that said, Why you still here questioning me? and she hustled to her bedroom nightstand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Bennett hadn’t specified which vibrator, she chose the most basic silver bullet model. She returned to the living room to find he’d rearranged the furniture, placing a straight-backed kitchen chair across from one of the green parson’s chairs. He’d yanked up his jeans and kicked off his boots. His posture as he rested his backside into her couch might’ve been standoffish—arms folded over his chest—but the heat in his eyes nearly set her clothes on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Underwear off. Pantyhose off.” He grinned ferally. “But go ahead and put them high heels back on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she strapped on the heels, he held his hand out for the vibrator and pointed to the kitchen chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what I’ve been thinkin’ about since I saw you up on that stage, looking so damn professional in that sexy-assed skirt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAinsley shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much I wanna see your hand up that skirt getting yourself off.” He studied her. “Have you ever done that? Been so horny that you had to take care of yourself in your office?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t lie to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I haven’t done it. I swear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” Bennett parked himself on the parson’s chair less than five feet from where she sat. “Think about it. You’re dressed so prim and proper, but your thoughts are so naughty. You’re so desperate to come you’ve locked your office door. No one can see you. No one knows what you’re doin’. Show me what you’d do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer pulse skyrocketed. Bennett liked to play games. Her hands trembled as she inched her fingers down the silky fabric covering her legs. When she reached the hem, she tugged the skirt upward, not in a strip tease but trying to keep her thunder thighs from joggling. Once the material circled her hips, she glanced over at Bennett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Touch yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe palmed her mound, separating her pussy lips with her middle finger. She swirled the tip around the opening, slid it back up and performed the same swirling motion around her clit. Then side to side. Following the slit back down, she pushed her finger inside her pussy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cowboy-casanova-rough-riders-12/page-36.html","bookId":2693,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:00 AM"}
