It is important to understand that, unlike most political and religious-based groups, the Circle of Cavan has no cause - no calling or purpose beyond profit and power. They are large enough to be dangerous and small enough to slip through cracks. They are mobile, careful, and very highly trained. And the scary thing is - for the most part - we\u0027re the ones who trained them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\" Tina asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means I wasn\u0027t lying when I said they are almost always double agents,\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Circle excels at isolating and recruiting agents who are young, vulnerable, or both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how do you know?\" Tina asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sly smile slid over his face as he stood and studied us all in turn. \"Because I\u0027m the man who tracks them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we hadn\u0027t hated him a lot, we might have liked him a little at that moment.

And they could be anyone. They could be\" - he turned to look at my mother - \"anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nineteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber of hours I wandered around the mansion, going nowhere: 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber of secret passageways I looked for in the hopes of going somewhere: 27\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber of secret passageways I found that were actually still working: 1 (But it only went to the kitchen.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber of cookies I swiped while in the kitchen: 1 (Oh, okay, 3 - but they were really little cookies.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber of times I wanted to cry: 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber of times I changed my mind: 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I just kept walking - through the library with its rows of books and dying fire, past the elevator that could no longer take me to Sublevel Two. The halls were quiet and dark, as if the mansion itself were sleeping - resting up for a new day. And then I stopped at the Hall of History and stared at the sword of Cava, realizing that for the first time since November, I was actually alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell . . . almost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello Ms. Morgan.\" A deep voice cut through the darkness behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure it was two in the morning on a school night, but somehow I wasn\u0027t surprised when I turned and saw Mr. Smith. Well . . . actually . . . the fact that he was walking around in slippers and one of those old-fashioned nightshirt did surprise me; the fact that he was awake did not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . .\" I started. Somehow, even though I technically wasn\u0027t doing anything wrong, I felt like I\u0027d been caught. \"I couldn\u0027t sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay, Ms. Morgan.\" He came to stand beside me in the warm glow of the sword\u0027s glass case. Protective beams rippled through the room like waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my teacher. Maybe it was the hour, or the fact that one of us was wearing a dress (and it wasn\u0027t me), but I dared to ask, \"So what\u0027s your excuse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A seasoned operative should always check his or her perimeter at unexpected times and in unexpected ways.\" I glanced at Mr. Smith\u0027s nightgown - I mean shirt . . . nightshirt. If unexpected was what it took to stay safe, then Mr. Smith was going to be alive forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will do well to remember that, Cammie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" I stared at the sword. \"Thank you. It\u0027s actually kind of nice . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I trailed off. I didn\u0027t dare say what I was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It okay.\" There was a knowing wink in Mr. Smith\u0027s eye. \"You can say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance down at the floor. \"It\u0027s nice getting some actual Covert Operatives Advice. I\u0027ve missed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Townsend is a fine operative, Cammie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course, I didn\u0027t mean to imply -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ambitious. Proud. Calculating . . . but he is perhaps not a natural for the classroom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I agreed. \"He\u0027ll never be as good as . . .\" nut I stopped short, suddenly unable to say the name aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he isn\u0027t what you\u0027re used to,\" Mr. Smith agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believed him.\" I don\u0027t know where the words came from, but there, in the light of that sword, I simply had to set them free. \"Joe Solomon is a liar. And a traitor. And I believed him. Even after London . . . He was talking crazy and I still -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he crazy, Cammie? Was he really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the most careful spy I\u0027d ever known - stared up into the fifth face I\u0027d seen him wear, and tried to focus on the eyes that hadn\u0027t changed since my first day of seventh grade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joe Solomon is many things, Cammie. But crazy? Crazy is the one I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Smith took a step toward the Grand Staircase, the hem of his nightshirt swaying as he moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do try to get some sleep, Cammie. And good night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking back upstairs that night, I thought of Mr. Smith\u0027s words and the way Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolomon had gripped my hand at the Tower of London and pulled me through the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I started up the old circular staircase that leads to the junior suites, cool air landed on my arms, and I looked out through the old wavy glass. It reminded me of the cold wind in London, the rippling waves of the Thames as if flowed below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember how lost Mr. Solomon had seemed as he hugged me on the bridge - how very strange and foreign the gesture had felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere do men like Joe Solomon go when they fall? I asked myself. I wondered if there would be any help for him, waiting on the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another step, but as I moved up the spiral stairs, something outsides caught my eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething made me stop and stare out across the grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLights from the mansion\u0027s windows streaked through the darkness, pebbling the dark, cloudy sky. And that was when I saw them - the birds that were sweeping out into the open air and then back again, stretching their wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, I stood still, listening to the howling wind and the faint cooing of the birds, and my teacher\u0027s words that had been playing over and over in my mind for weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow the pigeons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s there!\" My voice was cracking, and the words came in short gasps as if I were out of shape. Out of time. \"Mr. Smith was right. He isn\u0027t crazy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard my roommates\u0027 footsteps on the stairs behind me, as Bex asked, \"Cam what are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pigeons!\" I\u0027m sure I must have looked like an insane person. And technically, I have been hit on the head a lot, so my roommates had good reason to look at each other as if all that brain trauma was bound to catch up with me eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam,\" Liz said slowly, her eyes still puffy from sleep. \"Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was alive in me then. Maybe fear. Maybe dread. But mostly, I think it was hope as I climbed the stairs, higher and higher. When we reached the landing, I felt the cold air that seeped through the seams in the stone, and in that second my heart stopped. I stood, frozen by the cold stone beneath my fingers and a hope that I didn\u0027t dare sat, as I traced rough carving of the bird in flight, and pushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five largest stones receded, revealing a small compartment and a rusty lever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cammie!\" Liz exclaimed. \"No. You\u0027re not supposed to leave the mansion! What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was too late, because the door was already swinging open, a rush of freezing wind was blowing against my face and across my bare legs, but I didn\u0027t feel the chill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just turned to look at my best friends, who stood in the light of the doorway, and said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m following the pigeons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d been here before, of course. Just a few months ago we\u0027d sat on the dusty, overturned crates that were the last relics of the Gallagher Academy\u0027s once-proud covert carrier pigeon breeding program. We\u0027d sat there for hours, looking out onto the lights of Roseville, talking about the people who were after Macey. After me. But now, the space looked totally different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What . . .\" Liz started, looking around. \"What is all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChalkboards lined the inner wall of the rampart, far away from the glassless windows that over looked the grounds. The crates were stacked neatly to one side. A lone chair sat in the center of floor, facing the blackboards, as if someone had spent hours in that place, trying to solve an impossible equation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This must be what Mr. Solomon wanted us to find.\" I stepped closer to the blackboards that had Mr. Solomon\u0027s words scrawled over every inch. \"He risked everything - just to tell me to find this,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cammie . . .\" Bex started. \"You know as well as I do he was talking crazy. He wasn\u0027t Joe Solomon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027re here,\" I snapped back. \"It\u0027s not crazy if we\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it say?\" Liz\u0027s voice was soft, her eyes focused as she stepped slowly closer to the board, and I knew she wasn\u0027t talking to us; her mind was lost in code, tying to see through the chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Liz?\" Macey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz shook her head. \"I . . . I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve seen anything quite like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s crazy, is what it is.\" Bex banged her fist against the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about it, Bex. Think. He\u0027s one of the most wanted men on the planet, and I\u0027m the world\u0027s best guarded girl. Why come to me in London? If he\u0027s working for the Circle, why take that risk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Cam. Why did he kill your dad? Why did he join the Circle in the first place? Maybe he snapped or broke or . . .\" I thought that she might cry. \"Maybe this is what he is now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he crazy during finals week? Was he crazy in D.C.?\" I felt Mr. Smith\u0027s words washing over me. \"If he\u0027s not crazy, Bex, then he came to London for a reason.\" I threw out my arms and stepped closer to the boards. \"He came to London for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of us were standing in the very place Joe Solomon had stood, staring at the words and numbers and diagrams that he\u0027d written. There were answers here. Clues. He\u0027d risked his freedom - his life - to bring me to this rooftop. I had followed the pigeons, and that night I stood without a coat in the freezing cold, trying to decipher what they had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind me, a pigeon cawed. The sound was eerie and loud as I squinted through the dark toward the ledge. It cawed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid birds,\" Liz said, shooting her hands toward the lone pigeon that sat perched on the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people don\u0027t know that anything could be a cutout, a go-between, a messenger for spies. This part of the mansion existed because pigeons had once been some of the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey never talked when interrogated; even the best spy satellites in the world couldn\u0027t track them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" Liz said again. \"Get -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I said, reaching for my best friend\u0027s hands, staring at the small bird that sat stoically, waiting in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam.\" Bex\u0027s voice was soft. \"Cam, what is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inched toward the bird and reached for the tiny slip of paper wrapped delicately around its leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027re reading this, you\u0027ve found it. And if you\u0027ve found it, you know. Must see you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeet me at the place where we did the brush passes. Send me back the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd please be careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words were neatly typed. There was no signature - no name of any kind. And even though I know it had been reckless to send it, reckless for me to read - totally and completely foolish to even think about doing as it said - the truth of the matter is that a spy\u0027s life isn\u0027t about never taking chances. It\u0027s about taking chances that are worth the risk. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/only-the-good-spy-young-gallagher-girls-4/page-12.html","bookId":2749,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:51:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:51:06 PM"}
