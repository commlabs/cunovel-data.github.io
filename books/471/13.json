{"id":19129,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER VII","content":"\u0026nbsp;Four days after these curious incidents a funeral started from Canterville Chase at about eleven o’clock at night. \u0026nbsp;The hearse was drawn by eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of nodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich purple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville coat-of-arms. \u0026nbsp;By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the servants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully impressive. \u0026nbsp;Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up specially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first carriage along with little Virginia. \u0026nbsp;Then came the United States Minister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the last carriage was Mrs. Umney. \u0026nbsp;It was generally felt that, as she had been frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she had a right to see the last of him. \u0026nbsp;A deep grave had been dug in the corner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree, and the service was read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier. \u0026nbsp;When the ceremony was over, the servants, according to an old custom observed in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as the coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward and laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. \u0026nbsp;As she did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its silent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a nightingale began to sing. \u0026nbsp;She thought of the ghost’s description of the Garden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a word during the drive home. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had an interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given to Virginia. \u0026nbsp;They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby necklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen of sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis felt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘My lord,’ he said, ‘I know that in this country mortmain is held to apply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that these jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. \u0026nbsp;I must beg you, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them simply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you under certain strange conditions. \u0026nbsp;As for my daughter, she is merely a child, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such appurtenances of idle luxury. \u0026nbsp;I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I may say, is no mean authority upon Art—having had the privilege of spending several winters in Boston when she was a girl—that these gems are of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall price. \u0026nbsp;Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you will recognise how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain in the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such vain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the British aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who have been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles of republican simplicity. \u0026nbsp;Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very anxious that you should allow her to retain the box as a memento of your unfortunate but misguided ancestor. \u0026nbsp;As it is extremely old, and consequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to comply with her request. \u0026nbsp;For my own part, I confess I am a good deal surprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with medi?valism in any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was born in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned from a trip to Athens.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister’s speech, pulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile, and when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and said, ‘My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky ancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are much indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. \u0026nbsp;The jewels are clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough to take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave in a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. \u0026nbsp;As for their being heirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or legal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite unknown. \u0026nbsp;I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and when Miss Virginia grows up I daresay she will be pleased to have pretty things to wear. \u0026nbsp;Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the furniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity Sir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he was really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville’s refusal, and begged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was quite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to retain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of 1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen’s first drawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the universal theme of admiration. \u0026nbsp;For Virginia received the coronet, which is the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her boy-lover as soon as he came of age. \u0026nbsp;They were both so charming, and they loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the match, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch the Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less than three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to say, Mr. Otis himself. \u0026nbsp;Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke personally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his own words, ‘was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating influences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of republican simplicity should be forgotten.’ \u0026nbsp;His objections, however, were completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the aisle of St. George’s, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his arm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of England.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to Canterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over in the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pine-woods. \u0026nbsp;There had been a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir Simon’s tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it simply the initials of the old gentleman’s name, and the verse from the library window. \u0026nbsp;The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses, which she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for some time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. \u0026nbsp;There the Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her feet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. \u0026nbsp;Suddenly he threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her, ‘Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Dear Cecil! \u0026nbsp;I have no secrets from you.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n

watching the splendour and shabbiness of Parisian life, and wondering over my vermouth at the strange panorama of pride and poverty that was passing before me, when I heard some one call my name. \u0026nbsp;I turned round, and saw Lord Murchison. \u0026nbsp;We had not met since we had been at college together, nearly ten years before, so I was delighted to come across him again, and we shook hands warmly. \u0026nbsp;At Oxford we had been great friends. \u0026nbsp;I had liked him immensely, he was so handsome, so high-spirited, and so honourable. \u0026nbsp;We used to say of him that he would be the best of fellows, if he did not always speak the truth, but I think we really admired him all the more for his frankness. \u0026nbsp;I found him a good deal changed. \u0026nbsp;He looked anxious and puzzled, and seemed to be in doubt about something. \u0026nbsp;I felt it could not be modern scepticism, for Murchison was the stoutest of Tories, and believed in the Pentateuch as firmly as he believed in the House of Peers; so I concluded that it was a woman, and asked him if he was married yet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n

\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I believe you have a mystery in your life, Gerald,’ I exclaimed; ‘tell me about it.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Let us go for a drive,’ he answered, ‘it is too crowded here. \u0026nbsp;No, not a yellow carriage, any other colour—there, that dark green one will do’; and in a few moments we were trotting down the boulevard in the direction of the Madeleine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Where shall we

it. \u0026nbsp;Inside there was the photograph of a woman. \u0026nbsp;She was tall and slight, and strangely picturesque with her large vague eyes and loosened hair. \u0026nbsp;She looked like a clairvoyante, and was wrapped in rich furs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘What do you think of that face?’ he said; ‘is it

whether that secret was good or evil I could not say. \u0026nbsp;Its beauty was a beauty moulded out of many mysteries—the beauty, in fact, which is psychological, not plastic—and the faint smile that just played across the lips was far too subtle to be really sweet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Well,’ he cried impatiently, ‘what do you

\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the waiter brought us our coffee and cigarettes I reminded Gerald of his promise. \u0026nbsp;He rose from his seat, walked two or three times up and down the room, and, sinking into an armchair, told me the following story:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘One evening,’ he said, ‘I was walking down Bond Street about five o’clock. \u0026nbsp;There was a terrific crush of carriages, and the traffic was almost stopped. \u0026nbsp;Close to the pavement was standing a little yellow brougham, which, for some reason or other, attracted my attention. \u0026nbsp;As I passed by there looked out from it the face I showed you this afternoon. \u0026nbsp;It fascinated me immediately. \u0026nbsp;All that night I kept thinking of it, and all the next day. \u0026nbsp;I wandered up and down that wretched Row, peering into every carriage, and waiting for the yellow brougham; but I could not find ma belle inconnue, and at last I began to think she was merely a dream. \u0026nbsp;About a week afterwards I was dining with Madame de Rastail. \u0026nbsp;Dinner was for eight o’clock; but at half-past eight we were still waiting in the drawing-room. \u0026nbsp;Finally the servant threw open the door, and announced Lady Alroy. \u0026nbsp;It was the woman I had been looking for. \u0026nbsp;She came in very slowly, looking like a moonbeam in grey lace, and, to my intense delight, I was asked to take her in to dinner. \u0026nbsp;After we had sat down, I remarked quite innocently, “I think I caught sight of you in Bond Street some time ago, Lady Alroy.” \u0026nbsp;She grew very pale, and said to me in a low voice, “Pray do not talk so loud; you may be overheard.” \u0026nbsp;I felt miserable at having made such a bad beginning, and plunged recklessly into the subject of the French plays. \u0026nbsp;She spoke very little, always in the same low musical voice, and seemed as if she was afraid of some one listening. \u0026nbsp;I fell passionately, stupidly in love, and the indefinable atmosphere of mystery that surrounded her excited my most ardent curiosity. \u0026nbsp;When she was going away, which she did very soon after dinner, I asked her if I might call and see her. \u0026nbsp;She hesitated for a moment, glanced round to see if any one was near us, and then said, “Yes; to-morrow at a quarter to five.” \u0026nbsp;I begged Madame de Rastail to tell me about her; but all that I could learn was that she was a widow with a beautiful house in Park Lane, and as some scientific bore began a dissertation on widows, as exemplifying the survival of the matrimonially fittest, I left and went home.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n

the club quite unhappy and very much puzzled, and after long consideration wrote her a letter, asking if I might be allowed to try my chance some other afternoon. \u0026nbsp;I had no answer for several days, but at last I got a little note saying she would be at home on Sunday at four and with this extraordinary postscript: “Please do not write to me here again; I will explain when I see you.” \u0026nbsp;On Sunday she received me, and was perfectly charming; but when I was going away she begged of me, if I ever had occasion to write to her again, to address my letter to “Mrs. Knox, care of Whittaker’s Library, Green Street.” \u0026nbsp;“There are reasons,” she said, “why I cannot receive letters in my own house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n

crystals that one sees in museums, which are at one moment clear, and at another clouded. \u0026nbsp;At last I determined to ask her to be my wife: I was sick and tired of the incessant secrecy that she imposed on all my visits, and on the few letters I sent her. \u0026nbsp;I wrote to her at the library to ask her if she could see me the following Monday at six. \u0026nbsp;She answered yes, and I was in the seventh heaven of delight. \u0026nbsp;I was infatuated with her: in spite of the mystery, I thought then—in consequence of it, I see now. \u0026nbsp;No; it was the woman herself I loved.

uncle, you know, lives in Regent’s Park. \u0026nbsp;I wanted to get to Piccadilly, and took a short cut through a lot of shabby little streets. \u0026nbsp;Suddenly I saw in front of me Lady Alroy, deeply veiled and walking very fast. \u0026nbsp;On coming to the last house in the street, she went up the steps, took out a latch-key, and let herself in. \u0026nbsp;“Here is the mystery,” I said to myself; and I hurried on and examined the house. \u0026nbsp;It seemed a sort of place for letting lodgings. \u0026nbsp;On the doorstep lay her handkerchief, which she had dropped. \u0026nbsp;I picked it up and put it in my pocket. \u0026nbsp;Then I began to consider what I should do. \u0026nbsp;I came to the conclusion that I had no right to spy on her, and I drove down to the club. \u0026nbsp;At six I called to see her. \u0026nbsp;She was lying on a sofa, in a tea-gown of silver tissue looped up by some strange moonstones that she always wore. \u0026nbsp;She was looking quite lovely. \u0026nbsp;“I am so glad to see you,” she said; “I have not been out all day.” \u0026nbsp;I stared at her in amazement, and pulling the handkerchief out of my pocket, handed it to her. \u0026nbsp;“You dropped this in Cumnor Street this afternoon, Lady Alroy,” \u0026nbsp;I said very calmly. \u0026nbsp;She looked at me in terror but made no attempt to take the handkerchief. \u0026nbsp;“What were you doing there?” I asked. \u0026nbsp;“What right have you to question me?” she answered. \u0026nbsp;“The right of a man who loves you,” I replied; “I came here to ask you to be my wife.” \u0026nbsp;She hid her face in her hands, and burst into floods of tears. \u0026nbsp;“You must tell me,” I continued. \u0026nbsp;She stood up, and, looking me straight in the face, said, “Lord Murchison, there is nothing to tell you.”—“You went to meet some one,” I cried; “this is your mystery.” \u0026nbsp;She grew dreadfully white, and said, “I went to meet no one.”—“Can’t you tell the truth?” I exclaimed. \u0026nbsp;“I have told it,” she replied. \u0026nbsp;I was mad, frantic; I don’t know what I said, but I said terrible things to her. \u0026nbsp;Finally I rushed out of the house. \u0026nbsp;She wrote me a letter the next day; I sent it back unopened, and started for Norway with Alan Colville. \u0026nbsp;After a month I came back, and the first thing I saw in the Morning Post was the death of Lady Alroy. \u0026nbsp;She had caught a chill at the Opera, and had died in five days of congestion of the lungs. \u0026nbsp;I shut myself up and saw no one. \u0026nbsp;I had loved her so much, I had loved

\u0026nbsp;I asked her if she had any rooms to let. \u0026nbsp;“Well, sir,” she replied, “the drawing-rooms are supposed to be let; but I have not seen the lady for three months, and as rent is owing on them, you can have them.”—“Is this the lady?” I said, showing the photograph. \u0026nbsp;“That’s her, sure enough,” she exclaimed; “and when is she coming back, sir?”—“The lady is dead,” I replied. \u0026nbsp;“Oh sir, I hope not!” said the woman; “she was my best lodger. \u0026nbsp;She paid me three guineas a week merely to sit in my drawing-rooms now and then.” \u0026nbsp;“She met some one here?” I said; but the woman assured me that it was not so, that she always came alone, and saw no one. \u0026nbsp;“What on earth did she do here?” I cried. \u0026nbsp;“She simply sat in the drawing-room, sir, reading books, and sometimes had tea,” the woman answered. \u0026nbsp;I did not know what to say, so I gave her a sovereign and went away. \u0026nbsp;Now, what do you think it all

being a charming fellow. \u0026nbsp;Romance is the privilege of the rich, not the profession of the unemployed. \u0026nbsp;The poor should be practical and prosaic. \u0026nbsp;It is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating. \u0026nbsp;These are the great truths of modern life which Hughie Erskine never realised. \u0026nbsp;Poor Hughie! \u0026nbsp;Intellectually, we must admit, he was not of much importance. \u0026nbsp;He never said a brilliant or even an ill-natured thing in his life. \u0026nbsp;But then he was wonderfully good-looking, with his crisp brown hair, his clear-cut profile, and his grey eyes. \u0026nbsp;He was as popular with men as he was with women and he had every accomplishment except that of making money. \u0026nbsp;His father had bequeathed him his cavalry sword and a History of the Peninsular War in fifteen volumes. \u0026nbsp;Hughie hung the first over his looking-glass, put the second on a shelf between Ruff’s Guide and Bailey’s Magazine, and lived on two hundred a year that an old aunt allowed him. \u0026nbsp;He had tried everything. \u0026nbsp;He had gone on the Stock Exchange for six months; but what was a butterfly to do among bulls and bears? \u0026nbsp;He had been a tea-merchant for a little longer, but had soon tired of pekoe and souchong. \u0026nbsp;Then he had tried selling dry sherry. \u0026nbsp;That did not answer; the sherry was a little too dry. \u0026nbsp;Ultimately he became nothing, a delightful, ineffectual young man with a perfect profile and no profession.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To make matters worse, he was in love. \u0026nbsp;The girl he loved was Laura Merton, the daughter of a retired Colonel who had lost his temper and his digestion in India, and had never found either of them again. \u0026nbsp;Laura adored him, and he was ready to kiss her shoe-strings. \u0026nbsp;They were the handsomest couple in London, and had not a penny-piece between them. \u0026nbsp;The Colonel was very fond of Hughie, but would not hear of any engagement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Come to me, my boy, when you have got ten thousand pounds of your own, and we will see about it,’ he used to say; and Hughie looked very glum in those days, and had to go to Laura for consolation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One morning, as he was on his way to Holland Park, where the Mertons lived, he dropped in to see a great friend of his, Alan Trevor. \u0026nbsp;Trevor was a painter. \u0026nbsp;Indeed, few people escape that nowadays. \u0026nbsp;But he was also an artist, and artists are rather rare. \u0026nbsp;Personally he was a strange rough fellow, with a freckled face and a red ragged beard. \u0026nbsp;However, when he took up the brush he was a real master, and his pictures were eagerly sought after. \u0026nbsp;He had been very much attracted by Hughie at first, it must be acknowledged, entirely on account of his personal charm. \u0026nbsp;‘The only people a painter should know,’ he used to say, ‘are people who are bête and beautiful, people who are an artistic pleasure to look at and an intellectual repose to talk to. \u0026nbsp;Men who are dandies and women who are darlings rule the world, at least they should do so.’ \u0026nbsp;However, after he got to know Hughie better, he liked him quite as much for his bright, buoyant spirits and his generous, reckless nature, and had given him the permanent entrée to his studio.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a wonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man. \u0026nbsp;The beggar himself was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio. \u0026nbsp;He was a wizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous expression. \u0026nbsp;Over his shoulders was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears and tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand he leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered hat for alms.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘What an amazing model!’

‘I should think so! \u0026nbsp;Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day. \u0026nbsp;A trouvaille, mon cher; a living Velasquez! \u0026nbsp;My stars! what an etching Rembrandt would have

look at the trouble of laying on the paint alone, and standing all day long at one’s easel! \u0026nbsp;It’s all very well, Hughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art almost attains to the dignity of manual labour. \u0026nbsp;But you mustn’t chatter; I’m very busy. \u0026nbsp;Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the framemaker wanted to speak to him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Don’t run away, Hughie,’ he said, as he went out, ‘I will be back in a moment.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The old beggar-man took advantage of Trevor’s absence to rest for a moment on a wooden bench that was behind him. \u0026nbsp;He looked so forlorn and wretched that Hughie could not help pitying him, and felt in his pockets to see what money he had. \u0026nbsp;All he could find was a sovereign and some coppers. \u0026nbsp;‘Poor old fellow,’ he thought to himself, ‘he wants it more than I do, but it means no hansoms for a fortnight’; and he walked across the studio and slipped the sovereign into the beggar’s hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The old man started, and a faint smile flitted across his withered lips. \u0026nbsp;‘Thank you, sir,’ he said, ‘thank you.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Trevor arrived, and Hughie took his leave, blushing a little at what he had done. \u0026nbsp;He spent the day with Laura, got a charming scolding for his extravagance, and had to walk home.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That night he strolled into the Palette Club

be so miserable. \u0026nbsp;I have got heaps of old clothes at home—do you think he would care for any of them? \u0026nbsp;Why, his rags were falling to bits.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n
