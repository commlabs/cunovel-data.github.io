They have hourly check-ins with someone, and it’s been five hours since a check-in has happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath was stolen. I shook my head, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, “I know. Your mom, more than likely, got the kids away, but…I still want to know. We need to figure out what’s happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was my worst-case scenario. There was nothing I could do, from where I stood. “I need to find them. Come get me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and the call ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and looked at the gate; there was no way I was climbing over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my back and waited for Servario to hurry up and come drag me back. The defeat and fear were all consuming. How could I find my family, if he was holding me captive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario chuckled, “You’re taking my clothes again. I think you’ve forgotten the deal we have about you taking the things I bought you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down, grinning, hiding the terror I was feeling. I shook my head, “You didn’t buy this for me. I stole it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Same thing. It’s mine. You’re mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fought the tears in my throat, “Fine, have them back but I’m not yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled down the shorts, luckily the shirt was long enough to cover my bare ass. I noticed a guard in the guardhouse across the huge driveway. He looked confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario shouted at him, “Take a break and turn off the cameras!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard closed the blinds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip and lifted the shirt up. It was pulled down hard and fast, dragged against my skin. His huge hands pinned it to my sides, “Stop that,” he scolded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “You are distracting me on purpose. I see it now. Your role in this, from the beginning was to distract me. Tell me the truth. My kids are missing. You tell me the God damned truth.” I was shaking from the bad things rolling through my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the massive wrought-iron gate that dwarfed even him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words came slowly, “You were so wrapped up in them at first, it was so easy. You missed so many things, running here and there and everywhere with the kids. Then you got bored. I was scared you would see the truth then. I was about to intervene, when you found hot yoga.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to face him, shoving him, “ARE YOU HIGH? WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH MY KIDS?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed the top of my head, looking grim, “The secret must be kept at all costs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hit me like a ton bricks in the head, “You’re the Master Key…” The words left my dry mouth. I felt him nod against the top of my head, “Who better, than a man suspected of a thousand bad things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fourteen – Why mommy, what BIG shoes you have!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hadn’t spoken in hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn’t answer a single question or tell me where we were going, so it didn’t matter. I didn’t want to talk, unless it was Q\u0026amp;A time, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy foot tapping was getting on his nerves, I could tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at the outfit I was wearing and shook my head, “Why don’t you have normal clothes for women on the jet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a sideways look, “You’re the only normal girl, ever to come on here. You could have stayed in the other outfit. Lord knows, all you care about is comfort.” His tone was mocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, “Yes, maybe you could have found me a piece of cord to hold the shorts up. Look, I don’t dress like I’m homeless, all the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe coughed, “You aren’t exactly a sex kitten either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared, “The other outfit would have suited the house slippers of yours I stole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me another look, “You make sure those get back to the house. They were a gift from my mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sneered, “You have a problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked hurt, “What? My mother bought them for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tapped my heel and tried not to look down at the sexy heel, or think about the fact they were spiciest shoes, I’d ever donned. I wished the tight pants were half as comfortable, but they cut into my slight mommy tummy fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve looked back at me, “For the love of God and all things holy, stop tapping your damned foot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario snorted, “We land in eight minutes, children. Shut it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve scowled and turned back around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to tap louder. My nerves were on fire. I needed to hold my babies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI distracted myself with a question, I assumed he would actually answer, “Why are we always flying? Is this really how you live?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, “We need to keep moving. I can’t afford a mistake right now.” And that was it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes at him, “Fine, be aloof.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe landed and I forced Steve and Servario to run to the car. Well, as fast as my heels would go. The salty smell of the Boston harbor made me relax a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched out the window as we drove to wherever we were going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you called young Cooper and explained we would meet them tomorrow?” he asked distractedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “I gave them my word, that you meant them no harm and were not working with the military or government; I told them you just wanted the Burrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, “Have I ever worked with them? I like nothing better, than to watch them squirm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stress levels were too high. I didn’t want to listen to him speak, but I needed answers, “Where are my children?” I pestered again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “I’m not in the position to tell you that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growled, “No one is ever in the position to tell me anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked an eyebrow, “Do you know much about your mother, Evie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed and looked back out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, “You do know. I was wondering, when they would let it spill. Now that you know, I can tell you, your children are safe. I can also tell you, no one would care for them the way your mother will.” His eyes sparkled, “She has kept you alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know my mother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, “I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sick. An arms dealer, who was secretly the Master Key for the covert op my father had dedicated his life to, knew my family better than I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is my sister safe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, “Never. She is a walking disaster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat didn’t he know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car stopped in a neighborhood I didn’t recognize. The houses were smaller and older. “This doesn’t really look like your type of neighborhood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a blank stare, “They’re inside, smartass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, “How do you do it? How do you know everything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, “I know people, who know things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like what?” I crossed my arms and got comfy in the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “Go inside and tell them to hurry up. We have ten minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed the darkness of his eyes; they were missing the green altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unbuckled my seat belt and crawled across the seat to him, climbing onto his lap and straddling him. I lowered my face and licked along his neck to his ear. I bit down on his lobe. He was a sex addict, there was no doubt taunting him would get me information. I ground my pelvis into his and sucked his lobe, “What do you know?” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands roamed my back, settling on my hips where he gripped me hard. I made my way, kissing and sucking, to his cheek and placed feather-light kisses on either side of his face. \"If you tell me what you know, things between us could be different,\" I muttered and brushed my lips against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was frozen, either terrified or about to attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed him once more, “You want me to play along next time, Servario? You want me to suck things? Bite things?” I leaned to the other side and whispered into his other ear, “Stroke things?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted us both, nestling his erection between my legs better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back, grinning ear from ear, “Maybe you want me to put on a show for you? Let you pick the outfit, the shoes, and the toys?” I bit my lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed; the darkness had overtaken his eyes in a dangerous way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see,\" I muttered and opened his door, climbing off of him and walking up to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced at the thought of him forcing any of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf ever there was a bluff, that was it. I didn’t have a show or any sexual talents. I could cum and hold my legs up. James wasn’t seeking it elsewhere, because I was too much in the sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just prayed Servario didn’t know that yet. The terrible blowjob I’d given him in the shower, might have ruined my chances at seducing him. But I was willing to try. I needed him hard, weak, and under my spell. I just needed to learn how to cast one first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce opened the door to the dingy house, looking confused and cautious. “How the hell are you here?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “He must have known you took the phone and bugged it. He’s onto your every move. He’s a savage stalker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear Servario walking up behind me on the gravel driveway, “Except fleeing the hotel. I wasn’t aware you would actually do any of that, not naked anyway,\" he said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at him and noticed he was walking funny. Luce looked down at his groin and nodded, “Welcome to casa del dumpo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe entered and instantly, I was hit with the smell of fried food. Servario looked like he might throw up. I felt like I might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop came around the corner with a gun out, “What the fuck? You said we were meeting tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario sighed, “Yes well, that was for the benefit of the government agents tracking you with those cell phones you buy illegally. Please feel free to leave those here. We need to hurry. We have four minutes before they’re here. I wanted them to think that we were picking you up tomorrow. They aren’t as smart as they think they are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back, “It was ten minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “That was before your display in the car. Let’s move.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-32.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
