We walked in silence, Lou all sullen. I dropped him at his motorcycle and sent him back to Orlando with some instructions. I needed him to keep an eye on some people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How will I get hold of you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him Ma\u0027s number and waved bye. The Harley thundered away like the end of the world. I found a phone at an Exxon station. Time to put Benny\u0027s information to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dialed Jimmy\u0027s number. He answered in one ring but sounded sleepy. I apologized for ruining his nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hookman, what\u0027s the latest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost nobody called me Hook or Hookman anymore. \"I got a lead, Jimmy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk about it on the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody ever does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Charlie-boy. Make the drive. I\u0027ll be waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drive from Gainesville to Wedgewood, the golf course community on the edge of Orlando where Jimmy lived, took just a hair over two hours. I wanted this to be over quick. If Stan were on ice in the warehouse Benny had told me about, then I needed Jimmy\u0027s help to bust in and grab Stan out of there- dead or alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWedgewood was an up-and-coming community with gleaming white houses that all looked more or less the same with cookie-cutter lawns. But it was near good schools, safe and clean. A place where the residents didn\u0027t have to worry about guys like me and Jimmy. I parked in the driveway behind his Cadillac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knocked, and he let me in with a smile and a nod. He was still a great big fat tub of goo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Charlie, come on in.\" Jimmy waved me into his living room. A ten-year-old kid sat watching The Wizard of Oz on video. It was near the beginning of the film, and the house had just landed on the witch. \"That\u0027s my son, Jimmy Jr. Say hi to Charlie, Junior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid turned, gave me a wave, then glued his eyes back to the tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tin man\u0027s my favorite,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like the monkeys,\" said the kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The monkeys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They fly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They only fly when the witch tells them to. How about the lion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t fly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s more important things than flying, kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like shit, Charlie,\" said Jimmy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a long night.\" It was true. I was wrung out, no sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on. I got coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed Jimmy into the kitchen and slumped at his table. He poured me some coffee in a World\u0027s Greatest Dad mug. Jimmy sat across from me. His mug said 100% Italian. For a second it was like we were two buddies, maybe getting ready to hit the golf links, maybe going fishing. But I forgot all that when Jimmy raised an eyebrow, cleared his throat. Time to get down to business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might know where Stan is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy\u0027s face was blank. \"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found Benny. If Beggar has Stan, Benny had an idea where they might have stashed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Benny now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not in the picture anymore,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew better than to ask more about it. I told him about the warehouse in Bithlo. Jimmy nodded, said he knew the place. That made sense, since Jimmy was in charge of moving stolen goods in and out of the city. I didn\u0027t know too much about that end of the operation, but I\u0027d heard there were warehouses and storage sheds all over the city full of hot televisions, car radios, leather jackets, tires, compact discs and booze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy cleared his throat, fiddled with his coffee mug. \"All that stuff you said about sticking by Stan. That\u0027s all true, so I\u0027m going to help you, okay? But there\u0027s more. Another reason I\u0027m going to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Larry Cartwright.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother of Stan\u0027s lieutenants. \"What about Larry Cartwright?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s it matter? I called his house, his office, and his cell phone like maybe five hundred times. Nobody\u0027s seen him. Pretty clear to me Beggar\u0027s trimming the fat. I don\u0027t feel as safe as I did last time we talked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. I hated to be a hardass, but trouble for Jimmy meant he was more on my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s more,\" said Jimmy. \"We got to face up to the fact that Stan might be past saving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was painfully aware of that possibility but didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something you don\u0027t know about.\" Jimmy lowered his voice and leaned forward. For a moment the house was dead quiet, only the sound of singing munchkins coming from the other room. \"The stash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell\u0027s the stash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Money,\" said Jimmy. \"So much money not even God knows how much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no fucking idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me, Charlie, but Beggar was right about a couple of things. Orlando is a juicy territory. We were raking in money hand over fist, so much we didn\u0027t know what to do with it. Well, we can\u0027t have the Feds and the IRS and everyone breathing down our backs all the time, right? We can only launder the money so fast, and we could only make so many trips to safe deposit boxes without getting people suspicious. So Stan just started stockpiling the cash. He didn\u0027t know how to get rid of it or launder it any faster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long\u0027s this been going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four, maybe five years,\" said Jimmy. \"Cash just kept arriving in suitcases and trunks and trucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, closed my eyes tight trying to get the dragon\u0027s horde image of all that money out of my head. \"What\u0027s this got to do with finding Stan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just saying we might not find Stan. He might not be findable. In which case we got to look out for ourselves.\" Jimmy\u0027s eyes darted toward the living room where his son still watched the movie. \"We got families to think about. A big stack of cash could set us up in the Bahamas, Spain, Australia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chewed my bottom lip while thinking about it. \"We look for Stan. Maybe we find some other things along the way. Fine. But one thing at a time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy put up his hands. \"Fair enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I know a way to get us close to that warehouse. I got to make some calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. You got any medical tape? Maybe some iodine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a scrape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the bathroom down the hall, under the sink,\" said Jimmy. \"Take what you need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the bathroom, I peeled off the old bandage where the bullet had grazed my side. It was crusty with dried blood, but from what I could see it looked okay. I flushed the bandage. I cleaned the wound, taped on a new bandage. I looked at myself in the mirror. I looked beat. And old. I thought about Jimmy\u0027s fairy story, the stash of money. Maybe I should just get out of town. Maybe I\u0027d take Marcie. I wondered offhand where my National Geographic was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just wanted to sit someplace with a drink. With Marcie. Yeah, she was nice, a good one. She knew all about me and didn\u0027t mind. But I had to finish what I was doing. There was something about quitting in the middle and running off without knowing what happened that didn\u0027t sit right in my gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI splashed water on my face, dried myself, went back out to the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the television, Dorothy was skipping along the yellow brick road. She looked confident; she didn\u0027t know the score. Oz was in color, but Kansas was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy came out of the kitchen, his coffee mug leading the way. In his other hand he held a pastry the size of a hubcap. No wonder he was a blimp. \"I got it all straight, Charlie. I got one of my boys dropping off a truck. We\u0027ll slip in like it\u0027s a regular delivery. Just sit tight. I got to get some stuff.\" And he was gone again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy Jr. still had his eyes glued to the movie. He was sitting real close to the TV. Ma would have told him to move back or he\u0027d go blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s the movie, kid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you want to be when you grow up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, spared me another quick glance. \"A paleontologist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pa-paleo- a what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A paleontologist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s pretty good, kid. When I was your age I either wanted to be a cowboy or a robot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which did you choose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHilarious fucking kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy came back with a tote bag, and he\u0027d changed into a sweatshirt and sweatpants. He told his son to behave while he was gone, and then we were in the parking lot next to a big yellow truck which used to be a moving van. You could still see where the word Ryder had been spray-painted over, and I asked Jimmy if the truck was hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not looking for it anymore,\" he said, and that was good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged into my shoulder holsters. We climbed into the truck. Jimmy cranked the ignition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is it an important guy like you is driving a truck?\" I said it with a straight face, but he knew I was ribbing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, scrunching his chins into fleshy wads. Jimmy had been living the soft life, and he bulged pretty good under his Florida Gator sweats. He was one of these career wise guys that was always shoving a bratwurst down his face, and whenever the sun came out, he\u0027d sweat barbecue sauce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy said, \"I like to keep a hand in.\" He looked back at his house. \"I just hate leaving Junior on short notice. I guess it\u0027s okay leaving him with Maria- that\u0027s my house girl. Maria. It\u0027s been a while since I been on a run, you know? I fix up deals, right? It\u0027s been ten years since I drove a truck or waved a piece around or any of that crap. I do most of my work over the phone. I fix deals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fix deals,\" I acknowledged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s in the truck now?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nike sneakers and Zippo lighters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove east toward Bithlo, past the junkyards and the trailer parks, to the very edge of Stan\u0027s crumbling kingdom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ever think about getting out of this business?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy\u0027s mouth hung open, and he looked at me like I had three heads. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell do you think I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think too much about that kind of stuff, and you\u0027ll go batty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess what I really wanted was to find Stan and have him tell me everything was going to be okay. Either we\u0027d kick Beggar Johnson\u0027s ass back to Miami somehow, or Stan would give me the okay to get the hell out of town. I didn\u0027t feel right without Stan telling me what to do. That wasn\u0027t easy to admit, but it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy smelled a buck. I shook my head and laughed to myself over the notion of a secret stash of money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s funny?\" asked Jimmy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. How are you fixed for artillery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just in case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a snub-nose.38 on my ankle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get it up around your waist. Tuck it in your pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m wearing sweats. It\u0027ll fall down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tuck it in your underwear too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did like I said and grimaced, sucking in a sharp gasp of breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The metal\u0027s cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll warm up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept a casual eye on the rearview mirror, and about ten minutes into the trip I saw something I didn\u0027t like. I said, \"Jimmy, let\u0027s stop for some coffee and a muffin. What do you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me sideways. \"Now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. How about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess,\" said Jimmy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome ambitious redneck had built a sandwich shop up against a Chevron station, so Jimmy pulled off the side of the two-lane highway and parked the truck. We took a booth in the sandwich shop. A teenage waitress with a Southern accent as thick as a slab of ham took our order for two coffees and a cheese Danish for Jimmy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy poured sugar into his coffee and kept pouring. I thought maybe he\u0027d dozed off, but he cut the flow and dumped about two cows\u0027 worth of milk in after it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you making, cake batter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lay off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get defensive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" said Jimmy. \"What gives?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re being followed. Don\u0027t look around. Eat your Danish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took half the thing in the first bite and said, \"Bring me up to speed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mutt and Jeff in a black Ford Tempo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since when?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since Gainesville. I thought I\u0027d given them the shake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not,\" said Jimmy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re at the pay phone across from the pumps, waiting for us and pretending to make a call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy raised an eyebrow. \"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" It looked like the same car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got to be sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy frowned. \"We can\u0027t lose them in the moving van.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s pay for this and get going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about our buddies?\" Jimmy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you said. We need to be sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove for a while. The jokers in the Tempo stayed at a discreet distance, but they were definitely tailing us. They probably thought they were doing a good job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pull into that Burger King up there,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll get to the bottom of this shit.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gun-monkeys/page-14.html","bookId":2246,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:09 PM"}
