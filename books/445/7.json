JOYS AND PASSIONS.","content":"My brother, when thou hast a virtue, and it is thine own virtue, thou hast it in common with no one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To be sure, thou wouldst call it by name and caress it; thou wouldst pull its ears and amuse thyself with it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And lo! Then hast thou its name in common with the people, and hast become one of the people and the herd with thy virtue!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Better for thee to say: “Ineffable is it, and nameless, that which is pain and sweetness to my soul, and also the hunger of my bowels.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus speak and stammer: “That is MY good, that do I love, thus doth it please me entirely, thus only do I desire the good.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law or a human need do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for me to superearths and paradises.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is therein, and the least everyday wisdom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and cherish it—now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But now hast thou only thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those passions: then became they thy virtues and joys.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And though thou wert of the race of the hot-tempered, or of the voluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils angels.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar: but they changed at last into birds and charming songstresses.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Out of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself; thy cow, affliction, milkedst thou—now drinketh thou the sweet milk of her udder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And nothing evil groweth in thee any longer, unless it be the evil that groweth out of the conflict of thy virtues.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My brother, if thou be fortunate, then wilt thou have one virtue and no more: thus goest thou easier over the bridge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Illustrious is it to have many virtues, but a hard lot; and many a one hath gone into the wilderness and killed himself, because he was weary of being the battle and battlefield of virtues.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My brother, are war and battle evil? Necessary, however, is the evil; necessary are the envy and the distrust and the back-biting among the virtues.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lo! how each of thy virtues is covetous of the highest place; it wanteth thy whole spirit to be ITS herald, it wanteth thy whole power, in wrath, hatred, and love.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jealous is every virtue of the others, and a dreadful thing is jealousy. Even virtues may succumb by jealousy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth, turneth at last, like the scorpion, the poisoned sting against himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ah! my brother, hast thou never seen a virtue backbite and stab itself?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Man is something that hath to be surpassed: and therefore shalt thou love thy virtues,—for thou wilt succumb by them.—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2158/60981.html","bookId":445,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM"}
