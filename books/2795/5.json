Have you been working on it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooney Bird frowned. \"Yes. It\u0027s hard, though. I keep wanting to do the hula.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hula?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My grandma can do the hula,\" Keiko said. \"She lives in Hawaii.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s lovely, Keiko. If she comes to visit, maybe she can give us lessons,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My grandma can do the funky chicken!\" Chelsea said. She stood, with her white Pilgrim hat falling forward, in order to demonstrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gross!\" Nicholas and Ben said together, watching Chelsea wiggle her behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Pidgeon played a loud chord on the piano in order to get the class\u0027s attention. Then she began to play some low notes in a repetitive way. \"Pretend this is a drumbeat, Gooney Bird. Squanto should simply move across the stage, keeping time to the sound of drums. Maybe some rhythmic foot-hopping too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so,\" Gooney Bird said. \"I\u0027ll work on it at home. And it\u0027ll be easier when I have my costume on. I\u0027ll feel more like a real Squanto in my costume. I\u0027ll feel authentic, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Pidgeon picked up the chalk and added AUTHENTIC to the word list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True and original, known to be trustworthy,\" Beanie read from her dictionary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Squanto, all right,\" said Gooney Bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooney Bird and the Room Mother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got the room mother song finished,\" Mrs. Pidgeon announced. She sat down at the piano. \"We\u0027ll need to learn it quickly because, as you know, the Thanksgiving pageant is next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gather round,\" she said. \"And now that we\u0027ve finished the hats and headbands, why don\u0027t we wear them while we sing? This will be a sort of a dress rehearsal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pilgrims over here.\" She pointed to the left. \"And Native Americans here.\" She pointed to the right. The second-graders, wearing their headgear, arranged themselves around the piano.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see!\" Nicholas called. His Pilgrim hat had slid down over his eyes. Beanie, her own white bonnet falling across her forehead, leaned over and lifted his hat up. \"Stand very still,\" she told him, \"so it doesn\u0027t fall down again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about me?\" Gooney Bird asked. \"Where should Squanto stand? Probably in the middle, right? Because he\u0027s the star, right smack in the middle of everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the middle is fine,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said. \"What is that on your head, Gooney Bird?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Squanto\u0027s hat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were making a headband. I saw you making a headband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I decided Squanto should have a better hat than the other Native Americans, because he\u0027s been to England, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yes, he did travel there. But that\u0027s a top hat, Gooney Bird. Something an ambassador might wear. I don\u0027t think—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Squanto brought it back from England. He probably went shopping and bought a lot of new clothes there. People always buy new clothes when they travel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true. My mom went to Hawaii to visit my grandma, and she bought a muumuu,\" Keiko said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad went to Albuquerque on business and he brought back a silver and turquoise belt buckle,\" Tricia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom and dad went...\" Chelsea began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Pidgeon sighed. She played a chord on the piano, to quiet the children. Then she played a simple melody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe played it again, and sang, \"Roooommmm Motherrrr—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around. \"Recognize that? It\u0027s the melody from \u0027Moon River.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the second-graders shook their heads. \"I know a song about the man in the moon,\" Beanie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know one about the cow that jumped over the moon,\" Ben said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know one about shine on harvest moon,\" Nicholas said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a moon song,\" Tyrone announced. \"Listen! Oh Mister Moon, Moon, bright and shiny moon, please shine down on meeeee!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no.\" Mrs. Pidgeon played the melody again. \"Roooommmm Motherrrr,\" she sang. \"Try it with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roooommmm Motherrrr,\" all of the children sang. Keiko\u0027s headband fell forward across her eyes. She pushed it back up but her bangs got caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see,\" Felicia Ann whispered. Her Pilgrim bonnet had lurched down over her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh dear,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said, turning around on the piano bench. \"We\u0027re having hat problems of all sorts. Let\u0027s not worry about that now, though. We need to learn this song. The next line is...\" She hesitated. \"Well, if we were singing the original song, it would be wider than a mile—but of course we don\u0027t want the room mother to think we are commenting on how wide she is, do we?\" Mrs. Pidgeon winked at Gooney Bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooney Bird shrugged. \"I don\u0027t think she\u0027d mind,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve changed it,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said. \"So we\u0027ll sing kinder than a smile instead. Give it a try after me, class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pilgrims and Native Americans all sang loudly. \"Kinder than a smile—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good! Barry? Can you push your headband up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben? Pilgrim hat? Up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen tried. He wrinkled his face in order to hold his hat brim up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next line: Your clothing is in style—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would we say that, Mrs. Pidgeon?\" Gooney Bird asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, because it rhymes with smile. And although of course I don\u0027t know our room mother, although she\u0027s incognito, I suspect she is quite stylish, right? Because she comes from a stylish family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Pidgeon looked meaningfully at Gooney Bird, who today was wearing a long flowered gypsy skirt, a leather vest, hiking boots with red laces, and, of course, the top hat that she had explained Squanto would have brought back from his stay in England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooney Bird sighed. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hooray—\" Mrs. Pidgeon sang next. \"In the original song,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooney Bird and the Room Mother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe explained, \"it says someday at that point. But someday doesn\u0027t work for us, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Malcolm loudly, \"because we\u0027ll want those cupcakes right away after the pageant!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s try that first verse again from the beginning. Nicholas? Can you see, with your Pilgrim hat down like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Nicholas from under his hat brim. \"But it\u0027s okay. I can sing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roooommmm Motherrrr,\" the second-graders sang enthusiastically, in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWearing her top hat jauntily and singing as loudly as possible, Gooney Bird began testing some dance steps in the center of the room. \"I think Squanto probably learned the tango in England,\" she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooney Bird and the Room Mother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Tuesday morning of Thanksgiving week, the day before the pageant, Mrs. Pidgeon wrote another new word on the board, below AUTHENTIC. She wrote FIASCO. She sighed, and stared at the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dictionaries, class,\" she instructed, though she hadn\u0027t needed to. The second-graders had already reached for their dictionaries and begun turning to the F section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry Tuckerman waved his hand in the air. \"I found it!\" he called out. When Mrs. Pidgeon nodded to Barry, he stood and read aloud, \"A total failure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Pidgeon sighed. \"Correct, Barry. Good dictionary work. The word fiasco means a total failure, especially a humiliating one. Say it after me, class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fiasco. Fiasco. Fiasco,\" the second-graders said aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gerbils, usually quiet in their cage in the corner, unexpectedly began to fight. They chittered noisily and chased each other in a circle. A paper thumbtacked to the bulletin board suddenly came loose and fluttered to the floor. The radiator hissed. Outside, it was raining in a steady drizzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong, Mrs. Pidgeon?\" asked Beanie. \"You look sad. Did we do something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. You children have all worked so hard. I\u0027m very proud of you,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said. \"But I\u0027m worried about the Thanksgiving pageant,\" she confessed. \"I\u0027m afraid it will be a fiasco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it won\u0027t! Look! I got my cast off!\" Ben reminded her, holding up his arm. \"And my arm works!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We sent the invitations,\" said Felicia Ann. \"And, remember, we put turkey stamps on them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Muriel\u0027s done,\" Barry pointed out. \"It turned out great! We only have to hang it up in the multipurpose room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The room mother says the cupcakes are all ready for tomorrow afternoon,\" Gooney Bird said. \"And lemonade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you\u0027ve all done wonderfully. And all of your mothers are coming? I know yours is, of course, Gooney Bird,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said. \"Everyone else? And some dads? And little brothers and sisters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the children nodded. \"And my auntie,\" Keiko said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my triplets,\" Malcolm said, making a face. \"I hoped they would get chicken pox, but they didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, please tell me their names,\" Felicia Ann begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Malcolm said with a scowl. \"They don\u0027t have names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Malcolm, Malcolm,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said, putting her arm gently across his shoulders. \"They probably have beautiful names and I hope someday you will tell them to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You children have all worked very hard. It\u0027s just that—\" She hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" asked Beanie. \"We know all the words to the songs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m concerned about the songs,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said. \"I\u0027m not really a songwriter, and they seem, well, a little slapdash to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrote the word on the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, dear,\" said Ben when he found it in the dictionary. \"That\u0027s bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said, and she wrote the definition on the board: \"Careless, hasty, unskillful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our costumes are all made,\" Tricia added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very concerned about the costumes,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said. \"I\u0027m not really a costume designer, and they seem—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slapdash?\" asked Tyrone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe a little,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said, \"and ill-fitting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know our lines,\" Nicholas said. \"Mine is \u0027Thank you, good friend Squanto!\u0027 I know it by heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m concerned about the lines,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you wrote the lines, Mrs. Pidgeon!\" Tricia pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooney Bird and the Room Mother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. And I\u0027m not really a writer. The lines are slapdash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the children looked at Mrs. Pidgeon. She looked very sad. Felicia Ann, the most bashful person in the class, went to her and gave her a hug. \"You\u0027re a very good teacher, Mrs. Pidgeon,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t have to be a writer, or a songwriter, or a costume designer, or even a Muriel maker. Because you\u0027re a teacher. You taught me to read!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too!\" called Tyrone. \"I couldn\u0027t read worth nuthin\u0027 when I came to this class! Now lookit! I can read a whole dictionary!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too!\" called Ben. \"I only could read baby books before, but now I can read whole long words!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all can!\" the other children shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Pidgeon began to cheer up. She smiled at the children. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sorry that I was depressed for a minute. It\u0027s just that the story of the first Thanksgiving is such a truly wonderful story, about becoming friends, and helping one another, and being thankful. I wish I could have presented it better, instead of writing a dumb song about succotash.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gooney-bird-and-the-room-mother-gooney-bird-greene-2/page-5.html","bookId":2795,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:37 PM"}
