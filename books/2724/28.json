But there was that unspoken rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one was home but the two of us. No one would have to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What flavor do you want?” he asked me at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it was decided. This was happening. I felt fear and also exhilaration that we were doing this forbidden thing. I rarely broke rules, but this seemed a good one to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Black Cherry,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah looked in the cabinet, but there was none. He asked, “What’s your second-best flavor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grape.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah said that grape Kool-Aid Slurpee sounded good to him, too. The more he said the words “Kool-Aid Slurpee,” the more I liked the sound of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah got a stool and took the blender down from the top shelf. He poured the whole packet of grape into the blender and added two big plastic cups of sugar. He let me stir. Then he emptied half the ice dispenser into the blender, until it was full to the brim, and he snapped on the top the way we’d seen Mr. Fisher do it a million times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pulse? Frappe?” he asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. I never paid close enough attention when Mr. Fisher used it. “Probably frappe,” I said, because I liked the sound of the word “frappe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Jeremiah pushed frappe, and the blender started to chop and whir. But only the bottom part was getting mixed, so Jeremiah pushed liquefy. It kept at it for a minute, but then the blender started to smell like burning rubber, and I worried it was working too hard with all that ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve got to stir it up more,” I said. “Help it along.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got the big wooden spoon and took the top off the blender and stirred it all up. “See?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the top back on, but I guess I didn’t do it tight enough, because when Jeremiah pushed frappe, our grape Kool-Aid Slurpee went everywhere. All over us. All over the new white counters, all over the floor, all over Mr. Fisher’s brown leather briefcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at each other in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quick, get paper towels!” Jeremiah yelled, unplugging the blender. I dove for the briefcase, mopping it up with the bottom of my T-shirt. The leather was already staining, and it was sticky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, man,” Jeremiah whispered. “He loves that briefcase.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he did. It had his initials engraved on the brass clasp. He truly loved it, maybe even more than his blender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt terrible. Tears pricked my eyelids. It was all my fault. “I’m sorry,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah was on the floor, on his hands and knees wiping. He looked up at me, grape Kool-Aid dripping down his forehead. “It’s not your fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it is,” I said, rubbing at the leather. My T-shirt was starting to turn brown from rubbing at the briefcase so hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yeah, it kinda is,” Jeremiah agreed. Then he reached out and touched his finger to my cheek and licked off some of the sugar. “Tastes good, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were giggling and sliding our feet along the floor with paper towels when everyone came back home. They walked in with long paper bags, the kind the lobsters come in, and Steven and Conrad had ice-cream cones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Fisher said, “What the hell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah scrambled up. “We were just—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed the briefcase over to Mr. Fisher, my hand shaking. “I’m sorry,” I whispered. “It was an accident.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took it from me and looked at it, at the smeared leather. “Why were you using my blender?” Mr. Fisher demanded, but he was asking Jeremiah. His neck was bright red. “You know you’re not to use my blender.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah nodded. “I’m sorry,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was my fault,” I said in a small voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Belly,” my mother said, shaking her head at me. She knelt on the ground and picked up the soaked paper towels. Susannah had gone to get the mop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Fisher exhaled loudly. “Why don’t you ever listen when I tell you something? For God’s sake. Did I or did I not tell you to never use this blender?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah bit his lip, and from the way his chin was quivering, I could tell he was really close to crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Answer me when I’m talking to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah came back in then with her mop and bucket. “Adam, it was an accident. Let it go.” She put her arms around Jeremiah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suze, if you baby him, he’ll never learn. He’ll just stay a little baby,” Mr. Fisher said. “Jere, did I or did I not tell you kids never to use the blender?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah’s eyes filled up and he blinked quickly, but a few tears escaped. And then a few more. It was awful. I felt so embarrassed for Jeremiah and also I felt guilty that it was me who had brought all this upon him. But I also felt relieved that it wasn’t me who was the one getting in trouble, crying in front of everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Conrad said, “But Dad, you never did.” He had chocolate ice cream on his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Fisher turned and looked at him. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You never said it. We knew we weren’t supposed to, but you never technically said it.” Conrad looked scared, but his voice was matter-of-fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Fisher shook his head and looked back at Jeremiah. “Go get cleaned up,” he said roughly. He was embarrassed, I could tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah glared at him and swept Jeremiah into the bathroom. My mother was wiping down the counters, her shoulders straight and stiff. “Steven, take your sister to the bathroom,” she said. Her voice left no room for argument, and Steven grabbed my arm and took me upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think I’m in trouble?” I asked Steven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiped my cheeks roughly with a wet piece of toilet paper. “Yes. But not as much trouble as Mr. Fisher. Mom’s gonna rip him a new one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does that mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven shrugged. “Just something I heard. It means he’s the one in trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my face was clean, Steven and I crept back into the hallway. My mother and Mr. Fisher were arguing. We looked at each other, our eyes huge when we heard our mother snap, “You can be such an ass-hat, Adam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth, about to exclaim, when Steven clapped his hand over my mouth and dragged me to the boys’ room. He shut the door behind us. His eyes were glittery from all the excitement. Our mother had cussed at Mr. Fisher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “Mom called Mr. Fisher an ass-hat.” I didn’t even know what an ass-hat was, but it sure sounded funny. I pictured a hat that looked like a butt sitting on top of Mr. Fisher’s big head. And then I giggled. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-not-summer-without-you-summer-2/page-28.html","bookId":2724,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM"}
