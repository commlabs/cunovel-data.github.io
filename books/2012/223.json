You must warn her —’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Forgive me for interrupting, Mother Dark, but she is past listening to me. And to be honest, I don’t blame her. I have nothing worth saying. You have made her the ruler of an empty city – how do you expect her to feel?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo bold, perhaps, for there came no reply from the surrounding darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stumbled forward, unsure of his destination, but feeling the need to reach it. ‘I have lost my belief in the seriousness of the world. Any world. Every world. You give me an empty city, and I feel like laughing. It’s not as if I don’t believe in ghosts. I do. How could I not? As far as I’m concerned, we’re all ghosts.’ He paused, set a hand upon the cold, damp stone of the sea wall. ‘Only this is real. Only this lasts from moment to moment, stretching on for years. Centuries. We – we just pass through. Filled with ephemeral thoughts—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ You surrender too much of yourself, Withal .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s easy,’ he replied, ‘when nothing I own is worth a damned thing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ This island city is the ghost. Its truth lies broken on the seabed. It drifts only in your memory, Withal .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted. ‘The ghost dreams of ghosts in a ghostly world. This is what I’ve come to understand, Mother Dark. From the Tiste Andii – and these Liosan. The way you can take a hundred thousand years and crush it all in one hand. There is no truth to time. It’s all a lie.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ She agrees with you, Withal. She was born a hostage to secret fates, born a hostage to a future she could not imagine, much less defy. In this, it was understood by all, she symbolized every child .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But you took it too far,’ he said, shaking his head. ‘You never let her grow up.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Yes, we would keep them children for ever .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Meckros city ended with a ragged edge, as if it had been torn in half. Withal continued walking until his steps sent him pitching down through darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started, head snapping up, and looked round. The throne room of Kharkanas, Sandalath on the throne, hands to her face, sobbing uncontrollably. Swearing under his breath, he rose, unfolding stiff, aching limbs, and went up to take her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They’re all dying! Withal! On the Shore – they’re all dying! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words muffled by his shoulder, she said, ‘Five thousand warriors. From the mines, from the prisons. From the gutters. Five thousand. The Hust Legion – I saw them marching out from the burning city.’ She lifted her head, stared at him with tortured eyes. ‘ Their swords howled. Their armour sang with joy. No one stood by and wept. No. Instead, they ran from the laughter, they fled the streets – those not already dead. The sound – so terrible – the Hust Legion marched to their deaths, and no one watched them go! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slapped her, hard enough to knock her to the floor at the foot of the throne. ‘Enough of this, Sand. This palace is driving you mad.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twisted round on to her knees, a knife in her hand, eyes blazing with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Better,’ he grunted, and then backed away from the slashing blade. ‘Too many wretched ghosts in your skull, woman. They all think they got something useful to tell you, but they don’t. They’re damned fools, and you know how I know they’re damned fools? Because they’re still here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarily, he watched her straighten, watched her lick the blood from her lips. Then sheathe the knife. Her sigh was ragged. ‘Husband, it’s this waiting. Waiting for them all to die, for the Liosan legions to enter the city – the palace. And then they will kill you, and I cannot bear it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not just me,’ he said. ‘You, as well.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have no regret for that. None.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There are other Tiste Andii. There must be. They are coming—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To what end?’ She slumped at the foot of the throne. ‘To avenge me? And so it goes on and on, back and forth. As if it all meant something.’ She looked up. ‘Do these walls care? This floor? No, but I will make it different this time, Withal.’ She met his eyes with a fierce challenge. ‘I will burn this palace down to the ground before they ever get here. I swear it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sandalath, there is nothing here to burn.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There are other ways,’ she whispered, ‘to summon fire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe killing ground was once more clear of corpses, broken weapons and pieces of torn flesh, but the once-white sand was brown as mud. Captain Pithy studied it for a moment longer, and then resumed examining the grip of her sword. The leather cord was loose – twice in the last fight the weapon had shifted in her grip. Looking up, she saw one of the Letherii youths Yedan was using to scavenge decent weapons. ‘You! Over here!’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-223.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
