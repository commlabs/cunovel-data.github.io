{"id":96252,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eThat night at the Crypt, I was anxious to see what information I could get on Jagger\u0027s Halloween haunted house plans and how Luna and Romeo\u0027s relationship was percolating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander drove me to the club, and when I entered, the new lovebats were cuddling next to the bar. Luna was stroking Romeo\u0027s wavy hair and flashing her butterfly lashes. When he broke away to serve a drink, she blew kisses at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was really impressed with how quickly her affections had turned to Romeo. But I couldn\u0027t blame her. He was really cute, and being older made him alluring, too.When Luna caught sight of me, she waved me over. She was sitting at the bar in a tattered black shirt, a coral-colored flirty skirt, and chunky Doc Martens with pink laces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was shocked and checked around to make sure I really was the object of her attention. She waved again, as if it were obvious we were old friends; Alexander hung by Sebastian while I headed to the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun around on the barstool. \"Isn\u0027t Romeo dreamy?\" Luna stopped and pressed close to me as if she wanted to literally rub her words in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh ... yes,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s so mature. Not like these younger guys.\" I knew who she meant and who that comment was directed toward: Alexander. Funny, these younger guys had been fine with her before as she tried to date most of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I think some guys here are really mature,\" I said defensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have time for my response and threw her long pink locks behind her. \"Romeo loves so many things,\" she explained. \"And I\u0027m one of them!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great.\" I was really excited for Luna; after all, I was the one who set her up with Romeo, so naturally I wanted them to hit it off. But Luna Seshad a way of turning everything good into something adversarial. Instead of letting me find joy in her newfound happiness, she was tormenting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna twirled a piece of her Barbie-pink hair around her snow-white fingers. \"He said he always liked me but thought I was younger than I am. I think it\u0027s because of my smooth skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s probably it.\" I did my best not to roll my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he knows what he wants out of life. He isn\u0027t floundering around like the guys in this town - freaking out at commitments. Romeo is mature - he\u0027s not a total commitment-phobe, unlike some people around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did my best not to yank her off the barstool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so happy you finally found someone,\" I said like a thrilled parent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna stopped twirling her hair. Her smile stiffened, and I knew she didn\u0027t like my crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll have you know, we talked all last night about our future - that is, when we weren\u0027t making out. Romeo wants to take me downstairs to the covenant altar, bite me, and bond our lives together for eternity. Isn\u0027t that dreamy?\" She batted her eyelashes purposefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart dropped. How could they make that decision so quickly? It had only been a few days - nights, in their case. Or was this one of Luna\u0027s lies to get me jealous? Or even worse, was this another Maxwell ploy, like it had been with Sebastian, to be bonded without his knowledge? I assumed that Romeo had heard by now that the downstairs club was built right over a Civil War burial site. I wasn\u0027t sure if this idea was something real or something Luna made up to spite me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of being mad, I decided to try the opposite approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the one that fixed you up, remember? I\u0027m so happy that you found love so quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah. That\u0027s right,\" she said as if she was disappointed it had been me who was the one who had found her true-love-for-the-moment. Her scowl brightened, and she gushed like a bride. \"Then I have you to thank,\" she said. \"You can be my bridesmaid!\" She gave me a fake girlie hug - the kind that the popular girls at Dullsville High give when they greet each other at their lockers, then talk behind one another\u0027s backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing I wanted was for Luna to beat me to the covenant altar. In Romania, fine. But here in Dullsville? I was first in line. And to be her bridesmaid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForget it. I wasn\u0027t even going to attend!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Maxwell twins were known for their tricks. It wasn\u0027t too long ago that Jagger and Luna tried to trick Sebastian into bonding with her for eternity. Was Romeo the next ong ll the nee to be taken to the sacred altar unknowingly? That wasn\u0027t part of my plan when I had arranged for them to date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he even know he\u0027s the groom?\" I charged. \"You do have a history of leaving important information out when taking your boyfriends to a covenant altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the fact that it\u0027s on sacred ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows. Romeo knows all about the Crypt. And about the burial sites below the Covenant. It was his idea to be bonded, not mine,\" she said, triumphantly flipping her nose at me. \"Can you say the same about your boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words stung me. Always giving me a jab about Alexander and my relationship. And she was diverting me from the task at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Romeo really did want to be with Luna, perhaps it was a good thing. The more she knew that it made me jealous, the faster she\u0027d be to get hitched. Maybe I was thinking about this in the wrong way. The sooner Luna was locked and loaded to some guy, the sooner I could breathe easy that she wouldn\u0027t be so stuck on Alexander. So what was there not to like about this plan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said. \"You should do it soon! Before he gets away. You name the time, and we\u0027ll go shopping for dresses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And even though you just met him, you\u0027ll have all of eternity to find out if you guys made the right decision so quickly.\" Just then, I spotted Jagger coming up from downstairs. \"Let\u0027s go talk to your brother about the good news,\" I continued. \"We\u0027ll make a huge affair for you. We can invite the whole town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Luna\u0027s waxlike face flushed cherry red, and her pink lips tensed. She wanted me to be mopey and in a jealous frenzy about her fast-moving relationship and obviously didn\u0027t like my enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not so sure...\" she said, her bright tone darkening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, this will be great,\" I went on. \"Alexander can be one of Romeo\u0027s groomsmen!\" That image hit her hard. Alexander standing on the altar with her but not being the one she was bonding with for eternity. I thought she might explode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she said. \"Are you nuts? We just started dating!\" She hopped off the stool and glared her baby-blue eyes at me. \"Gosh, you are so immature!\" She threw her hair back again and left me standing alone by the empty stool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun the stool around in victory. I guess I didn\u0027t have to worry about Luna\u0027s covenant plans for now. I breathed a sigh of relief. Everything with her was tied up for a while into a nice pink-and-black-skull bow, and I could go back to normal - whatever \"normal\" meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eup for a while into a nice pink-and-black-skull bow, and I could go back to normal - whatever \"normal\" meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was starting to leave to join Scarlet and Onyx when someone grabbed my shirtsleeve. I turned back to find Luna suddenly by my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the way,\" she said, \"I can\u0027t wait until Stormy comes here. It\u0027s as if the puzzle will be completed. She\u0027s like family to me, you know.\" My heart dropped. Like family to Luna? They were close - that close?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh ... you know Stormy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know her? I practically raised her. I was her babysitter,\" Luna exclaimed as if I should have known. \"We are like sisters. I guess you couldn\u0027t know,\" she continued. \"You haven\u0027t even met her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow my lips were tensing. How did Luna even know Stormy was coming to town? And why was she so excited?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s coming to visit Alexander,\" I said emphatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she said, almost squealing. \"I can\u0027t wait!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was something I hadn\u0027t even imagined. I knew Alexander had been in an arranged covenant with Luna - which he rejected - but I wasn\u0027t aware of Luna\u0027s history with Alexander\u0027s sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were mortal then,\" I said. \"Wouldn\u0027t it be hard to sit for her when she\u0027s up all night and you\u0027re not?\" I was hoping she was lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was. But I\u0027d stay up all night with her until the Sterlings got home. I was her favorite sitter. I can\u0027t wait to see her again!\" Jealousy seared through me, this time in a big way. Not only did Luna know about a sister that Alexander had who I\u0027d only recently learned about - but she had already had a relationship with her. I could only wonder what Luna was like as a babysitter. She had to be the coolest one ever. Making Count Chocula treats, telling ghost stories instead of bedtime stores, and sliding down banisters like witches on broomsticks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot like my sitters, who mostly never returned after one night of playing with the shaven-head dolls in my Barbie Nightmare House and cooking spider-shaped cakes in my Easy-Bake Oven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna had everything I wanted - except Alexander - and though he was the one thing that mattered most to me, she still wound up getting under my temporary-tattooed, bone-white skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She gets in soon,\" she went on. \"I can\u0027t wait to have her here at the Crypt. She\u0027ll die when she sees it!\" Then she let go of my sleeve. Luna whirled away from me, and I could hear her laughing as she slipped behind the bar and cozied up with Romeo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna was evil. I wanted to be the one to bring Stormy to the Crypt, and Luna already had plans for that. How could I compete with her? I normally wasn\u0027t jealous of others - there wasn\u0027t much that I desired from people in Dullsville. But Luna had it all, and even though I had one thing she wanted - Alexander - she somehow managed to make her life\u0027s mission to see to it that I was the loser. And if I let her, she would do just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been?\" Scarlet asked when I caught up to the girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talking to Luna,\" I answered through gritted teeth. I couldn\u0027t hide my frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about?\" Becky asked. \"You seem tense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, are you okay?\" Onyx asked sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just about Romeo,\" I said. \"She\u0027s all into him, which is great. Hopefully this is for real this time.\" Becky received this news with a smile. But then she asked, \"So why do you look angry? This is what we wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said. \"But she just likes to throw all her relationships in my face. It gets old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you have the one she really wants,\" Scarlet said. \"So don\u0027t give her another thought.\" I was comforted by my friend\u0027s reassurance, but I still was bugged about Luna having such a strong relationship with Stormy before I\u0027d even gotten the chance to meet her. When I saw Trevor walk into the club, another foe\u0027s taunts flashed before me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear that Jagger is planning on having a Halloween bash?\" I asked them suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Scarlet replied. She put her hands on her hips as if she, too, was surprised to have not been involved in the business-minded Maxwells\u0027 plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Onyx didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know something?\" Scarlet asked her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" Onyx responded softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spill it,\" Scarlet ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he\u0027s going to turn the Crypt into a haunted house for Halloween.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s awesome!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait!\" Becky said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That will be the greatest, ever,\" I added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I overheard him talking,\" Onyx said. \"He\u0027s still working on the plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why didn\u0027t he tell us?\" Scarlet said. \"What\u0027s the big secret?\" Just then Sebastian approached us, his blond dreadlocks bouncing with every step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I have this dance?\" he said to Onyx, like a gentleman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlet, Becky, and I were surprised by Sebastian\u0027s invitation. He knew Onyx was smitten with Jagger, but since Sebastian had been tricked by the Maxwells, I assumed he didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one was more surprised than Onyx. \"I was waiting for...\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead,\" Scarlet said, gently pushing her toward him. \"It\u0027s time you branch out.\" Onyx reluctantly obliged, and she and Sebastian rocked together in the middle of the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Jagger keeps holding secrets from us,\" Scarlet said, \"then it\u0027s time for us to find a new Jagger.\" My blood was boiling when I finally found Alexander by the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asked. \"Where is that beautiful smile?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried focusing my energy on Alexander, but I couldn\u0027t help but think of the Maxwells and how they got on my nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Jagger is going to have a haunted house and he told Trevor and not us, and Luna is going to bring Stormy here before I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa. Slow down,\" Alexander said. His calming tone melted me, but I was still frazzled. \"What about Jagger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Halloween, he is going to have a haunted house here at the Crypt. I found out from the girls at the club. And Trevor knew something was up before we did. He told me Jagger was going to have a \u0027spectacular event\u0027 for Halloween.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trevor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Alexander looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing...\" But his voice was shallow and distant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.... It\u0027s just annoying that he\u0027e ag that s the one that gets to see you all day when it should be me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, you are the only one I\u0027ve ever wanted to see,\" I tried to reassure him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But it\u0027s one of the things I miss by being a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But it\u0027s one of the things I miss by being a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt for him. Alexander experienced the same longing I did for him by not being able to completely share our worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate it, too. I wish you could be by my side at school. Hang out by our lockers. Sneak off for a kiss. But then again, you wouldn\u0027t be you.\" I gave him a soft smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Trevor knows first,\" Alexander said. \"Is that really a big deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I insisted. I wanted to be the first to have any new Crypt information, and I thought we deserved to be in Jagger\u0027s inner circle. \"We hang out here all the time. We should know everything. And that means Jagger is still keeping secrets from us. What else does he have planned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But a haunted house isn\u0027t something that we need to know about,\" he said in Jagger\u0027s defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he went on, pushing his dark locks away from his face. \"It\u0027s his right, really. If he wants us to know, he can tell. If not, no big deal. It\u0027s just a haunted house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a haunted house? I thought. This was a haunted house dreamed up by a living, breathing vampire. And not being in on the idea from the beginning made the news really sting, especially when Trevor knew before me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what\u0027s this about Luna and Stormy?\" Alexander went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luna is shoving it in my face that she and Stormy are like sisters. And I haven\u0027t even met her.\" I folded my arms like a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stormy\u0027s not here yet,\" Alexander said. \"Why are you worrying about this now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luna seems to think she gets to bring Stormy to the Crypt, not us. Not me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like I was in first grade. I was getting all wound up over something Luna might or might not do. But just the thought and her goading me was enough to make steam rise from my multipierced ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about this?\" Alexander said. \"Stormy\u0027s my sister, and I\u0027ll bring her here. And since you are my girlfriend, you\u0027ll be coming with us. Luna will see her in due time. I want you and Stormy to get a chance to hang out. And I know Stormy will want that as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you!\" I flung my arms around Alexander. I wanted to be a part of his family, and I didn\u0027t want anyone to come between us - especially someone as wicked as Luna Maxwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the rest of the night I was buzzing. When I wasn\u0027t dancing with Alexander, I was hanging with Becky and my vampire ghoul friends. It was interesting to see Luna and Romeo together, whether it was for spite or if she truly found him irresistible. Sebastian seemed to be in heaven dancing with Onyx, and I was happy to find him having such a good time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger finally came up from his office downstairs and noticed Sebastian and Onyx on the dance floor together. His ashen face flushed as blood-red as the dyed tips of his white hair. Jagger immediately stormed over to Sebastian and wedged himself between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up, dude?\" Sebastian asked, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t find your own date, dude?\" Jagger charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian wasn\u0027t deterred. He wasn\u0027t a menacing figure, but he wasn\u0027t one to be pushed around, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes I can, and she\u0027s right here,\" he replied, continuing to dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can have you removed from the club,\" Jagger said, snapping his black-fingernailed fingers, \"like that.\" The tension was mounting, and I worried it was going to break out into a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlet must have overheard the commotion because she bravely stepped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Onyx can choose for herself,\" she said to Jagger defiantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnyx looked at all of us and got flustered. For a moment she stood speechless, then fled the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlet hurried after her. Alexander came to Sebastian\u0027s side and pulled him away from Jagger and off toward the bar, diffusing the tension between the two vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger put his hands on his hips, shook his head, then disappeared the other way. I grabbed Becky and we found Scarlet and Onyx talking in the restroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure what to do,\" Onyx said, patting her face with a paper towel. \"I really like Jagger.\" There was only one mirror on the wall for the mortal attendees. The vampire girls were standing on the other side of the room so as not to raise suspicions about any absent reflections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I think Sebastian is cool, too. I love his dreadlocks,\" Onyx continued, \"and he is so laid back and kind where Jagger seems...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dangerous?\" I prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Onyx turned to me, surprised by my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is,\" I said. But wasn\u0027t that why Jagger was appealing? He did ooze sex appeal and power, and that tinge of danger was just the right kind of edginess that made him attractive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Sebastian is so fun,\" Onyx went on. \"He\u0027s really sweet, and I like that he loves to just hang out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Matt is really laid back, too,\" Becky said. \"That makes it really nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Alexander, who was so exciting to be with, too, no matter what we did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I love the danger,\" Scarlet chimed in. \"Trevor seems so clean cut, but he does have this dark edge. He\u0027s so conservative, but it\u0027s really like he should be wearing chains and studded earrings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you like his dark side?\" Becky asked. \"I don\u0027t like that side of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I knew what Scarlet was referring to. She found the side of Trevor that was conniving and menacing attractive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Scarlet wailed. \"And that he is mega-hot!\" They all giggled, but I rolled my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I\u0027m confused,\" Onyx said. \"I like that Sebastian is spontaneous, but I also like that Jagger is so headstrong and focused on his clubs. It\u0027s really sexy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt is passionate about soccer. It is really cool to date someone who has a passion. I can see why you like that in Jagger,\" Becky said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander was passionate about his art. It was one of the traits that made him so alluring. I agreed that their interests did make our guys that much more dreamy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Trevor is passionate, too.\" Scarlet paused and looked to me. I wasn\u0027t sure what she was going to say next, but I sensed she was referring to me. \"Soccer, too,\" she eventually said. \"Trevor has so many layers to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I thought. You peel back the layers of a jerk and find a bigger jerk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything just felt right with Alexander. I could make a list of the things I liked about him, but there was something deeper to it that I couldn\u0027t quite put into words but that let me know he was the one. Our relationship just felt like heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to make a decision this minute,\" Scarlet said. \"For now, we\u0027ll dance together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, let them fight for you,\" Becky said like an old pro in the romantic game. \"It canon.e. \"I be very exciting.\" d \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-3.html","bookId":2147,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM"}
