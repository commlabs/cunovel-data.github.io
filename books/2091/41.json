His body bent; his clothes tore; hair sprouted from every pore. I\u0027d seen him change from wolf to man; now I watched as he went from man to wolf. That had to hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis too human eyes peered at us from behind the bars. When I\u0027d seen them before they\u0027d been full of hate and hunger.

Could you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me, no. I\u0027d need to find a practitioner powerful enough to perform that kind of magic.

I moved closer and slipped my hand into his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until then, let me try,\" Elise urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood why Adam didn\u0027t want to give anyone power over Henri. In relinquishing his grandpere, Adam relinquished control over his own and Luc\u0027s destiny. But we\u0027d exhausted our options. Protecting Henri wasn\u0027t getting us anywhere. We needed the experts\u0027 help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam must have thought the same thing, because he squeezed my hand and said, \"OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night passed; the sun rose; Henri became a man again. A very crazy man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise was forced to sedate him to get him back to the compound in Montana. She\u0027d been right. The knowledge of all he\u0027d done had sent him over the edge. He did a lot of moaning and muttering. If I hadn\u0027t almost been one of his victims, I might have felt sorry for him. As it was, I was glad to see him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra decided to take a trip to Haiti, courtesy of the Jager-Sucher society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mandenauer wants me to discover more about voodoo, zombies, and this goddess-of-the-moon question. I\u0027m game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d hired a local to run her store and take care of Lazarus when I refused to.

Maybe not. It won\u0027t hurt to look into things a little more. You want Henri cured, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For all I care, Henri can burn in hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He probably will. But if we can make certain Adam and Luc don\u0027t follow him there - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do anything,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I thought I made a few calls after you traveled to Ife and spoke to Erzulie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not tell me I\u0027m a lost priestess of the voodoo nation. I\u0027m a cryptozoologist from Boston. Period.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra\u0027s shoulders shifted, as if something were crawling down her neck. \"I think I sent you to Ife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I performed the ceremony. The magic came from me.\" Cassandra appeared sheepish. \"I might be more powerful than I thought\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good news, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell Mandenauer. He gets weird when people talk about power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t imagine why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s next for you?\" Cassandra asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head. \"Love, marriage, mommyhood. I see it in the cards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t read cards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hand over mine. \"Your future is with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen Adam or Luc since Henri went away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days ago. I\u0027d hung around the mansion waiting. Pathetic but true. I\u0027d have to get a job soon, considering Frank hadn\u0027t paid me. Since his butt was in jail, courtesy of me, I didn\u0027t mink he was going to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Mandenauer had left he\u0027d told Detective Sullivan there\u0027d been one rabid wolf in the swamp and he had killed it. Case closed. I had no reason to hang around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam loves you,\" Cassandra said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not so sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He put his son in your protection. There\u0027s no greater love than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henri found a gris-gris under Luc\u0027s pillow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? I guess that\u0027s the love charm you were so worried about.\" She narrowed her gaze. \"You want me to give you one to counteract the magic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He burned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe peered into my face. \"And you still love them both, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Desperately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d realized sometime over the past few nights I\u0027d slept alone that I\u0027d fallen for Adam before I\u0027d even met Luc. The gris-gris was irrelevant, even if it weren\u0027t dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you need to say good-bye to your first love before you move on to the last one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt my confused expression, she continued. \"Simon. You\u0027ve never really put him to rest\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how do you suggest I do that? Another gris-gris?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and squeezed my hand. \"Only you can say good-bye to him, Diana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure how I\u0027d say good-bye to a dead man, but I certainly couldn\u0027t do it long-distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI packed my things and went to Chicago, where I\u0027d buried Simon four years ago. The place no longer felt like home. I\u0027m not sure it ever had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cemetery was peaceful, deserted. No one would see me talking to a headstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were right, Simon. There\u0027s more in this world than anyone could imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on the grave and ran my hand over the grass. \"I had to break my vow, and I\u0027m sorry. I couldn\u0027t clear your name. I\u0027d only hurt more people. I figured you\u0027d understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsently I pulled out the gris-gris that contained the fire iris petal. A little truth wouldn\u0027t be so bad. Where was Simon now? Had he truly come to me in the swamp? Was there any way of getting him back? Did I want to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I touched the sack, the tie fell off, and when I peered inside, I discovered the petal had disintegrated into dust The wind swirled the particles away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess some truths are better left unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still miss you,\" I said. \"I probably always will, but I have to say good-bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe breeze, warm despite the autumn chill off Lake Michigan, stirred my hair. I wanted to smell Simon\u0027s aftershave, hear his voice, feel his love, know that he\u0027d heard me. I closed my eyes and wished for him, but he was as gone as the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I opened my eyes, Adam was there. Talk about magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You scared me to death, cher. I thought you\u0027d left for good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had he found me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassandra,\" I said as I got to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, then indicated Simon\u0027s grave with a tilt of his head. \"You were saying good-bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t live in the past anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, neither.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope lit my heart and probably my face, because he held up his hand. \"There\u0027s something I have to tell you. Luc and Sadie did a love spell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started. \"You do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to destroy it, but Luc can\u0027t find de gris-gris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henri burned it.

We can\u0027t both traipse off, tra-la-la.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips curved. \"You\u0027re thinkin\u0027 like a mother already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was. When had that happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure you want a ready-made family?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure I want you and Luc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027ll be no more children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be lucky if I can handle the one we have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll do fine,\" he said. \"The boy was crazy about you from day one. That\u0027s why he did de love spell. Couldn\u0027t bear to lose you. I have to say I understand why, but he\u0027s still grounded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stifled a laugh at the notion of being grounded for performing a voodoo love spell. My life certainly had taken a turn for the strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figure if we take Mandenauer\u0027s offer we can take turns bein\u0027 away from home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Home,\" I murmured. \"That sounds nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam reached into his pocket For an instant I thought he\u0027d brought another belly chain. I still wore the one he\u0027d given me. I planned never to take it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Partners?\" he asked, and held out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his palm lay a circlet of interlinked silver fleurs-de-lis with a moonstone center. The ring was so beautiful, I ached to put it on. But not yet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you say partners...?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll understand if you don\u0027t want to marry me. Who knows when I might change under de crescent moon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d still love you, even then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only way I\u0027ll do this is if we\u0027re married,\" I insisted. \"I adopt Luc. I\u0027ll protect him if you can\u0027t Once that\u0027s settled, we take the jobs, help save the world. Together, we\u0027ll face whatever comes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated so long, I feared he\u0027d take back the offer and the ring. At last he slipped the silver circlet onto my finger, sealing the deal without saying a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was one thing that still bugged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you really believe everything that was between us was the result of magic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy startled gaze flicked to his. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching out, he touched my cheek. \"Don\u0027t it feel like magic to you, cher?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t speak, could only nod, as he took my hand, then led me away from my past and into a bright new future. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-41.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
