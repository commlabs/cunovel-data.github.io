{"id":26579,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 30.","content":"It may be supposed that the dinner which was served to Lord Erradeen after this episode was done but little justice to. The trout was delicious, the bird cooked to perfection; but the young man, seated in sight of the apparently vacant chair, where so lately his visitor had been seated, could scarcely swallow a morsel. Was he there still, though no one could see him? or had he departed only to return again when Symington and the meal had been cleared away, and the evening was free? There was a sickening sensation at Walter’s heart as he asked himself these questions, and indeed, throughout this portion of his life, his experience was that the actual presence of this extraordinary person was very much less exciting and confusing than the effect produced during his apparent absence, when the idea that he might still be there unseen, or might appear at any moment, seemed to disturb the mental balance in a far more painful way. In the present case the effect was overpowering. Walter had been talking to him almost with freedom: it was impossible, indeed, thus to converse—even though the conversation was something of a struggle, with a man possessed of all the ordinary faculties, and in appearance, though more dignified and stately than most, yet in no way unlike other men—without a gradual cessation of those mysterious tremors with which the soul is convulsed in presence of anything that appears supernatural. The personage who inhabited, or (for it was impossible to think of him as inhabiting a ruin) periodically visited Kinloch Houran had nothing in him save his stateliness of aspect which need have separated him from ordinary men. He would have attracted attention anywhere, but except as a person of unusual distinction, would have startled no one; and even when the young man so cruelly subject to his influence talked with him, it was impossible to keep up the superstitious terror which nature feels for the inexplainable. But as soon as he withdrew, all this instinctive feeling returned. Walter’s nerves and imagination sprang up into full play again, and got command of his reason. By moments it seemed to him that he caught a glimpse still of an outline in the chair, of eyes looking at him, of the smile and the voice which expressed so full a knowledge of all his own past history and everything that was in him. This consciousness gave to his eyes the same scared yet searching look which he had seen in those of Symington, took his breath from him, made his head whirl, and his heart fail. Symington waiting behind his chair, but eagerly on the watch for any sign, saw that his young lord was ghastly pale, and perceived the half stealthy look which he cast around him, and especially the entire failure of his appetite. This is a thing which no Scotch domestic can bear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are no eating, my lord,” he said in a tone of gentle reproach, as he withdrew the plate with the untasted trout. (“That many a poor gentleman would have been glad of!” he said to himself.)\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, I am not particularly hungry,” Walter said, with a pretence at carelessness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I can recommend the bird,” said Symington, “if it’s no just a cheeper, for the season is advanced, it’s been young and strong on the wing; and good game is rich, fortifying both to the body and spirit. Those that have delicate stomachs, it is just salvation to them—and for those that are, as ye may say, in the condition of invalids in the mind——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Symington had entirely recovered from his own nervousness. He moved about the room with a free step, and felt himself fully restored to the position of counsellor and adviser, with so much additional freedom as his young master was less in a position to restrain him, and permitted him to speak almost without interruption. Indeed Walter as he ineffectually tried to eat was half insensible to the monologue going on over his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ye must not neglect the body,” Symington said, “especially in a place like this where even the maist reasonable man may be whiles put to it to keep his right senses. If ye’ll observe, my lord, them that see what ye may call visions are mostly half starvit creatures, fasting or ill-nourished. Superstition, in my opinion, has a great deal to do with want of meat. But your lordship is paying no attention. Just two three mouthfuls, my lord! just as a duty to yourself and all your friends, and to please a faithful auld servant,” Symington said, with more and more insinuating tones. There was something almost pathetic in the insistance with which he pressed “a breast of pairtridge that would tempt a saint” upon his young master. The humour of it struck Walter dully through the confusion of his senses. It was all like a dream to him made up of the laughable and the miserable; until Symington at last consented to see that his importunities were unavailing, and after a tedious interval of clearing away, took himself and all his paraphernalia out of the room, and left Walter alone. It seemed to Lord Erradeen that he had not been alone for a long time, nor had any leisure in which to collect his faculties; and for the first few minutes after the door had closed upon his too officious servant a sense of relief was in his mind. He drew a long breath of ease and consolation, and throwing himself back in his chair gave himself up to momentary peace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But this mood did not last long. He had not been alone five minutes before there sprang up within him something which could be called nothing less than a personal struggle with—he could not tell what. There is a quickening of excitement in a mental encounter, in the course of a momentous discussion, which almost reaches the height of that passion which is roused by bodily conflict, when the subject is important enough, or the antagonists in deadly earnest. But to describe how this is intensified when the discussion takes place not between two, but in the spiritual consciousness of one, is almost too much for words to accomplish. Lord Erradeen in the complete solitude of this room, closed and curtained and shut out from all access of the world, suddenly felt himself in the height of such a controversy. He saw no one, nor did it occur to him again to look for any one. There was no need. Had his former visitor appeared, as before, seated opposite to him in the chair which stood so suggestively between the fire and the table, his pulses would have calmed, and his mind become composed at once. But there was nobody to address him in human speech, to oppose to him the changes of a human countenance. The question was discussed within himself with such rapidity of argument and reply, such clash of intellectual weapons, as never occurs to the external hearing. There passed thus under review the entire history of the struggle which had been going on from the time of Lord Erradeen’s first arrival at the home of his race. It ran after this fashion, though with the quickness of thought far swifter than words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You thought you had conquered me. You thought you had escaped me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I did; you had no power in the glen, or on the isle.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Fool! I have power everywhere, wherever you have been.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “To betray me into wickedness?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “To let you go your own way. Did I tempt you to evil before ever you heard of me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Can I tell? perhaps to prepare me for bondage.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “At school, at home, abroad, in all relations? Self-lover! My object at least is better than yours.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am no self-lover; rather self-hater, self-despiser.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is the same thing. Self before all. I offer you something better, the good of your race.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have no race. I refuse!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You shall not refuse. You are mine, you must obey me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Never! I am no slave. I am my own master.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The slave of every petty vice; the master of no impulse. Yield! I can crush you if I please.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Never! I am—Oona’s then, who will stand by me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oona’s! a girl! who when she knows what you are will turn and loathe you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Fiend! You fled when she gave me her hand.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Will she touch your hand when she knows what it has clasped before?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then Walter felt his heart go out in a great cry. If any one had seen him thus, he would have borne the aspect of a madman. His forehead was knotted as with great cords, his eyes, drawn and puckered together in their sockets, shone with a gleam of almost delirious hatred and passion. He held back, his figure all drawn into angles, in a horrible tension of resistance as if some one with the force of a giant was seizing him. He thought that he shrieked out with all the force of mortal agony. “No! If Oona turns from me and all angels—I am God’s then at the last!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then there seemed to him to come a pause of perfect stillness in the heart of the battle; but not the cessation of conflict. Far worse than the active struggle, it was with a low laugh that his antagonist seemed to reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “God’s! whom you neither love nor obey, nor have ever sought before.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The room in which Lord Erradeen sat was quite still all through the evening, more silent than the night air that ruffled the water and sighed in the trees permitted outside. The servants did not hear a sound. Peace itself could not have inhabited a more noiseless and restful place.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1473/44196.html","bookId":1358,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 1:20:25 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 1:20:25 AM"}
