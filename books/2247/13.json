Two completely different poems. This one\u0027s about an arsonist and this other one is a man who kills people with piano wire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geeze, these things are so violent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan shrugged. \"In any case, those are just the vehicles,\" Morgan said. He kept the cigar in the side of his mouth as he talked. He was beginning to like it. \"Let me show you something.\" He stood, scanned the bookshelf in his living room, and came back to the table with The Collected Works of Wallace Stevens. \"Listen.\" He read a poem:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anecdote of the Jar\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed a jar in Tennessee,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd round it was upon a hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made the slovenly wilderness\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurround that hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wilderness rose up to it,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sprawled around, no longer wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jar was round upon the ground\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd tall and of a port in air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took dominion everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jar was gray and bare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did not give of bird or bush,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike nothing else in Tennessee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on in the poem?\" Morgan waited, puffed the cigar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJones turned the book toward him. He read again silently, his lips moving. \"This jar is changing everything just by being there. It\u0027s making itself the center of the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But is it really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it really doing anything? It\u0027s just sitting there, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJones thought for a long time. Morgan didn\u0027t mind. He was enjoying the cigar. He thought a cold beer would go well with the smoke, but it was still before noon and Morgan had recently set some new rules for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was getting his shit together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJones leaned back in his chair, rubbed his chin. \"You know what I think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s both,\" the old man said. \"I think it\u0027s doing nothing and everything at the same time. I think it\u0027s only perception that makes it seem like it\u0027s changing everything. Then again, maybe perception is all we got, right? So changing perception is like changing reality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan took the cigar out of his mouth, looked at Jones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJones scanned the poem again. \"Jesus. That\u0027s a pretty fucking good poem. Once you figure it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got any more like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can borrow the book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan said, \"That\u0027s pretty smart, Mr. Jones. Not a lot of people get it right off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, but I\u0027d trade being smart for being able to smoke that cigar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang. Morgan set the cigar across the top of the coffee cup, excused himself, and picked it up in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morgan, is that you?\" Louis Reams\u0027s voice was edgy and hushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me.\" Morgan hadn\u0027t spoken to the professor since the bicycle incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen Pritcher? The big faker is walking around campus wearing this ridiculous neck brace. He\u0027s been asking a lot of very pointed questions too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you need to consider that he might really have been seriously hurt,\" Morgan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha. I know better. He\u0027s out to get me. Yes, I admit it was a lapse in judgment, a bit juvenile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now he sees his chance. If he can prove I did it, he\u0027ll have me by the balls. That\u0027s just what he wants, the son of a bitch. Morgan, you didn\u0027t mention what happened to anybody did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you to keep it under your hat. You wouldn\u0027t tell would you? That would be playing right into his hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I hadn\u0027t mentioned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good man.\" Reams sounded relieved. \"I knew I could count on you. I\u0027m going to pay you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really. I want to show my appreciation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reams, I don\u0027t want you to pay me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReams didn\u0027t hear. \"I know a fellow down at San Gabriel College in Houston. They\u0027re going to need a one-year poet next fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Morgan was listening. He\u0027d sent out at least thirty applications for next fall and had turned up nothing. Securing a job for next year would take a big load off his mind. And he wouldn\u0027t have to track down Ellis for the ridiculous poetry reading. Wouldn\u0027t have to be under Whittaker\u0027s thumb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m listening,\" Morgan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now,\" Reams said. \"Got to go. Got to keep an eye out for Pritcher. Can\u0027t stay in one spot too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reams-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d already hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan returned to the table. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll let it go out.\" Jones pointed at the cigar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" He stuck it back in his mouth, resuscitated the glowing tip with sharp puffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what that jar poem made me think of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan kept puffing but arched his eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was ten years old, my father took me camping way back in the Catskills,\" Jones said. \"It wasn\u0027t like it is now. You could find a forest, go back in there for days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you fish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Just hiking. I liked to build campfires, cook over the wood coals. For some reason a hot dog tastes better in the woods. You get away from the city and you can really see the stars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to fish,\" Morgan said. \"Supposed to be some good trout streams over the line into Arkansas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in the middle of a fucking story here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway I\u0027m hiking pretty far. Dad and me had been hiking all day and it was starting to get dark and we\u0027re way gone into the woods, deeper than we\u0027ve ever been before. I\u0027m thinking maybe we\u0027re walking in a spot where nobody\u0027s ever been before. Maybe we\u0027re the first people ever. You ever think that when you were a kid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027m thinking maybe Indians had been here, but other than that we were the first. I guess even at ten I thought maybe that wasn\u0027t true, but a ten-year-old can think anything. That\u0027s the genius of being ten. Anything can be true. And it\u0027s a split second-literally the next second-after I think this that I take one more step and see a beer bottle, a Pabst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan started to laugh, shut himself up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man shook his head. \"The whole forest arranged itself around that beer bottle, my whole life. Everything I thought. Like that jar on a hill in Tennessee. Seems dumb, I guess. But I was mad about that bottle for a long time. Not because of littering. I don\u0027t give a shit about that. Because it took away what it felt like to be ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan puffed the cigar. The old man closed his eyes and smelled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I talk too much,\" Jones said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I know what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you?\" Jones scooted forward in his chair. \"Something\u0027s gnawing on you. I can tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m supposed to get one of my students to do a poetry reading in a week, but I think he\u0027s skipped out on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kids.\" Jones waved his hands like that covered the whole subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you, Mr. Jones? Ever read your poems in front of people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJones said, \"You ever drop your britches and wave your pecker at a passing bus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwenty-three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses Duncan drove his pal Eddie home from the county hospital. They\u0027d told the doctor that the broken window which caused the dozens of cuts on Eddie\u0027s face had been shattered by a hard-thrown baseball. Eddie\u0027s entire face was wrapped in gauze like a mummy\u0027s, only slits for his eyes and nostrils. His lips had been badly lacerated, so he didn\u0027t have a mouth hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmmph. Mmm mmmph,\" Eddie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you sweat it, Eddie.\" Duncan gripped the steering wheel tight. He still burned with hatred, the image of Big John\u0027s body sprawled in the dust branded on his mind\u0027s eye. His side stung too from the slight buckshot wound. \"We\u0027ll get that coon and his buddies too. We\u0027ll go home and get the shotguns and we\u0027ll find that son of a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You leave that to me,\" Duncan said. \"Not many black guys around here. Hell, we\u0027ll just cruise up and down every street until we find him if we have to. Don\u0027t worry. We\u0027ll get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmmph umph mmmmph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn straight.\" Duncan wondered how he understood Eddie so well. \"You know I think I\u0027d of been a good dentist. I could probably understand folks even with my hands in their mouths.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmmph Ummm Mmmph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan frowned. \"No need to get nasty, Eddie. Just ain\u0027t called for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed Zach sat in the back of his limo. He was pissed. Why couldn\u0027t it just be easy for once?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpoon sat across from him, one of Zach\u0027s big goons uncomfortably close. Spoon looked drained, broken, and scared. He kept his eyes on the floor of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, Zach had to get in character, so he could play hard-ass with Spoon. Not for the first time, Zach supposed he needed to train some middle-management personnel, a couple of good men to do all this bruiser work. Zach could lounge on the beach in Antigua and hear all about it via cell phone or e-mail. The key to an operation like this was to get it on autopilot as much as possible. Zach wanted to put as much distance as possible between himself and the dirty work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut until then, if he wanted shit done right, he\u0027d have to do it himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your boy Harold killed one of mine in that trailer,\" Zach said. \"You don\u0027t think I can just let that go, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpoon shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s he going now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Red. Shit, he don\u0027t tell me nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what you said the first time,\" Zach said. \"Once we helped you remember, you told us about Harold coming to Oklahoma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpoon\u0027s hand went to his split lip. \"I don\u0027t know, man. You got to believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach smiled. \"Okay, I believe you.\" He nodded to the goon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving fast, the goon looped the length of piano wire over Spoon\u0027s neck, yanked. Spoon\u0027s eyes bulged. His tongue popped from his mouth. His whole face bunched tight like the last bit of toothpaste being squeezed from the tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach flipped open his cell phone and thumbed the speed-dial. \"This is Red. I need all the boys down here right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpoon kicked. The goon hanging tight. Blood from Spoon\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach wasn\u0027t paying attention anymore. \"Don\u0027t waste my time asking why. Get the fuck down here and make sure everyone\u0027s packing heat. We going to make an example.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpoon went slack, eyes wide. The body slumped to the car floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach folded the cell phone closed, looked at the body and the goon and the blood. \"Goddammit. You got blood on the seat. Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goon hung his head, looked sheepish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeke Stubbs had found a lot of names and a lot of secrets in Annie Walsh\u0027s journal. Two names stood out. Moses Duncan and Timothy Lancaster. Annie had tried to be subtle in some of her journal entries, but it was obvious that Duncan was her connection. A good possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan wasn\u0027t in the phone book, but Lancaster was. His apartment was close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two beers Stubbs had swilled at Friday\u0027s put him in the mood for more. He stopped at a Quickie-Mart and bought a six-pack of Busch and a copy of Hustler. He drank one in the parking lot and flipped through the jack-off magazine. He was getting crazy horny again. Something happened to Stubbs when he saw skin. It made him desperate crazy. Maybe that\u0027s why he was always forking over big bucks to get his rocks off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw the magazine into the backseat before it made him too crazy. He flipped through Annie Walsh\u0027s journal instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, Annie had boinked this Lancaster kid a month back as some sort of experiment. The journal said that Lancaster \"intrigued\" her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA place to start. A thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubbs pulled out of the parking lot, tossed the empty beer can into the backseat. He opened another, slurped, held the can between his legs, and pointed the Dodge toward Lancaster\u0027s apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in no particular hurry. He was getting paid by the day. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-pistol-poets/page-13.html","bookId":2247,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:02 PM"}
