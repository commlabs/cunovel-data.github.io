Who was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlick turned, feeling like a child who had just received a Christmas gift he feared was not really for him. \"I just got a tip. Something\u0027s going on inside the Vatican.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s called conclave,\" Chinita said. \"Helluva tip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, something else.\" Something big. He wondered if the story the caller had just told him could possibly be true. Glick felt ashamed when he realized he was praying it was. \"What if I told you four cardinals have been kidnapped and are going to be murdered at different churches tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say you\u0027re being hazed by someone at the office with a sick sense of humor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I told you we were going to be given the exact location of the first murder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d want to know who the hell you just talked to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps because he\u0027s full of shit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlick had come to expect Macri\u0027s cynicism, but what she was forgetting was that liars and lunatics had been Glick\u0027s business for almost a decade at the British Tattler. This caller had been neither. This man had been coldly sane. Logical. I will call you just before eight, the man had said, and tell you where the first killing will occur. The images you record will make you famous. When Glick had demanded why the caller was giving him this information, the answer had been as icy as the man\u0027s Mideastern accent. The media is the right arm of anarchy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told me something else too,\" Glick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? That Elvis Presley was just elected Pope?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dial into the BBC database, will you?\" Glick\u0027s adrenaline was pumping now. \"I want to see what other stories we\u0027ve run on these guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indulge me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacri sighed and pulled up the connection to the BBC database. \"This\u0027ll take a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlick\u0027s mind was swimming. \"The caller was very intent to know if I had a cameraman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Videographer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if we could transmit live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One point five three seven megahertz. What is this about?\" The database beeped. \"Okay, we\u0027re in. Who is it you\u0027re looking for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlick gave her the keyword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacri turned and stared. \"I sure as hell hope you\u0027re kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e52\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe internal organization of Archival Vault 10 was not as intuitive as Langdon had hoped, and the Diagramma manuscript did not appear to be located with other similar Galilean publications. Without access to the computerized Biblion and a reference locator, Langdon and Vittoria were stuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure Diagramma is in here?\" Vittoria asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Positive. It\u0027s a confirmed listing in both the Uficcio della Propaganda delle Fede - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. As long as you\u0027re sure.\" She headed left, while he went right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon began his manual search. He needed every bit of self-restraint not to stop and read every treasure he passed. The collection was staggering. The Assayer... The Starry Messenger... The Sunspot Letters... Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina... Apologia pro Galileo... On and on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Vittoria who finally struck gold near the back of the vault. Her throaty voice called out, \"Diagramma della Verita!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon dashed through the crimson haze to join her. \"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria pointed, and Langdon immediately realized why they had not found it earlier. The manuscript was in a folio bin, not on the shelves. Folio bins were a common means of storing unbound pages. The label on the front of the container left no doubt about the contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiagramma Della Verita\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalileo Galilei, 1639\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon dropped to his knees, his heart pounding. \"Diagramma.\" He gave her a grin. \"Nice work. Help me pull out this bin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria knelt beside him, and they heaved. The metal tray on which the bin was sitting rolled toward them on castors, revealing the top of the container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No lock?\" Vittoria said, sounding surprised at the simple latch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never. Documents sometimes need to be evacuated quickly. Floods and fires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So open it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon didn\u0027t need any encouragement. With his academic life\u0027s dream right in front of him and the thinning air in the chamber, he was in no mood to dawdle. He unsnapped the latch and lifted the lid. Inside, flat on the floor of the bin, lay a black, duck-cloth pouch. The cloth\u0027s breathability was critical to the preservation of its contents. Reaching in with both hands and keeping the pouch horizontal, Langdon lifted it out of the bin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I expected a treasure chest,\" Vittoria said. \"Looks more like a pillowcase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow me,\" he said. Holding the bag before him like a sacred offering, Langdon walked to the center of the vault where he found the customary glass-topped archival exam table. Although the central location was intended to minimize in-vault travel of documents, researchers appreciated the privacy the surrounding stacks afforded. Career-making discoveries were uncovered in the top vaults of the world, and most academics did not like rivals peering through the glass as they worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon lay the pouch on the table and unbuttoned the opening. Vittoria stood by. Rummaging through a tray of archivist tools, Langdon found the felt-pad pincers archivists called finger cymbals - oversized tweezers with flattened disks on each arm. As his excitement mounted, Langdon feared at any moment he might awake back in Cambridge with a pile of test papers to grade. Inhaling deeply, he opened the bag. Fingers trembling in their cotton gloves, he reached in with his tongs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax,\" Vittoria said. \"It\u0027s paper, not plutonium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon slid the tongs around the stack of documents inside and was careful to apply even pressure. Then, rather than pulling out the documents, he held them in place while he slid off the bag - an archivist\u0027s procedure for minimizing torque on the artifact. Not until the bag was removed and Langdon had turned on the exam darklight beneath the table did he begin breathing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria looked like a specter now, lit from below by the lamp beneath the glass. \"Small sheets,\" she said, her voice reverent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon nodded. The stack of folios before them looked like loose pages from a small paperback novel. Langdon could see that the top sheet was an ornate pen and ink cover sheet with the title, the date, and Galileo\u0027s name in his own hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that instant, Langdon forgot the cramped quarters, forgot his exhaustion, forgot the horrifying situation that had brought him here. He simply stared in wonder. Close encounters with history always left Langdon numbed with reverence... like seeing the brushstrokes on the Mona Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muted, yellow papyrus left no doubt in Langdon\u0027s mind as to its age and authenticity, but excluding the inevitable fading, the document was in superb condition. Slight bleaching of the pigment. Minor sundering and cohesion of the papyrus. But all in all... in damn fine condition. He studied the ornate hand etching of the cover, his vision blurring in the lack of humidity. Vittoria was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hand me a spatula, please.\" Langdon motioned beside Vittoria to a tray filled with stainless-steel archival tools. She handed it to him. Langdon took the tool in his hand. It was a good one. He ran his fingers across the face to remove any static charge and then, ever so carefully, slid the blade beneath the cover. Then, lifting the spatula, he turned over the cover sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first page was written in longhand, the tiny, stylized calligraphy almost impossible to read. Langdon immediately noticed that there were no diagrams or numbers on the page. It was an essay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heliocentricity,\" Vittoria said, translating the heading on folio one. She scanned the text. \"Looks like Galileo renouncing the geocentric model once and for all. Ancient Italian, though, so no promises on the translation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it,\" Langdon said. \"We\u0027re looking for math. The pure language.\" He used the spatula tool to flip the next page. Another essay. No math or diagrams. Langdon\u0027s hands began to sweat inside his gloves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Movement of the Planets,\" Vittoria said, translating the title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon frowned. On any other day, he would have been fascinated to read it; incredibly NASA\u0027s current model of planetary orbits, observed through high-powered telescopes, was supposedly almost identical to Galileo\u0027s original predictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No math,\" Vittoria said. \"He\u0027s talking about retrograde motions and elliptical orbits or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElliptical orbits. Langdon recalled that much of Galileo\u0027s legal trouble had begun when he described planetary motion as elliptical. The Vatican exalted the perfection of the circle and insisted heavenly motion must be only circular. Galileo\u0027s Illuminati, however, saw perfection in the ellipse as well, revering the mathematical duality of its twin foci. The Illuminati\u0027s ellipse was prominent even today in modern Masonic tracing boards and footing inlays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next,\" Vittoria said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon flipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lunar phases and tidal motion,\" she said. \"No numbers. No diagrams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon flipped again. Nothing. He kept flipping through a dozen or so pages. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought this guy was a mathematician,\" Vittoria said. \"This is all text.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt the air in his lungs beginning to thin. His hopes were thinning too. The pile was waning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing here,\" Vittoria said. \"No math. A few dates, a few standard figures, but nothing that looks like it could be a clue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon flipped over the last folio and sighed. It, too, was an essay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Short book,\" Vittoria said, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merda, as we say in Rome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit is right, Langdon thought. His reflection in the glass seemed mocking, like the image staring back at him this morning from his bay window. An aging ghost. \"There\u0027s got to be something,\" he said, the hoarse desperation in his voice surprising him. \"The segno is here somewhere. I know it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you were wrong about DIII?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon turned and stared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she agreed, \"DIII makes perfect sense. But maybe the clue isn\u0027t mathematical?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lingua pura. What else would it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Art?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except there are no diagrams or pictures in the book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I know is that lingua pura refers to something other than Italian. Math just seems logical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon refused to accept defeat so quickly. \"The numbers must be written longhand. The math must be in words rather than equations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll take some time to read all the pages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time\u0027s something we don\u0027t have. We\u0027ll have to split the work.\" Langdon flipped the stack back over to the beginning. \"I know enough Italian to spot numbers.\" Using his spatula, he cut the stack like a deck of cards and lay the first half-dozen pages in front of Vittoria. \"It\u0027s in here somewhere. I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria reached down and flipped her first page by hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spatula!\" Langdon said, grabbing her an extra tool from the tray. \"Use the spatula.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m wearing gloves,\" she grumbled. \"How much damage could I cause?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just use it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria picked up the spatula. \"You feeling what I\u0027m feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Short of breath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon was definitely starting to feel it too. The air was thinning faster than he had imagined. He knew they had to hurry. Archival conundrums were nothing new for him, but usually he had more than a few minutes to work them out. Without another word, Langdon bowed his head and began translating the first page in his stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShow yourself, damn it! Show yourself!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e53\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere beneath Rome the dark figure prowled down a stone ramp into the underground tunnel. The ancient passageway was lit only by torches, making the air hot and thick. Up ahead the frightened voices of grown men called out in vain, echoing in the cramped spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he rounded the corner he saw them, exactly as he had left them - four old men, terrified, sealed behind rusted iron bars in a stone cubicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Qui etes-vous?\" one of the men demanded in French. \"What do you want with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hilfe!\" another said in German. \"Let us go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you aware who we are?\" one asked in English, his accent Spanish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silence,\" the raspy voice commanded. There was a finality about the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth prisoner, an Italian, quiet and thoughtful, looked into the inky void of his captor\u0027s eyes and swore he saw hell itself. God help us, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe killer checked his watch and then returned his gaze to the prisoners. \"Now then,\" he said. \"Who will be first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e54\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside Archive Vault 10 Robert Langdon recited Italian numbers as he scanned the calligraphy before him. Mille... centi... uno, duo, tre... cincuanta. I need a numerical reference! Anything, damnit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached the end of his current folio, he lifted the spatula to flip the page. As he aligned the blade with the next page, he fumbled, having difficulty holding the tool steady. Minutes later, he looked down and realized he had abandoned his spatula and was turning pages by hand. Oops, he thought, feeling vaguely criminal. The lack of oxygen was affecting his inhibitions. Looks like I\u0027ll burn in archivist\u0027s hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About damn time,\" Vittoria choked when she saw Langdon turning pages by hand. She dropped her spatula and followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any luck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria shook her head. \"Nothing that looks purely mathematical. I\u0027m skimming... but none of this reads like a clue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon continued translating his folios with increasing difficulty. His Italian skills were rocky at best, and the tiny penmanship and archaic language was making it slow going. Vittoria reached the end of her stack before Langdon and looked disheartened as she flipped the pages back over. She hunkered down for another more intense inspection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Langdon finished his final page, he cursed under his breath and looked over at Vittoria. She was scowling, squinting at something on one of her folios. \"What is it?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria did not look up. \"Did you have any footnotes on your pages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that I noticed. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This page has a footnote. It\u0027s obscured in a crease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon tried to see what she was looking at, but all he could make out was the page number in the upper right-hand corner of the sheet. Folio 5. It took a moment for the coincidence to register, and even when it did the connection seemed vague. Folio Five. Five, Pythagoras, pentagrams, Illuminati. Langdon wondered if the Illuminati would have chosen page five on which to hide their clue. Through the reddish fog surrounding them, Langdon sensed a tiny ray of hope. \"Is the footnote mathematical?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria shook her head. \"Text. One line. Very small printing. Almost illegible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hopes faded. \"It\u0027s supposed to be math. Lingua pura.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know.\" She hesitated. \"I think you\u0027ll want to hear this, though.\" Langdon sensed excitement in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquinting at the folio, Vittoria read the line. \"The path of light is laid, the sacred test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words were nothing like what Langdon had imagined. \"I\u0027m sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria repeated the line. \"The path of light is laid, the sacred test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Path of light?\" Langdon felt his posture straightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what it says. Path of light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the words sank in, Langdon felt his delirium pierced by an instant of clarity. The path of light is laid, the sacred test. He had no idea how it helped them, but the line was as direct a reference to the Path of Illumination as he could imagine. Path of light. Sacred test. His head felt like an engine revving on bad fuel. \"Are you sure of the translation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria hesitated. \"Actually...\" She glanced over at him with a strange look. \"It\u0027s not technically a translation. The line is written in English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant, Langdon thought the acoustics in the chamber had affected his hearing. \"English?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria pushed the document over to him, and Langdon read the minuscule printing at the bottom of the page. \"The path of light is laid, the sacred test. English? What is English doing in an Italian book?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria shrugged. She too was looking tipsy. \"Maybe English is what they meant by the lingua pura? It\u0027s considered the international language of science. It\u0027s all we speak at CERN.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this was in the 1600s,\" Langdon argued. \"Nobody spoke English in Italy, not even - \" He stopped short, realizing what he was about to say. \"Not even... the clergy.\" Langdon\u0027s academic mind hummed in high gear. \"In the 1600s,\" he said, talking faster now, \"English was one language the Vatican had not yet embraced. They dealt in Italian, Latin, German, even Spanish and French, but English was totally foreign inside the Vatican. They considered English a polluted, free-thinkers language for profane men like Chaucer and Shakespeare.\" Langdon flashed suddenly on the Illuminati brands of Earth, Air, Fire, Water. The legend that the brands were in English now made a bizarre kind of sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re saying maybe Galileo considered English la lingua pura because it was the one language the Vatican did not control?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Or maybe by putting the clue in English, Galileo was subtly restricting the readership away from the Vatican.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s not even a clue,\" Vittoria argued. \"The path of light is laid, the sacred test? What the hell does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s right, Langdon thought. The line didn\u0027t help in any way. But as he spoke the phrase again in his mind, a strange fact hit him. Now that\u0027s odd, he thought. What are the chances of that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to get out of here,\" Vittoria said, sounding hoarse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon wasn\u0027t listening. The path of light is laid, the sacred test. \"It\u0027s a damn line of iambic pentameter,\" he said suddenly, counting the syllables again. \"Five couplets of alternating stressed and unstressed syllables.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria looked lost. \"Iambic who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant Langdon was back at Phillips Exeter Academy sitting in a Saturday morning English class. Hell on earth. The school baseball star, Peter Greer, was having trouble remembering the number of couplets necessary for a line of Shakespearean iambic pentameter. Their professor, an animated schoolmaster named Bissell, leapt onto the table and bellowed, \"Penta-meter, Greer! Think of home plate! A penta-gon! Five sides! Penta! Penta! Penta! Jeeeesh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive couplets, Langdon thought. Each couplet, by definition, having two syllables. He could not believe in his entire career he had never made the connection. Iambic pentameter was a symmetrical meter based on the sacred Illuminati numbers of 5 and 2!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re reaching! Langdon told himself, trying to push it from his mind. A meaningless coincidence! But the thought stuck. Five... for Pythagoras and the pentagram. Two... for the duality of all things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, another realization sent a numbing sensation down his legs. Iambic pentameter, on account of its simplicity, was often called \"pure verse\" or \"pure meter.\" La lingua pura? Could this have been the pure language the Illuminati had been referring to? The path of light is laid, the sacred test...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh oh,\" Vittoria said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon wheeled to see her rotating the folio upside down. He felt a knot in his gut. Not again. \"There\u0027s no way that line is an ambigram!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not an ambigram... but it\u0027s...\" She kept turning the document, 90 degrees at every turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria looked up. \"It\u0027s not the only line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s another?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a different line on every margin. Top, bottom, left, and right. I think it\u0027s a poem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four lines?\" Langdon bristled with excitement. Galileo was a poet? \"Let me see!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria did not relinquish the page. She kept turning the page in quarter turns. \"I didn\u0027t see the lines before because they\u0027re on the edges.\" She cocked her head over the last line. \"Huh. You know what? Galileo didn\u0027t even write this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The poem is signed John Milton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John Milton?\" The influential English poet who wrote Paradise Lost was a contemporary of Galileo\u0027s and a savant who conspiracy buffs put at the top of their list of Illuminati suspects. Milton\u0027s alleged affiliation with Galileo\u0027s Illuminati was one legend Langdon suspected was true. Not only had Milton made a well-documented 1638 pilgrimage to Rome to \"commune with enlightened men,\" but he had held meetings with Galileo during the scientist\u0027s house arrest, meetings portrayed in many Renaissance paintings, including Annibale Gatti\u0027s famous Galileo and Milton, which hung even now in the IMSS Museum in Florence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milton knew Galileo, didn\u0027t he?\" Vittoria said, finally pushing the folio over to Langdon. \"Maybe he wrote the poem as a favor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon clenched his teeth as he took the sheathed document. Leaving it flat on the table, he read the line at the top. Then he rotated the page 90 degrees, reading the line in the right margin. Another twist, and he read the bottom. Another twist, the left. A final twist completed the circle. There were four lines in all. The first line Vittoria had found was actually the third line of the poem. Utterly agape, he read the four lines again, clockwise in sequence: top, right, bottom, left. When he was done, he exhaled. There was no doubt in his mind. \"You found it, Ms. Vetra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled tightly. \"Good, now can we get the hell out of here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to copy these lines down. I need to find a pencil and paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria shook her head. \"Forget it, professor. No time to play scribe. Mickey\u0027s ticking.\" She took the page from him and headed for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon stood up. \"You can\u0027t take that outside! It\u0027s a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Vittoria was already gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/angels-demons-robert-langdon-1/page-16.html","bookId":2228,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:23 PM"}
