Most of the zombies were women. In the fray, she hadn’t even noticed. Most were wearing neat little matching outfits and expensive shoes. Other zombies were the waiters and kitchen staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant maids and janitors could still be around. Walking around, studying the bodies, she identified the front desk receptionist and a doorman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shouldn’t be too many left,” Mike was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, these are mostly brunch guests. There was a meeting here during the first days,” Katie said. “And the lobby and kitchen crew. The maids and the janitors are probably around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike looked around, truly seeing the zombies for the first time and what they were wearing. “Oh. Yeah. We killed two janitors in that room and a maid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But how many were on shift?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni nodded. “I worked in a hotel. There should be a work schedule up at the front desk!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started heading out the door and Mike immediately motioned Ned and Ashley to follow. “Stay with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley nodded, still looking pale from the battle and Ned swaggered with more confidence than he should have considering the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie sighed and looked around. “I’m thinking that the maids may have barricaded themselves into bedrooms like that one zombie that took a header out of the window when we first arrived.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis stood nearby looking at his slimed up jacket and tossed it away with disgust. “Which means every room we enter could be full of really hungry zombies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing about this is easy,” Roger said, and kicked a pink Ferragamo high heel across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just gotta find them and shoot them in the head,” Shane said from where he was straddling a chair and looking bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unless they eat your ass first,” Felix grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike patted Felix on the back. “The trick is to shoot them in the head before they get that chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill and Curtis entered the room, followed by a guy named Davey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all three looked impressed with the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Been busy, I see,” Bill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing we can\u0027t handle,” Shane retorted. “Despite the lesbos, fatsos, and old people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone chose to ignore him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni ran back in, waving a clipboard. “Okay, I got the roster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe handed it automatically to Katie though Mike had been reaching for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, gimme a second…” Katie looked around, counting the kitchen staff and the wait staff. She looked at the list. “All the kitchen people are accounted for and so is the wait staff. Both front desk people are here as is the doorman. We are missing four maids…” She flipped a page and studied it for a moment. “And two plumbers. They were called in to look at the showers on the sixth floor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So the sixth floor is a potential hotspot,” Mike said thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the maids could be anywhere,” Travis said with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six zombies,” Katie said. “And the manager of the hotel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not so many compared to this,” Bill pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but they could be anywhere, upstairs, in closets, under the beds-anywhere,” Travis answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stood in a circle, pondering this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni looked around, then up at Katie. “Well, it can’t be that hard, can it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie arched an eyebrow at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni smiled at her. “I mean, what could go wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, Ashley looked pale and a little unsure on her feet. Putting her head down, she took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatarina looked toward Nerit and said, “Can I tag along with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie still felt unsteady and a little nauseous, but there was so much to do. Travis gave her a weak smile and she reached out to him. He took her hand and squeezed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We stand here any longer and we’re going to end up freaking ourselves out and giving up,” Mike said after a beat. “We survived this. We survived all that shit that went down the first days. We’ll survive this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie nodded her head, as did the others. Mike was right. They had to keep going. Standing here freaking themselves out was doing none of them a bit of good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, let’s get going and get this done. What more can go wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike said with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then that Ashley looked up, growled, and bit into Mike’s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. What Should Have Been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s not supposed to die, was Jenni\u0027s first thought. \u0027s the black hero of this tale. He\u0027s supposed to survive, isn\u0027t he? At least until the end…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mike was struggling, his throat caught in the angry bite of the tiny blond woman. Her bony arms were around him, crushing him as she tore at him. Everyone was frozen in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t real. It couldn\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get her off! Get her off,” Mike gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis grabbed Ashley\u0027s long blond hair and yanked her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood sprayed everywhere, hot and red with life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie moved fast, a hunting knife in her hand. The others were moving too slow, the shock of the attack dulling their reactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing that had been Ashley was now turning toward Travis, chewing the flesh she had torn from Mike’s neck. Hissing, she was about to strike again and Travis tried to duck away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding the knife over her head with both hands, Katie brought it down hard. With a disgusting sound, the knife plunged through the zombie\u0027s check, shattering teeth and wedging into her jaw. They both fell to the ground, the zombie beneath, Katie on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni ran forward, her hand holding her gun, flipping the safety off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie pinned the small zombie to the ground and hacked at its head with her knife. The skull cracked beneath the blade and she kept slamming it down until the thing that had been Ashley shuddered and was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike lay on the ground nearby, shivering violently, his hands pressed to his throat. Blood was bubbling up between his fingers and spreading on the floor around his head like a red halo. Jenni fell to her knees beside him. Feeling impotent to do anything, she laid her gloved hand on his cheek and he looked toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn\u0027t…see…her…” he said, looking regretful and sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I didn\u0027t either,” Jenni answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m sorry, but keep…going…” Mike whispered, and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni drew her hand back. Tears streamed down her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis drew his gun and aimed it at Mike’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do it,” Katie said softly, standing slowly, wiping off her knife on her jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis narrowed his eyes, his hand trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do it before he comes back,” Nerit said sternly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis struggled to pull the trigger. Jenni could see the agony in his eyes. “Can’t,” Travis sighed, beginning to lower the gun. “Someone else-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike’s eyes flashed open and he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood erupted between his eyes and he was truly gone. A delicate little hole, bubbled with blood as Nerit stepped over Mike’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you hesitate again, I will shoot you. I will not lose anyone else because you could not pull the trigger,” she said coldly, and brushed past Travis to stand guard at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn\u0027t right, man. This isn\u0027t right,” Felix exclaimed, falling to his knees beside of Mike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do we do?” Katarina asked softly. Her shock was mirrored in the faces of those around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni looked back at Mike, so peaceful in his final death. “We keep going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill leaned down and grabbed up Mike\u0027s walkie-talkie. “We go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finish this. Easy as that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurtis shook his head and grabbed a tablecloth to cover Mike with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni looked down at Mike and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were supposed to make it to the end. Mike, does this mean this is the end?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Shane was solemn as Curtis laid the white tablecloth over Mike\u0027s still features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Pieces of Hell\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We keep going,” Bill said for emphasis. “We get this job done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could she turn so fast?” Katarina asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie looked up at her, holding the dead woman\u0027s hand. “She was bitten. Looks like one of them got her hand and she yanked it back. It\u0027s not a distinct bite mark, more like a scrape, but it was enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ashley\u0027s been anorexic for years and has all sorts of health issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably took her down fast,” Curtis said softly. “Poor thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you have to kill whoever is bit immediately or we\u0027ll lose more people,” Nerit said in a cold voice. “We can\u0027t be sure how long it will take before they turn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie shivered at her tone and glanced at Travis. His head was down and he obviously knew the comment had been directed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring at the gun in his hand in a strange, almost angry way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s bullshit. What if they don\u0027t change? What if the bite don\u0027t take? We can\u0027t just shoot everyone like that lesbo bitch shot my brother!” Shane\u0027s voice was fierce and he glared at Katie. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fighting-to-survive-as-the-world-dies-2/page-13.html","bookId":2482,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:58:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:58:30 PM"}
