Is he gone?\" I ask hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. \"We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I have to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just put it this way. You\u0027re not leaving the attic until you hear me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefeated, I sit on one of the trunks. \"I\u0027m listening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" She takes a seat on the chair, still left here from the other day. \"I had one sibling,\" she says. \"A sister named Lottie. She was younger than me, smarter than me, prettier than me, with long, slender legs and thick, black hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reynolds looks up at me and continues. \"You see, I was the fat kid with bright red hair, the kid you look at and have to stop yourself from cringing. During summer break from college one year, I brought a boy to my parents\u0027 summer home. I\u0027d lost weight, I wasn\u0027t in my sister\u0027s shadow anymore, and I finally started feeling like I was worth more than I ever thought I deserved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can picture it in my mind. \"So you overcame your fears and fell in love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fell in love, all right, head over heels. His name was Fred.\" Mrs. Reynolds pauses, then sighs. \"He treated me as though I was the most amazing girl he\u0027d ever seen. Well, he did until my sister came to the summer house for a surprise visit.\" She looks directly at me and shrugs. \"I found him kissing her by the docks the morning after she arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hated her, blamed her for stealing my boyfriend. So I packed up, left, and never talked to either one of them again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never talked to your sister again?\" I ask. \"Ever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t even attend their wedding two years later.\" My mouth drops open. \"She married Fred?\" \"You got it. Had four kids, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a call from one of their kids that Lottie died a few years ago. Fred\u0027s in a nursing home with Alzheimer\u0027s. You know what the worst part is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m riveted by her story. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reynolds stands, then pats me on my knee. \"That, my dear, is what you\u0027re going to have to figure out all by yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think Caleb should stay and build the gazebo, don\u0027t you?\" I ask when she starts walking to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave that decision up to you. He won\u0027t go back to jail if it doesn\u0027t work out, I would never let that happen. I just figure he\u0027s a boy who wants to right his wrongs, Margaret. He\u0027s waiting downstairs for your answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks out of the attic. I hear her orthopedic shoes shuffling as she takes each stair. Can I just stay here forever, living with the spiders and cobwebs and antique trunks filled with an old lady\u0027s memories?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know the answer, even as I stand and head down the stairs to face the one person I\u0027ve been dying to avoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s sitting on the couch in the living room, leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees. When he hears me enter the room, he looks up. \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell he\u0027s not happy I have the control. Caleb used to always have the cards and knew which ones to play to get his way. Not this time. I\u0027d love to tell him to leave. That\u0027s his punishment for not loving me back. But I know that would be idiotic, childish, and stupid. Besides, I don\u0027t love Caleb anymore. I don\u0027t even like him. I\u0027m convinced he can\u0027t hurt me anymore, physically or emotionally. \"You can stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and starts to stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. I have two conditions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows raise up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One, you don\u0027t tell anyone about us working together. Two, you don\u0027t talk to me ... I ignore you and you ignore me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think he\u0027s going to argue because his lip curls up and his eyebrows furrow as if he thinks I\u0027m an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then he says, \"Fine. Done deal,\" and heads to the backyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find Mrs. Reynolds in the kitchen, sitting at the table drinking tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told him he could stay,\" I inform her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reynolds gives me a small smile. \"I\u0027m proud of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll get over it,\" she says. \"You ready to plant more bulbs today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull old, worn overalls out of my backpack so I can spare myself from having to wear the muumuu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u0027s back is to me when I walk outside. Good. I take a bag of bulbs and slowly, carefully sit on the grass. With a small shovel in hand, I start digging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t forget, Margaret. Six inches deep,\" Mrs. Reynolds says from behind, leaning over me to inspect my work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it, six inches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And make sure you place the bulbs right-side up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And scatter them. Don\u0027t place them in a pattern or else it looks funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old lady takes a lawn chair and places it right next to me so she can oversee my work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you supervise him?\" I ask, pointing to where Caleb has taken panels of wood and seems to be attempting to put them in some kind of order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s doing just fine. Besides, I don\u0027t know the first thing about building a gazebo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dig three holes, carefully make soft soil pillows for them, then place the bulbs into the holes and scoot myself down to plant more. After a while Mrs. Reynolds falls asleep in the chair. She usually does this at least once a day, and when I tell her she dozed off for an hour, she totally denies it. I\u0027m surprised she can sleep with all the hammering Caleb\u0027s doing, but the lady hears, as she more often than not admits, like the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance up at Caleb. He\u0027s a fast worker, already starting to nail planks together as if he builds gazebos every day. His shirt is soaking wet from sweat in his armpits, chest, and back. And it obviously doesn\u0027t bother him that one of my conditions is that we ignore each other. He does an incredible job of ignoring me. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s even glanced in my direction once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now he stops hammering, his back still to me when he yells, \"Would you stop staring at me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou ignore me, and I\u0027ll ignore you. Maggie, like every X other girl in my life, is trying to control me. I\u0027m sick of the games, I\u0027m sick of feeling like a jerk. And most of all I\u0027m sick of people gawking at me because I went to jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know she\u0027s staring at me, I can feel her eyes on me like little pin pricks poking into my back. Out of frustration, I pound the next nail into the two-by-four harder than I normally would and whack my forefinger with the hammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare at Maggie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl is sitting on the ground wearing torn and stained overalls. \"I ... I wasn\u0027t staring at you,\" she stutters. \"The hell you weren\u0027t,\" I bark back. I hold my arms out wide. \"You want to gawk at the ex-con, you got it. Just answer one thing for me, will ya? You like it when people stare at you when you limp around like you\u0027re gonna topple over any second?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie sucks in a breath, then covers her nose and mouth with her hand as she hobbles inside the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy finger is throbbing, my head is pounding, and I insulted a crippled girl--a girl I\u0027m responsible for crippling. I should just go to hell right now because the deal with the devil is probably signed anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reynolds has no clue what\u0027s happening, her head is slumped in the chair and she\u0027s snoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI throw down the hammer and go into the house to find Maggie. I hear sniffling sounds coming from the kitchen. Maggie is standing at the counter, taking vegetables out of the refrigerator. She pulls out a cutting board and starts cutting them with a huge butcher knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I say. \"I shouldn\u0027t have said that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously it\u0027s not or you wouldn\u0027t be crying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not crying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean my hip against the counter. \"There\u0027s tears running down your face.\" Plain as day I can see \u0027em.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picks up an onion and holds it out to me. \"My eyes tear when I cut onions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fists clench together, because I can\u0027t shake her and make her yell at me. This time I deserve to be yelled at. \"Say something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of responding, she chops the onion in two. I imagine she\u0027s pretending that onion is my head ... or some other part of my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, have it your way,\" I say, then leave her. If she wants to live in silence, that\u0027s her choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clench my teeth so much they hurt, and the rest of the afternoon I work outside on the gazebo. It feels good to create something useful, something to finally make someone proud of me for a change. Because the rest of my life I\u0027ve totally fucked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie abandoned her post in the yard. She hasn\u0027t been outside since I went off on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt seven I inform a waking Mrs. Reynolds I\u0027m leaving for the day and head for the bus stop. Maggie\u0027s not far behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m standing on the corner of Jarvis and Lake Streets, backpack flung over my shoulder, when a car screeches beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing slumming on this side of town, rich boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man. It\u0027s Vic Medonia. And some other guys on the Fremont High wrestling team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of your fucking business,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic laughs, bitterness dripping off the cackling sound. \"Your friends in jail taught you how to stand on the street corner and pimp yourself? How much you charging for that used booty of yours, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other guys in the car laugh, then Vic gets out. He looks to my right and says, \"Is this your new girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to see Maggie not far away, limping toward us as she heads for the bus stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, go back to the house,\" I warn her. I\u0027ve seen enough fights to know that Vic is looking for one. Hoping to redirect Vic, I say, \"This is between you and me, man. Leave her out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic laughs, the high pitched sound making my skin crawl. \"Check her out, guys. Jeez, Becker, you really are scraping the bottom of the barrel. Does it turn you on when she struts around like a retard like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop my backpack and charge him. We both land on the ground, but one of his friends grabs me from behind and pins my hands back. Before I can free my arms, Vic clocks me right on the jaw and the ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I know what\u0027s happening, Maggie is in the middle of us, swinging her book bag and hitting Vic. The chick has more in her than she lets on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough all the commotion, I break free and push the prick who\u0027d been holding me, then I grab Maggie and act as her shield before she gets herself killed. \"Run,\" I order her as I tackle one of the guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m punching and grasping at shirt collars as much as I can in a three-against-one fight. Odds are against me and it\u0027s not a pretty sight. All mayhem freezes when I hear a siren, attached to a cruiser with red and blue lights flashing. An officer flies out of the car and has us kneel on the ground with our hands over our heads. \"What\u0027s going on here, boys?\" I don\u0027t see Maggie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Vic says. \"We were just playing around. Right, Becker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare straight at Vic and say, \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t look like nothing to me.\" The cop holds his hand out to me, palm up. \"Let me see some ID.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince my driver\u0027s license was revoked, I only have my community service ID tag from the DOC. I\u0027m not about to pull it out and have him call Damon. I\u0027ll be locked up again before you can say \"hit-and-run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing in Hampton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Visiting a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy does a great cop stance from the movies, with his feet apart and his hands on his hips positioned right above his gun belt. \"Let me give you a piece of advice. We don\u0027t take kindly to strangers coming into our town and causing trouble.\" He turns to Vic. \"I suggest you meet your friend on his turf or I\u0027ll have to get your parents involved. Got it?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-16.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
