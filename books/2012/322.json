Gods below, against all of them.’ He continued staring into the southwest. ‘There you have it, High Mage. Fiddler and my sister. Our two weapons.’ When he looked back he saw Quick Ben studying him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Mage said, ‘The ascended Bridgeburners hold the gates of death.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Except for Hedge. Whiskeyjack sent Hedge back – to Fiddler.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Did he now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Remember Pale, Ganoes Paran?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As much of it as I could, which wasn’t much.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Right – you weren’t there yet, not when we got together on a hill outside the city, to shake things down one more time. Or, if you were around, Sorry was sticking a dagger in your back about then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What about it, Quick?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s just … we were all there. Trying to make sense of things. And now I’ve got this feeling … we’re all going to meet again. To bring it all to an end.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘One way or another.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How do you gauge our chances, High Mage?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Miserable.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And our weapons?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘With me vouching for Fiddler, and you for your sister,’ he said, with a wry grin, ‘the best we could hope for, I suppose.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And here I have two more – the infamous Kalam and Quick Ben. You know, if I wasn’t such a realist, I’d be feeling confident right now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scowl replaced the grin. ‘Did you really have to put it quite that way, High Fist?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt her eyes on him as he swung on to the horse. Settling in the saddle, gathering the reins, he squinted at the broad, terraced valley stretching away to his right. Rich lands, he mused. Then he glanced across at her. ‘What?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinala shook her head. ‘He’s going to get you killed for real one of these days. You know that, don’t you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalam snorted. ‘Whatever you think you’ve seen, Minala, you’ll just have to take my word: you really have no idea what we’ve survived, me and Quick.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fine. Impress me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Probably not possible, but I’ll try anyway. Jaghut and Crimson Guard Avowed in Mott Wood. Tiste Andii assassin-mages and highborn demons in Darujhistan. More Claw than you could count.’ Looking across at her, seeing her flat expression, he sighed. ‘And we ain’t so bad on our own, neither. Icarium, the Pannion Domin, K’Chain Nah’ruk and Soletaken dragons – Quick’s faced down them all. As for me … if I could raise up every person and every demon and every whatever I’ve personally killed, I’d have an army big enough to drown the Forkrul Assail in piss, never mind a knockdown fight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued staring at him, and then she said, inflectionless, ‘You are both insufferable.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Some nerve,’ he rumbled, ‘after all that attention I just gave you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn all sides, Paran’s Host was forming up, preparing to march – they had a third of a day’s light left and it seemed the High Fist wasn’t much interested in resting his troops. In a hurry. That’s always bad. Decent-looking soldiers, though. Lots of North Genabackan and Malazan mainlanders. And then there’s those Seven Cities horse-warriors – tribals. Tribals always scared me .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinala took a drink from her waterskin and then spoke again. ‘Were all you Bridgeburners the same? Arrogant, self-important, narcissistic?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, and we earned every strut.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Rubbish.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In fact,’ Kalam went on, ignoring her comment, ‘it’s probably why they decided to wipe us out. Every officer they threw at us couldn’t hold up. We were a company run by the sergeants, Whiskeyjack first and foremost, but even then the sergeants voted on stuff, the orders they’d give to the captains and lieutenants, the orders to go down to the rest of us. As you might imagine, the high command didn’t much like that. Oh, we might listen to a few, the ones we knew would do right by us – Dassem, Dujek, the ones we knew were worth their salt. But the rest? Not a chance.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Meaning you were ungovernable.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Meaning we were actually thinking of taking down the Empress. Aye, looking on it that way, Laseen had to wipe us out. She had no choice, and if it didn’t sit well with her – having to kill off her toughest soldiers – well, I suppose we gave her few options.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-322.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
