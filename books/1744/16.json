Undoubtedly, he said nothing to Tritt; that would have embarrassed and frightened the poor right-ling and Odeen always watched over Tritt with loving care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Odeen didn\u0027t have to say anything. He needed only to fill in the gaps in Tritt\u0027s clumsy plan and make it work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua was under no illusions now. She would have detected the taste of the food-ball; noticed its extraordinary tang; caught the way in which it began to fill her while giving her no sensations of fullness - had it not been that Odeen had occupied her with talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a conspiracy between the two of them, whether Tritt was consciously part of it or not. How could she have believed that Odeen was suddenly a careful, painstaking teacher? How could she have failed to see the ulterior motive? Their concern for her was their concern for the completion of the new triad, and that in itself was an indication of how little they thought of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused long enough to feel her own weariness and she worked herself into a crevice in the rock that would shield her from the thin, cold wind. Two of the seven stars were in her field of vision and she watched them absently, occupying her outer senses in trivia so that she might concentrate the more in internal thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was disillusioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Betrayed,\" she muttered to herself. \"Betrayed!\" Could they see no further than themselves? That Tritt would be willing to see all destroyed if he were but secure in his babies was to be taken for granted. But he was a creature of instinct. What of Odeen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen reasoned, and did that mean that for the purpose of exercising his reason, he would sacrifice all else? Was everything produced by reason its own excuse for being - at any cost? Because Estwald had devised the Positron Pump, did it have to be used in order that the whole world, Hard and Soft alike, be placed at its mercy, and at the mercy of the people of the other Universe? What if the other people stopped and if the world was left without a Positron Pump and with a dangerously cooled Sun?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, they wouldn\u0027t stop, those other people; for they had been persuaded to start and they would be persuaded to keep going until they were destroyed - and then they would be needed no longer by the Rationals, Hard or Soft - just as she, Dua, would have to pass on (be destroyed) now that she was needed no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and the other people, both being betrayed. Almost without being aware of it, she was cushioning deeper and deeper into the rock. She buried herself, out of sight of the stars, out of touch with the wind, unaware of the world. She was pure thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Estwald whom she hated. He was the personification of all that was selfish and hard. He had devised the Positron Pump and would destroy a whole world of perhaps tens of thousands without conscience. He was so withdrawn that he never made his appearance and so powerful that even the other Hard Ones seemed afraid of him. Well, then, she would fight him. She would stop him. The people of the other Universe had helped set up the Positron Pump through communications of some sort. Odeen had mentioned those. Where would such communications be kept? What would they be like? How could they be used for further communication?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was remarkable how clearly she could think. Remarkable. There was fierce enjoyment in this, that she would use reason to overcome the cruel reasoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wouldn\u0027t be able to stop her, for she could go where no Hard One could go, where no Rational or Parental could - and where no other Emotional would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe might be caught eventually, but at the moment she didn\u0027t care. She was going to fight to have her way - at any price - at any price - though to do it meant she would have to go through rock, live in rock, skirt the Hard-caverns, steal food from their stored energy batteries when she had to, flock with the other Emotionals and feed on Sunlight when she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the end she would teach them all a lesson and after that they could do as they wished. She would even be ready to pass on then - but only then -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5b\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen was present when the new baby-Emotional was born, perfect in every way, but he had not been able to feel enthusiasm over it. Even Tritt, who cared for it perfectly, as a Parental must, seemed subdued in his ecstasies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long time had passed and it was as though Dua had vanished. She had not passed on. A Soft One could not pass on except when the whole triad did; but she was not with them, either. It was as though she had passed on, without passing on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen had seen her once, only once, not very long after her wild fight on the news that she had initiated the new baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had passed a cluster of Emotionals, sunning themselves, when he was moving over the surface on some foolish notion that he might find her. They had tittered at the rare sight of a Rational moving in the vicinity of an Emotional cluster and had thinned in mass-provocation, with no thought among the foolish lot of them but to advertise the fact that they were Emotionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen felt only contempt for them and there was no answering stir along his own smooth curves at all. He thought of Dua instead and of how different she was from all of them. Dua never thinned for any reason other than her own inner needs. She had never tried to attract anyone and was the more attractive for that. If she could have brought herself to join the flock of empty-heads she would be easily recognized (he felt sure) by the fact that she alone would not thin, but would probably thicken, precisely because the others thinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as he thought that, Odeen scanned the sunning Emotionals and noted that one indeed had not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and then hastened toward her, oblivious to the Emotionals in his way, oblivious to their wild screeching as they flicked smokily out of his path and chattered desperately in their attempts to avoid coalescing one with the other - at least not in the open, and with a Rational watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Dua. She did not try to leave. She kept her ground and said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dua,\" he said, humbly, \"aren\u0027t you coming home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no home, Odeen,\" she said. Not angrily, not in hate - and all the more dreadfully for that reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you blame Tritt for what he did, Dua? You know the poor fellow can\u0027t reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can, Odeen. And you occupied my mind while he arranged to feed my body, didn\u0027t you? Your reason told you that I was much more likely to be trapped by you than by him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dua, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, what? Didn\u0027t you make a big show of teaching me, of educating me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did, but it wasn\u0027t a show, it was real. And it was not because of what Tritt had done. I didn\u0027t know what Tritt had done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe that\" She flowed away without haste. He followed after. They were alone now, the Sun shining redly down upon them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to him. \"Let me ask you one question, Odeen? Why did you want to teach me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen said, \"Because I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- wanted to. Because I enjoy teaching and because I would rather teach than do anything else - but learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And melt, of course . . . Never mind,\" she added to ward him off. \"Don\u0027t explain that you are talking of reason and not of instinct If you really mean what you say about enjoying teaching; if I can really ever believe what you say; then perhaps you can understand something I\u0027m going to tell you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been learning a great deal since I left you, Odeen. Never mind how. I have. There\u0027s no Emotional left in me at all, except physiologically. Inside, where it counts, I\u0027m all Rational, except that I hope I have more feeling for others than Rationals have. And one thing I\u0027ve learned is what we really are, Odeen; you and I and Tritt and all the other triads on this planet; what we really are and always were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\" asked Odeen. He was prepared to listen for as long as might be necessary, and as quietly, if only she would come back with him when she had said her say. He would perform any penance, do anything that might be required. Only she must come back - and something dim and dark inside him knew that she had to come back voluntarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What we are? Why, nothing, really, Odeen,\" she said lightly, almost laughing, \"Isn\u0027t that strange? The Hard Ones are the only living species on the face of the world. Haven\u0027t they taught you that? There is only one species because you and I, the Soft Ones, are not really alive. We\u0027re machines, Odeen. We must be because only the Hard Ones are alive. Haven\u0027t they taught you that, Odeen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Dua, that\u0027s nonsense,\" said Odeen, nonplused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua\u0027s voice grew harsher. \"Machines, Odeen! Made by the Hard Ones! Destroyed by the Hard Ones! They are alive, the Hard Ones. Only they. They don\u0027t talk about it much. They don\u0027t have to. They all know it. But I\u0027ve learned to think, Odeen, and I\u0027ve worked it out from the small clues I\u0027ve had. They live tremendously long lives, but die eventually. They no longer give birth; the Sun yields too little energy for that. And since they die very infrequently, but don\u0027t give birth at all, their numbers are very slowly declining. And there are no young ones to provide new blood and new thoughts, so the old, long-lived Hard Ones get terribly bored. So what do you suppose they do, Odeen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" There was a kind of fascination about this. A repulsive fascination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They manufacture mechanical children, whom they can teach. You said it yourself, Odeen. You would rather teach than do anything else but learn - and melt, of course. The Rationals are made in the mental image of the Hard Ones, and the Hard Ones don\u0027t melt, and learning is terribly complex for them since they already know so much. What is left for them but the fun of teaching. Rationals were created for no purpose but to be taught. Emotionals and Parentals were created because they were necessary for the self-perpetuating machinery that made new Rationals. And new Rationals were needed constantly because the old ones were used up, were taught all they could be taught. And when old Rationals had absorbed what they could, they were destroyed and were taught, in advance, to call the destruction process \"passing on\" to spare their feelings. And of course, Emotionals and Parentals passed on with them. As long as they had helped form a new triad there was no further use for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s all wrong, Dua,\" Odeen managed to say. He had no arguments to pose against her nightmare scheme, but he knew with a certainty past argument that she was wrong. (Or did a little pang of doubt deep inside suggest that the certainty might have been implanted in him, to begin with? - No, surely no, for then would not Dua be certain with an implanted certainty, too, that this was wrong? - Or was she an imperfect Emotional without the proper implantations and without -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Oh, what was he thinking. He was as crazy as she was.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua said, \"You look upset, Odeen. Are you sure I\u0027m all wrong? Of course, now they have the Positron Pump and they now have all the energy they need, or will have. Soon they will be giving birth again. Maybe they are doing so already. And they won\u0027t need any Soft-One machines at all, and we will all be destroyed; I beg pardon, we will all pass on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Dua,\" said Odeen, strenuously, as much to himself as to her. \"I don\u0027t know how you got those notions, but the Hard Ones aren\u0027t like that. We are not destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t lie to yourself, Odeen. They are like that. They are prepared to destroy a whole world of other-beings for their benefit; a whole Universe if they have to. Would they stop at destroying a few Soft Ones for their comfort? - \u0026amp;#8226; But they made one mistake. Somehow the machinery went wrong and a Rational mind got into an Emotional body. I\u0027m a Left-Em, do you know that? They called me that when I was a child, and they were right. I can reason like a Rational and I can feel like an Emotional. And I will fight the Hard Ones with that combination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen felt wild. Dua must surely be mad, yet he dared not say so. He had to cajole her somehow and bring her back. He said with strenuous sincerity, \"Dua, we\u0027re not destroyed when we pass on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? What does happen then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I don\u0027t know. I think we enter another world, a better and happier world, and become like - like - well, much better than we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua laughed. \"Where did you hear that? Did the Hard Ones tell you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Dua. I\u0027m sure that this must be so out of my own thoughts. I\u0027ve been thinking a great deal about it since you left\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua said, \"Then think less and you\u0027ll be less foolish. Poor Odeen! Good-by.\" She flowed away once more, thinly. There was an air of weariness about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen called out, \"But wait, Dua. Surely you want to see your new baby-mid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cried out. \"When will you come home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he followed no more, but looked after her in deepest misery as she dwindled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not tell Tritt he had seen Dua. What was the use? Nor did he see her again. He began haunting the favored sunning-sites of the Emotionals in the region; doing so even though occasional Parentals emerged to watch him in stupid suspicion (Tritt was a mental giant compared to most Parentals).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lack of her hurt more with each passing day. And with each passing day, he realized that there was a gathering fright inside himself over her absence. He didn\u0027t know why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came back to home-cavern one day to find Losten waiting for him. Losten was standing there, grave and polite while Tritt was showing him the new baby and striving to keep the handful of mist from touching the Hard One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosten said, \"It is indeed a beauty, Tritt. Derala is its name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Derola,\" corrected Tritt. \"I don\u0027t know when Odeen will be back. He wanders about a lot - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here I am, Losten,\" said Odeen, hastily. \"Tritt, take the baby away; there\u0027s a good fellow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt did so, and Losten turned to Odeen with quite obvious relief, saying, \"You must be very happy to have completed the triad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen tried to answer with some polite inconsequence, but could maintain only a miserable silence. He had recently been developing a kind of comradeship, a vague sense of equality with the Hard Ones, that enabled them to talk together on a level. Somehow Dua\u0027s madness had spoiled it. Odeen knew she was wrong and yet he approached Losten once more as stiffly as in the long-gone days when he thought of himself as a far inferior creature to them, as a - machine?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosten said, \"Have you seen Dua?\" This was a real question, and not politeness. Odeen could tell easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only once, H - \" (He almost said \"Hard-sir\" as though he were a child again, or a Parental.) \"Only once, Losten. She won\u0027t come home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She must come home,\" said Losten, softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how to arrange that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosten regarded him somberly. \"Do you know what she is doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen dared not look at the other. Had he discovered Dua\u0027s wild theories? What would be done about that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a negative sign without speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosten said, \"She is a most unusual Emotional, Odeen. You know that, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" sighed Odeen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you in your way, and Tritt in his. I doubt that any Parental in the world would have had either the courage or the initiative to steal an energy-battery or the perverse ingenuity to put it to use as he did. The three of you make up the most unusual triad of which we have any record.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there are uncomfortable aspects to the triad, too; things we didn\u0027t count on. We wanted you to teach Dua as the mildest and best possible way in which to cajole her into performing her function voluntarily. We did not count on Tritt\u0027s quixotic action at just that moment. Nor, to tell you the truth, did we count on her wild reaction to the fact that the world in the other Universe must be destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ought to have been careful how I answered her questions,\" said Odeen miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t have helped. She was finding out for herself. We didn\u0027t count on that either. Odeen, I am sorry, but I must tell you this - Dua has become a deadly danger; she is trying to stop the Positron Pump.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\"But how can she? She can\u0027t reach it, and even if she could, she lacks the knowledge to do anything about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, but she can reach it.\" Losten hesitated, then said, \"She remains infused in the rock of the world where she is safe from us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took awhile for Odeen to grasp the clear meaning of the words. He said, \"No grown Emotional would -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Dua would never - n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She would. She does. Don\u0027t waste time arguing the point . . . She can penetrate anywhere in the caverns. Nothing is hidden from her. She has studied those communications we have received from the other Universe. We don\u0027t know that of certain knowledge, but there is no other way of explaining what is happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, oh, oh.\" Odeen rocked back and forth, his surface opaque with shame and grief. \"Does Estwald know of all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosten said, grimly, \"Not yet; though he must know someday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what will she do with those communications?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is using them to work out a method for sending some of her own in the other direction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she cannot know how to translate or transmit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is learning both. She knows more about those communications than Estwald himself. She is a frightening phenomenon, an Emotional who can reason and who is out of control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen shivered. Out of control? How machine-like a reference!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"It can\u0027t be that bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can. She has communicated already and I fear she is advising the other creatures to stop their half of the Positron Pump. If they do that before their Sun explodes, we will be helpless at this end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She must be stopped, Odeen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B - But, how? Are you going to blast - \" His voice failed. Dimly, he knew that the Hard One had devices for digging caverns out of the world\u0027s rock; devices scarcely used since the world\u0027s population had begun declining ages ago. Would they locate Dua in the rock and blast it and her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Losten, forcefully. \"We cannot harm Dua.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Estwald might - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Estwald cannot harm her, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s to be done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s you, Odeen. Only you. We\u0027re helpless, so we must depend on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On me? But what can I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about it,\" said Losten, urgently. \"Think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t say more than that,\" said Losten, in apparent agony. \"Think! There is so little time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and left, moving rapidly for a Hard One, moving as though he did not trust himself to stay and perhaps say too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Odeen could \u0027only look after him, dismayed, confused - lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5c\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a great deal for Tritt to do. Babies required much care, but even two young-lefts and two young-rights together did not make up the sum of a single baby-mid - particularly not a mid as perfect as Derola. She had to be exercised and soothed, protected from percolating into whatever she touched, cajoled into condensing and resting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a long time before he saw Odeen again and, actually, he didn\u0027t care. Derola took up all his time. But then he came across Odeen in the corner of his own alcove, iridescent with thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt remembered, suddenly. He said, \"Was Losten angry about Dua?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen came to himself with a start. \"Losten? - Yes, he was angry. Dua is doing great harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She should come home, shouldn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen was staring at Tritt. \"Tritt,\" he said, \"we\u0027re going to have ,to persuade Dua to come home. We must find her first. You can do it. With a new baby, your Parental sensitivity is very high. You can use it to find Dua.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Tritt, shocked. \"It\u0027s used for Derola. It would be wrong to use it for Dua. Besides, if she wants to stay away so long when a baby-mid is longing for her - and she was once a baby-mid herself - maybe we might just learn to do without her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Tritt, don\u0027t you ever want to melt again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the triad is now complete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not all there is to melting.\" Tritt said, \"But where do we have to go to find her? Little Derola needs me. She\u0027s a tiny baby. I don\u0027t want to leave her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Hard Ones will arrange to have Derola taken care of. You and I will go to the Hard-caverns and find Dua.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt thought about that. He didn\u0027t care about Dua. He didn\u0027t even care about Odeen, somehow. There was only Derola. He said, \"Someday. Someday, when Derola is older. Not till then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tritt,\" said Odeen, urgently, \"we must find Dua. Otherwise - otherwise the babies will be taken away from us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By whom?\" said Tritt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the Hard Ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt was silent. There was nothing he could say. He had never heard of such a thing. He could not conceive of such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdeen said, \"Tritt, we must pass on. I know why, now. I\u0027ve been thinking about it ever since Losten -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But never mind that. Dua and you must pass on, too. Now that I know why, you will feel you must and I hope - I think -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Dua will feel she must, too. And we must pass on soon, for Dua is destroying the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt was backing away. \"Don\u0027t look at me like that, Odeen. . . . You\u0027re making me. . . . You\u0027re making me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not making you, Tritt,\" said Odeen, sadly. \"It\u0027s just that I know now and so you must . . . But we must find Dua.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no.\" Tritt was in agony, trying to resist. There was something terribly new about Odeen, and existence was approaching an end inexorably. There would be no Tritt and no baby-mid. Where every other Parental had his baby-mid for a long time, Tritt would have lost his almost at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t fair. Oh, it wasn\u0027t fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTritt panted. \"It\u0027s Dua\u0027s fault. Let her pass on first.\" Odeen said, with deadening calm, \"There\u0027s no other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eway but for all of us - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Tritt knew that was so - that was so - that was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDua felt thin and cold, wispy. Her attempts to rest in the open and absorb Sunlight had ended after Odeen had found her that time. Her feeding at the Hard Ones\u0027 batteries was erratic. She dared not remain too long outside the safety of rock, so she ate in quick gulps, and she never got enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was conscious of hunger, continuously, all the more so since it seemed to tire her to remain in the rock. It was as though she were being punished for all that long time in which she haunted the Sunset and ate so skimpily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it were not for the work she was doing, she could not bear the weariness and hunger. Sometimes she hoped that the Hard Ones would destroy her - but only after she was finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hard Ones were helpless as long as she was in the rock. Sometimes she sensed them outside the rock in the open. They were afraid. Sometimes she thought the fear was for her, but that couldn\u0027t be. How could they be afraid for her; afraid that she would pass on out of sheer lack of food, out of sheer exhaustion. It must be that they, were afraid of her; afraid of a machine that did not work as they had designed it to work; appalled at so great a prodigy; struck helpless with the terror of it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, she avoided them. She always knew where they were, so they could not catch her nor stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could not watch all places always. She thought she could even blank what little perception they had. She swirled out of the rock and studied the recorded duplicates of the communications they had received from the other Universe. They did not know that was what she was after. If they hid them, she would find them in whatever new place. If they destroyed them, it didn\u0027t matter. Duacould remember them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not understand them, at first, but with her stay in the rocks, her senses grew steadily sharper, and she seemed to understand without understanding. Without knowing what the symbols meant, they inspired feelings within her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked out markings and placed them where they would be sent to the other Universe. The markings were F-E-E-R. What that could possibly mean she had no idea, but its shape inspired her with a feeling of fear and she did her best to impress that feeling of fear upon the markings. Perhaps the other creatures, studying the markings, would also feel fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the answers came, Dua could sense excitement in them. She did not always get the answers that were sent Sometimes the Hard Ones found them first. Surely, they must know what she was doing. Still, they couldn\u0027t read the messages, couldn\u0027t even sense the emotions that went along with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she didn\u0027t care. She would not be stopped, till she was done - whatever the Hard Ones found out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for a message that would carry the feeling she wanted. It came: P-U-M-P B-A-D.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt carried the fear and hatred she wanted. She sent it back in extended form - more fear - more hatred -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Now the other people would understand. Now they would stop the Pump. The Hard Ones would have to find some other way, some other source of energy; they must not obtain it through the death of all those thousands of other Universe creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was resting too much, declining into a kind of stupor, within the rock. Desperately she craved food and waited so that she could crawl out. Even more desperately than she wanted the food in the storage battery, she wanted the storage battery to be dead. She wanted to suck the last bit of food out of it and know that no more would come and that her task was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe emerged at last and remained recklessly long, sucking in the contents of one of the batteries. She wanted to withdraw its last, empty it, see that no more was entering - but it was an endless source - endless - endless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stirred and drew away from the battery in disgust The Positron Pumps were still going then. Had her messages not persuaded the other Universe creatures to stop the Pumps? Had they not received them? Had they not sensed their meaning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to try again. She had to make it plain beyond plain. She would include every combination of signals that to her seemed to carry the feeling of danger; every combination that would get across the plea to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperately she began to fuse the symbols into metal; drawing without reserve on the energy she had just sucked out of the battery; drawing on it till it was all gone and she was more weary than ever: PUMP NOT STOP NOT STOP WE NOT STOP PUMP WE NOT HEAR DANGER NOT HEAR NOT HEAR YOU STOP PLEASE STOP YOU STOP SO WE STOP PLEASE YOU STOP DANGER DANGER DANGER DANGER STOP STOP YOU STOP PUMP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all she could. There was nothing left in her but a racking pain. She placed the message where it could be transferred and she did not wait for the Hard Ones to send the message unwittingly. Through an agonizing haze, she manipulated the controls as she had seen them do, finding the energy for it somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe message disappeared and so did the cavern in a purple shimmer of vertigo. She was - passing on - out of sheer - exhaustion. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gods-themselves/page-16.html","bookId":1744,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:25 AM"}
