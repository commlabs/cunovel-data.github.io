He looked down into her furious face. \"You really do love me, don\u0027t you?\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see what that has to do with anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were walking along the hall to the bedroom. Verity simmered down enough to think about what Yarwood had said. \"You know, Jonas, if Preston thinks you tried to kill Elyssa, that means he\u0027s probably innocent himself,\" she said slowly. \"He looked really torn up about it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be an idiot,\" Jonas said fondly as he swept her through the door of their room. \"If you\u0027ve just killed someone, the logical thing to do is throw suspicion on someone else. Yarwood used the information he had on me to do just that in front of witnesses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Witnesses? Oh, you mean Spencer and Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Spencer and Maggie. And when Warwick and Crump get back tomorrow morning Yarwood will undoubtedly make certain they hear about my unsavory reputation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you wouldn\u0027t talk like that,\" Verity chided him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas shrugged. \"Maybe Elyssa will remember what happened and solve the problem for all of us. In the meantime, we have to be prepared for the possibility that Doug will want to end this consulting job in a hurry tomorrow. Can\u0027t blame him. After what happened to his sister, he\u0027ll probably be anxious to end this entire thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you write the report he wants with the information you\u0027ve got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look so worried, boss. Sure I can write. The report never was a problem. I could have given him something for his clients after the first day.\" Jonas was moving around the room, collecting the flashlight and a jacket. \"But tonight could be our last shot at the treasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity groaned. \"I should have guessed. You know, you\u0027ve become obsessed by this treasure business, Jonas. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s at all healthy. In fact, given what happened to Digby, I\u0027d say it very definitely is not healthy.\" She broke off. \"It\u0027s strange, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s strange? Here, put on a jacket, that passage gets cold. You\u0027ve got to keep the baby warm.\" He tossed her the parka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s strange,\" Verity said as she put on the parka, \"is that two people who have a direct link with this villa have gotten into serious trouble here. Digby was murdered, and Elyssa was almost killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right—it is strange. Ready?\" Jonas was already at the wall, moving aside the tapestry to operate the door mechanism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity followed more slowly. \"What are we going to do tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to look for that room that appears in the vision of the man sitting at the desk. I\u0027ve scoured every inch of this villa during the past few days, and I haven\u0027t found a single room that matches the one in that image.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you figure it\u0027s hidden somewhere in this passageway?\" Verity shivered at the cold draft that swept out from the dank tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s possible this passage leads to it. Tonight we\u0027ll find out. Bring along that broken sword hilt in case we need to access the vision again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to know I don\u0027t really approve of this, Jonas. Something tells me we\u0027re making a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the rusted scrap of metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only mistake I\u0027m probably making is in taking you along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t let you go without me,\" she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just be sure you follow orders. You know the drill. Stay behind me and don\u0027t touch anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like taking a little kid through a department store,\" she muttered. \" Don\u0027t touch anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When little Jonas Junior comes along we\u0027ll get to find out about things like that, won\u0027t we? I can see us now—you, me, and the kid doing all kinds of stuff together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if it\u0027s a little Verity Junior?\" Verity said saucily. But it warmed her heart to hear him talking about the three of them as a family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not picky,\" Jonas said generously. \"Are you okay? Seems colder than usual in here tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gotten quite cold outside. Probably another storm on the way. I hope Doug and Oliver get back before it hits tomorrow. Jonas, I\u0027m going to be very glad to get off this island. The bloom is off the rose of consulting work, as far as I\u0027m concerned. I\u0027ll have to think very carefully before I sign you up for another job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do that, boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed the trail of old footprints and the ones they themselves had left as far as the entrance to the torture chamber. Jonas pointed the flashlight straight ahead and kept going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that I wouldn\u0027t like to stop and tarry awhile in that chamber,\" he told Verity. \"I\u0027ve got fond memories of that seduction scene you pulled in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly, Jonas, I\u0027d rather you didn\u0027t remind me.\" Verity was embarrassed at the memory of her sexual aggression. She didn\u0027t want to admit to herself how carried away she had gotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" he taunted. Then he chuckled. \"I know what\u0027s bothering you. I\u0027ll bet you don\u0027t think that sort of behavior is proper for a pregnant lady. Such a little prude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity chose not to respond. There wasn\u0027t much you could say to a man who had such satisfied glee in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stone corridor wound deeper into the bowels of the villa. Verity lost all sense of direction. It was impossible to tell what wing they were in or how deep underground they were. She huddled into her parka, grateful that Jonas had made her bring it along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hell,\" Jonas said a few minutes later. He sounded disgusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity nearly collided with him when he came to an abrupt halt in front of her. She peered around him and saw that the passage ended in a stone wall. \"Oh no!\" she cried. \"You mean it just ends? After all this running around down here, the passage just comes to an end? It\u0027s not fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe things got screwed up when they reconstructed the villa here on the island,\" Jonas suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed the flashlight downward. \"Ah, here we go. The footprints disappear into the wall. What we\u0027ve got here is another door. All we have to do is find the mechanism that opens it. Stand back, honey. This should be a piece of cake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was not a piece of cake. It took Jonas nearly half an hour to find the hidden lock mechanism. It wasn\u0027t the same design as the others, and it had been embedded in the floor instead of the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we go,\" he said finally. He was down on his knees, his fingers probing between two stones. There was a grinding noise from the wall in front of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity caught her breath as Jonas activated the mechanism. A wave of dank, fetid air burst from the slowly opening stone doorway. Jonas stepped back out of the way and pulled Verity with him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-62.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
