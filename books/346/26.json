Cameron then proposed that they should take the forenoon for their studies and walk out or exercise in some other way in the afternoon. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One afternoon Cameron said: “Let us take a walk to Prospect Pond; I think I should enjoy a little rowing.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will accompany you with pleasure, Mr. Cameron,” said Herbert, “but don\u0027t ask me to go out in the boat with you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why not? Are you afraid I will upset you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No,” answered Herbert; “I have confidence in your skill. Besides, I can swim.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What is your objection, then?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If the boat belonged to anyone but James Leech I would not mind.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why should you mind that?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I met him last evening and he told me not to get into his boat again. He said he was perfectly willing you should use it, but he didn\u0027t choose to have me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It appears that I am a greater favorite with James Leech than you are,” said Cameron, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He looks down upon me as a poor boy.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, I suppose James is entitled to his prejudice; but if you can\u0027t use the boat, I won\u0027t.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t let that interfere with your pleasure, Mr. Cameron,” said Herbert, eagerly. “I don\u0027t trouble myself in the least about the way James treats me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let us go down to the pond, at any rate. We can sit down on the bank, if nothing better.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All right.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n An easy walk brought them to the edge of the pond. Herbert naturally looked for James Leech\u0027s boat. He thought something was the matter with his eyes, for where there should be but one boat there were now two.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, there\u0027s another boat!” he exclaimed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is there?” asked Cameron, indifferently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, don\u0027t you see it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, it does look like a boat, I admit. I should say it was nicer than the other.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should say it was. Isn\u0027t she a regular beauty?” exclaimed Herbert, enthusiastically. “I wonder whose it is? James wouldn\u0027t want two.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a smile on Cameron\u0027s face that attracted Herbert\u0027s attention.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is it yours?” he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; I know who owns it, though.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It isn\u0027t the landlord, is it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then I can\u0027t imagine whose it is,” said Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Can\u0027t you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No,” said Herbert. “Will you tell me?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is yours!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mine!” exclaimed our hero, in the utmost surprise,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; I intended at first not to give it to you till I went away; but I may as well give it now, on one condition—that you let me use it whenever I please.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How kind you are!” said Herbert, gratefully. “I never received such a splendid present in my life. I have done nothing to deserve it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let me be the judge of that. Now, with your consent, we will try her.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With the utmost alacrity Herbert followed Cameron aboard the new craft, and took the oars. Smoothly and easily the boat glided off on the surface of the pond.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I like it much better than James\u0027,” said Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s a better model. His is rather clumsy. Besides, this is new and he must have had his for some time.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He has had it three years.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It needs painting.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Even if it were painted it wouldn\u0027t come up to this.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I agree with you,” said Cameron. “I am afraid James will be stirred with envy when he sees your boat.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am afraid so, too. He won\u0027t believe it is mine.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It may be your duty, out of a delicate regard to his feelings, to give it up, or exchange,” suggested Cameron.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s a little further than I carry my delicate regard to his feelings,” responded Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After half an hour\u0027s rowing, Cameron said, suddenly: “I must go back to the hotel. I came near forgetting an important letter, which must be sent off by this afternoon\u0027s mail.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert was a little disappointed, still he said, cheerfully: “All right, Mr. Cameron.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t you cease your rowing,” said the collegian.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I thought you might not like to walk back alone.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t mind that. I shall hurry back, and should be poor company. We will meet to-morrow morning.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cameron set out on his return home. He had gone less than quarter of a mile when he met James Leech.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good afternoon, Mr. Cameron,” said James, who was always polite to the rich manufacturer\u0027s son.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good afternoon, James.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Won\u0027t you go out in my boat, Mr. Cameron?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, I have just returned from the pond. I am obliged to go back to the hotel to write a letter.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should have been glad of your company.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You won\u0027t be alone,” said Cameron, mischievously. “I left Herbert Carter at the pond.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Was he out in the boat?” asked James, hastily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Without a word James walked abruptly away. He was very angry with Herbert, who, he naturally concluded, was out in his boat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He\u0027s the most impudent and cheeky boy I ever met!” he said to himself. “Last evening, I positively forbade his getting into my boat and he don\u0027t take the slightest notice of it. He needn\u0027t think he can take such liberties.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cameron smiled, as he read James\u0027 feelings in his face.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just before reaching the pond there was rising ground, from which James could take a general survey of the lake. Herbert was cruising about and had not yet seen James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He don\u0027t think I\u0027m so near,” thought James. “He thinks I won\u0027t know anything about his impudence. I\u0027ll soon make him draw in his horns.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In his excitement, James did not notice the boat particularly. If he had he would have seen that it was not his boat. But, so far as he knew, there was no other boat on the pond. Indeed, there was no boy whose father could afford to buy him one, and James had come to think himself sole proprietor of the pond, as well as of the only craft that plied on its surface.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wonder,” he thought, “whether I couldn\u0027t have Herbert fined for taking my property without leave, especially after I have expressly forbidden him to do it. I must ask my father this evening. It would bring down his pride a little to be taken before a justice.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert had got tired of cruising, and made a vigorous stroke, as if to cross the pond. James put up his hand to his mouth and shouted at the top of his voice: “Come right back, Herbert Carter!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2977/82065.html","bookId":346,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:05:13 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 1:35:45 PM"}
