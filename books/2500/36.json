I know your invitation was kindly meant, and I have received it in that spirit, but I am content with the life I have now, a life I know you have given me, and I do not believe that there is any purpose to our resuming our friendship now that I am of your blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is gratifying to know your business with Rustam Iniattir and his House has done so well. I am pleased that you were able to gain something after your great losses at Delhi, and I thank you for the funds that success has brought to me. It is most generous of you to set aside five percent of your profits for my use. In time I hope I will have no need of them, but in case that does not happen as soon as I anticipate, let me express my gratitude not only for the money, but your understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was saddened to learn of your hardships after the destruction of Delhi; but, as you said yourself, many suffered far worse than you did, and you returned to this place to a thriving business, which is more than most were able to do. From what little Rogerian has told me, you have endured many adversities in the past and may do so again, so while I am distressed to know that you had difficulties, you are doubtless capable of dealing with all that is demanded of you. I will take you as an admirable example in times to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as the Blood-Bond tells me you still live, I will not fret on your behalf. Knowing that you are about the world is a comfort in itself, but as my life as a breathing woman is over, so is all but the Bond with you. While I know I owe you more than I will ever be able to repay, if you would continue your kindness to me, leave me alone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-feast-in-exile-saint-germain-14/page-36.html","bookId":2500,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:58:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:58:30 PM"}
