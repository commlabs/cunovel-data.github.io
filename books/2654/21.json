Why would they want you present on that day of all days?\" Princess Cantacuzene paced back and forth in her mauve wall papered parlor. She looked at the calendar on her writing desk, then continued to pace and mumble to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was finally able to visit the princess on Sunday afternoon. The headmistress at Smolny believed I was at home with my parents, and my parents believed I had already returned to the school. I had many questions about the Montenegrins, and the princess was the only one I felt I could trust. \"He says it is when the earth opens up in the spring and sends forth the flowers,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and it is traditionally known as the day when the earth spews forth all sorts of foul things as well. Vampires, and other forms of the undead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other forms? What other forms?\" I sat down on the sofa. I wished there were a textbook of undead creatures. Or a field guide. It would make my life so much easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe princess sat down next to me. \"You already know there are several kinds of vampires. First there are the Vladiki.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are other kinds of vampires?\" This was getting more and more complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe princess called a servant to bring us tea in the parlor. \"Of course, Katerina. The Vladiki and the female veshtizas are found in the southern Balkan countries, but there are also the Russian upyri, who are savage blood drinkers, more animal than man. And then there are the Dekebristi, who have not been seen in Russia for many, many years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Dekebristi were vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrincess Cantacuzene closed her eyes. \"Their undead servants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreated by Konstantin\u0027s beloved to serve him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaman had told me about the vampires Tsar Nicholas had defeated, but I hadn\u0027t wanted to believe it. \"The history books tell us that Grand Duke Konstantin signed away his claim to the throne because he wanted to marry a Polish commoner,\" I said. \"But if she created the Dekebristi, what did that make her? What kind of powers did she have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A commoner is what the Romanovs call her,\" the princess said with a bitter laugh, waving her hand absentmindedly. \"But you are wanting to know about the different kinds of undead. Besides the vampires, you may find a revenant, or a ghoul. Flee from the both of them, because they are mindless and violent. More so than the normal peasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They both like to come out under the full moon,\" she continued, \"when there is plenty of light, for they are almost blind and their eyes are not accustomed to daylight. A revenant will haunt the graveyard in broad daylight, however, if there is reason. The ghoul likes to devour human flesh, while the revenant often prefers to eat its own flesh. He is usually not too particular, however. A revenant is always hungry.\" I started to feel hollow inside. hollow and nauseated at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Count Chermenensky. \"Your Highness, is there any way to cure an undead, like a revenant, for example?\" For that was what the count appeared to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, dear.\" My shoulders relaxed when I heard her say this. There was hope for the count. If I could just find him and administer the cure before the tsar\u0027s guards found him, everything would be fine. The princess took her tea from the servant\u0027s tray and stirred her sugar slowly. \"The cure is very simple. Remove the revenant\u0027s head from his body. Voila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRevenant is cured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart sank. This had been the grand duke\u0027s plan all along-what he still planned to do when he found the count again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But do not dwel on such creatures. The Vladiki are the only ones you should be concerned with. And not only the crown prince. You must be wary of Princess Militza. She is more ambitious than she seems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must become better acquainted with them, I believe, in order to uncover their secrets. My ring will keep you safe from them.\" She rose from her chair and approached the bookcase. \"You should also begin learning more about your abilities. Here we are.\" She selected a thick, dusty book from the bottom shelf and pressed it into my hands. A Necromancer\u0027s Companion. The black leather cover had Egyptian hieroglyphics imprinted down its spine. \"I don\u0027t need to tell you to keep it hidden. Share it with no one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Highness, I want no part of this. Please take it back.\" Her dark eyes flashed. \"I insist, Duchess. It is the only way you can protect your precious imperial family from the vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the tsar is in danger, he must be warned!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your tsar, the Bear, believes that the king of Montenegro is his staunchest ally. We cannot go before him without proof. You must discover their treachery by befriending the Montenegrins. Or kill the crown prince yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to remind the grand duchess that the Bear, as the peasants called Alexander I I, was her tsar as well. But I held my tongue. Reluctantly, I took the book and hid it within the folds of my cloak, silently promising myself I would never open the foul thing or read one unholy word. There had to be another way to keep the tsar and his family safe. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-21.html","bookId":2654,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM"}
