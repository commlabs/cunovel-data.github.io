Carter’s gonna call back once they’ve visited the place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hopefully he’ll come up with some answers,” she’d said, trying to figure out how a retired nurse from a town thirty-odd miles from Portland had anything to do with Allie seeming to vanish. Could this woman be the key to unlocking the entire mystery? Cassie had felt her pulse jump a little, then had refused to allow herself to feel the tiniest ray of hope. Belva Nelson could be just another dead end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, in the interrogation room Cassie watched as Detective Nash gave a nod to the mirror and within seconds a phone was delivered by a uniformed officer who hooked it to a jack in the wall. The cord stretched to the table. Nash dialed. Less than a minute later she was connected to Detective Hayes in LA and the interview continued for another forty-five minutes, directed by Nash, with Hayes asking a few questions for clarification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole experience was surreal. And unnerving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe questions became pointed and went over the same information Nash had asked earlier: Did she see the victim, Brandi Potts, last night? Did she know Brandi? Was there a connection between Brandi and Holly Dennison or Lucinda Rinaldi? Did Allie ever talk about either woman? Did Cassie own a gun? Could she provide an alibi for the hours surrounding Brandi Potts’s death? Did Cassie have any idea why the mask was left at her apartment in LA? Did she know about the other masks? Did she know of any reason either woman would have been killed? Any known enemies? Did she know if the two women were close? And just how close was she to either?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no, no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many times did she have to explain that she knew nothing? She answered each question as best as she could, but her knowledge of either victim was limited. Yes, she’d had drinks with Holly, but that was it. She’d driven her friend home the night before her death and hadn’t seen her again. She wasn’t even sure if she’d ever had a conversation with Brandi Potts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detectives’ questions were getting them nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still Nash kept firing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would someone place the masks on the victims or leave one at her apartment? Why scribble the words Mother or Sister on the back of each?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie was losing her patience. “I don’t know,” she said for the dozenth time. “Look, if I knew anything, I’d tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash’s smile was icy. “Well, that’s certainly reassuring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean it, I don’t know.” She’d almost pounded her fist on the table she was so frustrated, tired, and angry. But that wouldn’t solve anything. She forced a calmness she didn’t feel. “So I’m going to go now. I’ve told you everything I know, which is nothing, so there’s no reason for us to waste any more of your time or mine, or his,” she said, rolling a palm toward the phone from which the disembodied voice of Jonas Hayes had boomed. Standing, she headed to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t advise you leaving just yet,” Nash said, and Cassie whirled on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tough. I’m going.” She only hesitated long enough to see if the detective would try to stop her. She didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure I’m going to have more questions for you,” Nash stated, and was unable to hide her annoyance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure,” Cassie said. “You have my number. Oh, wait. You also have my damned phone.” Then she opened the door and nearly bolted from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonja Watkins wasn’t happy to find an officer of the law on her sagging front porch. Pushing forty and skinny as a rail, she stood behind a broken screen door and smoked a cigarette while a television blared from somewhere in the depths of the house. Two dogs of indeterminate breed lay on mats on the porch and chickens picked at bugs and grain or whatever in the sparse grass of the yard. The house, vintage 1940, sat on a plot that had to be five acres of fenced scrub brush. A boat and four older-model vehicles, two of which didn’t appear to run, were parked in a wide gravel area in front of a weathered barn. No Hyundai SUV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surrounding small farms, visible from the front porch, were neatly kept, the yards trimmed, the houses and outbuildings painted and clean. Not so the Watkins property. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-145.html","bookId":2675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM"}
