He had carried it with him since the night he\u0027d found it in a dirty Mexican alley. \"Some of us get our sense of security from other things.\" The gentle vibrations from the gold soothed some of the uneasiness in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, since there\u0027s not much we can do about my daughter, I guess maybe we ought to talk about the plans for springing Lehigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plans?\" Jonas shot his companion a quick, amused glance. \"You mean you\u0027ve actually got some?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I make a living at writing fiction, don\u0027t I? Of course I\u0027ve got plans. Besides, you know damn well we can\u0027t just drop off the cash and expect to see Lehigh again in one piece. We\u0027ll have to go in and bring him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s have it, Emerson. What\u0027s involved?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and your trusty knife are involved, among other things. Fortunately for us, my boy, you\u0027re a man of many talents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour days later, Verity spent the morning at the office of the one and only travel agent in Sequence Springs. That evening, the crowd at the No Bull Cafe was so light she closed earlier than usual, and trekked up the path to the pool room of the Sequence Springs Spa Resort. A stack of travel brochures was tucked under her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe European-style spa room was almost empty. Gleaming white and blue tile shone under the bright lights, and the spa pools bubbled invitingly. Verity undressed and slid naked into her favorite pool, a hot bath that smelled strongly of therapeutic minerals. Stacking the brochures on the tile rim beside her, she leaned back in the soothing water and began to study pictures of sun-kissed shores and tropical seas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier that evening she had made a promise to herself that she would not spend another night sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring. Jonas was not likely to call tonight. He certainly hadn\u0027t bothered to call during the past four days, and they had been the longest four days of Verity\u0027s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, she was sick of reading and rereading the poem she had found pinned to her pillow the morning Jonas had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait for me, my lady, though the wind blows chill and cold, wait while all is locked in winter\u0027s icy fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will dream of you, my lady, hot dreams of fire and gold, Dreams of gemlike passion too wondrous to resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if you\u0027re on vacation when I return, my lady, I swear I will be most extremely pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtremely pissed. Verity wrinkled her nose. If Jonas expected her to believe that little ditty was another of the Renaissance love poems he claimed to have loosely translated, he was wrong. And it certainly didn\u0027t make up for his failure to phone her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Verity! Just the person I\u0027m looking for. I rang the cafe and the cabin but there was no answer. I figured you might be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity looked up from the enticing photo of a gleaming white resort on a private bay. \"Hi, Laura. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura Griswald grinned cheerfully. \"I\u0027m not positive, but I get the feeling that a job for Jonas may be available.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity set aside the brochure. \"A job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew that would get your attention.\" Laura shook her head, her shoulder-length brown hair shining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything about Laura sparkled with radiant good health. She and her husband, Rick, owned the Sequence Springs Spa Resort, and they were walking advertisements for the place. She crouched at the edge of the pool. \"A young couple—brother and sister, I gather—checked in early this evening. They mentioned they\u0027re looking for Jonas Quarrel. They came to Sequence Springs to find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity straightened quickly. The last time someone had come looking for Jonas he had nearly been killed. \"They asked for Jonas by name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. Said they wanted to see him in a professional capacity. But they wouldn\u0027t come all this way to hire a dishwasher, so I figured they must mean in his professional academic capacity. I knew you\u0027d be interested, even if Jonas isn\u0027t. You\u0027ve been trying to get that man back into a respectable job since the day he started washing dishes for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have you know that he did an article for a history journal that appeared two weeks ago,\" Verity announced proudly. \"You can have one, if you like. I ordered twenty copies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that right?\" Laura appeared genuinely impressed. \"I remember you mentioned something about it. An article in his field? Something on Renaissance history?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. A comparison of modern-day fencing techniques with the style used during the late Renaissance.\" No need to mention that Jonas had learned the differences in techniques the hard way. He had a nasty scar on one shoulder to prove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity had nagged, cajoled, and otherwise made a nuisance of herself before Jonas had finally surrendered and written the article. She hated to see a well-educated mind going to waste while its owner washed dishes, although it didn\u0027t seem to bother Jonas in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen notice of the article\u0027s acceptance had arrived in the mail, she\u0027d strongly suspected that she was much more elated than Jonas was. Then she\u0027d remembered that as an instructor at Vincent College, he\u0027d probably been published in far more prestigious journals. Still, she planned to have one of her twenty copies of the Journal of Renaissance Studies framed. She had made Jonas autograph the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are these people and what do they want with Jonas?\" Verity asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I said, they\u0027re brother and sister. The name is Warwick. Doug and Elyssa. Doug\u0027s a stockbroker, twenty-nine or thirty, I\u0027d say. Likable. Probably drives a BMW and wears designer underwear. Elyssa is a couple of years younger and she positively radiates sweetness and light. Always smiling. It\u0027s enough to make you nauseated. I have a hunch she\u0027s into this new metaphysical stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean she believes in channelers and crystals and that sort of thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the impression I got. Doug seems normal enough, though, and I got the impression he\u0027ll be paying the fee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder what they want with Jonas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura shrugged. \"You said that before he took off to see the world a few years ago, Jonas had a reputation for authenticating antiques and museum artifacts. Maybe the Warwicks want his professional opinion on something they\u0027ve purchased. Think Jonas would be interested?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027m certainly interested. It\u0027s time that man put his education and, uh, experience to work.\" She had never attempted to explain to Laura or anyone else that Jonas\u0027s real talent was psychic in nature. \"I have a nagging fear that he\u0027s going to waste his life the way Dad has.\" Verity shook her head in exasperation. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-6.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
