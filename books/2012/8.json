He stamped the snow from his moccasins, and then strode into the twisting, stony corridor, hands out to the sides, fingertips brushing the wet stone. ‘Oh,’ he said under his breath, ‘but you’re a cold womb, aren’t you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead he heard voices, or, rather, one voice. Heed your sensitivities now, Udinaas. She stands unbowed, for ever unbowed. This is what love can do, I suppose .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old stains on the stone floor remained, timeless reminders of blood spilled and lives lost in this wretched chamber. He could almost hear the echoes, sword and spear, the gasp of desperate breaths. Fear Sengar, I would swear your brother stands there still. Silchas Ruin staggering back, step by step, his scowl of disbelief like a mask he’d never worn before, and was it not ill-fitting? It surely was . Onrack T’emlava stood to the right of his wife. Ulshun Pral crouched a few paces to Kilava’s left. Before them all reared a withered, sickly edifice. Dying House, your cauldron is cracked. She was a flawed seed .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilava turned upon his arrival, her dark animal eyes narrowing as would a hunting cat’s as it gathered to pounce. ‘Thought you might have sailed away, Udinaas.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The charts lead nowhere, Kilava Onass, as I’m sure the pilot observed upon arriving in the middle of a plain. Is there anything more forlorn than a foundered ship, I wonder?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnrack spoke. ‘Friend Udinaas, I welcome your wisdom. Kilava speaks of the awakening of the Jaghut, the hunger of the Eleint, and the hand of the Forkrul Assail, which never trembles. Rud Elalle and Silchas Ruin have vanished – she cannot sense them and she fears the worst.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My son lives.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilava stepped closer. ‘You cannot know that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas shrugged. ‘He took more from his mother than Menandore ever imagined. When she faced that Malazan wizard, when she sought to draw upon her power, well, it was one of many fatal surprises that day.’ His gaze fell to those blackened stains. ‘ What happened to our heroic outcome, Fear? To the salvation you gave your life to win? “If I have not challenged myself, if I have not striven to give it all I have, then will I stand head bowed before the world’s judgement.” But the world’s judgement is cruel .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We contemplate a journey from this realm,’ said Onrack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas glanced at Ulshun Pral. ‘Do you agree?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior freed one hand to a flurry of fluid gestures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas grunted. Before the spoken word, before song, there was this. But the hand speaks in broken tongue. The cipher here belongs to his posture – a nomad’s squat. No one fears walking, or the unfolding of a new world. Errant take me, this innocence stabs the heart . ‘You won’t like what you will find. Not the fiercest beast of this world stands a chance against my kind.’ He glared at Onrack. ‘What do you think that Ritual was all about? The one that stole death from your people?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hurtful as his words are,’ growled Kilava, ‘Udinaas speaks the truth.’ She faced the Azath once more. ‘We can defend this gate. We can stop them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And die,’ snapped Udinaas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ she retorted, wheeling to face him. ‘You will lead my children from here, Udinaas. Into your world. I will remain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I thought you said “we”, Kilava.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Summon your son.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Find someone else to join you in your last battle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will stand with her,’ said Onrack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You will not,’ hissed Kilava. ‘You are mortal—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And you are not, my love?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am a Bonecaster. I bore a First Hero who became a god.’ Her face twisted but there was anguish in her eyes. ‘Husband, I shall indeed summon allies to this battle. But you, you must go with our son, and with Udinaas.’ She pointed a taloned finger at the Letherii. ‘Lead them into your world. Find a place for them—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A place? Kilava, they are as the beasts of my world – there are no places left! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You must find one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you hear this, Fear Sengar? I am not to be you after all. No, I am to be Hull Beddict, another doomed brother. ‘Follow me! Listen to all my promises! Die .’ ‘There is nowhere,’ he said, throat tight with grief, ‘In all the world … nowhere. We leave nothing well enough alone. Not ever. The Imass can make claim to empty lands, yes, until someone casts upon it a covetous eye. And then they will begin killing you. Collecting hides and scalps. They will poison your food. Rape your daughters. All in the name of pacification, or resettlement, or whatever other euphemistic bhederin shit they choose to spit out. And the sooner you’re all dead the better, so they can forget you ever existed in the first place. Guilt is the first weed we pluck, to keep the garden pretty and smelling sweet. That is what we do, and you cannot stop us – you never could. No one can.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-8.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
