With their eyesight, they could naturally see that Su was rushing towards them with inconceivable speed. Meanwhile, the injuries of their bodies were worsening at a similarly fast speed.

Apart from the shrapnel that originated from Death Prison, no other rubble or any other matter could be seen around them.

Madeline floated in the distance. She didn’t take a step backwards. The enormous Death Prison pointed towards the ground, and her expressionless mask continued to stare towards Persephone without giving Su even a glance. Persephone, however, staggered backwards and fell onto the ground. Her bright red lips were moist, and blood now truly did seep out from them. Her body was riddled with scars, and her hands were even more so a bloody mess. It was quite a horrible sight.

She remained silent for a moment, and then she raised Death Prison slowly towards Su’s chest.

The face on her mask would eternally carry the same expression.

When he moved his head, he saw that Persephone had grabbed his upper arm. Her hand continued to flow with blood, and the blood had already covered her delicate hands and continued to flow down Su’s arm. From their skin to skin contact, Su could clearly sense the uneven surface of her palm that was completely different from the normally soft and gentle hand. Su knew that this meant that her palm was already badly mangled, but he didn’t use transparent surveillance, nor did he even use long-range sensation, all because he couldn’t bear to see the state of Persephone’s injuries.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone pulled gently, but the powerful force already made Su’s body slightly leave the ground and moved him behind her. This was a rare instance where she didn’t hide her strength in front of Su, as well as the first time she didn’t give Su the pride of being a man in front of someone else. However, in front of Madeline’s Death Prison, any reservation of strength was stupidity beyond redemption.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Your hand…” Su noticed that Persephone’s hands continued to drip with blood. Forget about the injuries, even if Persephone’s entire arm broke, Persephone could use her abilities to immediately close her blood vessels and stop the bleeding without the assistance of any medications or supplies.

He immediately tried to suppress this thought, not willing to place this malicious prediction on Madeline. He didn’t have any proof to verify this thought, and the only thing backing it was a weak intuition.

It was as if a formless gaze immediately penetrated his body and heard his innermost thoughts.
