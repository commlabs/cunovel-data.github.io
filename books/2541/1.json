This is my tenth published novel and the thought of writing introductions to any of the preceding nine never even occurred to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this novel, however, I feel that a brief prologue is called for. Because its subject is survival after death, it is essential that you realize, before reading the story, that only one aspect of it is fictional: the characters and their relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith few exceptions, every other detail is derived exclusively from research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor that reason, I have added, at the conclusion of the novel, a list of the books used for this research. As you will see, they are many and diverse. Yet, despite their wide variation with regard to authors and times and places of publication, there is a persistent, unavoidable uniformity to their content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou would, of course, have to read them all to prove this to yourself.
