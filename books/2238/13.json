He had barely shed his raincoat when he gathered me up in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Martin,\" I whispered, finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The water for the spaghetti is boiling over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go put in the spaghetti so we can eat. After all, you need to build up your strength.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich earned me a narrow-eyed look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can never manage to get all the elements of a meal ready simultaneously, but we did eventually eat our salad and garlic bread and spaghetti with meat sauce. Martin seemed to enjoy them, to my relief. While we ate, he told me about his trip, which seemed to have consisted mainly of small enclosed spaces alternating with large enclosed spaces: airplane, airport, meeting room, dining room, hotel room, airport, airplane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he asked me what I\u0027d been doing, I almost told him I\u0027d sat up last night afraid of the bogey man. But I didn\u0027t want Martin to think of me as a shaking, trembly kind of woman. Instead, I told him about my walk, about the people I\u0027d seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they all had a chance to kill Tonia Lee,\" I said. \"Any one of them could have walked up to the house in the dusk. Tonia Lee wouldn\u0027t have been too surprised to see any one of them, at least initially.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it had to have been a man,\" suggested Martin. \"Don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know if she\u0027d actually had sex,\" I pointed out. \"She was positioned to look like it, but we don\u0027t have the postmortem report. Or she could have had sex, and then been killed by someone other than her sex partner.\" Martin seemed to take this conversation quite matter-of-factly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would assume a lot of traffic in and out of the Anderton house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t seem too likely, does it? But it could be. After all, the presence of a woman wouldn\u0027t scare Tonia Lee at all. And Donnie Greenhouse said several very strange things last night.\" I told Martin about Donnie\u0027s remark that not only men had wanted Tonia Lee, and about his sighting of Idella\u0027s car. But I didn\u0027t say anything about Eileen and Terry; just because they were the only lesbians I knew about in Lawrenceton didn\u0027t mean they were the only ones in town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAubrey would have been nauseated by this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s your assumption?\" Martin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think ... I think Tonia Lee learned who was stealing those things from the houses for sale. I think she was having an affair with whoever it was, or he--or she--seduced her when she asked him to come to the Anderton house to talk about the thefts. Maybe he asked her to meet him under the guise of having a romp in the hay there, when he meant to finish her all along. So they romp or they don\u0027t, but either way he fixes it to look as if they had. I\u0027m sure he planned it beforehand. He arrives by foot or bicycle, he kills Tonia Lee, he positions her sexually to make us think it\u0027s just one of her paramours who got exasperated, he moves her car, he goes home, he somehow gets the key back to our key board. He thinks that that way no one will look for Tonia Lee for days, days during which all alibis will be blurred or forgotten or unverifiable. Maybe he returns the key in the few minutes Patty and Debbie are both out of the front room at the office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartin had been listening quietly, thinking along with me. Now he held up his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"I think Idella must have put back the key.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God, yes. Idella,\" I said slowly. \"That\u0027s why he killed her. She knew who had had the key. She got it from whoever was at Greenhouse Realty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made so much sense. Idella, crying at the staff meeting right after Tonia\u0027s body was discovered. Idella, red-eyed and upset during the days after the killing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must have been someone she was incredibly loyal to,\" I murmured. \"Why wouldn\u0027t she tell? It would have saved her life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She couldn\u0027t believe it, she wouldn\u0027t believe this person did it,\" Martin said practically. \"She was in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at each other for a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said quietly. \"That must have been it. She must have been in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of Idella after Martin fell asleep that night. Deluded in the most cruel way, Idella had died at the hands of someone she loved, someone of whom she could believe no evil, no matter how compelling the evidence. In a way, I thought drowsily, Idella had been like me ... she\u0027d been alone for a while, coping with her life on her own. Maybe that had made her all too ready to trust, to depend. It had cost her everything. I prayed for her, for her children, and finally for Martin and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must have coasted off into sleep, because the next thing I was aware of was waking. I woke up just a little, though; just enough to realize I\u0027d been asleep, just enough to realize something unusual had roused me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear someone moving very quietly downstairs. Martin must be getting a drink and doesn\u0027t want to disturb me--so sweet, I thought drowsily, and turned over on my stomach, pillowing my face on my bent arms. My elbow touched something solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes opened wide in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze, listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slight sound from downstairs was repeated. I automatically reached out to the night table for my glasses and put them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see the darkness much more clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid out of bed as silently as I could, my slithery black nightgown actually of some practical use, and crept to the head of the stairs. Maybe it was Madeleine? Had I fed her before we came up to bed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Madeleine was in her usual night place, curled on the little cushioned chair by the window, and she was sitting up, her head turned to the doorway. I could see the profile of her ears against the faint light of the streetlamp a block north on Parson Road, coming in through the blinds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glided back to the bed, very careful not to stumble over scattered clothes and shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Martin,\" I whispered. I leaned over my side of the bed and touched his arm. \"Martin, there\u0027s trouble. Wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he answered instantly, quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone downstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get behind the chair,\" he said almost inaudibly, but very urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard him get out of bed, heard him--just barely heard him--feeling in his overnight bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was ready to disobey and take my part in grabbing the intruder--after all, this was my house--when I saw in that little bit of glow from the streetlight that Martin was holding a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it did seem time to get behind something. Actually, the chair felt barely adequate all of a sudden. I left Madeleine right where she was. Not only would she very probably have yowled if I\u0027d grabbed her, but I trusted her survival instincts far more than mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI strained as hard as I could to hear but detected only some tiny suggestions of movement-- maybe Martin going to the head of the stairs. Despite the dreadful hammering of my heart, I said a few earnest prayers. My legs were shaking from fear and the cramped crouching position I\u0027d assumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI willed myself to be still. It worked only a little, but I could hear some sounds coming up the stairs. This intruder was no skilled stalker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found I was more frightened of what Martin might do than I was of the intruder. Only slightly, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the someone enter the room. I covered my face with my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the lights came on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop right there,\" Martin said in a deadly voice. \"I have a gun pointed at your back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peeked around the chair. Sam Ulrich was standing inside the room with his back to Martin, who was pressed against the wall by the light switch. Ulrich had a length of rope in one hand, some wide masking tape in the other. His face was livid with shock and excitement. Mounting my stairs must have been pretty heart-pounding for him, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn around,\" Martin said. Ulrich did. \"Sit on the end of the bed,\" Martin said next. The burly ex-Pan-Am Agra executive inched back and sat down. Slowly I got up from my place behind the chair, finding out that during those few moments I\u0027d spent there, my muscles had become strained and sore from the tension. My legs were shaking, and I decided sitting in the chair would be a good idea. My robe was draped over the back of it, and I pulled it on. Madeleine had vanished, doubtless irritated at having her night\u0027s sleep so rudely interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right, Roe?\" Martin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said shakily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at our captive. I had a thought. \"Martin, where did you park when you came tonight? Are you in your car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said slowly. \"No, I parked out back in one of the parking slots, but I\u0027m in a company car. I don\u0027t like to leave my car parked at the airport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he didn\u0027t know you were here,\" I observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartin absorbed that quickly. From looking perplexed and angry, his expression went to murderous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you going to do with the rope and the tape, Sam?\" he asked very quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt all the blood drain from my face. I hadn\u0027t followed through on my own idea until Martin asked that critical question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You son of a bitch, I was going to hurt you like you hurt me,\" Sam Ulrich said savagely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t rape your wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t going to rape her,\" he said, as if I weren\u0027t there. \"I was going to scare her and leave her tied up so you\u0027d know what it was like to see your family helpless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your logic escapes me,\" Martin said, and his voice was like a brand-new razor blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew this was a quarrel between the two men, but after all, it was I who would have been tied up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you feel it might be a little cowardly,\" I said clearly, \"to creep up in the dark and tie up a woman who wasn\u0027t even your real enemy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed Sam Ulrich had never put it to himself quite that way. He turned even redder in a slow, ugly way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to kill you,\" Martin said very quietly. I didn\u0027t doubt his sincerity, and I could tell from the hunch of his shoulders that Ulrich didn\u0027t, either. Martin, even in pajama bottoms, had more authority than Sam Ulrich would have had in a suit. \"But since it\u0027s Roe\u0027s house you broke into, and her you were going to harm, maybe she should decide what should happen to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that Martin would kill this man if I asked him to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of calling the police. I thought of cops I knew from having dated Arthur, perhaps even Arthur himself, up here in my bedroom looking at me in my black nightie. I thought of their eyes as they found out Martin and I had been asleep together when I heard someone downstairs. I thought of the report taken from the police blotter that appeared daily in the Lawrenceton Sentinel. Then I thought of letting this dreadful coward go scot-free. But my flesh crawled when I pictured myself alone here with this frustrated man and his rope and his tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027ll tell you what I just plain liked about Martin. He let me think. He didn\u0027t say one word, or look impatient, or even make a face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a wife?\" I asked Sam Ulrich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are their names?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked more and more humiliated. \"Jannie and Lisa,\" he said reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jannie and Lisa wouldn\u0027t like to see their father\u0027s name in the paper for attacking an unarmed woman in her home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought that between anger and humiliation he might cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got a pen and a notepad from my bedside drawer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Write,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the pen and paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Date it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrote the date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am dictating this now. Start writing,\" I told him. \"I, Sam Ulrich, broke into the townhouse of Aurora Teagarden tonight. . .\" His hand finally moved. When it stopped, I continued. \"I had with me some rope and masking tape.\" Done. \"She was asleep in bed with all the lights out, and I did not know anyone was in the townhouse with her.\" His fingers moved even slower. \"I was only prevented by her house guest from doing her harm. If I do not abide by the conditions she sets forth, she will send this letter to the police, with a copy to my wife.\" And as he finished writing, I told him to sign it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited to hear my conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I want to see is your house up for sale tomorrow, and for God\u0027s sake don\u0027t list it with Select Realty. And I want you out of here, moved, family and all, within the week. I never want you to come back here, and I never want to see you again. You may not get a job like you\u0027re used to, but anything, I think, would be better than being in jail for what you wanted to do to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartin\u0027s face was blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUlrich was so upset his features were distorted. I wondered if between rage, and relief, and shock, he would have a heart attack on the way home, and I found myself not much caring if he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Martin, could you please walk Mr. Ulrich to his car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, honey,\" Martin agreed, with a dangerous kind of smoothness. \"Come on, Ulrich. You\u0027re lucky I asked the lady. I would have put you in the hospital if it had been up to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr the morgue, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Ulrich rose slowly. He took a step forward and then stopped. He was afraid to go closer to Martin. He was not such a fool as he looked. Martin moved back, and Ulrich preceded him down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the back door open and close, and wondered if I\u0027d left it unlocked when we\u0027d gone upstairs for the night. I didn\u0027t think so. Not a very good lock. I\u0027d get a better one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing left alone for a few minutes was a great relief, and I burst into tears and tried very hard not to picture myself at the mercy of the man now being marched to his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was rinsing my face at the sink, the cold water making me shudder, when Martin returned. I saw his reflection in the mirror beside mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been crying,\" he said very gently, putting his gun on my vanity table, where it lay looking as out of place as a rattlesnake. I turned and put my arms around him. His bare chest was cold from the outside air, and I rubbed my cheek against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s driving home,\" he said, answering a question I was scared to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Martin,\" I said, \"if you hadn\u0027t been here . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would have called 911, because I wouldn\u0027t have been between you and the phone,\" he said practically. \"They would have been here in two minutes, maximum, and you would have been fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this doesn\u0027t count as a rescue?\" I asked shakily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re even on this one. You kept me from doing something stupid to him. I would hate to have to spend the night down at the police station because of Sam Ulrich. You saved his family, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Martin. Let\u0027s just get in bed and pile all the blankets on, and you can hold me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trembling from head to toe. I realized, as I lay with my eyes wide open in the dark, that I had had to wait to find that Sam Ulrich had left in his own car--alive--before I could let myself have the luxury of relaxing, believing the incident was over. Martin was awake, too, listening. I didn\u0027t think Ulrich was stupid enough to come back; he should be in his own bed counting his blessings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to count my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least Martin didn\u0027t try to get to the plant early on Saturday, but he felt he should go in, especially since he\u0027d been out of town. \"I think my weekend hours will decrease now things are beginning to shape up at this plant,\" he told me over our morning coffee, \"especially now that I have a reason to stay away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to smile back, but my attempt must have been miserable failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roe,\" he said seriously, \"it\u0027s me that got you into the trouble last night, and for that I am so sorry. He wouldn\u0027t have come here if it wasn\u0027t for me. I hope you don\u0027t hate me for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, surprised. \"No, never think it. I\u0027m just tired, and it was very upsetting. And you know--you do have to tell me why you brought a gun when you came to spend the night with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had a hard life,\" Martin said after a moment. \"I have a job that requires me to do difficult things to other people, people like Ulrich.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes briefly. This was all probably true, as far as it went. \"All right,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think you\u0027ll feel like going to that banquet tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d forgotten all about it. Of course, I wasn\u0027t wild about going, but on the other hand, when I pictured my mother asking me why we hadn\u0027t come, I just couldn\u0027t come up with a believable excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so,\" I said unenthusiastically. \"I\u0027d rather drag myself there than think about last night.\" \"Don\u0027t forget to wear your hair up,\" Martin reminded me later as he gathered all his things to stow in his company car. \"What time should I come by?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think cocktails start at six-thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six-thirty it is. Dressy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Everyone can bring two other couples as guests, so there\u0027s usually a decent crowd, and there\u0027s a speaker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was leaning on the door frame, and Martin was halfway to his car when he dropped the things he was carrying and came back. He held my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t off me because of last night?\" He looked at me steadily as he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head slowly, trying to analyze what I did feel, why things seemed so grim. \"I just realized I\u0027d taken on more than I\u0027d anticipated,\" I said, giving him the condensed version.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me quizzically. I was so tired that my judgment was impaired, and I went on. \"You\u0027re a dangerous man, Martin,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to you,\" he told me. \"Not to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially to me, I thought, as I watched him drive away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had completely forgotten to make an appointment to get my hair put up. Of course, all the hairdressers who were open on Saturday were fully booked. But with some wheedling and bribing, I got my mother\u0027s regular woman to stay open late to work with my mane. I would be done barely in time for the dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat suited me just fine. I climbed wearily up my stairs and went back to bed. It was becoming a habit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I woke again at two o\u0027clock, the gray day didn\u0027t look any more inviting, but I felt much better. I decided to cram the night before into a mental closet for the time being, to take some pleasure in going to a social function in Lawrenceton with Martin for the first time. I was human enough to relish the anticipation of eyebrows lifted, of envious women. I was convinced any woman with hormones would want Martin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even turned on my exercise tape and got at least halfway through it before getting fed up with the dictatorial instructress. Madeleine watched me, as usual, her eyes round and disbelieving. She followed me upstairs for my shower, watched me put on my makeup and dry my hair. I changed my sheets, too, and ran a carpet sweeper over the bedroom hurriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would be running so short on time I decided to put on everything but the actual dress before I left for my hair appointment. So I looked through my closets. I\u0027d wear the dress I\u0027d worn the year before. Martin hadn\u0027t seen it, even if everyone else had, and I\u0027d only worn it that once. It was green, and after simple long sleeves and a scoop neck, the bodice descended to a point in front, and the short skirt flounced out in gathers all around. I\u0027d have to wear black heels ... I needed some of those shiny lame-looking shoes that were so popular now, but I didn\u0027t have the energy or time to go shopping. Black would have to do. I had a little black evening purse, too. So I put on the right bra and slip and hose, and a dress that buttoned down the front over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried out to my car and started across town to my mother\u0027s hairdresser. I\u0027d looked up an address before leaving home, and I took a little detour. There was the Ulrich house, a three-bedroom ranch style in one of Lawrenceton\u0027s prettier middle-class neighborhoods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was a FOR SALE sign in the yard. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/three-bedrooms-one-corpse-aurora-teagarden-3/page-13.html","bookId":2238,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:41 PM"}
