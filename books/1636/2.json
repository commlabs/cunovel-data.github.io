Team Foxtrot followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery other Spartan on the field charged as well, hundreds of half-camouflaged armored figures, running and firing at the dazed Jackals, appearing as a wave of ghost warriors, half liquid, half shadow, part mirage, part nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey screamed a battle cry, momentarily drowning the sound of gunfire and explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom yelled with them—for the fallen, for his friends, and for the blood of his enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound was deafening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackals broke ranks, turned to flee, and got shot in the back as their shields turned with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut hundreds more held their ground, overlapping shields to form an invulnerable phalanx.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom led Team Foxtrot into the smoke-filled shadows of the factory. He found a pipe the size of a redwood dripping condensed water and green coolant and took cover behind it. In the mist he saw Lucy, Adam, and Min take positions behind cover, too. He gave them rapid- fire orders with hand signals: Move in and kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun around, his MA5K rifle leveled—and found himself face-to-face with a Covenant Elite, its jaw mandibles split in mimicry of an impossibly large human grin. The monster held an energy sword in one hand, and a plasma pistol in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt shot and swung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom sidestepped the deadly arcs of energy, set his foot between the Elite\u0027s too-wide stance—pushed and fired at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elite sprawled onto the ground, and Tom tracked his body, spraying rounds into the slit of its helmet. He didn\u0027t miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeam Foxtrot closed on him, leaving six dead Jackals behind, their bodies snapped like rag dolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind on the field came rapid thumps and flashes of heat. Plasma grenades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackals and Elites rushed from their cover in the factory to meet the rest of Beta Company on the field, realizing perhaps it would be suicide to face Spartans in close quarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThousands of Covenant clashed with two hundred Spartans in open combat. Tracer rounds, crystal shards, plasma bolts, and flaring shields made the scene a blur of chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SPARTAN-IIIs moved with speed and reflexes no Covenant could follow. They dodged, snapped necks and limbs, and with captured energy swords they cut through the enemy until the field ran with rivers of gore and blue blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom hesitated, torn between moving deeper into the factory complex and executing the mission and running back to help his comrades. You didn\u0027t leave your friends behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky darkened, clouds overhead turning steel gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom\u0027s COM crackled to life: \"Omega three. Execute now! NOW!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped him cold. Omega three was the panic code, an order to break and run no matter what the cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? They were winning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom then saw the clouds move. Only… they weren\u0027t clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was clear to him now. Why there were so many Covenant here. And why Seraph single ships, craft designed for space combat, were bombing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven Covenant cruisers sank from the clouds. Over a kilometer long, their bulbous oblong hulls cast shadows over the entire field. If these ships had been parked in formation, refueling over the complex, the STARS might have mistaken such large structures as part of the factory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to help them,\" Lucy whispered over the TEAMCOM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Min said, making a short cut motion with his hand. \"The Omega order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not running,\" Adam broke in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Tom agreed. \"We\u0027re not. The order is… in error.\" Despite the environmental controls in his SPI armor, he felt chilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeraph fighters dropped from the cruisers, dozens of them, and gathered into swarms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkly luminescent shafts of light appeared from the belly of each cruiser, transport beams, and from them marched hundreds of Elites onto the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we can\u0027t help them either,\" Tom whispered to his team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf of Beta Company turned to face the new threat. Impossible odds, even for Spartans, but they would buy time for the rest of them to find cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinding cover was a futile tactic, though. Seven Covenant cruisers had enough firepower to neutralize even two hundred Spartans. They could pin them down, send in ground reinforcements by the thousands, or if they wanted to, glass the entire moon from orbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat left only one option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The core,\" Tom told them. \"It\u0027s still our mission, and our only effective weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a heartbeat pause, and then three green acknowledgment lights winked on his display. His friends knew what he was asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeam Foxtrot moved as one, running into the factory at top speed, dodging pipes and supply pods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA squad of six Elites was ahead, hunkered behind a tangle of ducts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom tossed a handful of concussive grenades to disorient them, but his team kept running. Any delay—even to engage an enemy who could take shots at their backs—might rob them of their one chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surviving Elites recovered and fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam fell, one hand clutched at the crystal shards that penetrated his armor and punctured his lower spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go!\" Adam cried, waving them off. \"I\u0027ll hold them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom didn\u0027t break stride. Adam knew what had to be done: keep fighting until there was no fight left in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe core was a hundred meters ahead. It was impossible to miss, so bright Tom\u0027s faceplate automatically polarized to maximum tint, and it was still hard to look at. The core was the size of a ten-story building, pulsing like a huge heart, fed by glowing conduits and steaming coolant pipes, and encrusted with crystalline electronics. It was a marvel of alien engineering, and complex—which hopefully also meant easy to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Main coolant ducts there and there,\" Tom shouted over TEAMCOM and pointed. \"I\u0027ll jam the dump valve.\" He moved to the base of the core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy\u0027s and Min\u0027s acknowledgment lights winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom helmet\u0027s display fuzzed with static, then popped and went black. The reactor plasma and its intensely fluctuating electromagnetic field was wreaking havoc with their electronics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found the dump valve, a mechanism the size of a Pelican dropship, just below the main chamber. He unspooled the thermite-carbon cord and ran it around the valve twice. He then primed and activated the charge. A line of lightning brilliance flared and sizzled through Covenant alloy, fusing the valve into a solid lump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom glanced at Lucy. She set an explosive charge on one of the two main coolant lines that fed the reactor, and then set the timer on the detonator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin was setting his timer, too—then vanished in a flash of smoke and thunder. The core flared brighter than the sun. Coolant fumes screamed from twisted pipe and alarms blared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Lucy screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran past Tom toward the billowing cloud of toxic coolant. He caught her wrist, jerking her to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gone,\" Tom said. \"EM field must have triggered his charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrestled out of Tom\u0027s grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to get out of here,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, taking one step toward Min.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe support structure groaned and started to melt and sag from the superheating core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back to Tom, nodded, and they ran out of the chamber—deeper into the factory complex, through a jungle of struts and hissing ducts, and splashing through lakes of leaked, boiling coolant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe charge Lucy had set went off and silenced the reactor\u0027s alarms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with their backs to the reactor, running at a full-out flat sprint, the glare from the core doubled as it reached near supercritical phase. It was too much to endure, even through a polarized faceplate, and Tom squinted his eyes nearly shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turned a corner, slid down the railing of angled stairs and onto a catwalk that protruded over a ledge. Five hundred meters below, an ocean churned against rocky cliffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had made it through the factory, out the back side, where massive tubes sucked in the ocean water for processing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy looked back at the factory and then to Tom. She offered her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey jumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn free fall, Tom struggled, pumping his legs. Lucy released his hand, and straightened her body. He did the same and then pointed his feet down a split second before he hit the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact stunned him, then he tasted salt, and choked on water that filled his helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clawed for the surface. The lining of his SPI armor swelled, taking on water, weighing him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke the surface, paddling as hard as he could with his legs to stay afloat. He clawed at his helmet release and pulled it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to him, Lucy had her helmet off as well, gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look.\" He nodded to the cliff tops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom this angle Tom saw the Covenant cruisers over the field. Lances of laser fire rained down from the ships\u0027 lateral weapon arrays and blasted his fellow Spartans. Firepower meant for capital ship combat… how could anyone survive that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new sun appeared. The supercritical core flared and light filled the world. The cruisers rippled, distorted, their alloy skins boiling away in the heat. They disintegrated, bits blasted outward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rocky prominence shattered into molten debris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down!\" Tom cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Lucy pushed themselves underwater, diving to escape the overpressure and incinerating blast. His waterlogged armor might now save his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverhead, water flash vaporized. Droplets of liquid rock and metal hissed past him. Heat smothered him… and a giant hand grasped and squeezed until all Tom saw was blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom lay on the ground panting. They had nearly drowned after the blast, but managed to shed their armor, and finally, exhausted, swam back to the shore, and dragged themselves around the edge of the battlefield and into the hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Lucy had made it to extraction point six where he had seen one of the stealth exfiltration ships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Covenant reinforcements came. They had all been killed when the reactor blew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOperation TORPEDO was a success… but it had cost the lives of everyone else in the Beta Company contingent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that remained of the factory, the Covenant cruisers, and ground forces of Beta Company was a glass crater four kilometers in diameter. No bones, not even a camo panel from a suit of SPI armor. Gone. Whispers in the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy pulled herself up against the hull of the Black Cat sub-prowler craft, her body trembling. She started to stagger back down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Survivors,\" she whispered and took one uncertain step forward. \"Foxtrot. We have to look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had survived. They had checked all the COM frequencies, searched the shoreline, fields, and hills on their long silent hike back. No one else was alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy was tiny. Like Tom, she was only twelve years old, but at one point six meters and seventy kilos, Lucy was one of the smallest SPARTAN-IIIs. Without her SPI armor and weapons, and her pale form covered only in modest body sheathing, she looked even smaller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom stood and gently put his arm around her. She trembled violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going into shock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found a first-aid kit and injected her with the standard postmission antishock medical cocktail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Survivors…\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are none,\" he said. \"We have to get out of here. The Black Cat\u0027s capacitors will drain in four hours and we won\u0027t be able to jump to Slipspace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to him, eyes wide and brimming with tears. \"How are you sure we\u0027re alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom was alive. He was certain. But as he cast one final glance at the crackling fields of Pegasi Delta, he knew part of him had died today with Beta Company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped Lucy into the Black Cat prowler and closed the hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe subprowler\u0027s engines thrummed to life, then dulled to a whisper. The craft lifted and angled up into the darkening skies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy\u0027s words asking if they were alive would be her last. \"Posttraumatic vocal disarticulation,\" the experts would eventually declare. And although recertified for duty, she would remain silent—either unable, or unwilling, to speak the rest of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the years to come, Tom would reflect on Lucy\u0027s last question every day. \"How are you sure we\u0027re alive?\" Something had died for every Spartan that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSECTION I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLIEUTENANT AMBROSE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1647 HOURS, MAY 1, 2531 (MILITARY CALENDAR) \\ 111 TAURI SYSTEM, CAMP NEW HOPE, PLANET VICTORIA John, SPARTAN-117, despite being encased in a half ton of angular MJOLNIR armor, moved like a shadow through the twilight forest underbrush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard on the perimeter of Base New Hope drew on a cigarette, took a final puff, and tossed the butt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn lunged, a whisper rustle, and he wrapped his arm around the man\u0027s neck, wrenching it up with a pop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard\u0027s cigarette hit the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby crickets resumed their night song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn pinged his status to the rest of Blue Team. Four green LED lights winked on his display, indicating the rest of the extended perimeter guards had been neutralized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next objective was a delivery gate, the weakest part of the rebel base\u0027s defense system. The guardhouse had two men outside, two on the rooftop, and several inside. Past this, however, the base had impressive security even by Spartan standards: motion and seismic sensors, a triple layering of guards, trained dogs, and overhead MAKO-class drones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn blinked his status light green: the signal to proceed with the next phase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe setting sun just touched the edge of the horizon when the guards on the roof of the bunker twitched and crumpled. It happened so fast, John wasn\u0027t sure which Linda had targeted first. A heartbeat later the two on the ground were dead as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn and Kurt ran for the gatehouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly sprinted ahead, covering the three hundred meters from the forest in half the time, and leapt to the roof in a single bound. She opened the roof\u0027s vent and dropped flash-bang grenades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt posted outside the door, and swept the aft side for any targets. John waited on the other side of the steel and bulletproof-glass security door, one hand on its handle, one foot braced against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside three muffled thumps sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn pulled, wrenching the door and frame from the steel reinforcing in the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt entered, his M7 submachine gun burping three-round bursts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn was in a moment later, and assessed the threats in the blink of an eye. There were three guards already down. Behind them, banks of security monitors showed a hundred views of the base. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-2.html","bookId":1636,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM"}
