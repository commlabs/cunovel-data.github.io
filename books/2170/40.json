Humankind lost a certain useful practicality when it chose the other Semitic response - never to forgive and never to forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Lost People, Shiprecords\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLEGATA SAT back, her whole body shaking and trembling. She could tell by the flickering cursor on the com-console that it was almost dayside. Familiar activities soon would begin out in Ship\u0027s corridors - familiar but with a feeling of sparseness because of the diminished crew. She had kept illumination low during nightside, wanting no distractions from the holorecord playing at the focus in front of Oakes\u0027 old divan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze lifted and she saw the mandala she had copied for Oakes\u0027 quarters at the Redoubt. Looking at the patterns helped restore her, but she saw that her hands still shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFatigue, rage or disgust?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt required a conscious effort to still the trembling. Knots of tension remained in her muscles, and she knew it would be dangerous for Oakes to walk into his old cubby right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d strangle him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reason for Oakes to come shipside now. He was permanently groundside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prisoner of his terrors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I wa.... unti....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep, clear breath. Yes, she was free of the Scream Room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt happened, but I am here now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat to do about Oakes? Humiliation. That had to be the response. Not physical destruction, but humiliation. A particular humiliation. It would have to be at once political and sexual. Something more than embarrassment. Something he might think of to do against someone else. The sexual part was easy enough; that was no challenge to a woman of her beauty and genius. But the politic....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I conceal the evidence that I\u0027ve seen this holo?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSave that information for the proper moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a good thought. Trust her own inspiration. She keyed the com-console and typed in: SHIPRECORDS EYES ONLY LEGATA HAMILL. Then the little addition which she had discovered for herself: SCRAMBLE IN OX.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere. No matter who thought to search for such a datum, it would be lost in that strange computer which she had discovered in one of her history hunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll stay shipside this diurn. She would not feel well. That would be the message to Oakes. He would grant her a rest period without question. She would spend her time here pulling every trick of computer wizardry she could to get the complete record on Morgan Oakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolitical humiliation. Political and sexual. That had to be the way of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps that other Ceepee brought out of hyb, that Thomas, might hold a clue. Something in the way he looked at Oake.... as though he saw an old acquaintance in a new rol....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she owed a debt to Thomas. Strange that he should be the only one to know she had run the P. He had kept the secret without being aske.... or asking. Rare discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no thought of fatigue now. There was food shipside when she needed it. The power of Oakes\u0027 position made that no problem. She sent her message to Oakes groundside, turned to the console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in the records there would be a useful fact or two. Something Oakes had hidden or that he did not even know about himself - perhaps something he had done and did not want revealed. He was good at this concealment game but she knew herself to be better at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began at the main computer - Ship\u0027s major interface with Shipmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould it take fancy programming? A painstaking search through coded relationships which could hide bits of data far in the recesses of offshoot circuitry such as that Ox gate? How about the Ox gate? She hid things there, but had never asked it about Oakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tapped out a test routine, keyed it and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, data began flowing across the small screen on the console. She stared. That simple? It was as though the material were waiting for her to ask. As though someone had prepared a bio for her to discover. Everything she needed was there - facts and figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suspect everyone,\" Oakes had said. \"Trust no one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here he was being proved right beyond his wildest fears. The text kept rolling out. She backed it up, keyed for printout, and set it in motion once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heading of the record was the most surprising thing of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMORGAN LON OAKES.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloned. Raised, as he would put it, \"like a common vegetable.\" Out of the axolotl tanks and into an Earthside womb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was even as she asked. \"To conceal the fact that it could be done, the birth was made to appear natural.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a feat of politics worthy of Shi.... or Oakes. Did he know? How could he know? She stopped the printout and asked who else had called up this data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an answer she had never before seen. Ship had worked with this data. Fearfully, she asked why Ship had called up the bio on Oakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To store it in a special record for Kerro Panille should he ever desire to write a history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled her hands away from the keys. Am I talking to Ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanille was one of those who said he talked to Ship. Not one of the fools, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA...fool?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found herself more fearful of this discovery than she had been of the Scream Room. Ship dealt in powers far beyond those of Oakes and Lewis and Murdoch. She glanced around the enlarged cubby - pretentious damned place. Her gaze fell on the mandala. He had taken the movable hangings. The mystical design lay exposed against a bare metal bulkhead of silvery gray. It appeared lifeless to her, robbed of some original breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not worthy of talking to Ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had been an acciden.... a dangerous accident. Hesitantly, she started the Oakes bio printing once more. Words again flowed across the screen and the printer rattled with its text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegata heaved a deep sigh of relief. Perilous ground. But she had escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt that something strange was happening, some new program awakening in Ship. It was a feeling in her shoulderblades. Something even more awesome might happen and she was right in the middle of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer attention returned to the Oakes bio. That had been a time of great scurrying about Earthside, great secrets. Salvation and survival - whatever the label - the arrival of Ship and the desperation of doomed people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperation breeds extremes if nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Legata.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Oakes calling her name and she felt her heart skip a beat. But it was the console override. He was calling her from groundside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the com-console telltales to see if he could find out what she was reading. It was still blocked by the Ox gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized the sound of the printer, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you printing out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some data you\u0027ll find interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhhh, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could almost see his mind working on this. Legata had something she would not trust to the open channels between Ship and ground. She would show it to him, though. It must be interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll have to find something juicy, she thought. Something about Ferry. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been expecting you groundside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not feeling well. Didn\u0027t you get my signal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my dear, but we have urgent matters demanding our attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s not full dayside yet, Morgan. I couldn\u0027t sleep and I still have work here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is everything all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just busy,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This cannot wait. We need you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well. I\u0027m coming down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait for me at the Redoubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Redoubt!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke the connection and it was only then that she realized he had spoken of needing her. Was that possible? Alliance or love? She did not think there was much room for love in the convoluted patterns of Morgan Oakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSooner expect Lewis to start raising a pet Runner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, Oakes wanted her presence. That gave her a wedge into the power she needed. Something still nagged at her, though - the one fear above all others: What if he does love me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, she had thought she wanted him to love her. There was no question that he was the most interesting man she had ever met. Unpredictably terrifying, but interesting. There was much to be said for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill I destroy him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe printer finished producing the Oakes bio. She folded it, crossed to the mandala looking for a place to conceal the thick wad of Shipscript. The mandala was fixed solidly to the bulkhead. She turned and glanced around the cubby. Where to hide this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo I need to hide it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Until the right moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe divan? She crossed to the divan and knelt beside it. The thing was fixed to the deck by bolts. Could she call a serviceman? N.... she didn\u0027t dare let anyone suspect what she was doing. Gritting her teeth, she put two fingers on a bolt and twisted. The bolt turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrength has its purposes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bolts removed, she lifted the end of the divan. My! It was heavy. She doubted that three men could lift it. She slipped the text under the divan, restored the bolts, twisting them tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow for something juicy about Win Ferry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up and returned to the console. Ferry gave her no difficulty either. He practiced no discretion whatsoever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor old fool! I\u0027m going to destroy Oakes for you, Win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Don\u0027t trick yourself into nobility. You\u0027re doing it on your own and for yourself. Let\u0027s keep love and the glory of others out of it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-40.html","bookId":2170,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM"}
