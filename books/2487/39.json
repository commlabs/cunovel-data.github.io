The city sank forty million dollars’ worth of tax breaks and infrastructure into getting the thing built before three of the five investors disappeared (I always imagined that all three simultaneously shot each other, like in the movie Reservoir Dogs). Now, three years and thirty lawsuits later, raccoons nested in the one hundred and fifty empty store slots and rainwater puddled in the halls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt lay there in the darkness, broken and rotting like a decomposing animal carcass that was slowly picked apart by scavengers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly zipped off toward the building and was swallowed by the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrissy said, “Do we follow her in there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio kicked on, mandolin plucking the intro to an early ’90s song by REM called “Losing My Religion.” John and I reacted, Krissy didn’t. It only took a few seconds for me to realize this was not the song as Michael Stipe had written it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oooohhh, knife\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplus nigger\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEquals you, and Jews are dead meat . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know people around here,” John said, “who would like the song better that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can hear it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrissy said, “Hear what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind. Look over by those Dumpsters,” John said. “Wexler’s car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5 SPRTS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” I said. “Nothing to do now but wander the fuck into that abandoned building, totally unarmed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn opened the satchel and drew out a long, metal flashlight, clicked on the beam to confirm that it still worked. Then he pulled out a wadded-up hand towel and handed it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unwrapped it and found myself holding the stainless-steel automatic pistol I had stolen from the pickup during the Las Vegas thing. I had planned to ditch it, to throw it into the river or something. Not only was the weapon stolen, but for all I knew it had been used to hold up four liquor stores and shoot two policemen before I got hold of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you still have this? I thought you were gonna make it disappear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn shrugged. “Never got around to it. I keep it hidden. And I scratched off the serial numbers there. Should be safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ejected the magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Why is it loaded?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Head bought bullets for it. He borrowed it a month ago, I think he had to threaten a dude with it. Brought it right back though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrissy said, “You’re not going to shoot Danny, are you? If he’s possessed or whatever, you know that’s not his fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You belong to a church, right?” I asked. “You know anything about performing exorcisms? That sort of thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know your Bible?” John asked. “You could show us the part that’s got the spells and incantations and stuff and read them right from there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just stared at him. She heard the chorus as the bastardized song continued. Chorus now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s me in the porno\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s me in the spotlight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosing my religion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTryin’ to beat a tight-assed Jew . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrissy dug into her purse and pulled out a little black plastic thing that I thought was a flashlight but when she pressed the button a blue spark jumped across the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a Taser. A, uh, stun gun. I don’t think I’ve got anything else in here.” She sifted around in the purse. “Nail file . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur hearts hammering, the three of us approached the sprawling building, none of us making a sound other than the crunching of gravel under our shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made my way to Wexler’s car, edged toward the window with the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead was the tall, rusted metal framework that I supposed was going to be a fancy awning for the main entrance. Beneath it was a row of huge windows and a bank of doors, all boarded over with plywood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the graffiti, something had been painted in bold letters two feet high. On closer inspection we saw the letters were twitching, moving ever so slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple hundred of them had slimed their way up the boards to spell out a phrase that I was certain was right from “Korrok,” whoever he was:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOUR DOOMED\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis spelling, not mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne panel of plywood had been pulled partially off its frame, presumably by Mr. Wexler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, “Dave, you got the gun. You should go in first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got the stereo! Besides, if I go in and get killed right off the bat, you’re all fucked. But if you get attacked I can rescue you with the gun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe Krissy should go, like as a decoy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved toward the opening but I shouldered her aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stink hit me one foot inside the place. Rot and mildew and dead rodents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe empty storefronts were boarded up, giving us a single, impossibly long corridor. The floor was littered with paper cups and candy wrappers and cigarette butts and other teenager droppings. I saw a used condom under my shoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur only light was from a huge skylight running down the length of the building. Parts of it had been boarded over, other sections were spiderwebbed with breaks and clouded with mounds of accumulated dead leaves. When we walked under the boarded-over sections of the glass we found ourselves in pools of absolute blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn lit the flashlight. He fired up the stereo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Home Sweet Home” by Mötley Crüe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe plunged ahead, a creeping pool of light and music in the dead space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoes scraping on floor tile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wexler?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached a bend in the mall, the hall taking a ninety-degree turn to the right. Blood was pumping in my ears. Palm sweat greased the handle of the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead of us, shoes scraping tile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadowy shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as tall as a man. It passed into a shaft of moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn screamed a profanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunshots hammered the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrissy shrieked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYellow flashes from the gun barrel. Glimpses of brown fur and antlers in the darkness. A deer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it had been one, once. This creature had grown several new sets of eyes. Each of its antlers ended in a snapping set of lobsterish claws. It looked like it had a novelty chandelier from a seafood restaurant on its head. Looking back, I have to say it was the stupidest-looking thing I had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt stumbled as it got close and my wild shots started to land, blossoms of red opening up on the beast’s chest and neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt tried to turn away, showing me its rib cage and taking several broadside shots for its trouble. The mutated deer collapsed, thrashing on the dirty floor tiles and leaving red smears like a child’s finger painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt twitched one last time, and was still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands were shaking. The gun looked broken, the top half of it pushed an inch from the rest of the mechanism. After fiddling with it for a few minutes I realized this is what the gun naturally did when it was empty. I pushed in the button to release the empty magazine. Great job conserving ammo so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe approached the fallen was-a-deer, kicking brass casings as we went. I pushed at its furry hide with my foot. As solid as a dead deer. I turned to Krissy, asked, “You see it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, eyes still wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, look!” yelped John. “Look at its ass!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deer’s ass was melting, puddling on the floor like candle wax. In less than a minute the entire hindquarters were a brown pool on the floor, the ribs quickly caving in like a punctured balloon at a Thanksgiving Day parade. As the front legs and head flattened, the liquid residue from the hindquarters dissolved before our eyes, leaving dry floor behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one part that didn’t melt, a section in the middle of the animal that protruded from the pink and brown slime. Square. A box about six inches to a side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scooted it away with my foot. Heavy. When the goo dissolved from it, I saw that it was a green-and-yellow box marked . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shotgun shells,” John said. “Too bad we don’t have a . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice trailed off as his gaze shifted to a lone wooden crate over by the wall, presumably full of floor tile or coils of electrical wiring and other mall fixin’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn delivered a series of hard kicks to the side of the crate, cracking and splintering the boards. He plunged his hands into the opening and pulled out a dark length of plastic and metal that I had already guessed was a shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowls emerged from the darkness, followed by the scratches of claws. Many claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clenched the empty gun in my hand, pointing it stupidly into the darkness. John frantically loaded the shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“WHOA, LOOK AT the time!” said Arnie, standing to leave. “Mr. Wong, it’s been a hell of a lot of fun talkin’ to you. But I should start my drive back; I got six hours ahead of me. The piece may not run next month, but soon. They may want to run it on Halloween, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Arnie, please. You came all this way. Don’t walk away thinking what you’re thinking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dug his car keys from his pocket. “I’m not here to judge, I said that already. The shotgun, hey, the roofers could have left that behind. And maybe that deer got fed up with the local hunters and ate one of them, including the shotgun shells the poor guy had in his pocket.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out a cigar from an inside pocket and jammed it into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it’s nothing like that. The thing in Wexler, it had the power to call up on these things I guess, to try to kill us. But I think Wexler was still inside there, too, and he was working from the other end, helping us out. He was on the sauce, you know, and he used it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After you told me the part about Las Vegas, you know how I said it was the stupidest story I had ever heard?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t say that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I was thinkin’ it. But I’ve decided I owe that Las Vegas story an apology because this last thing made that one look like The Grapes of Wrath. I’ll see ya around.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/john-dies-at-the-end-john-dies-at-the-end-1/page-39.html","bookId":2487,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:25 PM"}
