But it mostly…excites me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was upright, his hand gripping her hair with enough force her scalp stung. “You like that take-charge side of me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispered, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get undressed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis command sent a shiver through her. She rolled off his lap and rested on her knees on the blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tugged his T-shirt over his head. Withdrew a condom from his front pocket and shucked his jeans and boxers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia was so busy watching Tell reveal his magnificent body that she’d forgotten what she was supposed to be doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he had to do was lift a brow at her and she started stripping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she was unsure what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re kinda far away. C’mere.” Tell rolled down onto his back. Grabbing her hand, he murmured, “I liked how you were on me before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On top?” she asked, wondering if he could see her blushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. And hurry up, ’cause I’m dying to see how beautiful you are when you’re ridin’ me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straddled him, pressing her palms against his pectorals, squeezing that warm, hard flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell reached up and traced the inner rim of her lip with his thumb. “Put me inside you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCircling her hand around his shaft, she adjusted her hips. The instant the tip connected with her opening, Tell’s hands landed on her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Slowly,” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia lowered herself a little at a time, aware of how wet she was. Aware of Tell’s hungry gaze on her. She looked up when his cock was inside her to the root.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put your hands on my thighs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArching back gave him full access to her clit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ride me like this. Bring me all the way out of that tight pussy and then take me deep again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time she lifted her hips, letting his shaft slide out, he’d swirl his thumb over her clit. Her body quivered from the effort as she kept the maddeningly slow pace. Her thighs were sweating. Aching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he pumped his up to meet her downstroke, she switched gears. She fell forward, dropping her hands above his shoulders. Sliding so they were skin on skin, which felt amazing. God. He was so pretty to look at as she was on top of him, fucking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands cupped her ass. “Impatient?” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. This is so good.” She rolled her torso, her breasts rubbing against his chest hair as she increased the tempo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo sharp smacks on her bare ass surprised her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe froze. “What was that for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For takin’ over.” He smacked her butt cheeks again. “Some other time when you get it in your mind to be in charge, I’m gonna put you over my knee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer pussy clenched at the image of lying across his lap as his big, rough hands connecting with her butt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. “Oh, sweetness, you’d like that, wouldn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,” she said, gliding back down his body like a cat, pushing him in deep. Then almost kissing him as she pushed herself forward. “But I’d really like to see that holy shit look in your eyes when I make you come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed a kiss to her lips. “Take us there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer instincts took over. She picked up the pace, sliding skin on skin until their torsos were damp and sticking together. Mouth dry, head roaring, every inch of her skin prickled with awareness as she pushed toward that point of no return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell whispered, “Breathe, baby. Lemme help you.” His grip on her ass tightened as he helped her move to shorter, faster strokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat little changeup flipped a switch, sending her straight over the edge. “Yes. Oh God.” She threw her head back in sweet anticipation of that first hard pulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe automatic sprinklers went off as she started to come. She gasped from the shock of the cold water spraying on her hot skin. The tick tick tick of the sprinklers was synchronized to the contractions in her pussy, to the throbbing in her clit, and to Tell’s sucking kisses on the pulse point in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the climax slowed, she was soaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Tell flipped her on her back, trying to protect her from the sprinkler stream. Resting on his forearms above her head, fucking her with power, but tenderness dominated his eyes. “Watch what you do to me.” He groaned and his back bowed as he peered at her from beneath lowered lashes. His mouth tight with tension, then slack with pleasure as he emptied himself into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t time to cling to each other, whispering sweet words as bodies and breathing returned to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell twitched. “Goddammit. That sprinkler head is spraying me right in the ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia snickered. “You won’t need an enema.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe you said that. Just for that…” He withdrew from her body and rolled to his feet, ducking out of the way so the sprinklers hit her from every direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrieked and scrambled upright, grabbing the corners of the blanket before she ran to the patio, where Tell was shaking with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shoulda left your clothes out there,” she grumbled, dropping the wet bundle on the cement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably.” He pulled her wet, naked body against his. “But won’t you feel a little bad for me, drivin’ home in wet clothes? While you’re all nice and warm, wrapped in a fluffy robe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope. Not a bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whacked her ass and covered her mouth, stopping her squeak of protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kiss was pure seduction. So hot her lips seemed to burn. So sweet her teeth ached. So thorough she felt as if he’d taken her body again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just can’t get enough of you, Georgia.” He gifted her forehead, temples, cheekbones, jaw, the corners of her mouth with soft kisses. He murmured, “Being with you… There’s never been anything like it for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor her either. And he seemed to be as perplexed by it as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate that I hafta go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to wait until your clothes are dry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah. I’ve worn worse than this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers traced the cut muscles in his chest. “At least let me give you a ride to your truck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The walk will do me good. But I appreciate the offer.” He snatched his wet clothes and only grimaced a little when he slid them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she returned from donning a robe, Tell lounged by the front door. “Thanks for supper tonight. And for—” his hungry gaze swept her from head to toe, “—dessert.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anytime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will I see you tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis knuckles followed the curve of her jaw. “Oh, I want.” Then he slipped out into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia spent way more time on her hair and makeup for the reunion than she’d planned. Pointless fussing as she was torn on which image she wanted to project to her classmates. That Georgia Hotchkiss hadn’t changed in appearance at all? Or that Georgia Hotchkiss had changed completely?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scrutinized her reflection. Her hair, a solid foot shorter than in her teenage years, was sleek and professional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. Why did she want to look like she’d just stepped out of a board meeting? Why wouldn’t she prefer to look sexy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDammit. None of this shit mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia fluffed up her sleek style into a tousled look. As if she’d just rolled out of bed after a bout of hot, hair-pulling sex. Tell would appreciate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing a sleeveless, form-fitting dress in a pale blue. With a modest bodice, the fabric was shirred from the empire waist to the froth of tulle at the hemline, two inches above her knees. With her funky platform heels in a blue cheetah print and a rhinestone clutch, she’d probably added fashion violation to her list of worries, which was already too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Deck for the first time since the dissolution of their marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Tara-Lee, pregnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the girls in her class who hated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing RJ’s friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia gave herself one last look and headed downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell hadn’t waited for her to open the door; he’d just waltzed right in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd wasn’t it ironic he was standing at the bottom of the stairs waiting for her, just like she’d seen in all those teen movies where the guy showed up to take the girl to the prom? To top it off, Tell had a look on his face she’d never seen on any man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My God, Georgia. You are a fucking goddess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped her before she reached the bottom stair, setting his hands on her hips. He still topped her by a couple inches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look so damn perfect I’m afraid to touch you. Afraid I’ll muss you up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoes dangled from her right index finger. She propped her forearms on his broad shoulders and let them hang between his shoulder blades as she rubbed her nose to his. “I love it when you muss me up. In fact, if you wanna ditch this whole reunion idea right now, I’ll take you upstairs and let you muss me up however you want. All night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell laughed. “Mighty tempting offer, hot lips. Now you gonna let me give you a proper kiss?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth came down on hers with more force than she’d expected. He dove in for a tongue-teasing, openmouthed kiss that utterly overwhelmed her. His fingers tightened on her hips. And he blew every one of her circuits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he eased back and made her weak-kneed with his dimpled grin. “See? I didn’t muss you up at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot on the outside. But on the inside? Different story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just have to put my shoes on.” She used the newel post for support as she shoved her feet in the heels and checked out Tell’s attire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black western-cut sport coat worn over a pristine white shirt, a bolo tie at his neck. Jeans, boots and his black hat. Yummy. “You are quite the head-turner, Mr. McKay.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissin-tell-rough-riders-13/page-25.html","bookId":2694,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:54 AM"}
