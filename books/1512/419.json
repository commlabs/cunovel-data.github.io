The other three Hobbits looked at each other and followed them. YinKong, Richard, and ChengXiao followed after. A Caucasian man from team Northern Ice Land hesitated a bit before going. These nine people crossed the elves\u0027 defense line and into the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng didn\u0027t have the effort to care about other people. He attacked with the intention of slashing the Ringwraith in halves but the dark sword defended against the light blade from Tiger\u0027s Soul. So after the two weapons clashed, he only cut off an arm from the Ringwraith. As he raised sword for a follow up attack, the Ringwraith pulled the lead rope and the horse jumped back. The anti-gravity attribute proved its usefulness. The skeleton horse stood on a tree\u0027s branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng also leaped back because three other Ringwraiths charged at him. Neither of them was slower than the first one. He wouldn\u0027t stand a chance if he didn\u0027t use Destruction against them. And the most important factor was their mobility given the anti-gravity attribute. The Ringwraiths\u0027 attacks became unpredictable. If it were a one on one fight on the ground, he could take on the Ringwraiths with just Explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heng! Where are your arrows? Give me fire support! Where is everyone else? Hie Hie no Mi and Goro Goro no Mi are all f*cking high tier enhancements! Are you waiting for the Ringwraiths to close in and get killed?\" Zheng was feeling a chill when he fought the three Ringwraiths alone. Just then, three more Ringwraiths came out from the top of the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready!\" The elves\u0027 leader yelled again. The hundred archers around him were recruited just for the occasion but they could tell these were well trained fighters. The arrows rained down on the nearest four Ringwraiths on the elves\u0027 leader\u0027s command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree of the Ringwraiths blocked with shields. The arrows couldn\u0027t penetrate through. The one with missing arm dodged with difficulty. After the rain of arrows, this Ringwraith and its skeleton horse were turned into hedgehogs. Its helm was nearly destroyed. Everyone heard a wail that seemingly came from the abyss as the Ringwraith fell. Black mist rose to the air. The skeleton horse also wailed and turned into a pile of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very impressive rain of arrow. Heng, what\u0027s wrong? Hurry and shoot!\" Seeing that a Ringwraith was killed, Zheng yelled with joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was staring at the remaining six Ringwraiths. The Ringwraiths stopped moving. They all looked up to the sky. The mist split into six and flowed into the Ringwraiths\u0027 helms through the openings. Once the mist was gone, the Ringwraiths\u0027 shields grew larger and thicker, their swords were enveloped in a dense mist, so much that they almost couldn\u0027t make out the mist. It seemed like black sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elves\u0027 leader frowned. \"It\u0027s just like the records indicated. The Ringwraiths aren\u0027t living creatures. They are monsters existing on the border of life and death. Their lives are connected. When one dies, his power and life will be given to the remaining Ringwraiths. When only one Ringwraith remains, he will be the monster that Sauron wanted. The true Ringwraith will be the strongest general under Sauron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe veterans didn\u0027t have time to delve into their questions when faced with six powered up Ringwraiths. They had began to consider backing away since these Ringwraiths weren\u0027t going after them. There was no need to put their lives on the line for little reward. Some people from team Northern Ice Land and team Africa stepped back. Even Gando followed their steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you retarded? Do you know what happens if the they seize the One Ring? Sauron will be revived!\" Neos was the first to shout out. \"What is our mission in this movie? Reach Mordor with all five teams! If Sauron waits there, do you think he will be easier than the final Ringwraith? You won\u0027t even know how you die at that point. It\u0027s better to follow the plot so Sauron never gets the One Ring. That\u0027s the only way we can safely complete this mission!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe veterans hesitated. Gungnir shouted. \"Sci-fi weapon users back off. You aren\u0027t useful here. Everyone get ready to fight with full strength. Zheng, how many Ringwraiths can you take at once? I mean at their current strength.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng didn\u0027t turn around. He was staring at the Ringwraiths. \"Two, maybe three. I don\u0027t have any way to take more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGungnir immediately brought out an ice energy stone. \"I can probably take on one with Ice Age. Hawfor can take one with with Goro Goro no Mi and everyone else\u0027s help. We will have to leave the rest to the elves. But f*ck. It\u0027s only the beginning of the movie and we are encountering enemies so powerful. I can\u0027t imagine what\u0027s going to come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng also sighed. He was about to respond then the Ringwraiths suddenly charged at him. Their speed was faster than before, almost reaching his speed in Explosion. They still ignored gravity so he couldn\u0027t predict their movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo green and two silver arrows flew toward the Ringwraiths. The elves\u0027 leader and Heng fired simultaneously. Then the girl archer and the elf patriarch fired their arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng and the elves\u0027 leader\u0027s explosive shots blasted the shields of two Ringwraiths. A rain of arrows followed. Everyone watched waiting for these two Ringwraiths to get buried by the arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the Ringwraiths really did grew stronger. The swung their swords at the incoming arrows. The swords had strong corrosive attribute. The arrows would get corroded on contact. After the rain of arrows, only a few were pierced into the Ringwraiths and their skeleton horses. None hit their fatal spots. The front three Ringwraiths were only fifty meters away from the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot! Shoot!\" Zheng defended in front of everyone with Tiger\u0027s Soul. He cried with madness as the Ringwraiths were getting close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng suddenly brought out an arrow. He put it beside his lips and blew the arrow. Then he drew his bow. A strong aura exploded from him and shocked the girl archer. Everyone except from Zheng turned their attention to him. Heng released the arrow then collapsed like he was exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one heard the usual sound of an arrow flying through the air nor saw even a trace of the arrow. All they saw was the nearest Ringwraith shattered. The arrow went from the underside of the horse, flew upward and out from the Ringwraith\u0027s neck. The Ringwraith shattered in midair before it fell to the ground. This was Heng\u0027s final attack, Charged Shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good!\" Zheng knew Heng could no longer fight. However, there were only five Ringwraiths left and two without shields. Without another second of thinking, he used Instant Destruction and Soru. He moved past the shieldless Ringwraiths and to the three behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoru was so fast that he went past first two Ringwraiths in just the blink of an eye. The elven archers shot their arrows again because the Ringwraiths stopped in place while they were growing. Gungnir also crushed the energy stone and charged up. People from both team Northern Ice Land and Africa did the same. No one would give up on these points and ranked rewards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng used Soru again. He used the force from this speed and leaped from a tree. The tree instantly trembled violently. And Zheng jumped up into mid air. The light blade extended from Tiger\u0027s Soul and he slashed at a Ringwraith. But this Ringwraith wasn\u0027t frozen in place as he thought. His dark sword blocked in front when the light blade was only two meters away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClank! Zheng\u0027s hand trembled. The powerful force that came through Tiger\u0027s Soul made his hand hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive Ringwraiths left but their power had became much stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-16-chapter-4-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-16-chapter-5-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-16-chapter-4-04","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM"}
