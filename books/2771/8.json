I need something to cheer me up,\" I say. \"There\u0027s a problem with my trip to Spain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrina gasps. \"Oy, vat hoppened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"It\u0027s a long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I come bring pie right now, da?\" Irina says before disappearing into the kitchen. She comes back a few minutes later with a huge slab of pie. I can tell before I taste it this is going to be a best-selling dessert at Auntie Mae\u0027s Diner next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I take the first bite, I say \"You\u0027re the best, Irina,\" and dig my fork into the white moistness speckled with graham cracker, caramel, and chocolate chips. She always waits next to me until I swallow the first bite and give her my analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s awesome,\" I say, savoring the moistness of the creamy part and the soft crunch of the chips blended with the smooth caramel and crumbly texture of the graham crackers. \"One of your best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrina whisks herself back into the kitchen with a flutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see Irina found you,\" Mom says as she holds a tray full of double-decker platters. \"By the time you finish the pie, I\u0027ll be done here and we can go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as my mom places the platters expertly in front of the hungry bowlers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I take my second forkful, another customer walks in. It\u0027s an old lady with grey hair, white pants, and a turquoise jacket. Mr. Reynolds greets her with a kiss on her cheek. \"Mom, why didn\u0027t you tell me you were coming?\" he asks the lady. \"Wait, where\u0027s Gladys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fired her yesterday,\" the lady says. \"She was a pain in the you-know-what. Besides, I don\u0027t need a caretaker. I made it here without one, didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reynolds looks worried. \"Mom, why can\u0027t you get along with anyone I hire to help you? I swear you just fire them to spite me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old lady stands up straight with her chin in the air like a three-year-old. \"I don\u0027t need any help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a heart condition,\" Mr. Reynolds says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waves her hand in the air, dismissing his concern. \"Who says?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do doctors know, anyway? They call it practicing medicine because that\u0027s all they ever do. Practice. If you\u0027d visit me once in a while, you\u0027d know I\u0027m doing fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just saw you on Saturday.\" He huffs, then says, \"Are you hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you have on special this week?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Irina will make you anything you want, Mom. Name it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe narrows her eyes at him. \"Corn and a big, juicy steak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reynolds shakes his head and chuckles. \"Mom, you have diverticulosis and a heart condition. Try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re no fun, Lou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re a barrel of laughs. Just sit down at a table. Wait ... follow me and you can meet Linda\u0027s daughter. You\u0027ve never met her before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at the pie, trying not to give away the fact I\u0027ve been eavesdropping on their conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, this is my mother,\" Mr. Reynolds announces. \"Mom, this is Linda\u0027s daughter Margaret. Everyone calls her Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and hold out my hand. \"Nice to meet you, Mrs. Reynolds. Are you the Auntie Mae?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old lady takes my hand and shakes it. \"Dearie, Mae was the name of my son\u0027s first dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way! I look to Mr. Reynolds for confirmation. He\u0027s smiling sheepishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" he whispers. \"Shh, it\u0027s a secret. If the town finds out I named my restaurant after a dog, this place will be deserted within a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI highly doubt that. Auntie Mae\u0027s is crowded almost every night. Besides, there\u0027s not another diner within a ten-mile radius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know Linda had a daughter. How old are you, Margaret?\" she asks, ignoring the fact that her son told her everyone calls me Maggie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventeen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She just started her senior year of high school, Mom,\" Mr. Reynolds announces loudly, as if his mother is hard of hearing. \"And she\u0027s going to Spain in January for school. Why don\u0027t you sit with her while she tells you all about it. I\u0027ll go in the back and have Irina fix you something to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her not to make it too healthy,\" Mrs. Reynolds orders before sitting down on the opposite bench from me. She eyes my plate. \"Lou, tell Irina to cut me a generous slice of that pie, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think Mr. Reynolds was listening to her last request, or maybe he wanted to let her think he wasn\u0027t listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman places her purse beside her in the booth, then looks at me. She doesn\u0027t smile, she doesn\u0027t frown. She tilts her head, as if trying to figure out what\u0027s inside my thoughts. \"Why do you want to leave Paradise so badly?\" she asks, almost as if she really can read my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just do,\" I say, hoping she\u0027ll leave it at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe makes a tsking noise with her tongue. \"If you don\u0027t want to talk about it, just say so. No sense in beating around the bush.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been busy chipping the nail polish off my fingers, but I stop and look at Mrs. Reynolds. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old lady claps her hands together. \"Fine. If you don\u0027t want to talk about it, we won\u0027t talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing standing between me and this woman is the pie I have and she wants. And awkward silence. It\u0027s not that I\u0027m trying to be rude, I just don\u0027t want to put into words how my life has become one disappointment after another. It\u0027s almost as if misery is following me and I\u0027ve been cursed. If I only knew how to break that curse ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you have your reasons for not wanting to talk about it. I can\u0027t imagine what those reasons are, but you\u0027re probably better off being silent and brooding about it rather than talking it out with someone who has nothing better to do than listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shove another forkful of pie in my mouth and focus on the salt shaker at the end of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want the salt?\" Mrs. Reynolds asks, knowing full well I don\u0027t have salt on my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They revoked my scholarship,\" I blurt out, then look at the old lady sitting across from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t have a look of pity on her face like I expected. She looks kind of... well, angry. \"Well, why would they go and do a thing like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take my time chewing and swallowing, then look up. Mrs. Reynolds has her little hands folded on the top of the table and she\u0027s looking intently at me, waiting for my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I applied for an athletic scholarship, but I\u0027m not on a team anymore so it\u0027s been revoked. I can go, but now I\u0027ll have to pay tuition we can\u0027t afford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods her head, lets out a long breath, then leans back in the booth. \"I see. Well, dearie, maybe one day your luck will change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, right. All I need is a little magic dust and a fairy godmother. I\u0027m not holding my breath for either of those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb, I hope you passed the tests,\" my mom calls out from the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m washing my hands for the third time tonight. I\u0027ve got paint up to my elbows, compliments of my community service job. The old couple from the senior center signed up to have their kitchen painted a bright pink to match their fake pink roses on their kitchen table. \"I tried my best,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s hope your best was good enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dry my hands on a towel, wondering when she\u0027ll stop treating me like a stranger. One day I\u0027m going to cut through her plastic exterior. One day soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rings. My mom answers, then hands it to me. \"It\u0027s for you. It\u0027s Damon.\" I take the phone. \"Hey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The manager from The Trusty Nail said you were late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, shit. \"I had to stay after school because--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard it all, don\u0027t waste your breath,\" he barks out, cutting me off. \"Zero tolerance. You sign in for community service on time. Period. You got it?\" I got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This goes on your record, Caleb. I can petition a judge to have you sent back to the DOC. Keep screwing up and I\u0027ll do it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s still babbling, but I\u0027m too pissed off to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... I told you to be a model citizen and be on time for your job. You let me down. Don\u0027t let it happen again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t my fault,\" I argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I had a dime for every time I heard those words, I\u0027d be a millionaire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardass. \"I get it, Damon. Loud and clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ll check in with you tomorrow,\" he says, then hangs up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I put the phone down, I realize Mom\u0027s been listening to my half of the conversation. She\u0027s staring at me, but there\u0027s an emptiness in her eyes--like she\u0027s not all there. \"Is everything okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep,\" I say. Just peachy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" She grabs her purse off the couch. \"I\u0027m off\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto the grocery store. I\u0027m going to bake my Spaghetti Spectacular for the Fall Festival Saturday night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom is always volunteering for shit. She loves the attention, I guess. Her Spaghetti Spectacular dish has won the Ladies\u0027 Auxiliary best recipe award every year. She\u0027s even got the awards neatly stacked on top of the mantle in the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom flies out the door in her usual flurry of chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s nuts, you know,\" Leah says from the kitchen doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday my sister is wearing black jeans with chains dripping from them. The end of one chain is attached to one of her pant legs and the other end is attached to the other pant leg. How can she walk like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch Mom drive down the driveway as I look out the living room window. \"Tell me about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think things will ever get back to normal?\" Leah asks, hope filling her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027d better.\" I\u0027m going to spend my days trying, starting right now with my sister. She\u0027s about to walk back into the kitchen, but I blurt out, \"Do you ever talk to, you know, Maggie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe freezes, then shakes her head slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not once since the accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head again. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it, Caleb. Please don\u0027t make me talk about it. Not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When, then?\" She doesn\u0027t answer. \"One day we\u0027re going to discuss it, Leah. You can\u0027t avoid the conversation forever.\" I put my jacket on, grab a basketball from the garage, and head outside. I avoid even looking at the Armstrongs house as I head for the park in the opposite direction. I need to shoot some baskets to clear my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy screwed-up sister is the one who needs group therapy. I\u0027m the one who was locked up and everyone who stayed home is a frickin\u0027 nutcase. Oh, the comic irony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day I\u0027m sitting in the principal\u0027s office. Mom and Dad had to come with me to hear whether or not I\u0027ve passed the tests. God this sucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeyer opens a folder and stares at it. Folders suck, too. Especially ones that have anything having to do with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe defense lawyer assigned to my case after the accident had a folder outlining the accident, my arrest, and the history of my life. The warden in the DOC had a folder much the same. It\u0027s like I wasn\u0027t a guy anymore. I\u0027d been reduced to words written by others about me. Even Damon relies on a damn folder. I could tell them a hell of a lot more than any folder could say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While Caleb did surprisingly well in almost all of the exams,\" Meyer directs his attention to my dad, \"he hasn\u0027t passed the requirements for social studies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGee, that\u0027s no surprise considering what Leah said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-8.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
