It\u0027s toys is all it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s the computer? A bigger toy than the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"It\u0027s a tool, Buell. But why do I be wastin\u0027 my breath tryin\u0027 to get through to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why indeed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought we might get to see a knockout in the next round, but it was clear halfway through that it wasn\u0027t going to happen. The kid had shaken off the effects of the knockdown, and my guy was slower, having a hard time getting his punches to go where he wanted them. I knew how he felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang, and Elaine picked it up in the other room. On the TV screen, my guy shook off a punch and waded in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElaine came in, a hard-to-read expression on her face. \"It\u0027s for you,\" she said. \"It\u0027s Adrian Whitfield. Do you want to call him back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ll talk to him,\" I said, rising. \"I wonder what he wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian Whitfield was a rising star, a criminal defense attorney who\u0027d been getting an increasing number of high-profile clients in the past couple of years, and a corresponding increase in media attention. In the course of the summer I\u0027d seen him three times on the TV screen. Roger Ailes had him on to discuss the notion that the jury system was outmoded and due for replacement. (His position was a tentative maybe in the civil courts, a flat no in criminal cases.) Then he was on Larry King twice, first to talk about the latest star-spangled homicide case in Los Angeles, and then to argue the merits of the death penalty. (He was unequivocally against it.) Most recently I\u0027d seen him along with Raymond Gruliow on Charlie Rose, all three of them caught up in an earnest discussion of the question of the lawyer as popular celebrity. Hard-Way Ray had put the issue in historical context, telling some wonderful stories about Earl Rodgers and Bill Fallen and Clarence Darrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had done some work for Whitfield on Ray Gruliow\u0027s recommendation, running checks on witnesses and potential jurors, and I liked him well enough to hope to do more. It was a little late for him to be calling me on business, but the nature of the business is such that you get calls at all hours. I didn\u0027t mind the interruption, especially if it meant work. It had been a slow summer thus far. That wasn\u0027t all bad, Elaine and I had been able to get away for some long weekends in the country, but I was beginning to get rusty. The signs were there in the way I read the morning papers, obsessively interested in the local crime news and itching to get mixed up in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the phone in the kitchen and said, \"Matthew Scudder,\" announcing myself to whoever had placed the call for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he\u0027d made it himself. \"Matt,\" he said. \"Adrian Whitfield. I hope I didn\u0027t get you at a bad time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was watching two fellows hitting each other,\" I said. \"Without much enthusiasm, on my part or theirs. What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good question. Tell me something, would you? How do I sound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you sound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My voice isn\u0027t shaky, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think it was,\" he said, \"but it ought to be. I got a phone call a little while ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From that idiot with the News, but perhaps I shouldn\u0027t call him that. For all I know he\u0027s a friend of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew a few people at the Daily News. \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marty McGraw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly a friend,\" I said. \"I met him once or twice, but neither of us had much of a chance to make an impression on the other. I doubt he\u0027d remember, and the only reason I remember is I\u0027ve been reading his column twice a week for I don\u0027t know how many years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t he in there three times a week?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t usually read the News on Sundays.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got your hands full with the Times, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Full of ink, generally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that something? You\u0027d think they could print the damned newspaper so it doesn\u0027t come off on your hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027If they can put a man on the moon…\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it. Can you believe there\u0027s a newsstand in Grand Central sells disposable white Pliofilm gloves to wear while you read the damn thing?\" He drew a breath. \"Matt, I\u0027m avoiding the point, and my guess is you already know what the point is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a pretty good idea. \"I suppose he got another of those letters. From Will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From Will, yes. And the subject of that letter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would have to be one of your clients,\" I said, \"but I wouldn\u0027t want to try to guess which one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they\u0027re all such estimable men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wouldn\u0027t have a clue,\" I said. \"I haven\u0027t followed your cases that closely, except for the couple I\u0027ve worked on. And I don\u0027t know how Will\u0027s mind works, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027s an interesting mind. I would say it works very well, certainly well enough for the purpose at hand.\" He paused, and I knew what he was going to say an instant before he said it. \"He wasn\u0027t writing about one of my clients. He was writing about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, lots of things,\" he said. \"I could read it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got the letter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A copy of it. McGraw faxed it to me. He called me first, before he called the cops, and he faxed me a copy of the letter. That was actually damned considerate of him. I shouldn\u0027t have called him a jerk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I first brought his name up, I said-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You called him an idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right at that. Well, I don\u0027t suppose he\u0027s either one, or if he is he\u0027s a considerate specimen of the breed. You asked what Will said. \u0027An Open Letter to Adrian Whitfield.\u0027 Let\u0027s see. \u0027You have devoted your life to keeping guilty men out of prison.\u0027 Well, he\u0027s wrong about that. They\u0027re all innocent until proven guilty, and whenever guilt was proved to the satisfaction of a jury, they went to prison. And stayed there, unless I could get a reversal on appeal. In another sense, of course, he\u0027s quite correct. Most of the men and women I\u0027ve represented did what they were accused of doing, and I guess that\u0027s enough to make them guilty in the eyes of Will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his beef with you, exactly? Doesn\u0027t he think the accused are entitled to a defense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t want to read you the whole thing,\" he said, \"and his position\u0027s hard to state with precision, but you could say he takes exception to the fact that I\u0027m good at what I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If\u0027s funny,\" he said. \"He doesn\u0027t even mention Richie Vollmer, and that\u0027s what got him started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, you were Vollmer\u0027s attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was indeed, and I got my share of hate mail when he managed to dodge the wheels of Justice, but there\u0027s nothing in here about my role in getting him off. Let\u0027s what he says. He says I put the police on trial, which is hardly unique on my part. Our mutual friend Gruliow does that all the time. It\u0027s often the best strategy with a minority defendant. He also says I put the victim on trial. I think he\u0027s talking about Naomi Tarloff.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might surprise you to know I\u0027ve had some second thoughts about that case. But that\u0027s neither here nor there. I defended the Ellsworth boy the best I knew how, and even so I didn\u0027t get him off. The jury convicted the little son of a bitch. He\u0027s upstate serving fifteen-to-twenty-five, but that\u0027s nothing to the sentence our friend Will has imposed. He says he\u0027s going to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I assume McGraw went straight to the cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With the briefest pause to ring me up and then fax me the thing. As a matter of fact he made a Xerox copy and faxed that. He didn\u0027t want to screw up any physical evidence by running the original through his fax machine. Then he called the cops, and then I heard from them. I had two detectives over here for an hour, and I can call them idiots without regard to the possibility that they\u0027re friends of yours. Did I have any enemies? Were there clients who were bitter about my efforts on their behalf? For Christ\u0027s sake, the only embittered clients I\u0027ve got are the ones behind bars, where nobody has to worry about them, least of all myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have to ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so,\" he said, \"but isn\u0027t it fairly obvious that this isn\u0027t a guy with a personal motive? He\u0027s already killed four people, and he nailed the first one because Marty McGraw told him to. I don\u0027t know what earned me a place on his shit list, but it\u0027s not because he thought I charged him too much for keeping him out of jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they offer you protection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They talked about posting a guard in my outer office. I can\u0027t see what good that\u0027s going to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It couldn\u0027t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but it couldn\u0027t help all that much either. I need to know what to do, Matt. I\u0027ve got no experience in this area. Nobody ever tried to kill me. The closest I\u0027ve come to this was five or six years ago when a man named Paul Masland offered to punch me in the nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A disaffected client?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-uh. A stockbroker with a snootful. He accused me of fucking his wife. Jesus, I was one of the few men in western Connecticut who hadn\u0027t had a shot at her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He swung and missed, and a couple of guys grabbed his arms, and I said the hell with it and went home. The next time I ran into him we both acted like nothing had ever happened. Or maybe he wasn\u0027t acting, because he\u0027d been pretty drunk that night. It\u0027s possible he didn\u0027t remember a thing. You think I should have told the two detectives about Paul?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you think there\u0027s a chance he could have written that letter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027d be a neat trick,\" he said, \"because the poor bastard\u0027s been dead for a year and a half. A stroke or a heart attack, I forget which, but he went in a minute, whichever it was. Son of a bitch never knew what hit him. Not like our friend Will. He\u0027s a fucking rattlesnake, isn\u0027t he? Warning you first, letting you know what\u0027s coming. Matt, tell me what I should do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you should do? You should leave the country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not serious, are you? Even if you are it\u0027s out of the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat didn\u0027t surprise me. I said, \"Where are you? At your office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I got out of there once I got rid of the cops. I\u0027m at my apartment. You\u0027ve never been here, have you? We always met downtown. I live at… Jesus, I was wondering if I should say it over the phone. But if he\u0027s got the phone tapped he\u0027d have to know where it\u0027s installed, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly on, he\u0027d asked if his voice was shaky. It hadn\u0027t been and it still wasn\u0027t, but his anxiety was apparent in the way his conversation was becoming increasingly disjointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told me the address and I copied it down. \"Don\u0027t go anywhere,\" I said. \"Call your doorman and tell him you\u0027re expecting a visitor named Matthew Scudder, and not to let me up until after I\u0027ve shown him photo ID. And tell him I\u0027m the only visitor you\u0027re expecting, and not to let anybody else up. And tell him that includes the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let your machine screen your phone calls. Don\u0027t pick up unless you recognize the caller.
