A LUNCHEON AT SIR RICHARD BLUNT\u0027S.—THE DOG AND HIS OLD FRIEND.","content":"\u0026nbsp;We willingly leave Todd to his own reflections upon the disastrous state of his affairs, while we solicit the attention of our readers to the private house and office of Sir Richard Blunt again, in Craven Street. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The worthy magistrate had quite a party to lunch on that day, and he had fixed the hour as eleven when he wished to see his friends.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Those friends consisted of Johanna Oakley, Mark Ingestrie, Mr. and Mrs. Oakley, Colonel Jeffery, Arabella Wilmot, and Big Ben, who was, at the special request of Johanna, gladly included in the party.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A happier party than that could not very well have been found throughout the whole length and breadth of London; and there was but one slight shade of disquietude upon the face of Johanna, when she at times thought that at one o\u0027clock she would have to attend the police-office at Bow Street to give her testimony against Todd the murderer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" said Ben, \"here we are alive—all alive, and as merry as so many grigs; and all I can say is, my tulips, that I will show the wild beasteses to anybody as likes to come to the Tower, free, gratis and for nothing. Take it easy, Mr. Ingestrie, and don\u0027t be casting sheep\u0027s-eyes at Johanna. The little love of a thing ain\u0027t at all used to it—indeed, she ain\u0027t; and the only person as she lets love her above a bit, and takes it easy with, is me; so don\u0027t come any nonsense.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But, Mr. Ben,\" said Mark, \"I may look sometimes?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, now and then, if you take things easy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Old Mr. Oakley had got on his spectacles, and seemed as if he could not be done looking at Mark Ingestrie; and more than once, or twice, or thrice, the old gentleman would shake hands with him, telling him that he looked upon him quite as one risen up from the dead, in a manner of speaking.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir, you may well, indeed, look upon me as such; but I hope now for long life and happiness.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A glance at Johanna was sufficiently expressive of with whom he hoped for happiness—and that glance was returned with one of those sweet endearing looks that only those who truly love can cast one upon another.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And I, too,\" said Colonel Jeffery, \"put in my claim to the happiness of the future, for am I not blessed with one whom I feel that I can love!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stop!\" said Arabella. \"We won\u0027t have any conversation of this sort before company, colonel, if you please; so I will trouble you to be quiet.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am all submission,\" said the colonel; \"and I hope my humble conduct upon this occasion will be to you all, ladies and gentlemen, a good example of what I shall be when I am married.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was said in so comical a manner that the whole party laughed amazingly, and then Sir Richard Blunt said rather gravely—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I expect two old friends here this morning.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Old friends?\" said everybody, in surprise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. The one is the captain of the ship which brought poor Mr. Thornhill and his dog home, and who has been to Hamburgh with his vessel, and the other is the dog himself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At this moment an officer, for Sir Richard was quite wholly attended upon by the police at that private office of his, came in to say that a gentleman wanted to see him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is the worthy captain,\" said Sir Richard; \"show him in at once.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you please, Sir Richard,\" added the officer, \"there is a man, too, with a great dog who wishes to see you, and the dog has been in the hall once, and walked off with a plate of cheese-cakes and a pickled tongue that were coming in to your worship.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A roar of laughter testified to the amusement which this freak of Hector\u0027s caused, and Sir Richard said—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know any one who was so much entitled to be invited to lunch as Hector, and no doubt he thought so too; and as we had not the courtesy to open the door for him, and properly accommodate him, he has helped himself on the road, that\u0027s all.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Shall I admit him, sir?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, and the man who is with him. He is one of the witnesses who I trust will help to bring Todd to justice. Show them all in.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In a very few minutes the captain of the vessel, with whom the reader had some slight acquaintance at the beginning of this most veritable narrative, made his appearance, and Colonel Jeffery warmly shook hands with him. The dog knew the colonel and the captain likewise, and was most vociferous in his joy to see them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was an affecting thing then to see the creature pause suddenly in his manifestations of delight, and look sad and solemn, after which he uttered a dismal howl, and catching the colonel by the skirt of his coat, he tried to pull him towards the door of the room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Poor fellow,\" said the captain, \"he does not forget his master yet, I see.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No,\" said Colonel Jeffery, \"nor never will. If he had his own way now, and we would follow him, I lay any wager he would take us to Sweeney Todd\u0027s shop.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In course he would, sir,\" said the ostler. \"In course he would. Lord bless you, gemmen, if this here dog as I calls Pison, cos why he was pisoned, was only to get hold of Todd, I would not give much for his chances. You sees, gemmen, as I have kept him in good condition.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He does look well,\" said the captain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Indeed it does you great credit,\" said Colonel Jeffery; \"but his keep must cost something. There is my guinea towards it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The colonel placed a guinea in the ostler\u0027s hand, and his example was followed by all present, so that the ostler found himself growing quite a man of substance when he least expected it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Lor, Pison,\" he said, \"you\u0027ll be a fortin for a fellow yet, you will. But I hope, gemmen, as you don\u0027t mean to take him away, cos if that\u0027s the caper, here\u0027s the money agin, and I\u0027d rather keep Pison. He\u0027s got fond o\u0027 me by this time, poor fellow, and I have got fond on him, as I hav\u0027nt no other brothers and sisters or family of my own.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It would indeed be unfair,\" said the colonel, \"to deprive you of him. But tell me, are you comfortable in your situation?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Lor bless you, sir, it ain\u0027t much of a situation. Lots of hard work, and werry little for it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, if you like to come into my service and bring Hector with you—you are welcome.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, won\u0027t I, sir, above a bit. Why, Pison, we is promoted, old fellor. We is a going to a new place, where there will be no end of grub, old chap.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You shall not have any complaints to make in that department,\" said the colonel.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So then,\" said the captain, \"it is quite clear that Mr. Thornhill was murdered by that rascal of a barber?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Quite,\" replied Sir Richard Blunt, \"and it is for that murder we mean to try Todd. If, however, by any chance, he should escape conviction upon that, we will be provided with two more indictments against him, so that he is tolerably well cared for; but the murder of Mr. Thornhill is what we mean ostensibly to go upon.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s right, sir,\" said the ostler, \"and I\u0027ll bring Pison as a witness to all the blessed facts. He\u0027ll settle the business, even if the jury is half as stupid agin as usual.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He will be committed for trial this morning,\" said Sir Richard Blunt, \"for the murder of Mr. Thornhill; and that woman, Mrs. Lovett, will be arraigned as an accessory before the fact, so that there can be very little doubt of the fate of both of them; and if ever two notorious criminals deserved that the last dread sentence of the law should be carried out against them, Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett are those two.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They could not be worse,\" said the captain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, that would be impossible,\" remarked the colonel. \"I shall be glad when this gloomy tragedy is over though. The public mind will soon be filled with it, and we shall hear of nothing but of Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett, with all their sayings and doings, for the next few months to come.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is true enough,\" said Sir Richard Blunt. \"But I don\u0027t think you will find any but one feeling upon the subject, and that will be one of universal condemnation.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not a doubt of it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There is another too who will suffer the just reward of his crimes,\" said the magistrate glancing at Mrs. Oakley.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She shook her head and sighed, for she shrunk naturally from the awfully responsible share she was condemned to have in the conviction of Mr. Lupin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will do my duty,\" she said, \"in that dreadful piece of business. The guilt of Lupin, although not so extensive as Todd\u0027s, is to the full as great.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is indeed, madam.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah, yes!\" said Ben. \"They are a bad lot altogether, and the sooner they are hung up like a rope of ingions the better. Bless me, I always was delicate, and so was obliged to take things easy; but I have more than once looked into that horrid pie shop in Bell Yard, and thought I should like a smack of about fifteen or twenty of them, just to stay my stomach till I got home to the Tower; and what a mercy it was I never bought \u0027em.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was, indeed, my friend,\" Sir Richard said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, you may say that, my dear, sir—you may say that. With my very delicate stomach, I should have been as good as done brown if I had had \u0027em. I should have fallen a victim to the wild beasteses, the very next time as I went a-near \u0027em; and all I can say is, as I shall be uncommon glad to show these creatures to any of this company, as will come to the Tower at feeding time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben had made this liberal offer so often that the company left off thanking him for it; but the ostler whispered to him—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll come and bring Pison.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, will you though?\" said Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, to be sure I will. Who knows but he\u0027d like to see them wild beasteses, as perhaps he has only heard of \u0027em in a wery promiscous sort o\u0027 way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not a doubt of it,\" cried Ben, \"not a doubt of it—only when he does come you must tell him to take things easy, and not be discomposed at any of the roaring and bellowing, as the creatures sets up at times.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, I\u0027ll hold him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You needn\u0027t go for to hold him. Just you impress upon him afore he comes that easy does it, that\u0027s all you need do, and then he\u0027ll know very well what to do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Won\u0027t I!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The conversation was rather breaking up into small fragments, when the magistrate rose from his seat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now then,\" said Sir Richard Blunt, \"it is time for us to go to Bow Street, where I appear as a witness to-day, instead of as a magistrate.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he spoke, the clock in the office sounded the half-past twelve.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All the guests of the magistrate rose, for they knew that his duties were imperative. There was a tone of great gravity now about Sir Richard Blunt as he spoke—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I fully expect,\" he said, \"that Todd will be committed for trial and Mrs. Lovett likewise. Already she has made repeated applications to her attendants in prison, to be permitted to become evidence against Todd.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Which will surely not be permitted?\" said the colonel.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly not; the evidence against him is quite clear enough without the assistance of Mrs. Lovett, while the proofs of her criminality with him, are of too strong a character for her to be given any chance of escape.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She is a dreadful woman.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She is, indeed; but you will all of you soon see how she conducts herself now, for she will be brought up with Todd.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89680.html","bookId":510,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:26:43 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:26:43 AM"}
