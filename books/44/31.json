{"id":1223,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 31","content":"THEY WERE COMING. Five hundred they numbered … beasts with nothing but instinct and a need to destroy. Failed experiments that bore the shells of human beings but the minds of wild animals. Naked and deranged, looking like three men who were dead, or one young woman who was crouched next to her father and shuddering as she looked down upon them. It was like watching ghosts, or one\u0027s worst nightmare heading one\u0027s way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She watched the clones of herself rampaging through the streets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027re not going to die.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bottom of the tower shuddered, and they heard triumphant howling from the horde below. Sulu and Demora had bolted the door below, but it had held only a brief time. They heard it crashing in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu and Demora looked bleakly at each other, Sulu no longer having empty promises of salvation to toss around.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t want to die like that,\" Demora whispered. \"Torn apart by them … I don\u0027t want to die like that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He said nothing, but looked at her in a way that had no despair, no hopelessness … but instead pride, even defiance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is a way out, isn\u0027t there,\" she said, knowing the answer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And knowing that she knew, he simply nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked down at the drop. She could see, far below her, the bloodthirsty mob pushing its way in. The tower continued to shudder beneath the pounding of their feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s not dishonorable, is it?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because I know that\u0027s important. And I\u0027d want you to be proud of me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He smiled, keeping back the tears, to be strong for her. \"I wouldn\u0027t mind having you proud of me, either.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The tower trembled, the shouts getting louder. A few feet away from them was the opening to the stairway that led down. A door was closed over it, but it wouldn\u0027t last more than a second.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dad … I never knew before that you had tests done to make sure I was your daughter. If … if they\u0027d come back as negative … would you still have taken care of me?\" She paused. \"Feel free to lie in order to spare my feelings. I promise I won\u0027t hold it against you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. I would have made you my daughter anyway. And I\u0027d have loved you as much, and I couldn\u0027t possibly have been more proud of you than I am right now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The horde grew closer and closer. Only seconds remained before they would burst out onto the uppermost portion of the tower, and that would be the end.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Demora,\" said Sulu, \"I am … honored … to die with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To die would be a great adventure.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu frowned. \"I\u0027ve heard that. Who said that? Ch\u0027en Tu-hsui, wasn\u0027t it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No. Peter Pan.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh. Well then,\" and he rose to his feet, taking her by the hand. \"Let\u0027s fly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They stepped to the edge of the tower. The drop yawned beneath them. Beyond them was the horizon, the purple skies seemingly ready to welcome their soon-to-be-freed souls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dad … I\u0027m scared.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So am I.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you believe in life after death?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I believe in life before death.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In that case … good job.\" \"Same to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She took a deep breath and said, \"I love you, Daddy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I love you, Demora.\" And he did … perhaps, for the first time, with all his heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They braced themselves, took one last look at each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Demora leaped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Sulu didn\u0027t.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did not let go of her hand, however. Instead he clutched on desperately as Demora swung down like a pendulum, slamming into the great stone tower. Sulu held on for all he was worth, still in the tower.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Demora screeched in terror, confusion, anger, dangling with only her father\u0027s frantic grip preventing her from plunging to her death. It took a few moments for her father\u0027s shouts of \"Look! Look!\" to penetrate, and then—even as she hung there—she twisted her head around to look where he was indicating.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A shuttlecraft was hurtling through the sky, glinting in the purple light, approaching them at high speed. At the pace it was going, it would be there in ten seconds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Three seconds later, the first of the berserker clones smashed through the door. It was a clone of Taine, followed by several more of exactly the same vintage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Both hands occupied with preventing Demora from falling, Sulu kicked out frantically. The kick knocked the clone back, sending him crashing into others coming in behind him. They were shrieking, howling, and they converged on Sulu from all sides.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu kicked out again, knocking one off his feet. Another grabbed at Sulu\u0027s face and Sulu bit him, sinking his teeth in and drawing blood. But more were coming and Sulu was out of time …\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the shuttlecraft was directly beneath them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Breathing a prayer, Sulu let go. Demora dropped five feet and slammed into the roof of the shuttle. She came near to skidding off, but then she managed to clamber back up. \"Dad!\" she screamed, \"Dad!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were all over him now. Sulu couldn\u0027t pull free of them. His hand was outstretched to Demora, but they seemed separated by a distance of miles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The door of the shuttlecraft suddenly slid open, and Captain John Harriman was hanging half out of the doorway. He was holding a phaser and, angling it upward, fired. He nailed one of the clones, blasting him backward, and then another, and for a moment Sulu was free.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu tore clear and leaped over the edge of the tower. He thudded onto the roof a few feet from Demora and she reached out, grabbing him by the wrist to hold him in place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Harriman was shouting into the interior of the cabin, \"Gently, Anik! Keep \u0027er steady! We got \u0027em! Let\u0027s get down and get \u0027em inside.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The shuttlecraft began to descend gently to the ground, a safe distance from the city. As it went, Demora and Sulu lay flat on their stomachs, clutching each other\u0027s hands, gasping, looking at each other and hardly believing what had just happened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Finally Demora managed to get a sentence out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Couldn\u0027t have spotted them two seconds earlier, could you.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939/28447.html","bookId":44,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:55:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:55:52 AM"}
