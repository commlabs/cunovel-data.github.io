Duncan nudged his mount forward when the last of his men had cleared the wooden planks spanning the moat. The stallion was eager to get to his destination, prancing a nervous sidestep that jarred Madelyne\u0027s thigh into aching again. She grimaced against the sting, unaware she was squeezing Duncan\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew she was in pain. Duncan looked down at Madelyne, took in her exhausted expression, and scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be able to rest soon, Madelyne. Hold on just a little longer,\" Duncan whispered, his voice ragged with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne nodded and closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached the courtyard, Duncan quickly dismounted and then lifted Madelyne into his arms. He held her firmly against his chest, and then turned and started walking toward his home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoldiers lined the way. Gilard was standing with two men in front of the castle doors. Madelyne opened her eyes and looked at Gilard. She thought he looked perplexed but couldn\u0027t reason why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until they\u0027d gotten closer that Madelyne realized Gilard wasn\u0027t looking at her. Why, his attention was drawn to her legs. Madelyne glanced down, saw then that her cloak wasn\u0027t hiding her injury any longer. The tattered gown trailed behind her like a shredded banner. Only blood covered her, flowing a stream down the length of her leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard hurried to open the doors, a double entry that dwarfed the men. A rush of warm air greeted Madelyne when they reached the center of a small hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe area around her was obviously the soldiers\u0027 keep. The entryway was narrow, the floor wooden, and the men\u0027s quarters located on the right. A circular stairway took up all of the left wall, curving wide steps that led to the housing above. There was something oddly disturbing about the structure, but Madelyne couldn\u0027t figure out what bothered her until Duncan had carried her halfway up the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The stairs are on the wrong side,\" Madelyne suddenly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, Madelyne. They are on the correct side,\" Duncan answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought he sounded amused. \" \u0027Tis not on the correct side,\" she contradicted him. \"The stairway is always built on the right side of the wall. Anyone knows that well enough,\" she added with great authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, Madelyne was infuriated that Duncan wouldn\u0027t admit the obvious flaw in his home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s built on the right unless it is deliberately ordered built on the left,\" Duncan answered. Each word was carefully enunciated. Why, he acted as though he was instructing a dimwitted child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy Madelyne found this discussion so important was beyond her. She did though, and vowed to have the last word on the subject. \"It\u0027s an ignorant deliberation then,\" she told him. Madelyne glared up at him and was sorry he wasn\u0027t looking down at her to see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a stubborn man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a stubborn woman,\" Duncan countered. He smiled, pleased with his observation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard trailed behind his brother. He thought their conversation ridiculous. Yet he was too worried to smile over their foolish banter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard knew Edmond would be waiting for them. Aye, the middle brother would certainly be inside the hall. Adela might be there as well. Gilard realized he was concerned for Madelyne now. He didn\u0027t want her to have any unpleasant confrontations. And he hoped there\u0027d be time to explain Madelyne\u0027s gentle nature to his brother Edmond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard\u0027s worry was temporarily put aside when Duncan reached the second level and didn\u0027t turn to enter the great hall. He took the opposite direction, climbed another stairway, and then entered the mouth of the tower. The steps were narrower and the procession slowed somewhat by the sharp curves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room at the top of the tower was freezing. There was a hearth built into the center of the circular wall. A large window had also been added, right next to the fireplace. The window was wide open, the wooden shutters flapping loudly against the stone walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a bed against the inside wall. Duncan tried to be gentle when he placed Madelyne on the covers. Gilard followed behind them and Duncan issued his orders to his brother as he bent to pile chunks of wood into the fireplace. \"Send Gerty with a trencher of food for Madelyne, and tell Edmond to bring his medicines. He\u0027ll have to use his needle on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll argue over it,\" Gilard commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll do it all the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is Edmond?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe softly spoken question came from Madelyne. Both Duncan and Gilard turned to look at her. She was struggling to sit up, and frowning over the impossibility of the task. Her teeth started chattering from the cold and the strain, and she finally collapsed against the bed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edmond is middle brother to Duncan and me,\" Gilard explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many Wextons are there?\" Madelyne asked, frowning. \"Five in all,\" Gilard answered. \"Catherine is oldest sister, then Duncan, then Edmond, then Adela, and lastly me,\" he added with a smile. \"Edmond will care for your injury, Madelyne. He knows the ways of healing, and before you know it, you\u0027ll be as fit as ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard frowned. \"Why what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you want me fit as ever?\" Madelyne asked, clearly puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard didn\u0027t know how to answer her. He turned back to look at Duncan, hoping he\u0027d give Madelyne answer. Duncan had started the fire and was now closing the shutters. Without turning around, he commanded, \"Gilard, do as I\u0027ve instructed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice didn\u0027t suggest argument. Gilard was wise enough to obey. He made it to the door before Madelyne\u0027s voice caught up with him. \"Don\u0027t bring your brother. I can take care of my injury without his aid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Gilard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slammed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan turned to Madelyne then. \"For as long as you are here, you\u0027ll not contradict any of my orders. Is that understood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was advancing upon the bed with a slow, measured stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I understand anything, milord?\" Madelyne whispered. \"I am but a pawn, isn\u0027t that the way of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could frighten her, Madelyne closed her eyes. She folded her arms across her chest, an action meant to ward off the chill in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me die in peace,\" she whispered quite dramatically. Lord, how she wished she had the strength and the courage to yell at him. She was so miserable now. There\u0027d be more pain coming if Duncan\u0027s brother touched her too. \"I do not have the stamina for your brother\u0027s ministrations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do, Madelyne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice had sounded gentle, but Madelyne was too angry to care. \"Why must you contradict everything I say to you? \u0027Tis a terrible flaw, that,\" Madelyne muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded at the door. Duncan yelled out as he walked back across the room. He leaned one shoulder against the mantel above the hearth, his gaze directed on Madelyne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne was too curious to keep her eyes closed. The door protested with a squeak as it was opened and an elderly woman appeared. She carried a trencher in one hand and a jug in the other. There were two animal skins tucked under her arm. The servant was a plump woman with worried brown eyes. She darted a hasty look at Madelyne and then turned to curtsy awkwardly to her lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne decided the servant was afraid of Duncan. She watched the poor woman, feeling great compassion for her as she tried to balance the items in her hands and genuflect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan wasn\u0027t making it any easier on the woman either. He gave her a curt nod and then motioned her to Madelyne\u0027s side. Not a word of encouragement or kindness did he utter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe servant proved to be quick on her feet, because as soon as Duncan commanded the task, she all but ran to the bed, stumbling twice before she was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe placed the trencher of food next to Madelyne and offered her the jug. \"By what name are you called?\" Madelyne asked the woman. She kept her voice low so Duncan wouldn\u0027t overhear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gerty,\" the woman answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman remembered the covers she held under her arm then and quickly moved the trencher to the wooden chest next to the bed. She covered Madelyne with the blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne smiled her appreciation and that encouraged Gerty to tuck the sides of the animal skins against Madelyne\u0027s legs. \"I can see you\u0027re shivering to death,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerty had no knowledge of Madelyne\u0027s injury. When she pushed the fur against her injured thigh, Madelyne squeezed her eyes shut against the excruciating insult and didn\u0027t say a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan saw what had happened, thought to yell a rebuke to the servant, but the deed was already done. Gerty was handing Madelyne her food now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for your kindness, Gerty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne\u0027s approval amazed Duncan. He stared at his captive, took in her tranquil expression, and found himself shaking his head. Instead of lashing out at the servant, Lady Madelyne had given her praise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door suddenly flew open. Madelyne turned, her eyes wide with fright. The door bounced against the wall twice before settling. A giant of a man stood in the doorway, his hands resting on his h*ps and a fierce scowl drawn across his face. Madelyne concluded with a weary sigh that this, then, was Edmond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerty scooted around the big man and hurried out the doorway just as Edmond advanced into the room. A trail of servants followed, carrying bowls of water and an assortment of trays with odd-shaped jars on them. The servants placed their trays on the floor next to the bed and then turned, bowed to Duncan, and left. They all acted like scared rabbits. And why wouldn\u0027t they? Madelyne asked herself. After all, there were two wolves in the room with her and wasn\u0027t that enough to scare anyone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond still hadn\u0027t said a word to his brother. Duncan didn\u0027t want a confrontation in front of Madelyne. He knew he\u0027d become angry, and that would frighten Madelyne. Yet, he wasn\u0027t about to back down either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you no greeting for your brother, Edmond?\" Duncan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ploy worked. Edmond looked surprised by the question. His face lost some of its anger. \"Why wasn\u0027t I informed of your plan to bring Louddon\u0027s sister back with you? I have only just learned that Gilard understood the way of it from the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose he boasted of it too,\" Duncan said, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gilard exaggerates, Edmond. He had no knowledge of my intentions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your reason for keeping this plan secret, Duncan?\" Edmond asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would have argued over it,\" Duncan remarked. He smiled over his own admission, as if he would have found pleasure in the fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne observed the change in Duncan\u0027s manner. She was truly amazed. Why, he looked so ruggedly handsome when he smiled. Aye, she thought, he looked human. And that, she scolded herself, was all she would allow herself to think about his appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When have you ever turned your back on an argument?\" Edmond shouted at his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls surely rocked from the noise. Madelyne wondered if both Edmond and Gilard suffered from a hearing problem of some sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond wasn\u0027t as tall as Duncan, not when they stood so close together. He looked more like Duncan than Gilard did though. He was just as mean-looking when he scowled. The facial features were almost identical, down to their frowns. Edmond\u0027s hair wasn\u0027t black though; it was as brown as a newly plowed field and just as rich in thickness. And when he turned to look at her, Madelyne thought she saw a smile light those dark brown eyes before they turned as cold as stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you think to yell at me, Edmond, I must tell you I\u0027m not up to listening,\" Madelyne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond didn\u0027t reply. He folded his arms across his chest and stared at her, long and hard, until Duncan told him to see to her injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the middle brother walked over to the bed, Madelyne began to get frightened again. \"I would prefer that you leave me alone,\" she said, trying to keep her voice from shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your preferences do not concern me,\" Edmond remarked. His voice was now as soft as hers had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe admitted defeat when Edmond motioned for her to show him which leg he was to tend. He was large enough to force her, and Madelyne needed to keep her strength for the ordeal ahead of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond\u0027s expression didn\u0027t change when she lifted the covering. Madelyne was careful to shield the rest of her body from his view. She was a modest lady, after all, and it was best that Edmond understand that from the beginning. Duncan walked over to the other side of the bed. He frowned when Edmond touched Madelyne\u0027s leg, and she grimaced in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d best hold her down, Duncan,\" Edmond remarked. His voice was mild now, his concentration obviously centered on the task ahead of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay! Duncan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t keep the frantic look from her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t any need,\" Duncan instructed his brother. He looked at Madelyne and added, \"I\u0027ll hold her down if it becomes necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne\u0027s shoulders sagged against the bed again. She nodded and a look of calm settled on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan was certain he\u0027d have to restrain her, else Edmond wouldn\u0027t be able to complete the task of cleaning the wound and sewing her flesh back together. There\u0027d be pain, intense but necessary, and it would be no disgrace for a woman to scream during the ordeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond lined up his supplies and was finally ready to begin. He looked at his brother, received his nod, and turned to look at Madelyne. What he saw surprised him into stillness. There was trust in those magnificent blue eyes, and not a trace of fear in evidence. She was quite beautiful, Edmond admitted, just as Gilard had claimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may begin, Edmond,\" Madelyne whispered then, interrupting Edmond\u0027s thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond watched Madelyne wave her hand in a regal gesture indicating she was waiting. He almost smiled over her show of authority. Her husky voice surprised him too. \"Would it be easier if you just used a hot knife to seal the wound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Edmond could answer her, Madelyne hastened on. \"I do not mean to tell you the way of it,\" she said. \"Please don\u0027t take offense, but it does seem barbaric of you to use a needle and thread.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barbaric?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdmond looked as if he were having trouble following the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne sighed. She decided she was too exhausted to try to make him understand. \"You may begin, Edmond,\" she repeated. \"I\u0027m ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may?\" Edmond asked, looking up at Duncan to catch his reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan was too worried to smile over Madelyne\u0027s conversation. He looked grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a bossy bit of goods,\" Edmond told Madelyne. The rebuke was softened by his smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get on with it,\" Duncan muttered. \"The waiting is worse than the deed.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-12.html","bookId":1841,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
