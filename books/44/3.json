{"id":1195,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"THERE WERE MANY \"firsts\" in Dr. Metcalfe\u0027s career in which he could take genuine pleasure. The first operation he performed … the first life he saved … the first child he delivered …\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But now he had to pronounce the first death aboard the Enterprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, certainly, the ship was associated with calamitous death and destruction. But Metcalfe hadn\u0027t been there for any of it. He, along with the rest of the medical personnel, had not come aboard until after the debacle of the ship\u0027s launch. Technically many had died, but it hadn\u0027t happened under Metcalfe\u0027s watch. Indeed, he felt a small degree of guilt (nothing major—he was too old a hand at this—but small nonetheless) over not having been there at the time of the ship\u0027s first crisis. Perhaps in some way he might have managed to save some lives.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But there was no great point in contemplating the past. Only the future at this point was of any interest to him. Unfortunately, it was a future that did not include the young woman laid out on the table in front of him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Metcalfe was an older gentleman, with a salt-and-pepper beard and a gleaming bald head. He was studying the readouts that his instruments were making, speaking softly and for the record that was automatically entering his words into his medical log. Standing nearby was a stone-faced Captain Harriman, his arms folded resolutely across his chest. His forehead had been cleaned and a thin layer of plasticskin had been applied against it to seal the wound.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Deceased died from catastrophic cellular disruption caused by a series of phaser blasts in increasing grades of intensity,\" Metcalfe said tonelessly. \"One in the small of the back … shot from behind,\" and he glanced at Harriman with eyebrows raised in apparent reproof. Harriman met his gaze levelly and said nothing. Metcalfe continued, \"One in the side positioned squarely between the third and four ribs … and the third, the most intense blast, in the solar plexus. Blood flow was halted in—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Harriman couldn\u0027t stand there and listen anymore. He turned and strode out of the lab area of the sickbay, into the main area. Thompson was lying there, still unconscious, but breathing steadily. Her injuries had likewise been attended to and her condition had been stabilized. Tobler was looking over readings and noticed Harriman looking on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s going to be fine, Captain,\" Tobler offered tentatively.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Harriman nodded once, briefly, and then started for the door. He stopped and turned as Tobler said to him, \"Captain?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes?\" His arms were still folded resolutely across his chest. Clear body language telling anyone who might be looking on to keep their distance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nonetheless Tobler said rather gamely, \"Sir, maybe I\u0027m out of line, but … I just want you to know, you saved Lieutenant Thompson\u0027s life.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Harriman said nothing for a moment. Then he asked flatly, \"Is that it, Tobler?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir. I guess it is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sickbay doors slid shut behind Harriman\u0027s retreating figure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e * * *\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Commander Dane entered Harriman\u0027s quarters, taking immediate note of the fact that it was rather dim. She could barely make him out. \"Captain?\" she said with just a trace of uncertainty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" came Harriman\u0027s voice from the darkness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dane straightened her shoulders a bit, mentally remonstrating herself for slouching. \"We\u0027re still in orbit around Askalon Five. Awaiting your orders on how to proceed.\" He said nothing at first, and Dane continued, \"I have another landing party selected, if you wish to continue exploring the planet surface.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s easy enough, I suppose,\" Harriman said after a moment. \"A crewman dies, at the hands of her captain. So bring in another crewman to fill the slot. That\u0027s all they are, after all. Slots to be filled. Life goes on, doesn\u0027t it, Dane.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir. It does.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Except for Demora Sulu. Life isn\u0027t exactly going on for her, is it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dane paused a moment. \"I\u0027ll take that to be rhetorical, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Harriman laughed softly, and it was not a pleasant sound. \"God, you are a cold one, aren\u0027t you, Dane. \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They offered me a Vulcan first officer, you know. It was down to you and him. I went with you. Vulcans … fine people. Brilliant minds. I admire the hell out of them. But, provincially, I felt more comfortable with a human at my side. And you know what? You give me the creeps sometimes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said softly after a moment. \"I\u0027ve spent the past hour tearing at myself. Now I\u0027m starting on you. It\u0027s not fair and it\u0027s not appropriate.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s understandable, sir. Losing a crewman under any circumstance is difficult.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I didn\u0027t lose her, Dane. That makes it sound like she was misplaced and might turn up if I check under the seat cushions. I killed her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You had no choice.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That doesn\u0027t exactly mollify it, does it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, sir. It doesn\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He said nothing for a moment and once again Dane prompted, \"The planet, sir? Askalon Five. How shall we proceed?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You want to know if I\u0027m interested in risking more of my people in the exploration of a world that turned one of them into a homicidal berserker … all in the hope of rescuing nonexistent people in distress.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wouldn\u0027t have phrased it in quite that way, but yes, sir. That\u0027s basically the question before us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I am not interested in doing that. Slap a quarantine on Askalon Five, inform other ships to keep away, and have done with it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"With all respect, sir, the ruins down there shouldn\u0027t be made off-limits to—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Which is more important to you, Dane? Ruined buildings? Or ruined lives?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She opened her mouth with an immediate answer, but then thought better of it and instead simply said, \"Yes, sir. I\u0027ll order course set for Starbase Nine. We can transfer the … Ensign Sulu … to them, and proceed from there to the Donatti system.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Take us home.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She blinked. \"Pardon?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The statement seems self-explanatory, Commander. Set course for Earth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sir … we\u0027re due in the Donatti system. You\u0027re scheduled for a reception with the—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Set course … for Earth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As you wish, sir. I feel constrained to point out that Starfleet\u0027s orders as to our expected arrival date in—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Harriman rose from his chair, his body trembling with barely contained fury. His jaw set, his voice a low growl, he said, \"I don\u0027t give a damn about what Starfleet\u0027s orders are. I don\u0027t care if they came via subspace, or appeared on the main monitor screen in flaming letters two feet high! Demora Sulu was the daughter of Hikaru Sulu, and I killed her, and I will show her the respect that both her parentage and the circumstances of her death dictate! I don\u0027t care if the only way we have of setting course for Earth is having you go outside and push! If that\u0027s the case, then the only question I have for you is, How long can you hold your breath?!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Actually, sir, holding one\u0027s breath in a vacuum would hasten the …\" Then she saw his expression and cleared her throat. \"I\u0027ll give the orders, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You do that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She walked out, leaving Harriman behind with his grief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At Starfleet Academy, they had tried to mentally steel trainees on the command track for that inevitable day when people under their command went down and didn\u0027t come back up. The decisions that had to be made which might sometimes result in the death of crewmen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But there were some things that somehow didn\u0027t quite make it into the curriculum. Things such as how you deal with it when a living legend dies on the maiden voyage of your greatest command.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And how you deal with informing one of the oldest, most dedicated associates of that selfsame living legend that you killed his daughter.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939/28419.html","bookId":44,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:54:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:54:35 AM"}
