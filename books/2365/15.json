It seemed to them that nothing in their lives had changed except the names of their patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Paige walked through the parking lot, she was reminded of Harry Bowman and his red Ferrari. \"How many lives were destroyed by the poison Harry Bowman was selling?\" she wondered. \"Drugs were so seductive. And, in the end, so deadly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy Ford showed up with a small bouquet of flowers for Paige.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this for, Jimmy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blushed. \"I just wanted you to have it. Did you know I\u0027m getting married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! That\u0027s wonderful. Who\u0027s the lucky girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name is Betsy. She works at a dress shop. We\u0027re going to have half a dozen kids. The first girl is going to be named Paige. I hope you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mind? I\u0027m flattered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was embarrassed. \"Did you hear the one about the doctor who gave a patient two weeks to live? \u0027I can\u0027t pay you right now,\u0027 the man said. \u0027All right, I\u0027ll give you another two weeks.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jimmy was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was worried about Tom Chang. He was having violent mood swings from euphoria to deep depression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning during a talk with Paige, he said, \"Do you realize that most of the people in here would die without us? We have the power to heal their bodies and make them whole again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the next morning: \"We\u0027re all kidding ourselves, Paige. Our patients would get better faster without us. We\u0027re hypocrites, pretending that we have all the answers. Well, we don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige studied him a moment. \"What do you hear from Sye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I talked to her yesterday. She won\u0027t come back here. She\u0027s going ahead with the divorce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige put her hand on his arm. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Why? It doesn\u0027t bother me. Not anymore. I\u0027ll find another woman.\" He grinned. \"And have another child. You\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something unreal about the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night Paige said to Kat, \"I\u0027m worried about Tom Chang. Have you talked to him lately?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he seem normal to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No man seems normal to me,\" Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was still concerned. \"Let\u0027s invite him for dinner tomorrow night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning when Paige reported to the hospital, she was greeted with the news that a janitor had found Tom Chang\u0027s body in a basement equipment room. He had died of an overdose of sleeping pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was near hysteria. \"I could have saved him,\" she cried. \"All this time he was calling out for help, and I didn\u0027t hear him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat said firmly, \"There\u0027s no way you could have helped him, Paige. You were not the problem, and you were not the solution. He didn\u0027t want to live without his wife and child. It\u0027s as simple as that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige wiped the tears from her eyes. \"Damn this place!\" she said. \"If it weren\u0027t for the pressure and the hours, his wife never would have left him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she did,\" Kat said gently. \"It\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige had never been to a Chinese funeral before. It was an incredible spectacle. It began at the Green Street Mortuary in Chinatown early in the morning, where a crowd started gathering outside. A parade was assembled, with a large brass marching band, and at the head of the parade, mourners carried a huge blowup of a photograph of Tom Chang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe march began with the band loudly playing, winding through the streets of San Francisco, with a hearse at the end of the procession. Most of the mourners were on foot, but the more elderly rode in cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Paige, the parade seemed to be moving around the city at random. She was puzzled. \"Where are they going?\" she asked one of the mourners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bowed slightly and said, \"It is our custom to take the departed past some of the places that have meaning in his life - restaurants where he ate, shops that he used, places he visited ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parade ended in front of Embarcadero County Hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mourner turned to Paige and said, \"This is where Tom Chang worked. This is where he found his happiness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrong, Paige thought. This is where he lost his happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking down Market Street one morning, Paige saw Alfred Turner. Her heart started pounding. She had not been able to get him out of her mind. He was starting to cross the street as the light was changing. When Paige got to the corner, the light had turned to red. She ignored it and ran out into the street, oblivious to the honking horns and the outraged cries of motorists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige reached the other side and hurried to catch up with him. She grabbed his sleeve. \"Alfred ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man turned. \"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a total stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that Paige and Kat were fourth-year residents, they were performing operations on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat was working with doctors in neurosurgery, and she never ceased to be amazed at the miracle of the hundred billion complex digital computers called neurons that lived in the skull. The work was exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat had enormous respect for most of the doctors she worked with. They were brilliant, skilled surgeons. There were a few doctors who gave her a hard time. They tried to date her, and the more Kat refused to go out with them, the more of a challenge she became.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard one doctor mutter, \"Here comes old iron-pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was assisting Dr. Kibler at a brain operation. A tiny incision was made in the cortex, and Dr. Kibler pushed the rubber cannula into the left lateral ventricle, the cavity in the center of the left half of the brain, while Kat held the incision open with a small retractor. Her entire concentration was focused on what was happening in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Kibler glanced at her and, as he worked, said, \"Did you hear about the wino who staggered into a bar and said, \u0027Give me a drink, quick!\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t do that,\u0027 the bartender said. \u0027You\u0027re already drunk.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burr was cutting in deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t give me a drink, I\u0027ll kill myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCerebral spinal fluid flowed out of the cannula from the ventricle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do,\" the bartender said. \"There are three things I want. You do them for me, and I\u0027ll give you a bottle. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he went on talking, fifteen milliliters of air were injected into the ventricle, and X-rays were taken of the anterior-posterior view and the lateral view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027See that football player sitting in the corner? I can\u0027t get him out of here. I want you to throw him out. Next, I have a pet crocodile in my office with a bad tooth. He\u0027s so mean I can\u0027t get a vet to go near him. Lastly, there\u0027s a lady doctor from the Department of Health who\u0027s trying to close up this place. You fuck her, and you get the bottle.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scrub nurse was using suction to reduce the amount of blood in the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wino throws out the football player, and goes into the office where the crocodile is. He comes out fifteen minutes later, all bloody, and his clothes torn, and he says, \"Where\u0027s the lady doctor with the bad tooth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Kibler roared with laughter. \"Do you get it? He fucked the crocodile instead of the doctor. It was probably a better experience!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat stood there, furious, wanting to slap him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the operation was over, Kat went to the on-call room to try to get over her anger. I\u0027m not going to let the bastards beat me down. I\u0027m not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom time to time, Paige went out with doctors from the hospital, but she refused to get romantically involved with any of them. Alfred Turner had hurt her too deeply, and she was determined never to go through that again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of her days and nights were spent at the hospital. The schedule was grueling, but Paige was doing general surgery and she enjoyed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning, George Englund, the chief of surgery, sent for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re starting your specialty this year. Cardiovascular surgery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I have a treat for you. Have you heard of Dr. Barker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige looked at him in surprise. \"Dr. Lawrence Barker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone had heard of Lawrence Barker. He was one of the most famous cardiovascular surgeons in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he returned last week from Saudi Arabia, where he operated on the king. Dr. Barker\u0027s an old friend of mine, and he\u0027s agreed to give us three days a Week here. Pro bono.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fantastic!\" Paige exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m putting you on his team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Paige was speechless. \"I ...I don\u0027t know what to say. I\u0027m very grateful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a wonderful opportunity for you. You can learn a lot from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure I can. Thank you, George. I really appreciate this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll start your rounds with him tomorrow morning at six o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking forward to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looking forward to it\" was an understatement. It had been Paige\u0027s dream to work with someone like Dr. Lawrence Barker. What do I mean, \"someone like Dr. Lawrence Barker\"? There\u0027s only one Dr. Lawrence Barker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never seen a photograph of him, but she could visualize what he looked like. He would be tall and handsome, with silver-gray hair, and slender, sensitive hands. A warm and gentle man. We\u0027ll be working closely together, Paige thought, and I\u0027m going to make myself absolutely indispensable. I wonder if he\u0027s married?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, Paige had an erotic dream about Dr. Barker. They were performing an operation in the nude. In the middle of it, Dr. Barker said, \"I want you.\" A nurse moved the patient off the operating table and Dr. Barker picked Paige up and put her on the table, and made love to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Paige woke up, she was falling off the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt six o\u0027clock the following morning, Paige was nervously waiting in the second-floor corridor with Joel Philips, the senior resident, and five other residents, when a short, sour-faced man stormed toward them. He leaned forward as he walked, as though battling a stiff wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe approached the group. \"What the hell are you all standing around for? Let\u0027s go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Paige a moment to regain her composure. She hurried along to catch up with the rest of the group. As they moved along the corridor, Dr. Barker snapped, \"You\u0027ll have between thirty and thirty-five patients to care for every day. I\u0027ll expect you to make detailed notes on each one of them. Clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were murmurs of \"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had reached the first ward. Dr. Barker walked over to the bed of a patient, a man in his forties. Barker\u0027s gruff and forbidding manner went through an instant change. He touched the patient gently on the shoulder and smiled. \"Good morning. I\u0027m Dr. Barker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you feeling this morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My chest hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Barker studied the chart at the foot of the bed, then turned to Dr. Philips. \"What do his X-rays show?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No change. He\u0027s healing nicely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do another CBC.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Philips made a note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Barker patted the young man on the arm and smiled. \"It\u0027s looking good. We\u0027ll have you out of here in a week.\" He turned to the residents and snapped, \"Move it! We have a lot of patients to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy God! Paige thought. Talk about Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next patient was an obese woman who had had apacemakerputin. Dr. Barker studied her chart. \"Good morning, Mrs. Shelby.\" His voice was soothing. \"I\u0027m Dr. Barker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long are you going to keep me in this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re so charming, I\u0027d like to keep you here forever, but I have a wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Shelby giggled. \"She\u0027s a lucky woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarker was examining her chart again. \"I\u0027d say you\u0027re just about ready to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stop by to see you this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence Barker turned to the residents. \"Move on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey obediently trailed behind the doctor to a semi-private room where a young Guatemalan boy lay in bed, surrounded by his anxious family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning,\" Dr. Barker said warmly. He scanned the patient\u0027s chart. \"How are you feeling this morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am feeling good, doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Barker turned to Philips. \"Any change in the electrolytes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good news.\" He patted the boy\u0027s arm. \"You hang in there, Juan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mother asked anxiously, \"Is my son going to be all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Barker smiled. \"We\u0027re going to do everything we can for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Barker stepped out into the corridor, the others trailing behind him. He stopped. \"The patient has myocardiopathy, irregular fever tremors, headaches, and localized edema. Can any of you geniuses tell me what the most common cause of it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. Paige said hesitantly, \"I believe it\u0027s congenital ... hereditary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Barker looked at her and nodded encouragingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePleased, Paige went on. \"It skips ... wait ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was struggling to remember. \"It skips a generation and is passed along by the genes of the mother.\" She stopped, flushed, proud of herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Barker stared at her a moment. \"Horseshit! It\u0027s Chagas\u0027 disease. It affects people from Latin American countries.\" He looked at Paige with disgust. \"Jesus! Who told you you were a doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige\u0027s face was flaming red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the rounds was a blur to her. They saw twenty-four patients and it seemed to Paige that Dr. Barker spent the morning trying to humiliate her. She was always the one Barker addressed his questions to, testing, probing. When she was right, he never complimented her. When she was wrong, he yelled at her. At one point, when Paige made a mistake, Barker roared, \"I wouldn\u0027t let you operate on my dog!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the rounds were finally over, Dr. Philips, the senior resident, said, \"We\u0027ll start rounds again at two o\u0027clock. Get your scut books, make notes on each patient, and don\u0027t leave anything out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Paige pityingly, started to say something, then turned away to join Dr. Barker. Paige thought, I never want to see that bastard again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following night, Paige was on call. She ran from one crisis to the next, frantically trying to stem the tide of disasters that flooded the emergency rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 1:00 A.M., she finally fell asleep. She did not hear the sound of a siren screaming out its warning as an ambulance roared to a stop in front of the emergency entrance of the hospital. Two paramedics swung open the ambulance door, transferred the unconscious patient from his stretcher to a gurney, and ran it through the entrance doors of ER One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe staff had been alerted by radiophone. A nurse ran alongside the patient, while a second nurse waited at the top of the ramp. Sixty seconds later, the patient was transferred from the gurney to the examination table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a young man, and he was covered with so much blood that it was difficult to tell what he looked like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nurse went to work, cutting his torn clothes off with large shears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks like everything\u0027s broken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s bleeding like a stuck pig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not getting a pulse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s on call?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Taylor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get her. If she hurries, he may still be alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was awakened by the ringing of the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"H\u0027lo ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have an emergency in ER One, doctor. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s going to make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige sat up on the cot. \"Right. I\u0027m coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at her wristwatch. 1:30 A.M. She stumbled out of bed and made her way to the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later, she was walking into ER One. In the middle of the room, on the examining table, was the blood-covered patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we have here?\" Paige asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Motorcycle accident. He was hit by a bus. He wasn\u0027t wearing a helmet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige moved toward the unconscious figure, and even before she saw his face, she somehow knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was suddenly wide awake. \"Get three IV lines in him!\" Paige ordered. \"Get him on oxygen. I want some blood sent down, stat. Call Records to get his blood type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse looked at her in surprise. \"You know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She had to force herself to say the words. \"His name is Jimmy Ford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige ran her fingers over his scalp. \"There\u0027s heavy edema. I want a head scan and X-rays. We\u0027re going to push the envelope on this one. I want him alive!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige spent the next two hours making sure that everything possible was being done for Jimmy Ford. The X-rays showed a fractured skull, a brain contusion, broken humerus, and multiple lacerations. But everything would have to wait until he was stabilized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 3:30 A.M., Paige decided there was nothing more she could do for the present. He was breathing better, and his pulse was stronger. She looked down at the unconscious figure. We\u0027re going to have half a dozen kids. The first girl is going to be named Paige. I hope you don\u0027t mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me if there\u0027s any change at all,\" Paige said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, doctor,\" one of the nurses said. \"We\u0027ll take good care of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige made her way back to the on-call room. She was exhausted, but she was too concerned about Jimmy to go back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone rang again. She barely had the energy to pick it up. \"H\u0027lo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctor, you\u0027d better come up to the third floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell did they teach you in medical school? Don\u0027t you even know the difference between heartburn and a heart attack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The problem is, you didn\u0027t. If you ever wake me up again in the middle of the night for a heartburn case, I\u0027ll have your ass. You understand that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige stood there stiffly, her face grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give her some antacid, doctor,\" Lawrence Barker said sarcastically, \"and you\u0027ll find that she\u0027s cured. I\u0027ll see you at six o\u0027clock for rounds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige watched him storm out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Paige stumbled back to her cot in the on-call room, she thought, I\u0027m going to kill Lawrence Barker. I\u0027ll do it slowly. He\u0027ll be very ill. He\u0027ll have a dozen tubes in his body. He\u0027ll beg me to put him out of his misery, but I won\u0027t. I\u0027ll let him suffer, and then when he feels better ... that\u0027s when I\u0027ll kill him! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-15.html","bookId":2365,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM"}
