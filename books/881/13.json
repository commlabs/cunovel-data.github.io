{"id":38303,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. THE END.","content":"Frank was amazed at the cool nerve and effrontery of the wretch. For a moment the young inventor was silent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You have one of our men in captivity here. I want him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The chief shook his head sullenly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mebbe no.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mebbe, yes!” cried Frank, angrily. “Come, I’ll blow you to perdition if you don’t give him up!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No can do dat.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “White man killed!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a moment Frank reeled as if given a terrific blow. He turned ghastly pale. Then Gaston was dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is awful!” he thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But something in the Esquimau chief’s face caused him to start. He grasped the situation at once.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are lying!” he hissed, leaning over the rail. “Give him up, or I’ll kill you and all your cowardly crew!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Esquimau chief laughed scornfully, and gave a peculiar cry. In a moment the vicinity was thronged with armed natives.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Frank saw that the crisis had come. There was no use in dallying further.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He picked up a bomb brought him by Barney and hurled it fairly into the midst of the murderous horde.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In a flash there was a frightful explosion. Heaps of dead and dying Esquimaux lay upon the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The survivors fled wildly. Frank leaped from the airship’s deck. He rushed into the nearest bough hut.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was Gaston bound hand and foot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Thank God! you have come to save me!” cried the scientist. “You are none too soon!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But there is yet danger!” cried Frank. “Follow me quickly!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To the airship they rushed. The Esquimaux were recovering and seemed ready to fight. But though he could have annihilated the whole gang, Frank did not wait for their attack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Up into the air sprang the airship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The course was at once set to the southward and for a week was firmly held. Then evidences of civilization appeared.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canada was passed over, Lake Erie and then the United States was once more beneath the aerial voyagers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Home again! There was an indescribable charm in the words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The airship descended into Readestown one evening. The next morning every daily paper in the world was recording the return of the travelers from zone to zone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James Spencer returned to his home where he was happily welcomed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Professor Gaston took the first train to New York and reported to the committee of the scientific society.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The much-mooted question of the two Poles was settled forever. Professor Gaston was instantly made honorary member in every scientific society in the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Indeed, the honors thrust upon him were most burdensome.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barney and Pomp were pleased to once more return to their duties in quiet old Readestown.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’ fink I want berry much to do wif dem Arctic countries!” Pomp declared. “Dey am a pooty po’ place fo’ a live man.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Bejabers, I’m wid yez, naygur!” cried Barney. “Hurroo fer ould Oireland an’ Afriky!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And hurrah for America, the queen of all nations!” cried Frank Reade, Jr., with a laugh, for he had overheard them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Dart was at once taken to pieces. The strain of her long voyage would preclude any possibility of ever using her again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the young inventor had plenty of other plans to develop.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For many a day the famous trip of Frank Reade, Jr., and his airship, the Dart, from zone to zone, rang through the country.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But though this was certainly a most extraordinary feat, the young inventor had even mightier projects on hand, some of which the reader may hear of at a later day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe End\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1927/55366.html","bookId":881,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:25:54 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:25:54 AM"}
