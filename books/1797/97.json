It\u0027s true they all got kicked out of the house, but my guess is they\u0027ll be showing up at the appointed time this morning for the bidding. Those collectors aren\u0027t the kind of people to let a little thing like death and violence get in the way of getting hold of Caitlin Evanger\u0027s last painting. Heck, the story of what happened last night will only make Bloodlust more valuable. And when those bidders show up, I have a hunch Caitlin will go ahead with the auction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what?\" Jonas reluctantly swung his legs over the edge of the bed and winced. His hand went to the bandage on his arm. His expression was distinctly surly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity ignored his change of mood and went into the bathroom. \"So I think Tavi might be right. I think Caitlin will fall apart if she actually sells Bloodlust. She\u0027s obsessed with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Personally, I do not give a damn.\" Jonas appeared in the bathroom doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I do. Caitlin has been through too much to go under now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas lounged against the doorjamb. He folded his arms. \"You\u0027re going to save her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I can.\" Verity stepped into the shower just as Jonas swore and muttered something under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\" she called over the roar of the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said,\" he yelled back, \"that you just lost your chance at the Most Wicked Woman of the Year award.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalk about innocence!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVERITY saw the cars parked in the driveway of the gray house as soon as she and Jonas rounded the last bend of the cliff-edge highway. She sat forward nervously, hoping she wasn\u0027t too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry, Jonas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down. This is a crazy idea to begin with, but there\u0027s no point in working yourself up into a frenzy over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand. Tavi was right to be so worried about the sale of Bloodlust. Nobody knows what will happen to Caitlin if she auctions it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want my opinion, Caitlin Evanger is a survivor,\" Jonas grumbled. \"She won\u0027t commit suicide just because Bloodlust is out of her life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She might not kill herself,\" Verity agreed slowly, \"but I have a feeling she\u0027ll commit professional suicide. Tavi thinks she\u0027ll never paint again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true! The woman is a brilliant artist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity was charged with anxious energy. She threw open the car door before Jonas had switched off the ignition. Without waiting for him she broke into a run, heading toward the front door of the house. She rang the bell, and when there was no immediate answer she pounded on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re probably all on the third floor in the room where the painting was stored,\" Jonas said, coming up behind her. He reached around Verity and turned the doorknob. The gray door swung inward, revealing a silent hall. \"Go to it, heroine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity needed no urging. She dashed down the hall toward the stainless steel staircase. The house was far too quiet, she realized as she pounded up the stairs. Jonas loped behind her, keeping up with her without appearing to exert himself. He had a knack for doing everything in a nonchalant fashion, Verity decided resentfully. Even running. The perfect Renaissance courtier. She was already wet under her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she remembered that Jonas did not make love to her nonchalantly. The realization made her feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing heavily, she reached the top floor and raced down the hall to the studio. The door stood open and as Verity came to a skittering halt she saw that she had guessed right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive very serious people—three men and two women, ranging in age from thirty to seventy—were standing in front of Bloodlust. Their gazes were riveted to the painting. Caitlin stood beside it, leaning most of her weight on her ebony cane. Her striking face looked drawn and grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Tavi who turned first to see who stood in the doorway, and her eyes flickered with faint hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five bidders paid little attention to the newcomer, and Caitlin merely glanced at Verity and shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have come back,\" Caitlin said. \"We\u0027re almost finished here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to come back.\" Verity drew in a deep breath and walked into the room. \"I\u0027m your friend, remember?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the only two friends you\u0027ve got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavi closed her eyes and a tear trickled down her cheek. \"It\u0027s too late,\" she whispered. \"It was always too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA portly man in a gray suit spoke up. \"I believe the last bid was mine. Are there any more bids?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so fast,\" Jonas advised laconically from the doorway. He surveyed the room full of collectors. \"I know that what happened here last night makes Bloodlust more interesting than ever, but I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re going to have to contain your enthusiasm for a while. Verity is in charge right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe portly man scowled. \"What do you mean, she\u0027s in charge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas smiled lopsidedly. \"You\u0027re about to suffer at the whim of a tyrant. It\u0027s an interesting experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the devil is going on here?\" one of the women bidders demanded. \"I\u0027m here to conduct business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am prepared to top Rossander\u0027s bid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity glanced at her. \"Save your money. The painting is not for sale.\" There were shocked gasps on all sides. She ignored them and kept walking toward Caitlin. En route she passed the worktable that held Caitlin\u0027s tools. She snatched up a small blade used for cutting canvas. Then she went straight toward Bloodlust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, wait one goddamned minute,\" someone shouted, apparently realizing belatedly what was about to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas,\" Verity said quietly, not looking back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, folks,\" Jonas said mildly. \"But I work for her. Anyone moves, he\u0027s going to have to move through me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive stunned faces turned toward him. No one moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity came to a halt in front of Bloodlust and looked at Caitlin who hadn\u0027t taken her eyes off of her. \"You don\u0027t need this painting any longer, Caitlin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\" Caitlin asked in a dull voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get it out of your life. Permanently.\" Verity lifted the small blade and began slashing the canvas into ribbons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a few screams of protest from the crowd of horrified bidders, but no one dared to try stopping her. There were advantages to having someone like Jonas in one\u0027s employ, Verity thought wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMethodically she completed her task, taking her time and doing a thorough job. When Bloodlust had been reduced to a pile of tatters, she turned to Tavi. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-97.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
