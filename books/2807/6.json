Honey, can you let go of me for a minute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess had been clutching my hand with both of hers the entire time I told her what had happened, and let go with great reluctance. \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" she\u0027d kept saying, shaking her head so hard it gave me a headache to watch. \"I just can\u0027t believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were on our knees in the Ant\u0027s walk-in closet. I was carefully inspecting my shoes and putting them inside the skirt of my stepmother\u0027s fourteen hundred dollar ball gown (what forty-five year old woman needs a ball gown, for crying out loud?). My father and stepmother were hiding in the living room, too afraid to come back and talk to me, to find out what happened. I could smell their fear and unease-it was like burning plastic-and while not having to face them any longer was a relief, I felt bad all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just can\u0027t believe it,\" Jess said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t believe it?\" I said. \"Try waking up dead and attempting to grasp the situation. It\u0027s taken me almost two days to get used to the idea. Or at least to start to start to get used to the idea. And I\u0027m not even sure how it happened, or what I\u0027m supposed to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t give a shit,\" Jessica said. \"You\u0027re alive-sort of-walking and talking, anyway, and that\u0027s all I care about.\" She threw her arms around me again. She weighs about ninety pounds and it was like being grabbed by a bundle of sticks. \"Liz, I\u0027m so happy you\u0027re here! Today was the worst day of my life!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a coincidence!\" I cried, and we both got the giggles. I added, \"And don\u0027t call me Liz, you know I hate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or you\u0027ll suck my blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to put that off,\" I admitted, but couldn\u0027t help but dart a glance at her long, ebony neck. \"The thought of it makes me want to yark. Repeatedly. Besides, I hate dark meat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat earned me a sharp poke. I needled Jess whenever I could, because it was a best friend\u0027s privilege and also because she was grossly prejudiced. Thought all whites were greedy and treacherous, with the possible exception of yours truly. Admittedly, this could sometimes be a hard case to argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we met in seventh grade, her first words to me were, \"Drop dead twice, you privileged, whitemeat schmuck.\" The fact that she was saying this while clutching a Gucci bag didn\u0027t seem to matter to her. My response (\"Go cry in a bag of money, sweetie.\") startled her into becoming my friend. That\u0027s how I made most of my friends: the element of surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that you\u0027re undead,\" Jessica went on, \"I expect you to stop repressing me and others of my racial persuasion,\" she said primly, which was as big a laugh as I\u0027d had that day. Jessica was about as repressed as Martha Stewart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you being driven insane with the unholy urge to feed?\" she asked in a \u0027would you like cream with that?\u0027 tone of voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help grinning. \"Not insane, but I\u0027m super, super thirsty. Like, jump out of bed and work out for an hour thirsty. Dancing at the club all night thirsty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, stay the hell away...I\u0027d hate to have to pepper spray my best friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. After throwing myself off the roof, getting run over by a garbage truck, electrocuting myself, drinking bleach, and committing a double homicide and felonious assault, I sure wouldn\u0027t want to be pepper sprayed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"You\u0027re unkillable now. Good. I don\u0027t need another phone call like I got last week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About that...how long have I been dead? What\u0027s been going on? I can\u0027t ask them,\" I said, jerking my head toward the living room. \"He\u0027s in shock and she\u0027s useless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Jessica began slowly, folding her legs beneath her and clasping her fingers together. She looked like a black praying mantis. \"Your dad called me Wednesday night. I reacted to the news of your death by calling him a fucking honky liar and slamming the phone down. FYI, I\u0027ve never called anyone a honky in my life; it\u0027s so twentieth century. Then, for effect, I burst into tears. Also very twentieth century. This lasted about eight hours. I called the rest of the gang, and talked to Officer Stud-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nick Berry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He called to ask about funeral information. I guess he found out about the accident because he\u0027s a cop and all. He was at the funeral,\" she added slyly. She\u0027d been teasing me about my nonexistent affair for months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooh, details, who else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Umm...most of the gang from work. And your former boss! He lays you off, you die, and the colossal prick had the nerve to be all sad-eyed at your funeral. And ask me if I knew where you\u0027d kept the phone number for the copy machine repair guy. Ugh. Of course, there wasn\u0027t actually a funeral...they lost your body! Picture it: we\u0027re all standing around, waiting for things to get started, and the head mortician guy stands up and tells us there\u0027s been \u0027a slight problem.\u0027 Which I thought was weird until I walked into this house and got a look at what weird really was. And speaking of weird, weren\u0027t you embalmed? I mean, did it just not affect you, or did your folks cheap out and skip that step, or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re asking me? How the hell should I know?\" I barely suppressed a shudder. Even the thought of liposuction creeped me out, to say nothing of tubing and embalming fluid. A riddle I was in no hurry to solve, and that was a fact. \"Why are you here, anyway? Not that I mind, because you probably saved me from wringing the Ant\u0027s neck. But you hate my parents. Don\u0027t tell me-you bought up their mortgage from the bank and came over to foreclose on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish. Thanks for the idea, though. I got a look at Mrs. Taylor\u0027s footgear at the funeral. I knew those weren\u0027t her Pradas. So I figured I\u0027d come over and try to get them back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at her. She looked like an Egyptian queen, and fought for her friends like a rabid coyote. She positively despised my father and his wife, but braved HellHouse the day of my funeral to get my shoes back. \"Oh, Jess...why? I was dead, for all you knew. I didn\u0027t need them anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I did,\" she said tartly. Which was a lie; Jessica has feet like Magic Johnson. \"Besides, it wasn\u0027t right. That jerk had to have swiped your dad\u0027s keys, snuck into your house, and stole! I knew you wouldn\u0027t have wanted her to have them. I figured I\u0027d donate them to the Foot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. In her spare time (which was to say, fifty hours a week), Jessica ran The Right Foot. The Foot gave interviewing tips, advice, resume assistance, and hand-me-down suits and accessories to underprivileged women to use for job interviews. It would have been an excellent place for my shoes to end up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Awesome idea, and bless your heart for thinking of it.\" I bundled my shoes into the ball gown, making a sack out of the dress and slinging it over my shoulder like a vampiric Santa. \"Of course, there\u0027ll be none of that now that I\u0027m back from the dead. Let\u0027s book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scooped up Antonia\u0027s jewelry box, stopped in the kitchen, and handed the sack of shoes to Jess, who looked on with interest as I dumped the Ant\u0027s jewelry into the blender, clapped the top on, and hit \u0027liquefy\u0027. The grinding, jarring, screeching brought her on the run. My father, as was his long habit, went to hide in his den, comforted by his proximity to his collection of old whiskey and new porn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few seconds, during which time we all stared at the mightily vibrating blender, I let the whirling blades groan to a halt. \"Don\u0027t you ever go into my home again without permission. Touch my things again, whether I\u0027m dead or not, and I\u0027ll kick your ass up into your shoulder blades.\" I said this perfectly pleasantly while I yanked the handle off the fridge and handed it to her. \"Got it? Super. See you at Easter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left. The sight of Antonia O\u0027Neill Taylor shrinking back from me as I passed her was one I\u0027ll treasure forever. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-6.html","bookId":2807,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:50 PM"}
