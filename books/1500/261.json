Only, it was unknown if it this expression was sincere or if it was due to some other reason. He continued to swirl the wine glass that he hadn’t take a single sip out of yet and said, “In reality, several decades ago, the Holy Crusaders and Black Dragonriders were a single organization. Back then, we were called the Black Night Crusaders. However, when the Blood Parliament rose to power and set up their headquarters base, the Black Night Crusaders’ leaders differed in opinion on how things should proceed in the future. One group believed that we should respect the original genes of humans and use natural methods of strengthening abilities, maintaining a completely human genome. They believed that excessively exploiting abilities and modifying genes would inevitably lead to destruction, and that ability users that underwent substantial amounts of modifications couldn’t be considered humans anymore. Meanwhile, the others believed that abilities were a gift to the world, so why did they have to maintain the old humans’ complete genome? The new humans that had undergone large scale ability modifications, regardless of whether it was their bodies or intelligence, all far surpassed the limits of what the old humans could achieve. A such, they believed that this was evolution and not disaster. The divergence between the two sides deepened by the day, and finally, a fissure appeared.
