The field, as viewed through the massive window, was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office was covered with photographs of past personnel and players. I recognized almost all of them, since football was my life. Not to mention, I had taken a particularly keen interest in the San Diego Chargers since their last offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was dressed to the nines in khakis and cordovan loafers and a blue silk shirt that accentuated my blue eyes. At least that\u0027s what I\u0027m told.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door opened and a little bald man with gold rimmed glasses came in. He saw me, smiled brightly, and moved over to me with surprising speed. Of course, it shouldn\u0027t be too surprising, Aaron Larkin had been free safety for the Chargers for most of his career in the seventies. In the seventies, he had not been bald.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God, Knighthorse, you are a big boy,\" he said, pumping my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really? I hadn\u0027t noticed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and gestured for me to sit. He moved behind his black lacquer desk and took a seat. Larkin leaned forward eagerly and laced his fingers together before him. His fingers were thick and gnarled and some seemed particularly crooked, not too surprising after a full career in football. Between high school, college and the pros, fingers were bound to get broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are very excited to hear from you,\" Aaron Larkin began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excitement is good. I am happy to be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we had given up on you. Such a tragedy about your leg. But my God you have kept yourself fit. And we need someone like you badly. Hell, who doesn\u0027t need a fullback nowadays?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Outside of football, few people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"We want to give you a private workout in two weeks. If we like what we see we\u0027ll invite you to training camp. We are honored that you\u0027re here, Knighthorse. My God you were an unholy terror on the playing field. Your services could be very, very valuable to us. So how is the leg?\" he asked, and his voice was filled with genuine concern, and for that I liked the guy immensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has healed completely.\" I lied. It hurt like a motherfucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An utter miracle. I watched you coming down the hall. There\u0027s no limp to speak of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hallways had been empty. He must have been watching me on some closed circuit TV. A sort of high tech surveillance to monitor my gait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m a hell of a specimen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Around here, they all are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe set a date for my mini-workout, and when I left his office, I waved to the little camera situated in the upper corner of the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e56.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the hell is he?\" asked Sanchez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you just shrug?\" he asked. \"Because it\u0027s too dark to tell. I mean there\u0027s a hundred reasons why I\u0027m one of the best homicide detectives in LAPD, but seeing in the dark ain\u0027t one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither is using proper English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell you\u0027re lucky I\u0027m using any English at all, being of Latino descent, and this being Southern California.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is America, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately there ain\u0027t no such thing as speaking American.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And last time I checked we ain\u0027t in England, so fuck English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were waiting outside of Huntington High in my Mustang. It was past 7:00 p.m., and Bryan Dawson, or Pencil Dick, was still in his office. We had been waiting here for the past four hours. Students were long gone, including most of the faculty. We had watched the sun set over the Pacific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hungry,\" said Sanchez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a Wendy\u0027s around the corner. Why don\u0027t you go get us something to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you give me the fucking money to go get us something to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When was the last time you paid for anything?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last time you helped me solve a case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him the cash. Sanchez left, and the mere thought of a burger and fries made my stomach start to growl. We had been following Pencil Dick for four straight days. So far there was no evidence of any extracurricular activities on the part of the band director, other than his fondness for frozen yogurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanchez came back with a massive grease-stained bag of food. We ate silently and quickly, drinking from two plastic buckets that were passed off as jumbo drinks. And when we were finished, when the eating noises finally stopped altogether, when the debris had been collected back into the bags, I saw a familiar sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing down through a side hall, turning into the faculty parking lot, was a handsome man with dark hair. He was carrying a briefcase, and looked far too important to be just a band director. Or at least that was the impression he presented. He got into a red Jetta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s roll,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e57.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan Dawson lived in a condo about a mile from the beach. We were currently heading in the opposite direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not heading home,\" said Sanchez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Astute,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was three cars behind the Huntington band director, sometimes drifting back to four or five. To date, he had made no indication that he knew he was being followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re following too close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to make us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not going to make us,\" I said. \"And I\u0027m the one who taught you how to tail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m the one who got all the tail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were heading deeper into Huntington Beach. In fact, we were just a few blocks from my office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know someone works around here,\" said Sanchez. \"Thinks he\u0027s a detective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jetta suddenly turned into an empty bank parking lot. I pulled to the side of the road and killed the headlights, giving us a good view of Pencil Dick. From the shadows, a lithe figured stepped away from the building and into Dawson\u0027s car. The Jetta swung around, exited the parking lot and was soon heading back our way. Sanchez and I both ducked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You realize that we look like fools,\" said Sanchez as the car sped past us. \"The windows are tinted. They can\u0027t see us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They especially can\u0027t see you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a comment on my darkish skin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your dark skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m proud of my dark skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for you,\" I said, peeking up and looking in my rearview mirror. Dawson was heading south, probably home. I flicked on the lights. \"And away we go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e58.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed four car lengths behind the Jetta. Judging by Dawson\u0027s preoccupation with his newly acquired passenger, I probably could have followed directly behind him with my brights on, with little fear of being made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She just disappeared,\" said Sanchez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In his lap,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think she\u0027s inspecting the quality of his zipper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s inspecting something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jetta swerved slightly to the right. Dawson over-compensated and swerved to the left. He finally regained some control, although he now drove more toward the right side of the lane and even on the line itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems distracted,\" said Sanchez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old do you think she is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way of telling yet,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the least, gonna nail him for statutory rape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got the camera?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanchez reached around and grabbed a nifty piece of equipment. It was a high resolution camcorder with night vision capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you know how to work this thing?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No idea. But we should figure it out fairly quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jetta braked and made a right into a massive condo complex. I pulled immediately into a maintenance parking spot near the trash dumpster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Sanchez said, \"I\u0027ve got it rolling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zoom in on the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the whir of the zoom feature, and watched the lens stretch out like a probing eye. A green light feature indicated that the night vision capability was currently being used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it steady,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what your mom told me back in high school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know you back in high school. Plus, my mom was killed when I was ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled away from the camera. \"No shit? How was she killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, lifted the camera back up to his eye. \"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Here they come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice choice of words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl emerged from her position in his lap. We both hunched down. The doors opened. I peaked through the steering wheel. Although the windshield was tinted, it was not as dark as the door glass. Someone looking hard enough could still spot us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to get a van. This is bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you talk the camera moves. So don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed our way, laughing and holding hands. Dawson\u0027s shirt was untucked. They continued toward us. Sanchez turned in his seat and followed them. As if on cue, Dawson stopped next to Sanchez\u0027s door, turned the girl around, planted a big kiss on her lips, and felt her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You getting this?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old do you think she is?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued up a flight of stairs and disappeared. Sanchez pulled the camera away from his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Goodbye, Pencil Dick.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-horse-jim-knighthorse-1/page-20.html","bookId":2351,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:30 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:30 AM"}
