Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassey groaned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the cemetery, he stood guard as day ended and dusk fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHand in hand, Nikki and Brent entered. \"Huey?\" Brent called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki saw the old man as he came out to greet them. \"Hey, there, Injun boy. And you, miss,\" he said to Nikki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to thank you, Huey,\" Brent said. \"And I hope that, if I need you, you\u0027ll be around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well… I don\u0027t think I will be. I\u0027ve just been waiting on you comin\u0027 around again,\" Huey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" Brent said with a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuey gave a broad grin. \"You wouldn\u0027t believe… that pretty young gal came around again. Marie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old McManus\u0027s descendant?\" Nikki asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuey nodded. \"She done found that I have a great, great… well, I don\u0027t know how many greats. But I got me a pretty descendant, too. A little girl just as sweet as can be. And Miss Marie McManus, well, she brought the girl to the graveyard with her momma, and she showed her about where I\u0027m supposed to be, and they were talking, and the momma, she\u0027s pretty poor, but that Marie girl wants to be her big sister and pay for piano lessons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s nice, Huey. That\u0027s really nice,\" Brent said. \"But… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you see, late at night, after the ruckus, I was pretty proud. Felt like I\u0027d stopped some bad stuff from hitting the streets. And I reckon I was right enough to feel proud, \u0027cause I saw this passage—prettiest passage I ever done see, living or dead. It was like I was beckoned to follow, only it just wasn\u0027t right yet. Today, after seeing those girls… it\u0027s right. I\u0027m going to be looking for it. Looking for the light.\" Huey tilted his chin, indicating that they should look behind themselves. \"I\u0027m thinking as how your friends there are ready, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki spun around, as did Brent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew, however, who she would see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy. And Tom Garfield. She wasn\u0027t surprised, and she wasn\u0027t frightened. She wasn\u0027t even disturbed by the cold when Andy came over to her and she felt the strangest hug. There… but not there. Cold. And yet so very warm. Andy kissed her cheek. \"Thank you,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt tears rising in her eyes. \"No,\" Andy told her. She winked. \"That passage Huey is talking about… well, you can\u0027t imagine. And… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flicked her hair back, wickedly winking. \"I don\u0027t have to go alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost of Tom Garfield reached out a hand to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy took it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki never actually saw any of them go down their magnificent path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were just there, and then they were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Brent whispered to her softly. \"It\u0027s time for us to go now, too. We have a different path.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took his hand, and they left the cemetery together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took Massey and Joulette for drinks that evening, then went back to Nikki\u0027s. Alone in the house, they made love, then made love again, the act made special by the simple fact that it was so physical. They couldn\u0027t help but feel so grateful and so alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, Brent rose while Nikki slept. He walked out on the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew Orleans. Home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a great place. A wonderful place. It was his heart. Nikki had become his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUm, yeah, it was full of ghosts. But they were great ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was also full of history, art, music, and wonderful memories of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with Nikki in his life, it held a future full of hope. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-51.html","bookId":2268,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
