Then Sophie spoke, trying to get Alberto\u0027s mind off what had happened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Descartes must have been an odd kind of person. Did he become famous?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alberto breathed deeply for a couple of seconds before answering: \"He had a great deal of significance. Perhaps most of all for another great philosopher, Ba-ruch Spinoza, who lived from 1632 to 1677.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you going to tell me about him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That was my intention. And we\u0027re not going to be stopped by military provocations.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m all ears.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Spinoza belonged to the Jewish community of Amsterdam, but he was excommunicated for heresy. Few philosophers in more recent times have been so blasphemed and so persecuted for their ideas as this man. It happened because he criticized the established religion. He believed that Christianity and Judaism were only kept alive by rigid dogma and outer ritual. He was the first to apply what we call a historico-critical interpretation of the Bible.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Explanation, please.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He denied that the Bible was inspired by God down to the last letter. When we read the Bible, he said, we must continually bear in mind the period it was written in. A \u0027critical\u0027 reading, such as the one he proposed, revealed a number of inconsistencies in the texts. But beneath the surface of the Scriptures in the New Testament is Jesus, who could well be called God\u0027s mouthpiece. The teachings of Jesus therefore represented a liberation from the orthodoxy of Judaism. Jesus preached a \u0027religion of reason\u0027 which valued love higher than all else. Spinoza interpreted this as meaning both love of God and love of humanity. Nevertheless, Christianity had also become set in its own rigid dogmas and outer rituals.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t suppose these ideas were easy to swallow, either for the church or the synagogue.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When things got really tough, Spinoza was even deserted by his own family. They tried to disinherit him on the grounds of his heresy. Paradoxically enough, few have spoken out more powerfully in the cause of free speech and religious tolerance than Spinoza. The opposition he was met with on all sides led him to pursue a quiet and secluded life devoted entirely to philosophy. He earned a meager living by polishing lenses, some of which have come into my possession.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very impressive!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is almost something symbolic in the fact that he lived by polishing lenses. A philosopher must help people to see life in a new perspective. One of the pillars of Spinoza\u0027s philosophy was indeed to see things from the perspective of eternity.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The perspective of eternity?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, Sophie. Do you think you can imagine your own life in a cosmic context? You\u0027ll have to try and imagine yourself and your life here and now ...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hm ... that\u0027s not so easy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Remind yourself that you are only living a minuscule part of all nature\u0027s life. You are part of an enormous whole.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think I see what you mean ...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you manage to feel it as well? Can you perceive all of nature at one time--the whole universe, in fact-- at a single glance?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I doubt it. Maybe I need some lenses.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t mean only the infinity of space. I mean the eternity of time as well. Once upon a time, thirty thousand years ago there lived a little boy in the Rhine valley. He was a tiny part of nature, a tiny ripple on an endless sea. You too, Sophie, you too are living a tiny part of nature\u0027s life. There is no difference between you and that boy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Except that I\u0027m alive now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, but that is precisely what I wanted you to try and imagine. Who will you be in thirty thousand years?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Was that the heresy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not entirely ... Spinoza didn\u0027t only say that everything is nature. He identified nature with God. He said God is all, and all is in God.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So he was a pantheist.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s true. To Spinoza, God did not create the world in order to stand outside it. No, God is the world. Sometimes Spinoza expresses it differently. He maintains that the world is in God. In this, he is quoting St. Paul\u0027s speech to the Athenians on the Areopagos hill: \u0027In him we live and move and have our being.\u0027 But let us pursue Spinoza\u0027s own reasoning. His most important book was his Ethics Geometrically Demonstrated.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ethics--geometrically demonstrated?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It may sound a bit strange to us. In philosophy, ethics means the study of moral conduct for living a good life. This is also what we mean when we speak of the ethics of Socrates or Aristotle, for example. It is only in our own time that ethics has more or less become reduced to a set of rules for living without treading on other people\u0027s toes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because thinking of yourself is supposed to be egoism?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Something like that, yes. When Spinoza uses the word ethics, he means both the art of living and moral conduct.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But even so ... the art of living demonstrated geometrically?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The geometrical method refers to the terminology he used for his formulations. You may recall how Descartes wished to use mathematical method for philosophical reflection. By this he meant a form of philosophic reflection that was constructed from strictly logical conclusions. Spinoza was part of the same rationalistic tradition. He wanted his ethics to show that human life is subject to the universal laws of nature. We must therefore free ourselves from our feelings and our passions. Only then will we find contentment and be happy, he believed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Surely we are not ruled exclusively by the laws of nature?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, Spinoza is not an easy philosopher to grasp. Let\u0027s take him bit by bit. You remember that Descartes believed that reality consisted of two completely separate substances, namely thought and extension.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How could I have forgotten it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The word \u0027substance\u0027 can be interpreted as \u0027that which something consists of,\u0027 or that which something basically is or can be reduced to. Descartes operated then with two of these substances. Everything was either thought or extension.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"However, Spinoza rejected this split. He believed that there was only one substance. Everything that exists can be reduced to one single reality which he simply called Substance. At times he calls it God or nature. Thus Spinoza does not have the dualistic view of reality that Descartes had. We say he is a monist. That is, he reduces nature and the condition of all things to one single substance.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They could hardly have disagreed more.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, but the difference between Descartes and Spinoza is not as deep-seated as many have often claimed. Descartes also pointed out that only God exists independently. It\u0027s only when Spinoza identifies God with nature--or God and creation--that he distances himself a good way from both Descartes and from the Jewish and Christian doctrines.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So then nature is God, and that\u0027s that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But when Spinoza uses the word \u0027nature,\u0027 he doesn\u0027t only mean extended nature. By Substance, God, or nature, he means everything that exists, including all things spiritual.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You mean both thought and extension.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You said it! According to Spinoza, we humans recognize two of God\u0027s qualities or manifestations. Spinoza called these qualities God\u0027s attributes, and these two attributes are identical with Descartes\u0027s \u0027thought\u0027 and \u0027extension.\u0027 God--or nature--manifests itself either as thought or as extension. It may well be that God has infinitely more attributes than \u0027thought\u0027 and \u0027extension,\u0027 but these are the only two that are known to man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fair enough, but what a complicated way of saying it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, one almost needs a hammer and chisel to get through Spinoza\u0027s language. The reward is that in the end you dig out a thought as crystal clear as a diamond.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can hardly wait!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Everything in nature, then, is either thought or extension. The various phenomena we come across in everyday life, such as a flower or a poem by Wordsworth, are different modes of the attribute of thought or extension. A \u0027mode\u0027 is the particular manner which Substance, God, or nature assumes. A flower is a mode of the attribute of extension, and a poem about the same flower is a mode of the attribute of thought. But both are basically the expression of Substance, God, or nature.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You could have fooled me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But it\u0027s not as complicated as he makes it sound. Beneath his stringent formulation lies a wonderful realization that is actually so simple that everyday language cannot accommodate it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think I prefer everyday language, if it\u0027s all the same to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Right. Then I\u0027d better begin with you yourself. When you get a pain in your stomach, what is it that has a pain?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Like you just said. It\u0027s me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fair enough. And when you later recollect that you once had a pain in your stomach, what is it that thinks?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s me, too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So you are a single person that has a stomachache one minute and is in a thoughtful mood the next. Spinoza maintained that all material things and things that happen around us are an expression of God or nature. So it follows that all thoughts that we think are also God\u0027s or nature\u0027s thoughts. For everything is One. There is only one God, one nature, or one Substance.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But listen, when I think something, I\u0027m the one who\u0027s doing the thinking. When I move, I\u0027m doing the moving. Why do you have to mix God into it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I like your involvement. But who are you? You are Sophie Amundsen, but you are also the expression of something infinitely bigger. You can, if you wish, say that you are thinking or that you are moving, but could you not also say that it is nature that is thinking your thoughts, or that it is nature that is moving through you? It\u0027s really just a question of which lenses you choose to look through.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you saying I cannot decide for myself?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes and no. You may have the right to move your thumb any way you choose. But your thumb can only move according to its nature. It cannot jump off your hand and dance about the room. In the same way you also have your place in the structure of existence, my dear. You are Sophie, but you are also a finger of God\u0027s body.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So God decides everything I do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Or nature, or the laws of nature. Spinoza believed that God--or the laws of nature--is the inner cause of everything that happens. He is not an outer cause, since God speaks through the laws of nature and only through them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m not sure I can see the difference.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"God is not a puppeteer who pulls all the strings, controlling everything that happens. A real puppet master controls the puppets from outside and is therefore the \u0027outer cause\u0027 of the puppet\u0027s movements. But that is not the way God controls the world. God controls the world through natural laws. So God--or nature--is the \u0027inner cause\u0027 of everything that happens. This means that everything in the material world happens through necessity. Spinoza had a determinist view of the material, or natural, world.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think you said something like that before.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re probably thinking of the Stoics. They also claimed that everything happens out of necessity. That was why it was important to meet every situation with \u0027stoicism.\u0027 Man should not get carried away by his feelings. Briefly, that was also Spinoza\u0027s ethics.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I see what you mean, but I still don\u0027t like the idea that I don\u0027t decide for myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Okay, let\u0027s go back in time to the Stone Age boy who lived thirty thousand years ago. When he grew up, he cast spears after wild animals, loved a woman who became the mother of his children, and quite certainly worshipped the tribal gods. Do you really think he decided all that for himself?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Or think of a lion in Africa. Do you think it makes up its mind to be a beast of prey? Is that why it attacks a limping antelope? Could it instead have made up its mind to be a vegetarian?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, a lion obeys its nature.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You mean, the laws of nature. So do you, Sophie, because you are also part of nature. You could of course protest, with the support of Descartes, that a lion is an animal and not a free human being with free mental faculties. But think of a newborn baby that screams and yells. If it doesn\u0027t get milk it sucks its thumb. Does that baby have a free will?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I guess not.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When does the child get its free will, then? At the age of two, she runs around and points at everything in sight. At the age of three she nags her mother, and at the age of four she suddenly gets afraid of the dark. Where\u0027s the freedom, Sophie?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When she is fifteen, she sits in front of a mirror experimenting with makeup. Is this the moment when she makes her own personal decisions and does what she likes?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I see what you\u0027re getting at.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She is Sophie Amundsen, certainly. But she also lives according to the laws of nature. The point is that she doesn\u0027t realize it because there are so many complex reasons for everything she does.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think I want to hear any more.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you must just answer a last question. Two equally old trees are growing in a large garden. One of the trees grows in a sunny spot and has plenty of good soil and water. The other tree grows in poor soil in a dark spot. Which of the trees do you think is bigger? And which of them bears more fruit?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Obviously the tree with the best conditions for growing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"According to Spinoza, this tree is free. It has its full freedom to develop its inherent abilities. But if it is an apple tree it will not have the ability to bear pears or plums. The same applies to us humans. We can be hindered in our development and our personal growth by political conditions, for instance. Outer circumstances can constrain us. Only when we are free to develop our innate abilities can we live as free beings. But we are just as much determined by inner potential and outer opportunities as the Stone Age boy on the Rhine, the lion in Africa, or the apple tree in the garden.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Okay, I give in, almost.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Spinoza emphasizes that there is only one being which is totally and utterly \u0027its own cause\u0027 and can act with complete freedom. Only God or nature is the expression of such a free and \u0027nonaccidental\u0027 process. Man can strive for freedom in order to live without outer con-straint, but he will never achieve \u0027free will.\u0027 We do not control everything that happens in our body--which is a mode of the attribute of extension. Neither do we \u0027choose\u0027 our thinking. Man therefore does not have a \u0027free soul\u0027; it is more or less imprisoned in a mechanical body.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is rather hard to understand.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Spinoza said that it was our passions--such as ambition and lust--which prevent us from achieving true happiness and harmony, but that if we recognize that everything happens from necessity, we can achieve an intuitive understanding of nature as a whole. We can come to realize with crystal clarity that everything is related, even that everything is One. The goal is to comprehend everything that exists in an all-embracing perception. Only then will we achieve true happiness and contentment. This was what Spinoza called seeing everything \u0027sub specie aeternitatis.\u0027 \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Which means what?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To see everything from the perspective of eternity.
