If I don\u0027t return within an hour, have Matt drive you home.\" Alexander gave me a quick kiss on the cheek and started toward his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going with you,\" I said, following after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay here,\" he said, proceeding on. \"I\u0027ll come back for you when I\u0027m finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming too. Billy\u0027s my brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander continued cutting through the grass instead of walking on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where does Maria Maxwell live?\" I asked. \"Or, I mean, where\u0027s she buried? In Dullsville\u0027s cemetery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry said Billy was going to Valentine\u0027s house. I have an idea where that might be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alexander and I reached the Mercedes, my usually gentlemanly boyfriend didn\u0027t open the door for me. Alexander was preoccupied as he started the car. We continued to sit in silence as we drove through downtown. \"This isn\u0027t how I imagined spending my prom,\" I said. \"Trevor getting even with me and now Billy Boy in harm\u0027s way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trevor is more of a vampire than I am,\" Alexander admitted. \"He thinks like one and acts like one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I love you,\" I said. \"You are a vampire with a soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While I am buried in the darkness of my coffin, I know Trevor can see you every day, share classes with you, gaze at you in the cafeteria. Things I never get to do--and will never be able to do. I know he was shoving it in my face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s a heavenly face,\" I said, caressing his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You looked so beautiful tonight,\" Alexander said as he continued to drive. \"I only wish I could have been the Prom King dancing with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I didn\u0027t dance with Trevor. I gave the tiara to Jennifer Warren. She\u0027s the most popular girl in school. I can guarantee, now that Trevor tricked both me and her, he\u0027ll be riding home tonight in his million-dollar stretch limo alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed out into darkness and at the same haze-covered fields we passed a few days ago. We drove through a forgotten meadow and along a bumpy dirt path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car\u0027s headlights shined on the darkened cavern and illuminated something shiny at the mouth of the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly got out of the car. Billy Boy\u0027s bike was outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were right!\" I said proudly. \"My brother\u0027s here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander handed me the flashlight and we crept into the darkened cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy!\" I called, but only my voice echoed back to me. A few inches of water trickled over the stone floor as we traipsed through the dark and dank cave in our prom outfits. I held the hem of my dress up with one hand and the flashlight with the other while Alexander kindly guided me through our subterranean surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t like Billy. He\u0027s not this adventurous. This is something I\u0027d do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that\u0027s why he\u0027s doing it,\" Alexander deduced. \"To be more like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he was trying to impress Valentine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe impressing you is more important to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy!\" I called. No answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the trickling waterfall and fanglike stalactites where Alexander and I had had our romantic interlude. Alexander and I stopped and called out to Billy again. Once again we didn\u0027t hear an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy flashlight illuminated what seemed to be a round patch on the stone floor. On further inspection, I realized it was a circle of dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This circle isn\u0027t big enough for a coffin,\" I stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not sleeping in a coffin,\" Alexander surmised. He pointed above us. I turned my light toward the cave\u0027s ceiling. A few bats, hanging upside down, were startled and flew off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped. \"Is one of them Valentine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continued to forge on, proceeding farther into the cave than we\u0027d explored the last time we were here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy!\" Alexander hollered. My light caught an odd shape in front of us. At first it appeared to be a dead end. But then I realized the cave split off in two different directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which way do we go?\" I asked anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to separate,\" Alexander instructed. \"We don\u0027t have enough time to search each path together. I\u0027ll be able to find you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut will we be able to find Billy? I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander squeezed my hand and then let go. I flashed the light in his direction, but he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shined my light in front of me. A chill ran through my veins. The air was cool and smelled musty. I took a deep breath and proceeded into the passageway. As I journeyed deeper into the cave, the passageway narrowed, the walls closing in on me. Soon the branch of the cave was only wide enough for one person to fit through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally I\u0027d have been exhilarated, feeling comforted by the nocturnal elements around me. Instead I was anxious. If I didn\u0027t get to Billy Boy in time, he\u0027d be grounded for eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I crept through the skinny passageway, the air turned chillier and the sound of trickling water grew faint. The flashlight illuminated only a small pathway before me. I averted any protruding stalagmites by reaching out before me in the blinding darkness as I continued on my way, deeper into the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy!\" I shouted. \"Billy--where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe narrow walls of the passageway suddenly opened. In the distance, I saw what appeared to be flickering lights a few yards away. Maybe Billy was flashing an SOS. I gathered the hem of my dress and hurried toward the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a lit candelabra. \"Billy!\" I pointed the flashlight everywhere--the moss-carpeted walls, the rock-encrusted floor, the mile-high ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I felt a presence standing next to me. I shined the light on the figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Billy Boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy!\" I exclaimed. I reached out and hugged my startled brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" he asked, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should be asking you that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly checked my brother\u0027s neck for any bite marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to make sure you are okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine. Don\u0027t tell Mom. I\u0027ll be grounded again. Valentine wanted to show me this cave before he finally took me to the place where he\u0027s been staying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is where he\u0027s been staying! I almost said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We came here to get more samples for our vampire project,\" Billy Boy said proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re the vampire project, I wanted to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise you won\u0027t snitch on Valentine. He\u0027s from Romania and knows a lot about the history of vampires, caves, and bats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re terrified of bats!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh!\" he whispered. \"Swear you won\u0027t tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear. Now let\u0027s go--\" \"Valentine was just here,\" Billy Boy said, glancing around. \"We were going to meet his aunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to meet his aunt?\" I asked. \"This is Valentine\u0027s aunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed my brother Jagger\u0027s gravestone etching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy gasped, his face turning as white as a corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I warned you about Valentine. Hurry, we have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would Valentine lie? Where is he?\" he said, concerned. \"We can\u0027t leave him--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander will take care of him. You and I have to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to grab my backpack. Our project is inside it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget about your--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could finish my sentence, my brother had already taken off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine stepped out of the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeakened and wearied, Valentine appeared more deathly than ever, as if he\u0027d been lying at the bottom of a frozen lake. His lips were ice blue and his teeth were chattering, but that didn\u0027t stop the devilish boy from inching closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Billy!\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More important, where are my siblings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I already explained before that I thought they went back to Romania.\" \"Well, they didn\u0027t. Something--or someone--kept them from returning,\" he said accusingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why you were reading Billy\u0027s, Trevor\u0027s, and my thoughts? To find Jagger and Luna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I read a lot more than I imagined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine inched closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I read Trevor\u0027s blood, I saw a covenant by the graveyard with Grim Reapers all around. A girl in a tattered prom dress walked up the aisle. But when she lifted her veil, instead of seeing my sister\u0027s face--I saw yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are talking about the Graveyard Gala--Trevor\u0027s party at the cemetery. That\u0027s not how it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but that\u0027s how Trevor wanted it to happen. He never wanted my sister; he settled for her because she reminded him of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My family has been shamed ever since Alexander ditched my sister in Romania. Jagger came here to seek his revenge on that cowardly vampire. Then he called for my sister. Only they never called for me--because they think I\u0027m a kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s normal. Billy feels left out all the time,\" I tried to assure him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now that I\u0027m here, I see that you are the cause of them being shamed again,\" Valentine said, advancing toward me. \"Now they won\u0027t ever return to me and my family. Neither Trevor nor Alexander wanted my sister. They both want you--and they still do.\" \"I don\u0027t know what you mean. Why would Alexander \u0027still\u0027 want me--he already has me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not completely. Remember...Alexander is a vampire, after all,\" Valentine said, and flashed his fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve read his blood. He\u0027s hungered for your flesh, blood, and soul since he laid eyes on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what you say; you are just trying to destroy our relationship. But you can\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or can I? How long can you two be together when one craves the blood of the other? How long will you torment him? For eternity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I\u0027m the one who\u0027s tormented. I want to be in Alexander\u0027s world and he wants to protect me from it-- and vampires like you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Valentine--you\u0027ve said enough!\" I heard a familiar voice say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around. Alexander was standing behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed up at Alexander\u0027s dark eyes. Were Valentine\u0027s words about my boyfriend correct? Alexander backed away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Valentine--you have to leave this cave and this town now,\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t leave until I\u0027ve gotten what I came here for. And since I can\u0027t find my brother, I\u0027ll have to take yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the darkness, Billy Boy traipsed toward me, his backpack slung over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine grabbed my brother\u0027s puny arm and lifted his wrist to his mouth. \"What are you doing?\" Billy Boy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine smiled a wicked grin and flashed his fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine opened his mouth wide and began to bear down on my brother\u0027s wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shined the flashlight on Valentine\u0027s face. His green eyes turned crystal white, then bloodred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine let out a horrible yell and withdrew his grip from my brother\u0027s wrist. He covered his face from the light and recoiled into the shadows. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dance-with-a-vampire-vampire-kisses-4/page-16.html","bookId":2143,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:14 PM"}
