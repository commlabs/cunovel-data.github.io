We were boarded on it, when I got my first glimpse of Roxy. Her eyes were swollen shut. She was a mess—fat lips and cuts. Her hands were wrapped in soaked bandages. He dragged her from the plane and shoved her in the back. Her blonde hair was ratty and missing in parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce and Coop shared the same blank expression, whereas I imagined Jack and I were both horrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me, terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were somewhere warm still. We flew down a coastline, rocky and beautiful. I was lost, completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself to see the stunning things, and not the dying girl in the back, who used to be stunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe helicopter circled a huge house. It landed on a large, cement pad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames was walking down the path from the huge house. My breathing stopped completely, as my heart pounded out of my chest. I felt my face flush. Coop covered my hands with his, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “No—to what you’re thinking or feeling. Shut it off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried, but my kids’ faces were all over his. My kids, who I hadn’t seen in, what felt like an eternity. My face pinched and balled. I fought tears so hard it hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffled and sighed, “I can do this,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe landed. James didn’t look up. He walked until the door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he stopped, stared and then frowned. His girlfriend was tossed from the helicopter first. Servario had a gun drawn. He passed one to Luce and Coop, as he stepped down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames put his hands up. He was completely lost and confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t even seen me yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed out last, following Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes darted as the helicopter turned off, making a huge wind surround us all momentarily, until it finally stopping spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames’ eye caught my face. He put his hands out, “Evie!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and snatched the gun from Luce’s hand. I fired at his left kneecap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe screamed out as crimson started to seep out from this beige, linen pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce reached for the gun, but when she saw my face, she stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could you?” I asked just barely audible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face crumpled as he held his knee, “Evie, please let me speak.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot at the other knee, missing. He dropped to the ground anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario walked away from the nearly falling-over Roxy and came up to me. He looked down, lifting my face up. He brushed his lips against mine, “Let me. You don’t want this memory when you look at your children,” he whispered into my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and stepped back. He pulled the gun from my hand and passed it back to Luce. She gave me an understanding look but Coop looked psychotic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Mel here?” I asked past Servario’s back. He wasn’t looking at me, he was trying to crawl to his girlfriend, Roxy. She swayed as blood dripped from her bandaged hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally James looked at me long and hard, “Your father did this, Evie. Not me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed, “Just kill him. I want him gone for real.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and walked back to the helicopter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the shot fire but I didn’t look back. Then the second one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in the seat and waited. I wanted to look inside of the house. I wanted to know his secrets. I wanted it all to become clear to me but a voice, probably my father’s, told me I didn’t really want that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt told me that I wanted to let this one go. I would find answers in other places too. I didn’t just need these answers. These ones would haunt me for all my days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seventeen – Princess Evie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jet felt haunted as we crossed an ocean. I could only assume it was the Pacific. We were going to Asia. I wondered if he was taking me to an ashram. I needed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Servario, trying not to see the sadistic fuck I’d seen in that room. He looked like I’d killed his cat, when he glanced over at me. “I’m sorry, Evie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “Me too. I’m sorry it was her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop glanced over from the notes Servario must have taken while torturing her. “So Mel is dead. She was the one in the car.” That hurt. Mel too, had been used by James.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “He didn’t need her anymore, because he had Roxy. Roxy, who wanted to find herself a millionaire like Servario.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario stood and walked to the front of the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop continued, “James was helping frame you to get your dad out of hiding. He had asked Roxy to take pictures of every meeting Servario went to. After your dad was dead, he and Servario met. Roxy got it on her cellphone so it must have been recent. It was the proof CI needed to use you to bring him out of hiding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, “They knew he was in hiding all along? He’s been dead for a long time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, “Must have suspected something. Anyway, Servario beat her and broke her and she confessed. The plan was to take the money, leave you screwed and leave the kids with your mom. She actually said James never really cared what happened to the kids. He just wanted his easy life in his beach house with his blonde.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t even hurt anymore. Not even for my kids. I didn’t even care a little. I couldn’t. If I cared about one thing, all the emotions I was shutting off would find their way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, “He was a douche nozzle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop snorted, “Yeah. Dumb fuck. Who does that to their own family? Anyway, Servario used Roxy’s cell to text James and send the helicopter. James was expecting her to get off alone. They were going to start their new life together. Roxy had been letting him in on the progress of the fuck-Evie campaign. Apparently, he was quite satisfied with how it had turned out. You were a fugitive and Servario was forcing sex on you all the time and humiliating you.” His tone was filled with disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed at that. My lips curled into a grim smile, “She was thorough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario brought a tray to Luce and Jack and then one to us. It was filled with snacks and things. He smiled at me, “I’m so sorry, Evie. I had no idea it was her. I assumed Steve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, “They got the death they deserved, then I guess.” I smirked, “The account is still there right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes flashed, “Excellent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe landed hours later in smoggy Tokyo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, “Japan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario bowed, “Yes, Princess Evie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe climbed into another helicopter. I shook my head, “It’s too much. I need to be away from all vehicles—all. I need a vacation from this vacation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack moaned, “Not another flight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat in our seats and instantly started for the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario grinned, “This is going to take about two hours. So buckle up and try to enjoy the ride.” He seemed tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI supposed I would too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI, on the other hand, felt a renewed sense of freedom. My marriage had never had confines that I was aware of. Looking back, I could see the sense of freedom I was feeling was stemming from a lack of confines. Ones I had gotten so used to that I didn’t see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe money in the account freed me from worry, guilt, and obligation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kids were mine. I had never considered divorce, seven months without sex and I never considered divorce. I knew why that was. I never wanted to battle it out like our friends had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Servario and smirked. He was a savage and a complete fiend, and yet he made me feel like a woman. I finally understood the damned song, “A Natural Woman.” Looking at him, I would swear I could hear the bloody lyrics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scared me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked that. Was there shame in my feelings for him, after everything? I couldn’t find any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe would never fall into a routine. We would never go seven months without sex. I would never be truly safe with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked that a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, he wasn’t the only freak in the relationship that would never be a relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking out over the city, I wondered if he was taking me to my kids? I was scared we were never going to get them back. I couldn’t let myself dwell or I would cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and laid my head back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing I knew, I was being shoved. I opened my eyes with a start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack grinned at me, “We’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around, he was waiting for me. Everyone else was outside stretching their legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, “Where are we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe beamed, “I could cry. It’s genius. It actually makes perfect sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, “You are such a nerd.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed out to see nothing but forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario gave me a look. I wasn’t sure what it meant. “This is where I leave you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, “No. What? No. I don’t want you to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, whispering, “I have to. I can never set foot in there. It’s a rule. The Master Key may never set foot in the Princess’s temple, once he has taken on the role. I know I’m safe right now but they don’t know that. They assume I could bring the bad people down on them. I take the role of Master Key and I walk away. Always leading the suspicious people away from this spot. This temple.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around, “What temple?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to a small black cave-looking thing, “That’s the entrance. You have to go in there and walk until you see the light again.” He held a hand out, “I need all of your clothes, and phones, and every piece of electronics.” I looked down at the others. When they looked up at me, they could tell something was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t matter that we griped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe eventually got naked, one at a time behind the helicopter, and left everything with him. We put on the robes he left us. They were stunning Japanese traditional-looking robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce smiled when she came from behind it in the robe. It wasn’t her usual smile, but it counted as effort, after everything we’d been through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s nice, huh?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, “So pretty.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-38.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
