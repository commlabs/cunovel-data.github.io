Afterward, they took the drive to Cernobbia and had lunch at Lake Como, at the beautiful Villa d\u0027Este.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concert that night was a triumph, and the greenroom at La Scala Opera House was packed with well-wishers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara stood to one side, watching as Philip\u0027s fans surrounded him, touching him, adoring him, asking for autographs, handing him little gifts. Lara felt a sharp pang of jealousy. Some of the women were young and beautiful, and it seemed to Lara that all of them were obvious. An American woman in an elegant Fendi gown was saying, coyly, \"If you\u0027re free tomorrow, Mr. Adler, I\u0027m having an intimate little dinner at my villa. Very intimate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara wanted to strangle the bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip smiled. \"Er...thank you, but I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother woman tried to slip Philip her hotel key. He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip looked over at Lara and grinned. Women kept crowding around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lei era magnifico, maestro!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Molto gentile da parte sua,\" Philip replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"L\u0027ho sentita suonare il anno scorso. Bravo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grazie.\" Philip smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman was clutching his arm. \"Sarebbe possibile cenare insieme?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip shook his head. \"Ma non credo che sarai impossibile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Lara, it seemed to go on forever. Finally, Philip made his way over to Lara and whispered, \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"S��!\" Lara grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went to Biffy, the restaurant in the opera house, and the moment they walked in, the patrons, dressed in black tie for the concert, rose to their feet and began applauding. The maitre d\u0027 led Philip and Lara toward a table in the center of the room. \"It\u0027s such an honor to have you with us, Mr. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA complimentary bottle of champagne arrived, and they drank a toast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To us,\" Philip said warmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip ordered two of the specialties of the house, osso buco and penne all\u0027arrabbiata. All during supper they talked, and it was as though they had known each other forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were constantly interrupted by people coming up to the table to compliment Philip and to ask for autographs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s always like this, isn\u0027t it?\" Lara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip shrugged. \"It goes with the territory. For every two hours you spend onstage, you spend countless more signing autographs or giving interviews.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if to punctuate what he was saying, he stopped to sign another autograph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve made this tour wonderful for me.\" Philip sighed. \"The bad news is that I have to leave for Venice tomorrow. I\u0027m going to miss you a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been to Venice,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara\u0027s jet was waiting for them at Linate Airport. When they arrived there, Philip looked at the huge jet in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is your plane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s going to take us to Venice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to spoil me, lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara said softly, \"I intend to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey landed in Venice thirty-five minutes later at Marco Polo Airport where a limousine waited to drive them the short distance to the dock. From the dock they would take a motorboat to the island of Giudecca, where the Cipriani Hotel was located.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I arranged for two suites for us,\" Lara said. \"I thought it would be more discreet that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the motorboat on the way to the hotel, Lara asked, \"How long will we be here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only one night, I\u0027m afraid. I\u0027m giving a recital at La Fenice, and then we head for Vienna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \"we\" gave Lara a little thrill. They had discussed it the night before. \"I\u0027d like you to stay with me as long as you can,\" Philip had said, \"but are you sure I\u0027m not keeping you from something more important?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is nothing more important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to be all right by yourself this afternoon? I\u0027m going to be busy rehearsing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine,\" Lara assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they had checked into their suites, Philip took Lara in his arms. \"I have to go to the theater now, but there\u0027s a lot to see here. Enjoy Venice. I\u0027ll see you later this afternoon.\" They kissed. It was meant to be a brief one, but it turned into a long, lingering kiss. \"I\u0027d better get out of here while I can,\" Philip murmured, \"or I\u0027ll never be able to make it through the lobby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Happy rehearsal.\" Lara grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Philip was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara telephoned Howard Keller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\" Keller demanded. \"I\u0027ve been trying to reach you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in Venice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. \"Are we buying a canal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m checking it out.\" Lara laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really should be back here,\" Keller said. \"There\u0027s a lot going on. Young Frank Rose brought in some new plans. I like them, but I need your approval so we can get...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you like them,\" Lara interrupted, \"go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to see them?\" Keller\u0027s voice was filled with surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now, Howard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. And on the negotiations for the West Side property, I need your okay to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara...are you feeling all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never felt better in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you coming home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll stay in touch. Good-bye, Howard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenice was the kind of magical city that Prospero might have created. Lara spent the rest of the morning and all afternoon exploring. She roamed through St. Mark\u0027s Square, and visited the Doge\u0027s Palace and the Bell Tower, and wandered along the crowded Riva degli Schiavoni, and everywhere she went she thought of Philip. She walked through the winding little side streets, crammed with jewelry shops and leather goods and restaurants, and stopped to buy expensive sweaters and scarves and lingerie for the secretaries at the office, and wallets and ties for Keller and some of the other men. She stopped in at a jeweler\u0027s to buy Philip a Piaget watch with a gold band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you please inscribe it \u0027To Philip with Love from Lara\u0027?\" Just saying his name made her miss him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Philip returned to the hotel, they had coffee in the verdant garden of the Cipriani.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara looked across at Philip and thought, What a perfect place this would be for a honeymoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a present for you,\" Lara said. She handed him the box with the watch in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened it and stared. \"My God! This must have cost a fortune. You shouldn\u0027t have, Lara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I do. It\u0027s beautiful, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ssh! Wear it and think of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need this to think of you, but thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time do we have to leave for the theater?\" Lara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara glanced at Philip\u0027s new watch and said innocently, \"That gives us two hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe theater was packed. The audience was volatile, applauding and cheering each number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the concert was over, Lara went back to the greenroom to join Philip. It was London and Amsterdam and Milan all over again, and the women seemed even more nubile and eager. There were at least half a dozen beautiful women in the room, and Lara wondered which one Philip would have spent the night with if she were not there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had supper at the storied Harry\u0027s Bar and were warmly greeted by the affable owner, Arrigo Cipriani.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a pleasure to see you, signore. And signorina. Please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led them to a corner table. They ordered Bellinis, the specialty of the house. Philip said to Lara, \"I recommend starting with the pasta e fagioli. It\u0027s the best in the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater Philip had no memory of what he had eaten for dinner. He was mesmerized by Lara. He knew he was falling in love with her, and it terrified him. I can\u0027t make a commitment, he thought. It\u0027s impossible. I\u0027m a nomad. He hated to think about the moment when she would leave him to go back to New York. He wanted to prolong their evening as long as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had finished supper, Philip said, \"There\u0027s a casino out on the Lido. Do you gamble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara laughed aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s so funny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara thought about the hundreds of millions of dollars she gambled on her buildings. \"Nothing,\" she said. \"I\u0027d love to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took a motorboat to Lido Island. They walked past the Excelsior Hotel and went to the huge white building that housed the casino. It was filled with eager gamblers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dreamers,\" Philip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip played roulette and within half an hour had won two thousand dollars. He turned to Lara. \"I\u0027ve never won before. You\u0027re my good-luck charm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey played until 3:00 A.M., and by that time they were hungry again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA motorboat took them back to St. Mark\u0027s Square, and they wandered through the side streets until they came to the Cantina do Mori.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is one of the best bacaros in Venice,\" Philip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara said, \"I believe you. What\u0027s a bacaro?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a wine bar where they serve cicchetti - little nibbles of local delicacies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottle-glass doors led to a dark, narrow space where copper pots hung from the ceiling and dishes gleamed on a long banquette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dawn before they got back to their hotel. They got undressed, and Lara said, \"Speaking of nibbles \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly the following morning Lara and Philip flew to Vienna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going to Vienna is like going into another century,\" Philip explained. \"There\u0027s a legend that airline pilots say, \u0027Ladies and gentlemen, we\u0027re on our final approach to Vienna Airport. Please make sure your seat backs and table trays are in the upright position, refrain from smoking until inside the terminal, and set your watches back one hundred years.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My parents were born here. They used to talk about the old days, and it made me envious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were driving along the Ringstrasse, and Philip was filled with excitement, like a small boy eager to share his treasures with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vienna is the city of Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Brahms.\" He looked at Lara and grinned. \"Oh, I forgot - you\u0027re an expert on classical music.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey checked into the Imperial Hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go to the concert hall,\" Philip told Lara, \"but I\u0027ve decided that tomorrow we\u0027re going to take the whole day off. I\u0027m going to show you Vienna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that, Philip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held Lara in his arms. \"I wish we had more time now,\" he said ruefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her lightly on the forehead. \"We\u0027ll make up for it tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held him close. \"Promises, promises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concert that evening took place at the Musikverein. The recital consisted of compositions by Chopin, Schumann, and Prokofiev, and it was another triumph for Philip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe greenroom was packed again, but this time the language was German.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sie war en wunderbar, Herr Adler!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip smiled. \"Das ist sehr nett von Ihnen. Danke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ich bin ein grosser Anhanger von Ihnen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip smiled again. \"Sie sind sehr freundlich.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was talking to them, but he could not take his eyes off Lara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the recital Lara and Philip had a late supper in the hotel. They were greeted by the maitre d\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What an honor!\" he exclaimed. \"I was at the concert tonight. You were magnificent! Magnificent!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re very kind,\" Philip said modestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dinner was delicious, but they were both too excited by each other to eat. When the waiter asked, \"Would you like some dessert?\" Philip said quickly, \"Yes.\" And he was looking at Lara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis instincts told him that something was wrong. She had never been gone this long without telling him where she was. Was she deliberately avoiding him? If she was, there could only be one reason. And I can\u0027t allow that, Paul Martin thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beam of pale moonlight streamed through the window, making soft shadows on the ceiling. Lara and Philip lay in bed, naked, watching their shadows move above their heads. The ripple of the curtains made the shadows dance, in a soft, swaying motion. The shadows came slowly together and separated and came together again, until the two became entwined, became one, and the movement of the dance became faster, and faster, a wild savage pounding, and suddenly it stopped, and there was only the gentle ripple of the curtains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly the following morning Philip said, \"We have a whole day and evening here. I have a lot to show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had breakfast downstairs in the hotel dining room, then walked over to the Karntnerstrasse, where no cars were permitted. The shops there were filled with beautiful clothes and jewelry and antiques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip hired a horse-drawn Fiaker, and they rode through the wide streets of the city along the Ring Road. They visited Schonbrunn Palace and looked at the colorful imperial coach collection. In the afternoon they got tickets for the Spanish Riding School and saw the Lipizzaner stallions. They rode the huge Ferris wheel at the Prater, and afterward Philip said, \"Now we\u0027re going to sin!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Philip laughed. \"I had something else in mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took Lara to Demel\u0027s for its incomparable pastry and coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was fascinated by the mix of architecture in Vienna: beautiful baroque buildings centuries old that faced neomodern buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip was interested in the composers. \"Did you know that Franz Schubert started as a singer here, Lara? He was in the Imperial Chapel choir, and when his voice changed at seventeen, he was thrown out. That\u0027s when he decided to compose music.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had a leisurely dinner at a small bistro, and stopped at a wine tavern in Grinzing. Afterward Philip said, \"Would you like to go for a cruise on the Danube?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a perfect night, with a bright full moon and a soft summer breeze. The stars were shining down. They\u0027re shining down on us, Lara thought, because we\u0027re so happy. Lara and Philip boarded one of the cruise ships, and from the ship\u0027s loudspeaker came the soft strains of \"The Blue Danube.\" In the distance they saw a falling star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quick! Make a wish,\" Philip said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara closed her eyes and was silent for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you make your wish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you wish for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara looked up at him and said seriously, \"I can\u0027t tell you, or it won\u0027t come true.\" I\u0027m going to make it come true, Lara thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip leaned back and smiled at Lara. \"This is perfect, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can always be this way, Philip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could get married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there it was, out in the open. He had been thinking of nothing else for the past few days. He was deeply in love with Lara, but he knew he could not make a commitment to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara, that\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve explained it to you, darling. I\u0027m almost always on tour like this. You couldn\u0027t travel with me all the time, could you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Lara said, \"but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are. It would never work. Tomorrow in Paris, I\u0027ll show you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to Paris with you, Philip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought he had misunderstood her. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara took a deep breath. \"I\u0027m not going to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like a blow to the stomach. \"Why? I love you, Lara. I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I love you. But I\u0027m not a groupie. I don\u0027t want to be just another one of your fans, chasing you around. You can have all those you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara, I don\u0027t want anyone but you. But don\u0027t you see, darling, our marriage could never work. We have separate lives that are important to both of us. I would want us to be together all the time, and we couldn\u0027t be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it then, isn\u0027t it?\" Lara said tightly. \"I won\u0027t see you again, Philip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. Please! Let\u0027s talk about this. Let\u0027s go to your room, and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Philip. I love you very much, but I won\u0027t go on like this. It\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want it to be over,\" Philip insisted. \"Change your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s all or nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were silent the rest of the way back to their hotel. When they reached the lobby, Philip said, \"Why don\u0027t I come up to your room? We can talk about this and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, my darling. There\u0027s nothing more to talk about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched Lara get into the elevator and disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lara reached her suite, the telephone was ringing. She hurried to pick it up. \"Philip...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Howard. I\u0027ve been trying to reach you all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed to hide her disappointment. \"Is anything wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Just checking in. There\u0027s a lot going on around here. When do you think you\u0027ll be coming back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow,\" Lara said. \"I\u0027ll be back in New York tomorrow.\" Slowly, Lara replaced the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat there, staring at the telephone, willing it to ring. Two hours later, it was still silent. I made a mistake, Lara thought miserably. I gave him an ultimatum, and I lost him. If I had only waited...If only I had gone to Paris with him...if...if... She tried to visualize her life without Philip. It was too painful to think about. But we can\u0027t go on this way, Lara thought. I want us to belong to each other. Tomorrow she would have to return to New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara lay down on the couch, fully dressed, the telephone by her side. She felt drained. She knew it would be impossible to get any sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his room Philip was pacing back and forth like a caged animal. He was furious with Lara, furious with himself. He could not bear the thought of not seeing her again, not holding her in his arms. Damn all women! he thought. His parents had warned him. \"Your life is music. If you want to be the best, there\u0027s no room for anything else.\" And until he met Lara, he had believed it. But now everything had changed. Damn it! What we had was wonderful. Why did she have to destroy it? He loved her, but he knew he could never marry her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was awakened by the ringing of the telephone. She sat up on the couch, groggy, and looked at the clock on the wall. It was five o\u0027clock in the morning. Sleepily, Lara picked up the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Howard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Philip\u0027s voice. \"How would you like to get married in Paris?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-shine-down/page-23.html","bookId":2364,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM"}
