He wasn’t any stronger than Lian Chengji. If the one that Lin Ming had attacked was him and not Lian Chengji a moment ago, there was a very high possibility that he wouldn’t be anything but a cold corpse right now. Xuan Zhan began to feel deep regret.

Before, it had been the Divine Phoenix Island Elders that didn’t have the courage to join the battle. But now, facing Lin Ming who was like a world destroying war god, the South Sea Demon Region Elders were the ones that didn’t dare to fight!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat a joke!

They weren’t individuals from the Lian or Xuan bloodline.

He now only had several dozen more breaths of time of the Heretical God Force left. With the Scarlet Blood Pill burning his blood, he still managed to maintain his rationality.

In particular, the Blood Drinking Seal that was formed from Lian Chengji’s blood essence was a much more vivid and solemn red than the others. The power of these Blood Drinking Seals that were unfettered by the suppressive laws of this world was truly terrifying when their strength was unleashed to the limit!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAn Elder that bore the brunt of Lin Ming’s attack was alarmed.

With the 15 Blood Drinking Seals free from the laws of this broken world, they chaotically spun around.

Even the Ninth Elder who had been severely wounded seemed to recover some of his strength, and the flames on his sword grew ever brighter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for the South Sea Demon Region, because of their abject fear from watching Lin Ming’s fight, their strength had sharply dropped.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn terms of a large scale fight, martial artists were much worse and less organizational than the armies of common mortal men.

Which one of these Demon Region Elders weren’t characters were overwhelming characters with a harem filled with countless beautiful women? How could these characters who held power in the palms of their hands possibly give their life like an ordinary soldier? The only possibility was if it was a huge temptation that could further their cultivation and life.

In truth, he was able to feel that Lin Ming had used some sort of arcane ability in order to stimulate the potential of his body, and this was the reason that his strength had risen so suddenly and so sharply. But this sort of ability should not be able to last much longer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, Xuan Zhan wasn’t willing to gamble on how much longer it could last, and he didn’t know whether or not Lin Ming would be able to use it again.
