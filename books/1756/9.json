It penetrated the inky blackness of the Venusian ocean with smooth ease. They were navigating blind. Not once had the ship\u0027s powerful beams been turned on. Radar, instead, plumbed the abyss ahead more delicately and more informatively than light possibly could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with the radar pulses went the selected microwaves designed to attain maximum reflection from the metal alloy that formed the outer hull of a subship. Their range in the hundreds of miles, the microwaves plunged their probing ringers of energy this direction and that, seeking the particular design of metal that would send them careening back in their tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, no reflecting message had come back, and the 72 Hilda settled down in the ooze, half a mile of water above it, and motionless except for a slow rocking with the mighty sway of Venus\u0027s globe-girdling oceanic currents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first hour Bigman had been scarcely aware of the microwaves and the object of their search. He had been lost in the spectacle to be seen from the portholes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenusian subsea life is phosphorescent, and the black ocean depths were dotted with colored lights thicker than the stars in space, larger, brighter, and most of all, moving. Bigman squashed his nose against the thick glass and stared, fascinated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the life forms were little round splotches, whose movement was a slow ripple. Others were darting lines. Still others were sea ribbons of the type Lucky and Bigman had seen in the Green Room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky joined him after a while. He said, \"If I remember my xenozoology...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the study of extraterrestrial animals, Bigman. I\u0027ve just been looking through a book on Venusian life. I left it on your bunk in case you want to look at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind. I\u0027ll take it second hand from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. We can start with those little objects. I think that represents a school of buttons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buttons?\" said Bigman. Then, \"Sure, I see what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a whole series of yellow ovals of light moving across the black field visible through the porthole. Each had black markings on it in the form of two short parallel lines. They moved in brief spurts, settled down for a few moments, then moved again. The dozens in view all moved and rested simultaneously, so that Bigman had the queerly swimming sensation that the buttons weren\u0027t moving at all, but that every half minute or so the ship itself lurched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"They\u0027re laying eggs, I think.\" He was silent for a long moment, then said, \"Most of these things I can\u0027t make out. Wait! That must be a scarlet patch there. See it? The dark red thing with the irregular outline? It feeds on buttons. Watch it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a scurrying among the yellow blotches of light as they became aware of the swooping predator, but a dozen buttons were blotted out by the angry red of the scarlet patch. Then the patch was the only source of light in the porthole\u0027s field of vision. On all sides of it, buttons had scattered away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The patch is shaped like a large pancake turned down at the edge,\" said Lucky, \"according to the book. It\u0027s hardly anything but skin with a small brain in the center. It\u0027s only an inch thick. You can tear it through and through in a dozen places without bothering it. See how irregular the one we\u0027re watching is? Arrowfish probably chewed it up a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scarlet patch moved now, drifting out of sight. There v/as little left where it had been except for one or two faint, dying glimmers of yellow. Little by little, buttons began moving back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"The scarlet patch just settles down to the bottom, holding on to the ooze with its edges and digesting and absorbing whatever it covers. There\u0027s another species called the orange patch which is a lot more aggressive. It can shoot a jet of water with enough force to stagger a man, even though it\u0027s only a foot wide and not much more than paper thin. The big ones are a lot worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How big do they get?\" asked Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t the slightest idea. The book says there are occasional reports of tremendous monsters-arrowfish a mile long, and patches that can cover Aphrodite City. No authentic cases, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mile long! I\u0027ll bet there aren\u0027t any authentic cases.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s eyebrows lifted. \"It\u0027s not as impossible as all that. These things here are only shallow-water specimens. The Venusian ocean is up to ten miles deep in spots. There\u0027s room in it for a lot of things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman looked at him doubtfully. \"Listen, you\u0027re try- ing to sell me a bale of space dust.\" He turned abruptly and moved away. \"I think I\u0027ll look at the book after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hilda moved on and took a new position, while the microwaves shot out, searching and searching. Then again it moved. And again. Slowly Lucky was screening the underwater plateau on which the city of Aphrodite stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited grimly at the instruments. Somewhere down here his friend Lou Evans must be. Evans\u0027s ship could navigate neither air nor space, nor any ocean depth of more than two miles, so he must be confined to the relatively shallow waters of the Aphrodite plateau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first answering flash caught his eye even as he repeated the must to himself for the second time. The microwave feedback froze the direction finder in place, and the return pip was brightening the entire receiving field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman\u0027s hand was on Lucky\u0027s shoulder instantly. \"That\u0027s it! That\u0027s it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" said Lucky. \"And maybe it\u0027s some other ship, or maybe it\u0027s only a wreck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get its position, Lucky. Sands of Mars, get its position!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing it, boy, and we\u0027re moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman could feel the acceleration, hear the churning of the propeller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky leaned closely over the radio transmitter and its unscrambler, and his voice was urgent. \"Lou! Lou Evans! Lucky Starr at this end! Acknowledge signals! Lou! Lou Evans!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver and over again, the words pushed out along the ether. The returning microwave pip grew brighter as the distance between the two ships grew less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"That ship we\u0027re pipping isn\u0027t moving, Lucky. Maybe it is a wreck. If it were the councilman, he\u0027d either answer or try to get away from us, wouldn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sh!\" said Lucky. His words were quiet and urgent as he spoke into the transmitter: \"Lou! There\u0027s no point in trying to hide. I know the truth. I know why you sent the message to Earth in Morriss\u0027s name asking for your own recall. And I know who you think the enemy is. Lou Evans! Acknowledge...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe receiver crackled, static-ridden. Sounds came through the unscrambler and turned into intelligible words: \"Stay away. If you know that, stay away!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky grinned his relief. Bigman whooped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got him,\" shouted the little Martian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re coming in to get you,\" said Lucky into the transmitter. \"Hold on. We\u0027ll lick it, you and I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords came back slowly, \"You don\u0027t-understand-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- I\u0027m trying to...\" Then, almost in a shriek, \"For\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarth\u0027s sake, Lucky, stay away! Don\u0027t get any closer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more came through. The Hilda bored toward the position of Evans\u0027s ship relentlessly. Lucky leaned back, frowning. He murmured, \"If he\u0027s that afraid, why doesn\u0027t he run?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman didn\u0027t hear. He was saying jubilantly, \"Terrific, Lucky. That was terrific the way you bluffed him into talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t bluffing, Bigman,\" said Lucky, grimly. \"I know the key fact involved in this whole mess. So would you, if you stopped to think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said shakily, \"What are you getting at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember when Dr. Morriss and you and I entered the small room to wait for Lou Evans to be brought to us? Do you remember the first thing that happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You started laughing. You said I looked queer and deformed without a mustache. And I felt exactly the same way about you. I said so. Remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure. I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did it occur to you to wonder why that was? We\u0027d been watching men with mustaches for hours. Why was it that the thought suddenly occurred to both of us at that particular time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Suppose the thought had occurred to someone else who had telepathic powers. Suppose the sensation of surprise flooded from his mind to ours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean the mentalist, or one of them, was in the room with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t that explain it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s impossible. Dr. Morriss was the only other man...Lucky! You don\u0027t mean Dr. Morriss!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morriss had been staring at us for hours. Why should he be suddenly amazed at our not having mustaches?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, was someone hiding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not hiding,\" said Lucky. \"There was one other living creature in the room, and it was in plain view.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" cried Bigman. \"Oh, no.\" He burst into laughter. \"Sands of Mars, you can\u0027t mean the V-frog?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" said Lucky calmly. \"We\u0027re probably the first men without mustaches it ever saw. It was surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it? They\u0027re all over the city. People collect them, feed them, love them. Now do they really love V-frogs? Or do the V-frogs inspire love by mental control so as to get themselves fed and taken care of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Space, Lucky!\" said Bigman. \"There\u0027s nothing surprising about people liking them. They\u0027re cute. People don\u0027t have to be hypnotized into thinking that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you like them spontaneously, Bigman? Nothing made you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure nothing made me like them. I just liked them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just liked them? Two minutes after you saw your first V-frog, you fed it. Remember that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing wrong with that, is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, but what did you feed it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What it liked. Peas dipped in axle g...\" The little\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efellow\u0027s voice faded out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. That grease swelled like axle grease. There was no mistaking what it was. How did you come to dip the pea in it? Do you always feed axle grease to pet animals? Did you ever know any animal that ate axle grease?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sands of Mars!\" said Bigman weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it obvious that the V-frog wanted some, and that since you were handy it maneuvered you into delivering some-that you weren\u0027t quite your own master?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman muttered, \"I never guessed. But it\u0027s so clear when you explain it. I feel terrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a hateful thing, having an animal\u0027s thoughts rolling around inside your head. It seems unsanitary.\" His puckish little face screwed up in an expression of revulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Unfortunately, it\u0027s worse then unsanitary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to the instruments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interval between pip and return disclosed the distance between the two ships to be less than half a mile when, with surprising suddenness, the radar screen showed, unmistakably, the shadow of Evans\u0027s ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s voice went out over the transmitter. \"Evans, you\u0027re in sight now. Can you move? Is your ship disabled?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer came back clearly in a voice torn with emotion. \"Earth help me, Lucky, I did my best to warn you. You\u0027re trapped! Trapped as I\u0027m trapped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as though to punctuate the councilman\u0027s wail, a blast of force struck the subship Hilda, knocking it to one side and jarring its main motors out of commission! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-oceans-of-venus-lucky-starr-3/page-9.html","bookId":1756,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:48 AM"}
