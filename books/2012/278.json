One blazed yellow, the other was quicksilver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorror filled Tanakalian at the moment of recognition. The Wolves of Winter – they are within her. They are there, inside her – those eyes! They stare out at me from the Beast Throne. Fanderay. Togg. Our gods are among us .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll strength left his limbs when those terrible eyes fixed on him and sank into his skull like fangs, forcing him to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once she stood before him. Those fangs dug deeper, tearing into his brain, ripping loose every secret, every hidden hunger. Raping him with cold remorselessness. As if he was carrion. Something washed back, thick as blood, and it was filled with contempt. An instant later and he was dismissed, made irrelevant. Her gaze lifted past him, to the Grey Helms – and he knew that they too knelt, abject, helpless, their courage drained away, their souls made cold with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she spoke in their minds, the voice was a multitude of howls, a sound more terrible than anything they had ever heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ I am the voice of the Wolves of Winter. Listen well to these words. We will not be judged .’ She looked down at Tanakalian. ‘ You would wield my swords, mortal? Are you the one to lay waste to a thousand realms in my name? I think not. Pettiness consumes your thoughts. Vanity commands your every vision .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Look well upon this child. She is Setoc. Destriant. She is our voice. She is our will .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl raised her eyes once more, addressed the entire army. ‘ Your kin kneel before the Forkrul Assail in the palace of Kolanse. The Assail would force the Perish Grey Helms to serve them, and they eagerly await your arrival, and the moment when you, too, must kneel in obeisance .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ This … offends us .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ When Sister Reverence summons Destriant Setoc, when she seeks to wrest this army from us, she shall know the wrath of the Wolves .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the officers suddenly found the courage to call out, ‘Blessed Wolves – do you wish us to destroy the Forkrul Assail? Did the Mortal Sword speak true?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Around us, mortal, there are only enemies. But we are among you now, and in the moment of battle the ghosts shall rise, in numbers beyond counting, and before us every army shall fall. Before us, every city shall burn. Before us, there shall be slaughter to redress the balance .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Think on your faith, my children. Think well on the imbalance of which I speak. The millennia of slaughter at your human hand. We shall give answer. In every realm, we shall give answer! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the power of his gods, Tanakalian bowed his head. To hide his eyes. He was seething, his time of glory ripped away from him, his dreams of power stolen, his ascension left in ruins by this … this girl .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had walked past him now, into the midst of his soldiers. But no, they were no longer his, were they? ‘It will not end this way,’ he whispered. ‘ It will not end this way! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe staggered away, blood pouring from her wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGruntle sought to rise, to lift his huge form one more time, but will was not enough. The pain was fading, a dullness seeping in, and in his bloodied nostrils all he could smell was burned fur, scorched flesh. The time surrounding him now, slowly closing in, seemed a force vast beyond countenance. It felt thick, unyielding, and yet he could see its expanse, the way it stretched behind him – but not ahead. No, there, almost within reach, it vanished into dark mists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he could, he would have laughed. The irony of life’s end was found in all the truths suddenly discovered, when it was too late to do a damned thing about them. It was said that in the moments before death, there arrived an acceptance, a willingness to see it come to an end, and an indifference to the anguish and grief of the living. If I have let go, why can’t you? It’s these truths, you see, and my helplessness in answering them. I would laugh, but in laughter there is pain. I would bless, but in blessing there is loss. This is not how anyone wants it. But then, it never is .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t you see that, Stonny? In all your fraught moments – and isn’t every moment fraught? – in all of them, you miss the chance of peace. The calm of all these truths, the ones us dying discover, and even then we can say nothing. Offer nothing .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time. It’s all past. No. It’s my past. And with it, I can do nothing .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had fought with terrible savagery. For how long he could not guess. Two indomitable beasts spilling out their hot, steaming blood, lashing out in rage, staggering in pain. Claws tearing, slashing deep. Fangs punching through hide and thick muscle. The stone floor of the chamber had grown slick, the air hot and fetid. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-278.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
