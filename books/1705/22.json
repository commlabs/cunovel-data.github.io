He\u0027d figured it out later as one in fourteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that,\" he replied on the screen. \"There are two and a half million people with cerebral palsy. There are two million with convulsive disorders, including epilepsy. There are six million with mental retardation. There are probably two and a half million with hyperkinetic behavior disorders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And all of these people are violent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, certainly not. But an unusually high proportion of violent people, if you check them, have brain damage. Physical brain damage. Now, that shoots down a lot of theories about poverty and discrimination and social injustice and social disorganization. Those factors contribute to violence, of course. But physical brain damage is also a major factor. And you can\u0027t correct physical brain damage with social remedies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause in the reporters\u0027 questions. Ellis remembered the pause, and remembered being elated by it. He was winning; he was running the show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you say violence- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean,\" Ellis said, \"attacks of unprovoked violence initiated by single individuals. It\u0027s the biggest problem in the world today, violence. And it\u0027s a huge problem in this country. In 1969, more Americans were killed or attacked in this country than have been killed or wounded in all the years of the Vietnam war. Specifically- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporters were in awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"- we had 14,500 murders, 36,500 rapes, and 306,500 cases of aggravated assault. All together a third of a million cases of violence. That doesn\u0027t include automobile deaths, and a lot of violence is carried out with cars. We had 56,000 deaths in autos, and three million injuries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always were good with figures,\" Gerhard droned, watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s working, isn\u0027t it?\" Ellis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Flashy.\" Gerhard sighed. \"But you have a squinty, untrustworthy look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my normal look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerhard laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the screen, a reporter was saying, \"And you think these figures reflect physical brain disease?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In large part,\" Ellis said. \"In large part. One of the clues pointing to physical brain disease in a single individual is a history of repeated violence. There are some famous examples. Charles Whitman, who killed seventeen people in Texas, had a malignant brain tumor and told his psychiatrist for weeks before that he was having thoughts about climbing the tower and shooting people. Richard Speck engaged in several episodes of brutal violence before he killed eight nurses. Lee Harvey Oswald repeatedly attacked people, including his wife on many occasions. Those were famous cases. There are a third of a million cases every year that are not famous. We\u0027re trying to correct that violent behavior with surgery. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a despicable thing. I think it\u0027s a noble goal and an important goal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But isn\u0027t that mind control?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllis said, \"What do you call compulsory education through high school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Education,\" the reporter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that ended the interview. Ellis got up angrily. \"That makes me look like a fool,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it doesn\u0027t,\" Anders, the cop, said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday, March 13, 1971: Termination\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was being pounded, beaten senseless by brutal, jarring blows. She rolled away and moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Gerhard said, shaking her. \"Wake up, Jan.\" She opened her eyes. The room was dark. Someone was leaning over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, come on, wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe yawned. The movement sent streaks of pain down through her neck. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Telephone for you. It\u0027s Benson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat jolted her awake faster than she would have thought possible. Gerhard helped her sit up, and she shook her head to clear it. Her neck was a column of pain, and the rest of her body was stiff and aching, but she ignored that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Telecomp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went outside into the hallway, blinking in the bright light. The cops were still there, but they were tired now, eyes dulled, jaws slack. She followed Gerhard into Telecomp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichards held out the phone to her, saying, \"Here she is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the receiver. \"Hello? Harry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the room, Anders was listening on an extension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t feel good,\" Harry Benson said. \"I want it to stop, Dr. Ross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, Harry?\" She could hear the fatigue in his voice, the slow and slightly childlike quality. What would one of those rats say after twenty-four hours of stimulation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things aren\u0027t working very well. I\u0027m tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can help you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the feelings,\" Benson said. \"They\u0027re making me tired now. That\u0027s all. Just tired. I want them to stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to let us help you, Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to trust us, Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause. Anders looked across the room at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss. She shrugged. \"Harry?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you never did this to me,\" Benson said. Anders checked his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can fix it for you, Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to fix it myself,\" he said. His voice was very childlike, almost petulant. \"I wanted to pull out the wires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss frowned. \"Did you try?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I tried to pull off the bandages, but it hurt too much. I don\u0027t like it when it hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was really being quite childlike. She wondered if the regression was a specific phenomenon, or the result of fear and fatigue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t pull- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I have to do something,\" Benson said. \"I have to stop this feeling. I\u0027m going to fix the computer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, you can\u0027t do that. We have to do that for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I m going to fix it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry,\" she said, in a low, soothing, maternal voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, please trust us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no reply. Breathing on the other end of the line. She looked around the room at the tense, expectant faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, please trust us. Just this once. Then everything will be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police are looking for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are no police here,\" she said. \"They\u0027ve all gone. You can come here. Everything will be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lied to me before,\" he said. His voice was petulant again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Harry, it was all a mistake. If you come here now, everything will be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a very long silence, and then a sigh. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Benson said. \"I know how it\u0027s going to end. I have to fix the computer myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a click, and then the buzz of a disconnection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss hung up. Anders immediately dialed the phone company and asked whether they had been able to trace the call. So that was why he had been looking at his watch, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell,\" Anders said, and slammed the phone down. \"They couldn\u0027t get a trace. They couldn\u0027t even find the incoming call. Idiots.\" He sat down across the room from Ross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was just like a child,\" she said, shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he mean about fixing the computer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose he meant tearing out the wires from his shoulder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he said he tried that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he did, maybe he didn\u0027t,\" she said. \"He\u0027s confused now, under the influence of all the stimulations and all the seizures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it physically possible to pull out the wires, and the computer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"At least, animals do it. Monkeys...\" She rubbed her eyes. \"Is there any coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerhard poured her a cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor Harry,\" she said. \"He must be terrified out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the room, Anders said, \"How confused do you suppose he is, really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very.\" She sipped the coffee. \"Is there any sugar left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Confused enough to mix up computers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re out of sugar,\" Gerhard said. \"Ran out a couple of hours ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had wiring plans for the hospital,\" Anders said. \"The main computer, the computer that assisted in his operation, is in the hospital basement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set down her coffee cup and stared at him. She frowned, rubbed her eyes again, picked the coffee up, then set it down once more. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pathologists called while you were asleep,\" Anders said. \"They determined that Benson stabbed the dancer with a screwdriver. He attacked the mechanic, and he attacked Morris. Machines and people connected with machines. Morris was connected with his own mechanization.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled slightly. \"I\u0027m the psychiatrist around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just asking. Is it possible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, of course it\u0027s possible...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone rang again. Ross answered it. \"NPS.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pacific Telephone liaison here,\" a male voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve rechecked that trace for Captain Anders. Is he there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute.\" She nodded to Anders, who picked up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anders speaking.\" There was a long pause. Then he said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you repeat that?\" He nodded as he listened. \"And what was the time period you checked? I see. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up, and immediately began dialing again. \"You better tell me about that atomic power pack,\" he said as he dialed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know what happens if it\u0027s ruptured,\" Anders said, then turned away as his call was put through. \"Bomb squad. This is Anders, homicide.\" He turned back to Ross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss said, \"He\u0027s carrying around thirty-seven grams of radioactive plutonium, Pu-239. If it breaks open, you\u0027ll expose everyone in the area to serious radiation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What particles are emitted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been to college,\" he said, \"and I can even read and write, when I have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alpha particles,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnders spoke into the phone. \"Anders, homicide,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want a van at University Hospital right away. We\u0027ve got a possible radiation hazard pending. Man and immediate environment may be contaminated with an alpha emitter, Pu-239.\" He listened, then looked at Ross. \"Any possibility of explosion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No explosive,\" Anders said. He listened. \"All right. I understand. Get them here as quickly as you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up. Ross said, \"Do you mind telling me what\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The phone company rechecked that trace,\" Anders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve determined that there were no calls into the hospital from the outside at the time Benson called. None at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Anders said. \"He must have called from somewhere inside the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss stared out the fourth-floor window at the parking lot, and watched as Anders gave instructions to at least twenty cops. Half of them went into the main hospital building; the rest remained outside, in little groups, talking together quietly, smoking. Then a white bomb-squad van rumbled up, and three men in gray metallic-looking suits lumbered out. Anders talked to them briefly, then nodded and stayed with the van, unpacking some very peculiar equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnders walked back toward the NPS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlongside her, Gerhard watched the preparations. \"Benson won\u0027t make it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she said. \"I keep wondering if there is any way to disarm him, or immobilize him. Could we make a portable microwave transmitter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought of that,\" Gerhard said. \"But it\u0027s unsafe. You can\u0027t really predict the effect on Benson\u0027s equipment. And you know it\u0027ll raise hell with all the cardiac pacemakers in other patients in the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t there anything we can do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerhard shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There must be something,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued to shake his head. \"Besides,\" he said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"pretty soon the incorporated environment takes over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Theoretically.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerhard shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incorporated environment was one of the notions from the Development group of the NPS. It was a simple idea with profound implications. It began with something that everybody knew: that the brain was affected by the environment. The environment produced experiences that became memories, attitudes, and habits - things that got translated into neural pathways among brain cells. And these pathways were fixed in some chemical or electrical fashion. Just as a common laborer\u0027s body altered according to the work he did, so a person\u0027s brain altered according to past experience. But the change, like the calluses on a worker\u0027s body, persisted after the experience ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that sense, the brain incorporated past environments. Our brains were the sum total of past experiences - long after the experiences themselves were gone. That meant that cause and cure weren\u0027t the same thing. The cause of behavior disorders might lie in childhood experiences, but you couldn\u0027t cure the disorder by eliminating the cause, because the cause had disappeared by adulthood. The cure had to come from some other direction. As the Development people said, \"A match may start a fire, but once the fire is burning, putting out the match won\u0027t stop it. The problem is no longer the match. It\u0027s the fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Benson, he had had more than twenty-four hours of intense stimulation by his implanted computer. That stimulation had affected his brain by providing new experiences and new expectations. A new environment was being incorporated. Pretty soon, it would be impossible to predict how the brain would react. Because it wasn\u0027t Benson\u0027s old brain any more - it was a new brain, the product of new experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnders came into the room. \"We\u0027re ready,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got two men for every basement access, two for the front door, two for the emergency ward, and two for each of the three elevators. I\u0027ve kept men away from the patient-care floors.
