Answering one half reverse,\" Fred said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship slowly angled toward the center of the large asteroid and backed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cortana?\" the Admiral asked. \"Do we have a weapons turret or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" Cortana said, \"but the turret\u0027s magnetic coils that shape and aim the plasma charge have overloaded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral inhaled and sighed explosively. \"Master Chief, you got anything on Weapons Station One?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Archer missile pods depleted,\" the Master Chief answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scanned the display, hoping he had missed something. \"No rounds for the MAC gun. All Shiva nuclear missiles fired as well, sir. The only things left in the tubes are three Clarion spy drones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No plasma and no missiles,\" Admiral Whitcomb said. \"We might as well open an air lock and throw rocks at \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrow rocks? The Master Chief wondered if they could fash- ion a slug to shoot from the MAC cannon. Let its magnetic coils propel the mass to supersonic velocities and— Magnetic coils?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir,\" the Master Chief said. \"We may have a way to fire the plasma turret after all. The Gettysburg\u0027s MAC gun has seventeen superconducting coils. Cortana might be able to use them to shape and aim the plasma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" the Admiral said, nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Cortana amended and stared off into space, think- ing. \"Calculating field strength drop-off now.\" The mathematic symbols scrolling across her body increased threefold. She frowned. \"This would be easier if the Gettysburg was oriented bottom to Ascendant Justice\u0027s top. I\u0027ll have to guess at the interference from the intervening hulls, but it still might work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief—power it up. I\u0027ll need to recalibrate the pulse generation to match the plasma output.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MAC gun magnetic fields coming online,\" the Master Chief said as he tapped in commands. \"Rerouting power from Ascen- dant Justice\u0027s reactor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won\u0027t have enough power to move fast if we have to,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred remarked, watching the energy fed to the Gettysburg\u0027s engines drop to nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay.\" The Admiral absentmindedly tugged at the end ERIC NYLUNO 265 of his mustache. \"We wouldn\u0027t be able to outrun that Covenant cruiser even if we had full power. Our only chance is to take them out before they take us out. Launch those Clarion spy drones, Chief. Target the region abeam that planetoid—so we can see around the corner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief kept one eye on the fluctuating magnetic field strengths of the superconducting coils as he programmed a course for the spy drones. Set to either side of the large asteroid, they\u0027d effectively give them another set of eyes to see past the obstructing rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drones away,\" the Chief said and launched them; their feathery propellant trails vanished into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cortana,\" Admiral Whitcomb said, \"slave your targeting system to the feed from those drones. I want a clean shot fired before the cruiser crosses that rock\u0027s shadow and shoots at us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Working,\" she replied. \"Getting magnetic field variations from the Ascendant Justice-to-Gettysburg energy transfer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drones in position and images online,\" the Master Chief said and pushed the video feed to the forward screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoubled images of the Covenant cruiser appeared. Along its three bulbous sections, lateral plasma conduits glowed and every turret bristled with energy, ready to fire. Their laser batteries obliterated the large asteroids in their path, while the smaller ones simply bounced off their shields. The warship accelerated as it entered the gravitational influence of the planetoid between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going to slingshot around,\" the Admiral said. \"Cortana, give me your best targeting solution and fire at will!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCortana narrowed her eyes and calculations flashed across her body. \"Extrapolating their course and speed,\" she breathed. \"I got them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Weapons Station One the Master Chief saw the accelera- tion coils of the Gettysburg\u0027s MAC pulse—then redline with power. Magnetic field lines ballooned, overlapped, and distorted asymmetrically. Static washed across his MJOLNIR armor\u0027s shields, and every electrically conducting surface on the bridge sparked as the magnetic lines of force penetrated through the ship and toward the turret on Ascendant Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir only working turret heated, and plasma gathered at its tip; streamers looped upon themselves like tiny solar flares, vi- brated, intensified to orange and then blue-white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost there,\" Cortana cried. \"Hang on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ball of squeezed plasma imploded. It instantly boiled away a thirty-meter section of armor and hull from Ascendant Justice; the plasma vanished for a split second—then a bolt of coiled energy corkscrewed toward the edge of the planetoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant cruiser rounded the planetoid, targeted the Get- tysburg, and fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCortana\u0027s single shot impacted on the nose of the enemy craft first. The cruiser\u0027s shield flashed solid silver for a moment and was gone. The supercompressed plasma tore into the hull of the warship—exploding the metal where it touched. The plasma forked and detonated outward as it chained through the vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondary explosions rippled through the alien ship\u0027s hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdges of its shattered hull glowed red and then white hot as their superheated atmosphere vented. The bolt ripped through the engineering compartment, shattered their reactors—and the entire warship blossomed into fire and ejected trails of golden sparks and dying flickers of static electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe five plasma bolts that the Covenant cruiser fired at the Gettysburg dispersed into a red haze. There was no longer any magnetic force to shape and guide them to their intended target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge crew watched the explosions fade from the for- ward screens. The Admiral said, \"Status?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred tapped the screen of the Engineering station and re- ported: \"Engines and reactor offline. That magnetic pulse did something to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStatic washed over Weapons Station One as the Master Chief looked up and said, \"MAC accelerating coils intact. Drone one destroyed. Retrieving drone two, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCortana\u0027s holographic presence was missing, but her voice sounded triumphantly through the bridge speakers: \"Turret number three destroyed. But if we ever get any of the other six turrets in working order, we\u0027ll have a formidable arsenal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We may not get that chance,\" Lieutenant Haverson remarked as he bent over the NAV station. \"Contacts inbound. Small ships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDozens of them. Transferring to the forward screens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmored Pelicans, exoskeleton welders, a handful of Long- sword singleships, and the odd stealth Chirvptera-class vessel appeared on screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jiles\u0027s fleet,\" Haverson stated. \"And he has us exactly where he wants us—dead in the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Incoming transmission,\" Cortana said. \"Piping it through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Admiral Whitcomb?\" Jiles\u0027s rich and resonant voice flooded the bridge. \"Can I be of some assistance? A tow, perhaps, back to our base so we can expedite repairs to your ships?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be most kind of you,\" the Admiral said and eased back into the Captain\u0027s chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo Laden-class cargo ships came alongside the Gettysburg and attached; their engines rumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" Haverson whispered. \"He had us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he didn\u0027t,\" Admiral Whitcomb replied. He scowled and added, \"Governor Jiles may not like it, but he needs us now. The Covenant aren\u0027t going to send just one ship. After this one goes missing for a while, there\u0027ll be more. A lot more. This is only the start of the battle, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn and his six remaining teammates sat in the Gettysburg\u0027s machine shop. The room was large enough to fit a Longsword in- side, and the walls, ceilings, and deck had robotic arms tipped with welders, multitools, and hydraulic presses. Three of the arms had high-intensity spotlights directed onto the walls and provided a clear, cool, indirect illumination that the Master Chief found soothing after having one too many plasma blasts etch his retinas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were here because Admiral Whitcomb had ordered the Spartans to repair their equipment and get at least six hours of sleep. The machine shop was a solid room, reinforced, and un- likely to breach in case they were attacked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda sat in the corner with her helmet, back torso, and shoul- der MJOLNIR armor sections removed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred and Will used two robotic arms to hold her armor in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey swapped out damaged plates and components with the spare parts they\u0027d found in ONI\u0027s CASTLE facility on Reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngry red scars crisscrossed Linda\u0027s pale body—the only external trace of her double transplant operation. Against Dr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalsey\u0027s advice for strict bed rest, Linda had hobbled down here with her team. She sat cross-legged before a disassembled SRS99C sniper rifle and selected gyro compensators, optics, and adaptive texture barrel sheaths. Linda proceeded to re- assemble the precision-made weapon with the care of a loving mother caressing her newborn child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout looking up from her rifle she said, \"Now I know what you have to do to get a couple of days\u0027 R-and-R in this outfit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard,\" Fred remarked, \"that you spent the whole time sleeping, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why she likes to snipe,\" Will replied. \"I caught her snoring last time she posted in that tower on Europa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn was glad they could joke about her return from the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t bring himself to join in, though. He had accepted the mantle of command, and CPO Mendez had taught him to re- press his external emotional reactions to preserve his authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, he resented that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly rolled over and woke up. She nudged Grace, and they sat up, shaking their helmets. \"0400,\" Kelly told them. \"That was six hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felt like a fifteen-minute nap,\" Grace muttered. \"I just closed my eyes. You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly looked over to Linda and drew her two fingers across her helmet in the smile gesture. Linda returned a rare, bare smile to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile looked odd to John. He wanted to smile, too, but nothing much—apart from Linda—in a long time had given him cause: not the hordes of rebels crawling over and through the Gettysburg whom Admiral Whitcomb trusted too much, nor the imminent return of Covenant forces before their engines and weapons could be repaired. .. and certainly not the hundreds of dead crew members aboard the Gettysburg, whom they had col- lected and placed in cargo bay seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slight click of metal on metal alerted every Spartan in the room. Pistols drew in a blur of motion and rifles leveled at the side hatch as it eased open with a squeak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Johnson and Corporal Locklear stood in the doorway— frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one told me this was target practice,\" Locklear muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Else I woulda painted a bull\u0027s-eye on my chest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Master Chief,\" the Sergeant said. \"Reporting as you requested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded and lowered his gun, as did the other Spartans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in, Marines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he holstered his weapon, John\u0027s hand brushed against the belt compartment that held Dr. Halsey\u0027s data crystals. He hadn\u0027t decided which to give to Lieutenant Haverson. Did he sacrifice the Sergeant to save billions from potential Flood infestation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid it even matter? He had every reason to believe that the Flood had been destroyed with Halo—but what if he was wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted you both down here to help us discuss our tactical options,\" John told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe COM pulsed to life. Dr. Halsey said, \"Master Chief?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need Kelly to report to Medical Four,\" she said. \"She requires one last injection of dermacortic steroids. And I could use her assistance on another matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded to Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slowly stretched, stood, sighed, and marched out of the room. \"I\u0027ll be right back,\" she said, flexing her burned hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t plan the overthrow of the Covenant Empire without me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s on her way, Doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe COM snapped off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief turned to his Spartans and the Marines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go over what we know and see if we\u0027ve missed anything— any way to exploit the enemy\u0027s plan.\" He set down a data pad with a star map glittering upon its surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Covenant are on their way to Earth,\" he told them. \"They are gathering at a battle station and then jumping en masse to the Sol system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens then?\" Fred asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assuming we get to Earth first,\" Linda answered, \"our Fleet will be waiting for them, and\"—she pulled back the bolt on her rifle with a clack—\"they\u0027ll give them a warm reception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what chance will our forces have?\" Will asked. There was no fear in his voice, just cool logic. \"You saw Cortana\u0027s report. There will be hundreds of Covenant warships. I don\u0027t think our Fleet or even Earth\u0027s orbital MAC platforms can repel a force that powerful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" the Chief quietly said. \"They can\u0027t win. They\u0027ll try. But the Covenant will eventually take down one of the orbital MACs, slip through, and pick off the ground-based generators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like on Reach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred visibly flinched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocklear twisted the red bandanna he had tied on his biceps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we get to watch another fight in space?\" he hissed. His fists trembled with barely checked rage. \"There has to be a way to get to those bastards first—on the ground where we can win. Hell, I\u0027d even take my chances in hand-to-hand combat.
