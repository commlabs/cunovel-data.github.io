Did he have to try Reinforcing bone equipment with other bone equipment, or should he try to reinforce his own bones? It was still a problem that he needed to solve.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He couldn\u0027t say which exactly was more effective yet. From now on, this was a problem he\u0027d have to look into, possibly for quite a long time.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But right now, the only thing he was sure about was that he still needed the assistance of powerful equipment.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Strength has increased by 11, Agility by 9, Health by 13, and Magic by 12.

All the potential strength within the equipment was extracted and as a result, his stats were reinforced beyond his wildest imagination; in the process of leveling up, his bones thickened once again and became even more durable.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His height increased considerably and became close to 1 meter and 90 cm. His bones were even more saturated with darkness and anyone that saw him would say that his bones were black. And once the acquired memories and experiences were collected and organized, they bore fruit.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Low Rank Sprint has changed into the Combat Sprint skill.

It had changed in a way that better suited him, so it couldn\u0027t get any better than this.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n More importantly, contrary to Regeneration, he hadn\u0027t been saved from receiving the Self-Destruct skill... Lee Shin Woo decided to think about this later. After all, there was something much more important that he had to do right now. A change much greater than any skill... a level up.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [You have become level 3.

He felt that his strength and his magic were much stronger, to the extent that they were incomparable to before. If it was with his current strength, he felt as though he could face the Great Slime head on.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0027However, my bones have turned black, so will I be able to properly fool the skeletons...?\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lee Shin Woo had a concern that truly befitted a hero, and smiled gently. He could actually feel just how much more powerful his body had become, so he was able to cleanly sweep away his uneasiness and concern over the future.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hoo... then.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had something he needed to check first.
