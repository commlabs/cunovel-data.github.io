And it wasn\u0027t just me. Svetlana would die too. She\u0027d get embroiled in a hopeless attempt to save her boss. The entire structure of the Moscow Watch would collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I didn\u0027t get the one thing right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went on standing there for a while, with my hand against the dirty brick wall. Digging through my memory, chewing things over, trying to find an answer. There wasn\u0027t one. That meant it was destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked across the quiet little courtyard to the \u0027box on stilts\u0027. The Soviet skyscraper made me feel strangely despondent. There was no obvious reason, but the feeling was undeniable. I\u0027d felt the same thing before, in a train passing abandoned villages and crumbling grain silos. The sense of wasted effort. A punch thrown too hard, connecting with nothing but the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Zabulon,\u0027 I said, \u0027if you can hear me . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll was calm. The usual calm of a late evening in Moscow – car engines roaring, music playing somewhere behind the windows, empty streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s no way you can have covered every single possibility,\u0027 I said, speaking to the empty air. \u0027Just no way. There are always forks in the road in reality. The future isn\u0027t determined. You know that. And so do I.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set out across the road without looking right or left, ignoring the traffic. I was on a mission, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sphere of exclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA trolleybus screeched to a halt on the rails. Cars braked and skidded round an empty space with me at its centre. Nothing else existed for me now, only that building where we\u0027d done battle on the roof three months before, in the darkness, those bright flashes of an energy that human eyes couldn\u0027t see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that power, visible to so few, was increasing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was right, this was the eye of the hurricane. This was where they\u0027d been leading me all this time. Great. Now I\u0027d arrived. So you didn\u0027t forget that shabby little defeat after all, Zabulon? You haven\u0027t forgotten the way you were sent down in front of your underlings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from all his exalted goals – and I understood that for him they were exalted – the Dark Magician harboured another burning desire. Once it had been a simple human weakness but now it had been increased immeasurably by the Twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desire for revenge. To get even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo play the battle out all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll you Great Magicians share this, Light and Dark – this boredom with ordinary battle, this desire to win elegantly. To humiliate your opponent. You\u0027re weary of simple victories, you\u0027ve had plenty of those already. The great confrontation has developed into an endless game of chess. Gesar, the great Light Magician, was playing it when he assumed another\u0027s appearance and took such delight in taunting Zabulon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for me the confrontation still hadn\u0027t turned into a game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe that was exactly where my chance lay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the pistol from its holster and clicked the safety catch off. I took a deep, deep breath as if I was about to dive into water. It was time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaxim could sense that this time it would all be over quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t spend all night lying in wait. He wouldn\u0027t spend hours tracking down his prey. This time the flash of inspiration had been too bright. More than just a sense of an alien, hostile presence – a clear direction to his target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove as far as the intersection of Galushkin Street and Yaroslavskaya Street and parked in the courtyard of a high-rise. He watched the black flame glimmering as it slowly moved about inside the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark Magician was in there. Maxim could already feel him as a real person, he could almost see him. A man. His powers were weak. Not a werewolf or a vampire or an incubus. A straightforward Dark Magician. The level of his powers was so low, he wouldn\u0027t cause any problems. The problem was something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaxim could only hope and pray that this wouldn\u0027t keep happening so often. The strain of killing the creatures of the Dark day after day wasn\u0027t just physical. There was also that terrible moment when the dagger pierced his enemy\u0027s heart. The moment when everything started to shudder and sway, when colours and sounds faded away and everything started moving slowly. What would he do if he ever made a mistake? If he killed someone who wasn\u0027t an enemy of the human race, but just an ordinary person?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was nothing he could do, since he was the only one in the entire world who could tell the Dark Ones from ordinary people. Since he was the only one who\u0027d been given a weapon – by God, by destiny, by chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaxim took out his wooden dagger and looked at the toy with a heavy heart, feeling slightly confused. He wasn\u0027t the one who\u0027d whittled this dagger, he wasn\u0027t the one who\u0027d given it the high-flown name of a \u0027misericord\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were only twelve at the time, he and Petka, his best friend, in fact his only childhood friend and – why not admit it? – the only friend he\u0027d ever had. They used to play at knights in battle – not for very long, mind you, they had plenty of other ways to amuse themselves when they were kids, even without all these computer games. All the kids on the block had played the game for just one short summer, whittling swords and daggers, pretending to stab at each other with all their strength, but really being careful. They had enough sense to realise that even a wooden sword could take someone\u0027s eye out or draw blood. It was strange how he and Petka had always ended up on opposite sides. Maybe that was because Petka was a bit younger and Maxim felt slightly embarrassed about having him as a friend, the adoring way he gazed at Maxim and trailed around after him as if he was in love. It was just an ordinary moment in one of their battles when Maxim knocked Petka\u0027s wooden sword out of his hands – his friend had hardly even tried to resist – and cried: \u0027You\u0027re my prisoner!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then something odd had happened. Petka had handed him this dagger and said that the valiant knight had to take his life with it rather than humiliate him by taking him prisoner. It was a game, of course, only a game, but Maxim had shuddered inside when he pretended to strike with the wooden dagger. And there had been one brief, agonising moment when Petka had looked at Maxim\u0027s hand holding the dagger just short of his grubby white t-shirt and then glanced into Maxim\u0027s eyes. And then he\u0027d blurted out: \u0027Keep it, you can have it as a trophy.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaxim had been happy to accept the wooden dagger. But for some reason he\u0027d never used it in the game again. He\u0027d kept it at home and tried to forget about it, as if he felt ashamed of the unexpected gift and his own sentimentality. But he\u0027d never forgotten it. Even when he grew up and got married and his own first child was growing up, he\u0027d never forgotten it. The toy weapon always lay in the drawer with the photo albums of the children, the envelopes with locks of hair and all that sentimental nonsense. Until the day Maxim first felt the presence of the Dark in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if the wooden dagger had summoned him. And it had proved to be a genuine weapon, pitiless, merciless, invincible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Petka was gone now. They\u0027d grown apart when they were still young: a year is a big age difference for children, but for teenagers it\u0027s a huge gulf. And then life had separated them. They\u0027d still smiled at each other whenever they met and shaken hands, had even enjoyed a drink together a few times and reminisced about their childhoods. Then Maxim had got married and moved away and they\u0027d almost completely lost contact. But this winter he\u0027d had news of Petka, purely by chance, from his mother – he phoned her regularly, just like a good son should. \u0027Do you remember Petka? You were such good friends when you were children, quite inseparable.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d remembered. And he\u0027d realised immediately where this was leading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaxim\u0027s mother told him that he\u0027d fallen to his death from the roof of some high-rise, though God only knew what he\u0027d been doing up there in the middle of the night. Maybe he\u0027d committed suicide, or maybe he\u0027d been drunk – but the doctors had said he was sober. Or maybe he\u0027d been murdered. He had a job in some commercial organisation that paid well, he used to help his parents and drive around in a good car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He was probably high on drugs,\u0027 Maxim had said sternly. So sternly his mother hadn\u0027t even tried to argue. \u0027I suppose so, he always was strange.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart hadn\u0027t contracted in sudden pain. But for some reason that evening he\u0027d got drunk and killed a woman he\u0027d been trying to track down for two weeks, a woman whose Dark power forced men to leave the women they loved and go back to their wives, an old witch who forced people together and forced them apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetka was gone. The boy he\u0027d been friends with had already been gone for many years, and now Pyotr Nesterov, the man he\u0027d seen once a year or even less often, had been gone for three months. But Maxim still had the dagger Petka had given him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must have been some special reason for it, that awkward childhood friendship of theirs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaxim toyed with the wooden dagger, rolling it from one hand to the other. Why was he so alone? Why didn\u0027t he have a friend beside him to lift at least part of the burden from his shoulders? There was so much Dark all around, and so little Light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason Maxim recalled the last thing Elena had shouted at him as he was leaving: \u0027I wish you\u0027d love us, not just take care of us.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut isn\u0027t that the same thing? thought Maxim, mentally parrying the thrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it probably wasn\u0027t. But what was a man to do when his love was a battle fought against Evil, rather than for Good?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst the Dark, not for the Light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot for the Light but against the Dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m the guardian,\u0027 Maxim said to himself in a low voice, as if he was too fearful to say it out loud. Only schizos talked to themselves. And he wasn\u0027t a schizo, he was normal. He was better than normal, he could see the ancient Evil creeping and crawling into the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut was it creeping in, or had it already made its home here a long, long time ago?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, this was madness. He mustn\u0027t, he absolutely mustn\u0027t allow himself to doubt. If he lost even a part of his faith, allowed himself to relax or start searching for non-existent allies, then he was finished. The wooden dagger would no longer be a luminous blade driving out the Dark. The next magician would reduce it to ashes with magic fire, a witch would cast a spell on it, a werewolf would tear it to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guardian and the judge!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mustn\u0027t hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patch of Dark moving about on the ninth floor suddenly started moving downward. His heart started beating faster: the Dark Magician was coming, to keep his appointment with destiny. Maxim climbed out of the car and glanced rapidly around him. As usual, some secret thing inside him had driven everyone away from the scene and cleared the battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it a battlefield? Or a scaffold?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuardian and judge?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr executioner?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat difference did it make?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe familiar power flooded into his body. Holding his hand inside his jacket, Maxim walked towards the building\u0027s entrance, towards the Dark Magician who was coming down in the lift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly, it had to be done quickly. It still wasn\u0027t quite night yet. Someone might see. And no one would ever believe him, the best he could hope for would be the madhouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall out. Give his name. Take out his weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMisericord. Mercy. He was the guardian and the judge. The warrior against evil. And not an executioner!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis courtyard was a battlefield, not a scaffold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaxim stopped outside the entrance to the building. He heard footsteps. The lock clicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt so wronged, he could have howled in horror and screamed curses at the heavens for his destiny and his gift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark Magician was a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA skinny, dark-haired little boy who looked quite ordinary – except for the quivering halo of Dark that only Maxim could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why? Nothing like this had ever happened to him before. Maxim had killed women and men, young and old, but he\u0027d never come across any children who\u0027d sold their souls to the Dark. He\u0027d never even thought about it, maybe because he hadn\u0027t wanted to accept that it was possible, or maybe because he\u0027d been avoiding making any decisions in advance. He might have stayed at home if he\u0027d known his next victim would be only twelve years old. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-48.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
