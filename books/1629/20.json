Philosophy,” said Om.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha peered cautiously round the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the room two groups of very nearly identical men in togas were trying to hold back two of their colleagues. It is a scene repeated a million times a day in bars around the multiverse-both would-be fighters growled and grimaced at one another and fought to escape the restraint of their friends, only of course they did not fight too hard, because there is nothing worse than actually succeeding in breaking free and suddenly finding yourself all alone in the middle of the ring with a madman who is about to hit you between the eyes with a rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep,” said Om, “that\u0027s philosophy, right enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But they\u0027re fighting!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A full and free exchange of opinions, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that Brutha could get a clearer view, he could see that there were one or two differences between the men. One had a shorter beard, and was very red in the face, and was waggling a finger accusingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He bloody well accused me of slander!” he was shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn\u0027t!” shouted the other man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did! You did! Tell \u0027em what you said!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, I merely suggested, to indicate the nature of paradox, right, that if Xeno the Ephebian said, `All Ephebians are liars-\u0027 ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See? See? He did it again!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-no, no, listen, listen . . . then, since Xeno is himself an Ephebian, this would mean that he himself is a liar and therefore-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXeno made a determined effort to break free, dragging four desperate fellow philosophers across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m going to lay one right on you, pal!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha said, “Excuse me, please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe philosophers froze. Then they turned to look at Brutha. They relaxed by degrees. There was a chorus of embarrassed coughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you all philosophers?” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one called Xeno stepped forward, adjusting the hang of his toga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s right,” he said. “We\u0027re philosophers. We think, therefore we am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are,” said the luckless paradox manufacturer automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXeno spun around. “I\u0027ve just about had it up to here with you, Ibid!” he roared. He turned back to Brutha. “We are, therefore we am,” he said confidently. “That\u0027s it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral of the philosophers looked at one another with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s actually quite interesting,” one said. “The evidence of our existence is the fact of our existence, is that what you\u0027re saying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” said Xeno, without looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you been fighting?” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assembled philosophers assumed various expressions of shock and horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fighting? Us? We\u0027re philosophers,” said Ibid, shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My word, yes,” said Xeno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you were- Brutha began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXeno waved a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The cut and thrust of debate,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thesis plus antithesis equals hysteresis,” said Ibid. \"The stringent testing of the universe. The hammer of the intellect upon the anvil of fundamental truth-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” said Xeno. “And what can we do for you, young man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ask them about gods,” Om prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, I want to find out about gods,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe philosophers looked at one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gods?” said Xeno. “We don\u0027t bother with gods. Huh. Relics of an outmoded belief system, gods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a rumble of thunder from the clear evening sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Except for Blind to the Thunder God,” Xeno went on, his tone hardly changing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning flashed across the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Cubal the Fire God,” said Xeno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gust of wind rattled the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Flatulus the God of the Winds, he\u0027s all right too,” said Xeno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arrow materialized out of the air and hit the table by Xeno\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fedecks the Messenger of the Gods, one of the alltime greats,” said Xeno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bird appeared in the doorway. At least, it looked vaguely like a bird. It was about a foot high, black and white, with a bent beak and an expression that suggested that whatever it was it really dreaded ever happening to it had already happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s that?” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A penguin,” said the voice of Om inside his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patina the Goddess of Wisdom? One of the best,” said Xeno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe penguin croaked at him and waddled off into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe philosophers looked very embarrassed. Then Ibid said, “Foorgol the God of Avalanches? Where\u0027s the snowline?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two hundred miles away,” said someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited. Nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relic of an outmoded belief system,” said Xeno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wall of freezing white death did not appear anywhere in Ephebe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mere unthinking personification of a natural force,” said one of the philosophers, in a louder voice. They all seemed to feel a lot better about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Primitive nature worship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wouldn\u0027t give you tuppence for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Simple rationalization of the unknown.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hah! A clever fiction, a bogey to frighten the weak and stupid!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words rose up in Brutha. He couldn\u0027t stop himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it always this cold?” he said. “It seemed very chilly on my way here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe philosophers all moved away from Xeno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Although if there\u0027s one thing you can say about Foorgol,” said Xeno, “it\u0027s that he\u0027s a very understanding god. Likes a joke as much as the next . . . man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked both ways, quickly. After a while the philosophers relaxed, and seemed to completely forget about Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd only now did he really have time to take in the room. He had never seen a tavern before in his life, but that was what it was. The bar ran along one side of the room. Behind it were the typical trappings of an Ephebian bar-the stacks of wine jars, racks of amphorae, and the cheery pictures of vestal virgins on cards of salted peanuts and goat jerky, pinned up in the hope that there really were people in the world who would slatheringly buy more and more packets of nuts they didn\u0027t want in order to look at a cardboard nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s all this stuff?” Brutha whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How should I know?” said Om. “Let me out so\u0027s I can see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha unfastened the box and lifted the tortoise out. One rheumy eye looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Typical tavern,” said Om. “Good. Mine\u0027s a saucer of whatever they were drinking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A tavern? A place were alcohol is drunk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I very much intend this to be the case, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But . . . but . . . the Septateuch, no less than seventeen times, adjures us most emphatically to refrain from-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beats the hell out of me why,” said Om. \"See that man cleaning the mugs? You say unto him, Give me a-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it mocks the mind of Man, says the Prophet Ossory. And-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll say this one more time! I never said it! Now talk to the man!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact the man talked to Brutha. He appeared magically on the other side of the bar, still wiping a mug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Evening, sir,” he said. “What\u0027ll it be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027d like a drink of water, please,” said Brutha, very deliberately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And something for the tortoise?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wine!” said the voice of Om.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know,” said Brutha. “What do tortoises usually drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ones we have in here normally have a drop of milk with some bread in it,” said the barman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You get a lot of tortoises?” said Brutha loudly, trying to drown out Om\u0027s outraged screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, a very useful philosophical animal, your average tortoise. Outrunning metaphorical arrows, beating hares in races . . . very handy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh . . . I haven\u0027t got any money,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barman leaned towards him. “Tell you what,” he said. “Declivities has just bought a round. He won\u0027t mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bread and milk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Thank you. Thank you very much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, we get all sorts in here,” said the barman, leaning back. “Stoics. Cynics. Big drinkers, the Cynics. Epicureans. Stochastics. Anamaxandrites. Epistemologists. Peripatetics. Synoptics. All sorts. That\u0027s what I always say. What I always say is”-he picked up another mug and started to dry it “it takes all sorts to make a world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bread and milk!” shouted Om. “You\u0027ll feel my wrath for this, right? Now ask him about gods!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me,” said Brutha, sipping his mug of water, “do any of them know much about gods?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027d want a priest for that sort of thing,” said the barman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I mean about . . . what gods are . . . how gods came to exist . . . that sort of thing,” said Brutha, trying to get to grips with the barman\u0027s peculiar mode of conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gods don\u0027t like that sort of thing,” said the barman. “We get that in here some nights, when someone\u0027s had a few. Cosmic speculation about whether gods really exist. Next thing, there\u0027s a bolt of lightning through the roof with a note wrapped round it saying `Yes, we do\u0027 and a pair of sandals with smoke coming out. That sort of thing, it takes all the interest out of metaphysical speculation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not even fresh bread,” muttered Om, nose deep in his saucer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I know gods exist all right,” said Brutha, hurriedly. “I just want to find out more about . . . them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barman shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I\u0027d be obliged if you don\u0027t stand next to anything valuable,” he said, “Still, it\u0027ll all be the same in a hundred years.” He picked up another mug and started to polish it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you a philosopher?” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It kind of rubs off on you after a while,” said the barman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This milk\u0027s off,” said Om. “They say Ephebe is a democracy. This milk ought to be allowed to vote.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t think,” said Brutha carefully, “that I\u0027m going to find what I want here. Um. Mr. Drink Seller?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that bird that walked in when the Goddess”-he tasted the unfamiliar word-“of Wisdom was mentioned?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bit of a problem there,” said the barman. “Bit of an embarrassment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry? ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was,” said the barman, “a penguin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it a wise sort of bird, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Not a lot,” said the barman. “Not known for its wisdom. Second most confused bird in the world. Can only fly underwater, they say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don\u0027t like to talk about it,” said the barman. “It upsets people. Bloody sculptor,” he added, under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown the other end of the bar the philosophers had started fighting again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barman leaned forward. “If you haven\u0027t got any money,” he said, “I don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to get much help. Talk isn\u0027t cheap around here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they just- Brutha began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s the expenditure on soap and water, for a start. Towels. Flannels. Loofahs. Pumice stones. Bath salts. It all adds up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a gurgling noise from the saucer.
