Of course, they make the dual claim in the hope that it will strengthen their mandarinate and help them to endure in a universe which finds them increasingly oppressive. It is in the name of all those oppressed people that I warn the Fremen: short-term expediency always fails in the long term. -The Preacher at Arrakeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto had come up in the night with Stilgar to the narrow ledge at the crest of the low rock outcropping which Sietch Tabr called The Attendant. Under the waning light of Second Moon, the ledge gave them a panoramic view - the Shield Wall with Mount Idaho to the north, the Great Flat to the south and rolling dunes eastward toward Habbanya Ridge. Winding dust, the aftermath of a storm, hid the southern horizon. Moonlight frosted the rim of the Shield Wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar had come against his will, joining the secretive venture finally because Leto aroused his curiosity. Why was it necessary to risk a sand crossing in the night? The lad had threatened to sneak away and make the journey alone if Stilgar refused. The way of it bothered him profoundly, though. Two such important targets alone in the night!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto squatted on the ledge facing south toward the flat. Occasionally he pounded his knee as though in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar waited. He was good at silent waiting, and stood two paces to one side of his charge, arms folded, his robe moving softly in the night breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Leto, the sand crossing represented a response to inner desperation, a need to seek a new alignment for his life in a silent conflict which Ghanima could no longer risk. He had maneuvered Stilgar into sharing the journey because there were things Stilgar had to know in preparation for the days ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Leto pounded his knee. It was difficult to know a beginning! He felt, at times, like an extension of those countless other lives, all as real and immediate as his own. In the flow of those lives there was no ending, no accomplishment - only eternal beginning. They could be a mob, too, clamoring at him as though he were a single window through which each desired to peer. And there lay the peril which had destroyed Alia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto stared outward at the moonlight silvering the storm remnants. Folds and overfolds of dunes spread across the flat: silica grit measured out by the winds, mounded into waves - pea sand, grit sand, pebbles. He felt himself caught in one of those poised moments just before dawn. Time pressed at him. It was already the month of Akkad and behind him lay the last of an interminable waiting time: long hot days and hot dry winds, nights like this one tormented by gusts and endless blowings from the furnace lands of the Hawkbled. He glanced over his shoulder toward the Shield Wall, a broken line in starlight. Beyond that wall in the Northern Sink lay the focus of his problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more he looked to the desert. As he stared into the hot darkness, day dawned, the sun rising out of dust scarves and placing a touch of lime into the storm\u0027s red streamers. He closed his eyes, willing himself to see how this day would appear from Arrakeen, and the city lay there in his consciousness, caught up like a scattering of boxes between the light and the new shadows. Desert... boxes... desert... boxes...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he opened his eyes, the desert remained: a spreading curry expanse of wind-kicked sand. Oily shadows along the base of each dune reached out like rays of the night just past. They linked one time with the other. He thought of the night, squatting here with Stilgar restless beside him, the older man worried at the silence and the unexplained reasons for coming to this place. Stilgar must have many memories of passing this way with his beloved Muad\u0027Dib. Even now Stilgar was moving, scanning all around, alert for dangers. Stilgar did not like the open in daylight. He was pure old Fremen in that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto\u0027s mind was reluctant to leave the night and the clean exertions of a sand crossing. Once here in the rocks, the night had taken on its black stillness. He sympathized with Stilgar\u0027s daylight fears. Black was a single thing even when it contained boiling terrors. Light could be many things. Night held its fear smells and its things which came with slithering sounds. Dimensions separated in the night, everything amplified - thorns sharper, blades more cutting. But terrors of the day could be worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto spoke without turning: \"I have a very serious problem, Stil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I surmised.\" The voice beside Leto came low and wary. The child had sounded disturbingly of the father. It was a thing of forbidden magic which touched a cord of revulsion in Stilgar. Fremen knew the terrors of possession. Those found possessed were rightfully killed and their water cast upon the sand lest it contaminate the tribal cistern. The dead should remain dead. It was correct to find one\u0027s immortality in children, but children had no right to assume too exact a shape from their past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My problem is that my father left so many things undone,\" Leto said. \"Especially the focus of our lives. The Empire cannot go on this way, Stil, without a proper focus for human life. I am speaking of life, you understand? Life, not death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once, when he was troubled by a vision, your father spoke in this vein to me,\" Stilgar said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto found himself tempted to pass off that questioning fear beside him with a light response, perhaps a suggestion that they break their fast. He realized that he was very hungry. They had eaten the previous noon and Leto had insisted on fasting through the night. But another hunger drew him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trouble with my life is the trouble with this place, Leto thought. No preliminary creation. I just go back and back and back until distances fade away. I cannot see the horizon; I cannot see Habbanya Ridge. I can\u0027t find the original place of testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s really no substitute for prescience,\" Leto said. \"Perhaps I should risk the spice...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And be destroyed as your father was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dilemma,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once your father confided in me that knowing the future too well was to be locked into that future to the exclusion of any freedom to change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The paradox which is our problem,\" Leto said. \"It\u0027s a subtle and powerful thing, prescience. The future becomes now. To be sighted in the land of the blind carries its own perils. If you try to interpret what you see for the blind, you tend to forget that the blind possess an inherent movement conditioned by their blindness. They are like a monstrous machine moving along its own path. They have their own momentum, their own fixations. I fear the blind, Stil. I fear them. They can so easily crush anything in their path.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar stared at the desert. Lime dawn had become steel day. He said: \"Why have we come to this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I wanted you to see the place where I may die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar tensed. Then: \"So you have had a vision!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps it was only a dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do we come to such a dangerous place?\" Stilgar glared down at his charge. \"We will return at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t die today, Stil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? What was this vision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw three paths,\" Leto said. His voice came out with the sleepy sound of remembrance. \"One of those futures requires me to kill our grandmother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar shot a sharp glance back toward Sietch Tabr, as though he feared the Lady Jessica could hear them across the sandy distance. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To keep from losing the spice monopoly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor do I. But that is the thought of my dream when I use the knife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Stilgar understood the use of a knife. He drew a deep breath. \"What is the second path?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ghani and I marry to seal the Atreides bloodline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ghaaa!\" Stilgar expelled his breath in a violent expression of distaste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was usual in ancient times for kings and queens to do this,\" Leto said. \"Ghani and I have decided we will not breed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I warn you to hold fast in that decision!\" There was death in Stilgar\u0027s voice. By Fremen Law, incest was punishable by death on the hanging tripod. He cleared his throat, asked: \"And the third path?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am called to reduce my father to human stature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was my friend, Muad\u0027Dib,\" Stilgar muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was your god! I must undeify him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar turned his back on the desert, stared toward the oasis of his beloved Sietch Tabr. Such talk always disturbed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto sensed the sweaty smell of Stilgar\u0027s movement. It was such a temptation to avoid the purposeful things which had to be said here. They could talk half the day away, moving from the specific to the abstract as through drawn away from real decisions, from those immediate necessities which confronted them. And there was no doubt that House Corrino posed a real threat to real lives - his own and Ghani\u0027s. But everything he did now had to be weighed and tested against the secret necessities. Stilgar once had voted to have Farad\u0027n assassinated, holding out for the subtle application of chaumurky: poison administered in a drink. Farad\u0027n was known to be partial to certain sweet liquors. That could not be permitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I die here, Stil,\" Leto said, \"you must beware of Alia. She is no longer your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this talk of death and your aunt?\" Now Stilgar was truly outraged. Kill the Lady Jessica! Beware of Alia! Die in this place!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Small men change their faces at her command,\" Leto said. \"A ruler need not be a prophet, Stil. Nor even godlike. A ruler need only be sensitive. I brought you here with me to clarify what our Imperium requires. It requires good government. That does not depend upon laws or precedent, but upon the personal qualities of whoever governs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Regency handles its Imperial duties quite well,\" Stilgar said. \"When you come of age -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am of age! I\u0027m the oldest person here! You\u0027re a puling infant beside me. I can remember times more than fifty centuries past. Hah! I can even remember when we Fremen were on Thurgrod.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you play with such fancies?\" Stilgar demanded, his tone peremptory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto nodded to himself. Why indeed? Why recount his memories of those other centuries? Today\u0027s Fremen were his immediate problem, most of them still only half-tamed savages, prone to laugh at unlucky innocence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The crysknife dissolves at the death of its owner,\" Leto said. \"Muad\u0027Dib has dissolved. Why are the Fremen still alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of those abrupt thought changes which so confounded Stilgar. He found himself temporarily dumb. Such words contained meaning, but their intent eluded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am expected to be Emperor, but I must be the servant,\" Leto said. He glanced across his shoulder at Stilgar. \"My grandfather for whom I was named added new words to his coat of arms when he came here to Dune: \u0027Here I am; here I remain.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had no choice,\" Stilgar said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good, Stil. Nor have I any choice. I should be the Emperor by birth, by the fitness of my understanding, by all that has gone into me. I even know what the Imperium requires: good government.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naib has an ancient meaning,\" Stilgar said. \"It is \u0027servant of the Sietch.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember your training, Stil,\" Leto said. \"For proper government, the tribe must have ways to choose men whose lives reflect the way a government should behave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the depths of his Fremen soul, Stilgar said: \"You\u0027ll assume the Imperial Mantle if it\u0027s meet. First you must prove that you can behave in the fashion of a ruler!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnexpectedly, Leto laughed. Then: \"Do you doubt my sincerity, Stil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My birthright?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I do what is expected of me, that is the measure of my sincerity, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the Fremen practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I cannot have inner feelings to guide my behavior?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand what -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I always behave with propriety, no matter what it costs me to suppress my own desires, then that is the measure of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such is the essence of self-control, youngster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Youngster!\" Leto shook his head. \"Ahhh, Stil, you provide me with the key to a rational ethic of government. I must be constant, every action rooted in the traditions of the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is proper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But my past goes deeper than yours!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What difference -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no first person singular, Stil. I am a multiple person with memories of traditions more ancient than you could imagine. That\u0027s my burden, Stil. I\u0027m past-directed. I\u0027m abrim with innate knowledge which resists newness and change. Yet Muad\u0027Dib changed all this.\" He gestured at the desert, his arm sweeping to encompass the Shield Wall behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar turned to peer at the Shield Wall. A village had been built beneath the wall since Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s time, houses to shelter a planetology crew helping spread plant life into the desert. Stilgar stared at the man-made intrusion into the landscape. Change? Yes. There was an alignment to the village, a trueness which offended him. He stood silently, ignoring the itching of grit particles under his stillsuit. That village was an offense against the thing this planet had been. Suddenly Stilgar wanted a circular howling of wind to leap over the dunes and obliterate that place. The sensation left him trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto said: \"Have you noticed, Stil, that the new stillsuits are of sloppy manufacture? Our water loss is too high.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar stopped himself on the point of asking: Have I not said it? Instead he said: \"Our people grow increasingly dependent upon the pills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto nodded. The pills shifted body temperature, reduced water loss. They were cheaper and easier than stillsuits. But they inflicted the user with other burdens, among them a tendency to slowed reaction time, occasional blurred vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why we came out here?\" Stilgar asked. \"To discuss stillsuit manufacture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Leto asked. \"Since you will not face what I must talk about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why must I beware of your aunt?\" Anger edged his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she plays upon the old Fremen desire to resist charge, yet would bring more terrible change than you can imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make much out of little! She\u0027s a proper Fremen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhh, then the proper Fremen holds to the ways of the past and I have an ancient past. Stil, were I to give free reign to this inclination, I would demand a closed society, completely dependent upon the sacred ways of the past. I would control migration, explaining that this fosters new ideas, and new ideas are a threat to the entire structure of life. Each little planetary polis would go its own way, becoming what it would. Finally the Empire would shatter under the weight of its differences.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar tried to swallow in a dry throat. These were words which Muad\u0027Dib might have produced. They had his ring to them. They were paradox, frightening. But if one allowed any change... He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The past may show the right way to behave if you live in the past, Stil, but circumstances change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar could only agree that circumstances did change. How must one behave then? He looked beyond Leto, seeing the desert and not seeing it. Muad\u0027Dib had walked there. The flat was a place of golden shadows as the sun climbed, purple shadows, gritty rivulets crested in dust vapors. The dust fog which usually hung over Habbanya Ridge was visible in the far distance now, and the desert between presented his eyes with dunes diminishing, one curve into another. Through the smoky shimmer of heat he saw the plants which crept out from the desert edge. Muad\u0027Dib had caused life to sprout in that desolate place. Copper, gold, red flowers, yellow flowers, rust and russet, grey-green leaves, spikes and harsh shadows beneath bushes. The motion of the day\u0027s heat set shadows quivering, vibrating in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently Stilgar said: \"I am only a leader of Fremen; you are the son of a Duke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not knowing what you said, you said it,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar scowled. Once, long ago, Muad\u0027Dib had chided him thus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember it, don\u0027t you, Stil?\" Leto asked. \"We were under Habbanya Ridge and the Sardaukar captain - remember him: Aramsham? He killed his friend to save himself. And you warned several times that day about preserving the lives of Sardaukar who\u0027d seen our secret ways. Finally you said they would surely reveal what they\u0027d seen; they must be killed. And my father said: \u0027Not knowing what you said, you said it.\u0027 And you were hurt. You told him you were only a simple leader of Fremen. Dukes must know more important things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar stared down at Leto. We were under Habbanya Ridge! We! This... this child, not even conceived on that day, knew what had taken place in exact detail, the kind of detail which could only be known to someone who had been there. It was only another proof that these Atreides children could not be judged by ordinary standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you will listen to me,\" Leto said. \"If I die or disappear in the desert, you are to flee from Sietch Tabr. I command it. You are to take Ghani and -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are not yet my Duke! You\u0027re a... a child!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m an adult in a child\u0027s flesh,\" Leto said. He pointed down to a narrow crack in the rocks below them. \"If I die here, it will be in that place. You will see the blood. You will know then. Take my sister and -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doubling your guard,\" Stilgar said. \"You\u0027re not coming out here again. We are leaving now and you -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stil! You cannot hold me. Turn your mind once more to that time at Habbanya Ridge. Remember? The factory crawler was out there on the sand and a big Maker was coming. There was no way to save the crawler from the worm. And my father was annoyed that he couldn\u0027t save that crawler. But Gurney could think only of the men he\u0027d lost in the sand. Remember what he said: \u0027Your father would\u0027ve been more concerned for the men he couldn\u0027t save.\u0027 Stil, I charge you to save people. They\u0027re more important than things. And Ghani is the most precious of all because, without me, she is the only hope for the Atreides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will hear no more,\" Stilgar said. He turned and began climbing down the rocks toward the oasis across the sand. He heard Leto following. Presently Leto passed him and, glancing back, said: \"Have you noticed, Stil, how beautiful the young women are this year?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe life of a single human, as the life of a family or an entire people, persists as memory. My people must come to see this as part of their maturing process. They are people as organism, and in this persistent memory they store more and more experiences in a subliminal reservoir. Humankind hopes to call upon this material if it is needed for a changing universe. But much that is stored can be lost in that chance play of accident which we call \"fate.\" Much may not be integrated into evolutionary relationships, and thus may not be evaluated and keyed into activity by those ongoing environmental changes which inflict themselves upon flesh. The species can forget! This is the special value of the Kwisatz Haderach which the Bene Gesserits never suspected: the Kwisatz Haderach cannot forget. -The Book of Leto, After Harq al-Ada\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar could not explain it, but he found Leto\u0027s casual observation profoundly disturbing. It ground through his awareness all the way back across the sand to Sietch Tabr, taking precedence over everything else Leto had said out there on The Attendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, the young women of Arrakis were very beautiful that year. And the young men, too. Their faces glowed serenely with water-richness. Their eyes looked outward and far. They exposed their features often without any pretense of stillsuit masks and the snaking lines of catchtubes. Frequently they did not even wear stillsuits in the open, preferring the new garments which, as they moved, offered flickering suggestions of the lithe young bodies beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch human beauty was set off against the new beauty of the landscape. By contrast with the old Arrakis, the eye could be spellbound by its collision with a tiny clump of green twigs growing among red-brown rocks. And the old sietch warrens of the cave-metropolis culture, complete with elaborate seals and moisture traps at every entrance, were giving way to open villages built often of mud bricks. Mud bricks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I want the village destroyed? Stilgar wondered, and he stumbled as he walked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew himself to be of a dying breed. Old Fremen gasped in wonder at the prodigality of their planet - water wasted into the air for no more than its ability to mold building bricks. The water for a single one-family dwelling would keep an entire sietch alive for a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new buildings even had transparent windows to let in the sun\u0027s heat and to desiccate the bodies within. Such windows opened outward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew Fremen within their mud homes could look out upon their landscape. They no longer were enclosed and huddling in a sietch. Where the new vision moved, there also moved the imagination. Stilgar could feel this. The new vision joined Fremen to the rest of the Imperial universe, conditioned them to unbounded space. Once they\u0027d been tied to water-poor Arrakis by their enslavement to its bitter necessities. They\u0027d not shared that open-mindedness which conditioned inhabitants on most planets of the Imperium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar could see the changes contrasting with his own doubts and fears. In the old days it had been a rare Fremen who even considered the possibility that he might leave Arrakis to begin a new life on one of the water-rich worlds. They\u0027d not even been permitted the dream of escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched Leto\u0027s moving back as the youth walked ahead. Leto had spoken of prohibitions against movement off-planet. Well, that had always been a reality for most other-worlders, even where the dream was permitted as a safety valve. But planetary serfdom had reached its peak here on Arrakis. Fremen had turned inward, barricaded in their minds as they were barricaded in their cave warrens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very meaning of sietch - a place of sanctuary in times of trouble - had been perverted here into a monstrous confinement for an entire population.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto spoke the truth: Muad\u0027Dib had changed all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar felt lost, He could feel his old beliefs crumbling. The new outward vision produced life which desired to move away from containment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How beautiful the young women are this year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old ways (My ways! he admitted) had forced his people to ignore all history except that which turned inward onto their own travail. The old Fremen had read history out of their own terrible migrations, their flights from persecution into persecution. The old planetary government had followed the stated policy of the old Imperium. They had suppressed creativity and all sense of progress, of evolution. Prosperity had been dangerous to the old Imperium and its holders of power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an abrupt shock, Stilgar realized that these things were equally dangerous to the course which Alia was setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Stilgar stumbled and fell farther behind Leto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the old ways and old religions, there\u0027d been no future, only an endless now. Before Muad\u0027Dib, Stilgar saw, the Fremen had been conditioned to believe in failure, never in the possibility of accomplishment. Well... they\u0027d believed Liet-Kynes, but he\u0027d set a forty-generation timescale. That was no accomplishment; that was a dream which, he saw now, had also turned inward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuad\u0027Dib had changed that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the Jihad, Fremen had learned much about the old Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. The eighty-first Padishah of House Corrino to occupy the Golden Lion Throne and reign over this Imperium of uncounted worlds had used Arrakis as a testing place for those policies which he hoped to implement in the rest of his empire. His planetary governors on Arrakis had cultivated a persistent pessimism to bolster their power base. They\u0027d made sure that everyone on Arrakis, even the free-roaming Fremen, became familiar with numerous cases of injustice and insoluble problems; they had been taught to think of themselves as a helpless people for whom there was no succor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How beautiful the young women are this year!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he watched Leto\u0027s retreating back, Stilgar began to wonder how the youth had set these thoughts flowing - and just by uttering a seemingly simple statement. Because of that statement, Stilgar found himself viewing Alia and his own role on the Council in an entirely different way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia was fond of saying that old ways gave ground slowly. Stilgar admitted to himself that he\u0027d always found this statement vaguely reassuring. Change was dangerous. Invention must be suppressed. Individual willpower must be denied. What other function did the priesthood serve than to deny individual will?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia kept saying that opportunities for open competition had to be reduced to manageable limits. But that meant the recurrent threat of technology could only be used to confine populations - just as it had served its ancient masters. Any permitted technology had to be rooted in ritual. Otherwise... otherwise...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Stilgar stumbled. He was at the qanat now and saw Leto waiting beneath the apricot orchard which grew along the flowing water. Stilgar heard his feet moving through uncut grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncut grass!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat can I believe? Stilgar asked himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was proper for a Fremen of his generation to believe that individuals needed a profound sense of their own limitations. Traditions were surely the most controlling element in a secure society. People had to know the boundaries of their time, of their society, of their territory. What was wrong with the sietch as a model for all thinking? A sense of enclosure should pervade every individual choice - should fence in the family, the community, and every step taken by a proper government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar came to a stop and stared across the orchard at Leto. The youth stood there, regarding him with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes he know the turmoil in my head? Stilgar wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the old Fremen Naib tried to fall back on the traditional catechism of his people. Each aspect of life required a single form, its inherent circularity based on secret inner knowledge of what will work and what will not work. The model for life, for the community, for every element of the larger society right up to and beyond the peaks of government - that model had to be the sietch and its counterpart in the sand: Shai-Hulud. The giant sandworm was surely a most formidable creature, but when threatened it hid in the impenetrable deeps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChange is dangerous! Stilgar told himself. Sameness and stability were the proper goals of government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the young men and women were beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they remembered the words of Muad\u0027Dib as he deposed Shaddam IV: \"It\u0027s not long life to the Emperor that I seek; it\u0027s long life to the Imperium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsn\u0027t that what I\u0027ve been saying to myself? Stilgar wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe resumed walking, headed toward the sietch entrance slightly to Leto\u0027s right. The youth moved to intercept him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuad\u0027Dib had said another thing, Stilgar reminded himself: \"just as individuals are born, mature, breed, and die, so do societies and civilizations and governments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDangerous or not, there would be change. The beautiful young Fremen knew this. They could look outward and see it, prepare for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar was forced to stop. It was either that or walk right over Leto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youth peered up at him owlishly, said: \"You see, Stil? Tradition isn\u0027t the absolute guide you thought it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Fremen dies when he is too long from the desert; this we call \"the water sickness.\" -Stilgar, the Commentaries\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is difficult for me, asking you to do this,\" Alia said. \"But... I must insure that there\u0027s an empire for Paul\u0027s children to inherit. There\u0027s no other reason for the Regency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia turned from where she was seated at a mirror completing her morning toilet. She looked at her husband, measuring how he absorbed these words. Duncan Idaho deserved careful study in these moments; there was no doubt that he\u0027d become something far more subtle and dangerous than the one-time swordmaster of House Atreides. The outer appearance remained similar - the black goat hair over sharp dark features - but in the long years since his awakening from the ghola state he had undergone an inner metamorphosis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered now, as she had wondered many times, what the ghola rebirth-after-death might have hidden in the secret loneliness of him. Before the Tleilaxu had worked their subtle science on him, Duncan\u0027s reactions had borne clear labels for the Atreides - loyalty, fanatic adherence to the moral code of his mercenary forebears, swift to anger and swift to recover. He had been implacable in his resolve for revenge against House Harkonnen. And he had died saving Paul. But the Tleilaxu had bought his body from the Sardaukar and, in their regeneration vats, they had grown a zombie-katrundo: the flesh of Duncan Idaho, but none of his conscious memories. He\u0027d been trained as a mentat and sent as a gift, a human computer for Paul, a fine tool equipped with a hypnotic compulsion to slay his owner. The flesh of Duncan Idaho had resisted that compulsion and, in the intolerable stress, his cellular past had come back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia had decided long ago that it was dangerous to think of him as Duncan in the privacy of her thoughts. Better to think of him by his ghola name, Hayt. Far better. And it was essential that he get not the slightest glimpse of the old Baron Harkonnen sitting there in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan saw Alia studying him, turned away. Love could not hide the changes in her, nor conceal from him the transparency of her motives. The many-faceted metal eyes which the Tleilaxu had given him were cruel in their ability to penetrate deception. They limned her now as a gloating, almost masculine figure, and he could not stand to see her thus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you turn away?\" Alia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must think about this thing,\" he said. \"The Lady Jessica is... an Atreides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your loyalty is to House Atreides, not to me,\" Alia pouted. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-10.html","bookId":2155,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:17 PM"}
