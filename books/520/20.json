{"id":44686,"no":20,"title":"30th May","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Did you ever see this campus? (That is merely a rhetorical question. \n\u003cbr\u003e Don\u0027t let it annoy you.) It is a heavenly spot in May. All the\n\u003cbr\u003e shrubs are in blossom and the trees are the loveliest young green--\n\u003cbr\u003e even the old pines look fresh and new. The grass is dotted with yellow\n\u003cbr\u003e dandelions and hundreds of girls in blue and white and pink dresses. \n\u003cbr\u003e Everybody is joyous and carefree, for vacation\u0027s coming, and with\n\u003cbr\u003e that to look forward to, examinations don\u0027t count.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Isn\u0027t that a happy frame of mind to be in? And oh, Daddy! \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m the happiest of all! Because I\u0027m not in the asylum any more;\n\u003cbr\u003e and I\u0027m not anybody\u0027s nursemaid or typewriter or bookkeeper (I\n\u003cbr\u003e should have been, you know, except for you).\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m sorry now for all my past badnesses.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m sorry I was ever impertinent to Mrs. Lippett.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m sorry I ever slapped Freddie Perkins.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m sorry I ever filled the sugar bowl with salt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m sorry I ever made faces behind the Trustees\u0027 backs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m going to be good and sweet and kind to everybody because I\u0027m\n\u003cbr\u003e so happy. And this summer I\u0027m going to write and write and write\n\u003cbr\u003e and begin to be a great author. Isn\u0027t that an exalted stand\n\u003cbr\u003e to take? Oh, I\u0027m developing a beautiful character! It droops\n\u003cbr\u003e a bit under cold and frost, but it does grow fast when the sun shines.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That\u0027s the way with everybody. I don\u0027t agree with the theory that\n\u003cbr\u003e adversity and sorrow and disappointment develop moral strength. \n\u003cbr\u003e The happy people are the ones who are bubbling over with kindliness. \n\u003cbr\u003e I have no faith in misanthropes. (Fine word! Just learned it.)\n\u003cbr\u003e You are not a misanthrope are you, Daddy?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I started to tell you about the campus. I wish you\u0027d come\n\u003cbr\u003e for a little visit and let me walk you about and say:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `That is the library. This is the gas plant, Daddy dear. \n\u003cbr\u003e The Gothic building on your left is the gymnasium, and the Tudor\n\u003cbr\u003e Romanesque beside it is the new infirmary.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, I\u0027m fine at showing people about. I\u0027ve done it all my life at\n\u003cbr\u003e the asylum, and I\u0027ve been doing it all day here. I have honestly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And a Man, too!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That\u0027s a great experience. I never talked to a man before (except\n\u003cbr\u003e occasional Trustees, and they don\u0027t count). Pardon, Daddy, I don\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e mean to hurt your feelings when I abuse Trustees. I don\u0027t consider\n\u003cbr\u003e that you really belong among them. You just tumbled on to the Board\n\u003cbr\u003e by chance. The Trustee, as such, is fat and pompous and benevolent. \n\u003cbr\u003e He pats one on the head and wears a gold watch chain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That looks like a June bug, but is meant to be a portrait of any\n\u003cbr\u003e Trustee except you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e However--to resume:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I have been walking and talking and having tea with a man. \n\u003cbr\u003e And with a very superior man--with Mr. Jervis Pendleton of the House\n\u003cbr\u003e of Julia; her uncle, in short (in long, perhaps I ought to say;\n\u003cbr\u003e he\u0027s as tall as you.) Being in town on business, he decided to run\n\u003cbr\u003e out to the college and call on his niece. He\u0027s her father\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e youngest brother, but she doesn\u0027t know him very intimately. It seems\n\u003cbr\u003e he glanced at her when she was a baby, decided he didn\u0027t like her,\n\u003cbr\u003e and has never noticed her since.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, there he was, sitting in the reception room very proper\n\u003cbr\u003e with his hat and stick and gloves beside him; and Julia and Sallie\n\u003cbr\u003e with seventh-hour recitations that they couldn\u0027t cut. So Julia\n\u003cbr\u003e dashed into my room and begged me to walk him about the campus\n\u003cbr\u003e and then deliver him to her when the seventh hour was over. \n\u003cbr\u003e I said I would, obligingly but unenthusiastically, because I don\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e care much for Pendletons.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But he turned out to be a sweet lamb. He\u0027s a real human being--\n\u003cbr\u003e not a Pendleton at all. We had a beautiful time; I\u0027ve longed\n\u003cbr\u003e for an uncle ever since. Do you mind pretending you\u0027re my uncle? \n\u003cbr\u003e I believe they\u0027re superior to grandmothers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Pendleton reminded me a little of you, Daddy, as you were twenty\n\u003cbr\u003e years ago. You see I know you intimately, even if we haven\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e ever met!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He\u0027s tall and thinnish with a dark face all over lines, and the\n\u003cbr\u003e funniest underneath smile that never quite comes through but just\n\u003cbr\u003e wrinkles up the corners of his mouth. And he has a way of making\n\u003cbr\u003e you feel right off as though you\u0027d known him a long time. \n\u003cbr\u003e He\u0027s very companionable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We walked all over the campus from the quadrangle to the athletic grounds;\n\u003cbr\u003e then he said he felt weak and must have some tea. He proposed that\n\u003cbr\u003e we go to College Inn--it\u0027s just off the campus by the pine walk. \n\u003cbr\u003e I said we ought to go back for Julia and Sallie, but he said he didn\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e like to have his nieces drink too much tea; it made them nervous. \n\u003cbr\u003e So we just ran away and had tea and muffins and marmalade and\n\u003cbr\u003e ice-cream and cake at a nice little table out on the balcony. \n\u003cbr\u003e The inn was quite conveniently empty, this being the end of the month\n\u003cbr\u003e and allowances low.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We had the jolliest time! But he had to run for his train\n\u003cbr\u003e the minute he got back and he barely saw Julia at all. She was\n\u003cbr\u003e furious with me for taking him off; it seems he\u0027s an unusually rich\n\u003cbr\u003e and desirable uncle. It relieved my mind to find he was rich,\n\u003cbr\u003e for the tea and things cost sixty cents apiece.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This morning (it\u0027s Monday now) three boxes of chocolates came by\n\u003cbr\u003e express for Julia and Sallie and me. What do you think of that? \n\u003cbr\u003e To be getting candy from a man!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I begin to feel like a girl instead of a foundling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I wish you\u0027d come and have tea some day and let me see if I like you. \n\u003cbr\u003e But wouldn\u0027t it be dreadful if I didn\u0027t? However, I know I should.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bien! I make you my compliments.\n\u003cbr\u003e `Jamais je ne t\u0027oublierai.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. I looked in the glass this morning and found a perfectly\n\u003cbr\u003e new dimple that I\u0027d never seen before. It\u0027s very curious. \n\u003cbr\u003e Where do you suppose it came from?\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59742.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
