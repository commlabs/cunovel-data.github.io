Then Cassie remembered that the new principal was being announced at this morning\u0027s assembly. Maybe that was the source of all the new energy in the air? She was eager to meet the man who would be in charge of their school, especially after their last principal turned out to be Black John in disguise. But Melanie and Laurel were probably right - it was this weekend\u0027s spring festival that had everyone keyed up. Their schoolmates were all planning their outfits and debating over who\u0027d be a worthy date. Nobody cared who the new principal was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a good sign,\" Melanie said. \"A celebration of new beginnings is just what this town needs.\" Cassie wanted to be as excited as everyone about the coming spring, but her heart felt heavy in her chest. Her disastrous attempt to talk to her mother the previous night was still weighing on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Chris and Doug Henderson swept by on Roll erblades, laughing as they tore through the crowded hallway. Their forward momentum blew their disheveled blond hair back from their identical blue-green eyes. They slowed down only to hand out star-shaped flowers to whichever pretty girls they passed. Suzan, carrying a wicker basket full of the flowers, jogged behind them to keep them supplied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the heck was that?\" Cassie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chionodoxa luciliae,\" Laurel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie gave Laurel a shove. \"In English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\" Laurel smiled. \"Those blue flowers. They\u0027re called glory-of-the-snow. They\u0027re one of the first signs of spring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to Cassie then that even the Henderson twins, who\u0027d lost their sister, Kori, just last fall, were embracing the new season. She could try a little harder to have a more positive outlook. \"I think I\u0027ve seen those flowers,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re in the rock garden behind the gymnasium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore they\u0027re not,\" Sean said, laughing loudly. He walked toward them with a bouquet of the blue flowers in his skinny outstretched hand and hesitantly offered them to Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Sean,\" Cassie said, but before she could accept the bouquet, Faye stepped in and swiped it from accept the bouquet, Faye stepped in and swiped it from Sean\u0027s hand. She sniffed at the buds and then shoved them back onto Sean\u0027s chest. \"Run along to the assembly and find some other pathetic girl to give those to,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she turned to Cassie. \"I need a word with you.\" Faye was wearing all black, as she often did, but her outfit today was tighter and more revealing than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie gave a nod to Melanie and Laurel. \"It\u0027s okay,\" she said. \"Go ahead to the auditorium. I\u0027ll see you there.\" She\u0027d promised herself she would show no fear to Faye, no matter what. She couldn\u0027t allow herself to be afraid to be alone with her, especially at school, where it was safe to assume she\u0027d be protected from any abuse Faye could inflict upon her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye, of course, wasted no time making her point. \"I know you\u0027re new to this whole leader thing,\" she told Cassie. \"But even you should recognize you won\u0027t be able to play fair for long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" Faye scoffed, like it was beneath her to have to explain herself. \"Don\u0027t play innocent with me, Cassie. It doesn\u0027t work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie glanced up and down the empty hallway and put her hands on her hips. \"If you actually have something to say to me, Faye, then say it. But if you\u0027re just trying to intimidate me, you\u0027re not succeeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liar.\" Faye reached out to lightly brush aside the few strands of hair that had fall en in front of Cassie\u0027s eyes, and Cassie jumped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye smiled. \"Here\u0027s what I have to say. Power always Faye smiled. \"Here\u0027s what I have to say. Power always creates enemies. It divides people into two types, good and bad. If you really want to be a leader of this Circle, then you need to pick a side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie remembered Diana once saying that power was only power - it wasn\u0027t good or bad. Only the way we use it is good or bad, she\u0027d said. But even Diana had changed her opinion about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already chosen a side,\" Cassie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe star ruby around Faye\u0027s neck glistened. It was the same color as her lipstick. \"No, you haven\u0027t,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something in you that proves you\u0027re daddy\u0027s little girl. You can feel it inside you. A darkness. I know you can.\" Cassie hugged her books tighter to her chest. \"You don\u0027t know anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it exhausting trying so hard to emulate Diana when really you\u0027re just like me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Because I\u0027m nothing like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye let out a deep, throaty laugh and took a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d accomplished what she\u0027d intended. Cassie was significantly rattled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better hurry up,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t want to be late to the assembly.\" She pulled a tube of lipstick from her bag and applied another slash of dark pigment to her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want some?\" She held the bloodred tube out to Cassie. \"I think it\u0027s your color.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flash of anger Cassie thought to swat the lipstick right out of Faye\u0027s hand. But that would be giving her exactly what she wanted. She was trying to push Cassie into giving in to her lowest impulses, to be as brash and reckless as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Cassie wouldn\u0027t do it. She wouldn\u0027t give Faye that satisfaction. Instead, she turned her back on her, and when she did, she caught sight of someone she hadn\u0027t seen before. A boy. Faye noticed him, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, they watched him walk up the hallway. He was tall and muscular with light brown hair, and he must have just finished working out, because he was wearing warm-ups and sneakers. He carried a gym bag in one hand and a lacrosse stick in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That boy is gorgeous.\" Faye capped her lipstick and stuffed it into her purse. \"You know how I love those sweaty jocks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye immediately approached the boy to stake her claim. \"Are you lost?\" she called out to him. \"I can help you find your way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head shot up when he realized he was being spoken to. Cassie saw that his eyes were green like emeralds, as beautiful as Diana\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you,\" he said, in a voice both rugged and cocky. \"I know where I\u0027m heading.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To that boring assembly?\" Faye wasn\u0027t about to give up that easy. \"In that case, I can help you lose your way.\" That got a smile out of him, but he directed it at Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" he said. \"I\u0027m Max.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Faye,\" Cassie said, returning Max\u0027s grin. \"She\u0027s glad to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax dropped his gym bag onto the floor and shook Faye\u0027s hand in a way that made it obvious he was used to girls fawning over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie,\" Faye said, still holding Max\u0027s thick hand in hers. \"Won\u0027t Adam be waiting for you at the assembly? You should probably get going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie nodded. \"She\u0027s right. I should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Cassie turned away, she heard Max call after her,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie made it into the auditorium just in time for the welcoming ceremony. She was relieved to find Adam waving her over to where he was seated in the last row. The auditorium was more crowded than she had ever seen it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroups of students were crammed in the back and up each exit row. The humming excitement Cassie picked up on in the hallway had carried over here, where it heightened like rough water constrained by a dam. But once Mr. Humphries tapped on the microphone to quiet the crowd and make some announcements, that restless energy died down to a low-level boredom. Assemblies were always fun until the assembly part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie let her eyes roam over the crowd. She found Diana all the way up front, seated with her AP English class. Melanie and Laurel had joined Suzan, Sean, and the Henderson brothers in the center rows about midway from the stage. And Deborah and Nick were just a few rows behind them. Cassie noticed that none of them looked concerned. They appeared as bored and apathetic as the rest of the school. Was she the only one still reeling from the last assembly they had to welcome a principal? Were they all just faking it, trying to put their best faces forward?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr was everyone really that much better at moving on than Cassie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSally Waltman and Portia Bainbridge were sitting in their cluster of cheerleaders. Sally\u0027s rust-colored hair stood out from the rest of her mostly blonde friends, so she was easy to spot in their crowd. She was laughing at something Portia was saying, probably making fun of someone, like she always did. The Circle had come to an uneasy truce with Portia and her brothers, but Cassie still didn\u0027t like her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" Adam asked when Cassie settled into her seat. \"You\u0027ve got that I-just-had-a-Faye-encounter look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine. Faye was getting up in my face, but then a hot boy walked by, and she forgot all about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s our Faye.\" Adam took Cassie\u0027s hand in his and squeezed it. \"Who was the boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, someone new. His name was Max.\" Cassie searched the auditorium for Faye and found her standing in the corner talking to Max - talking at him was more like it. He leaned with both hands on his lacrosse stick, like he might fall over from boredom if it weren\u0027t holding him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie shifted her attention to the man she assumed was the new principal waiting off to the side. He wore a finely cut dark suit and had salt-and-pepper hair. He was tall, with broad shoulders, and kept his hands clasped behind his back. He was handsome, the way Mr. Brunswick had been handsome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeak applause welcomed him to the stage. \"Thank you,\" he said, as he adjusted the microphone. \"I\u0027m Mr. Boylan, and it\u0027s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.\" His voice was deeper than Cassie had expected it to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis outer appearance was dapper and elegant, but he had the voice of a lumberjack - it had a toughness to it, a grit, and the slightest hint of an accent she couldn\u0027t place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver ran down her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Cassie thought to herself. You\u0027re being paranoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust because Mr. Brunswick turned out to be evil doesn\u0027t mean Mr. Boylan will. She figured she must have been suffering from some kind of post-traumatic stress, the way soldiers returned from wars startled at every harmless loud sound they heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as Mr. Boylan continued speaking, every muscle in Cassie\u0027s body tightened in defense. She glanced at Adam to see if he sensed anything off about the principal, too, but he was calmly watching the stage with no expression of alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you all for your gracious welcome,\" Mr. Boylan said. \"I hope you\u0027ll do the same for my son, who will also be a student here.\" He pointed to the far corner, where Max was still leaning on his lacrosse stick, staring straight ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam and Cassie looked at each other simultaneously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of them had to say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course. Faye\u0027s new crush was the principal\u0027s son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye was smirking behind him, watching the back of his head as if she could burn a hole through it with her desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she caught Cassie watching, she puckered her lips into a kiss and blew it Cassie\u0027s way. Then she stuck out her tongue, pretending she might lick the back of Max\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This can\u0027t be good,\" Cassie said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-divide-the-secret-circle-4/page-3.html","bookId":2098,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:39 PM"}
