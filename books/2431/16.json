He was conscious of a voice. He could not hear the words it spoke, just a voice. He puzzled over the fact that it sounded odd and solved the matter to his satisfaction by recognizing it as a woman\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were arms around him, lifting him, heaving him. One arm - his arm - dangled. His head lolled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried feebly to straighten out, but nothing happened. The woman\u0027s voice again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes wearily. He was aware of being cold and wet and suddenly realized that water was not striking him. And it was not dark, not entirely. There was a dim suffusing, of light and, by it, he saw a robot\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized it. \"Giskard,\" he whispered and with that he remembered the storm and the flight. And Giskard had reached him first; he had found him before the other robots had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley thought contentedly: I knew he would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let his eyes close again and felt himself moving rapidly but with the slight - yet definite - unevenness that meant he was being carried by someone who was walking. Then a stop and a slow adjustment until he was resting on something quite warm and comfortable. He knew it was the seat of a car covered, perhaps, with toweling, but did not question how he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was the sensation of smooth motion through the air and the feeling of soft absorbent fabric over his face and hands, the tearing open of his blouse, cold air upon his chest, and then the drying and blotting again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, the sensations crowded in upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in an establishment. There were flashes of walls, of illumination, of objects (miscellaneous shapes of furnishings) which he saw now and then when he opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt his clothes being stripped off methodically and made a few feeble and useless attempts to cooperate, then he felt warm water and vigorous scrubbing. It went on and on and he didn\u0027t want it to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point, a thought occurred to him and he seized the arm that was holding him. \"Giskard! Giskard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Giskard\u0027s voice, \"I am here, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Giskard, is Daneel safe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is quite safe, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Baley closed his eyes again and made no effort whatever in connection with the drying. He felt himself turned over and over in the stream of dry air and then he was being dressed again in something like a warm robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuxury! Nothing like this had happened to him since he was an infant and he was suddenly sorry for the babies for whom everything was done and who were not sufficiently conscious of it to enjoy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr did they? Was the hidden memory of that infant luxury a determinant of adult behavior? Was his own feeling now just an expression of the delight of being an infant again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had heard a woman\u0027s voice. Mother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that couldn\u0027t possibly be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMamma?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sitting in a chair now. He could sense as much and he could also feel, somehow, that the short happy period of renewed infancy was coming to an end. He had to return to the sad world of self-consciousness and selfhelp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there had been a woman\u0027s voice. - What woman?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley opened his eyes. \"Gladia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e67\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a question, a surprised question, but deep within himself he was not really surprised. Thinking back, he had, of course, recognized her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around. Giskard was standing in his alcove, but he ignored him. First things first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Where\u0027s Daneel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGladia said, \"He has cleaned and dried himself in the robot\u0027s quarters and he has dry clothing. He is surrounded by my household staff and they have their instructions. I can tell you that no outsider will approach within fifty meters of my establishment in any direction without our all knowing it at once. Giskard is cleaned and dried as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I can see that,\" said Baley. He was not concerned with Giskard, only with Daneel - He was relieved that Gladia seemed to accept the necessity of guarding Daneel and that he would not have to face the complications of explaining the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet there was one breach in the wall of security and a note of querulousness entered in his voice as he said, \"Why did you leave him, Gladia? With you gone, there was no human being in the house to stop the approach of a band of outside robots. Daneel could have been taken by force.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" said Gladia with spirit. \"We were not gone long and Dr. Fastolfe had been informed. Many of his robots had joined mine and he could be on the spot in minutes if needed - and I\u0027d like to see any band of outside robots withstand him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen Daneel since you returned, Gladia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course! He\u0027s safe, I tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you!\" Baley relaxed and closed his eyes. Oddly enough, he thought: It wasn\u0027t so bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it wasn\u0027t. He had survived, hadn\u0027t he? When he thought that, something inside himself grinned and was happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had survived, hadn\u0027t he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes and said, \"How did you find me, Gladia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Giskard. They had come here - both of them - and Giskard explained the situation to me quickly. I set right about securing Daneel, but he wouldn\u0027t budge until I had promised to order Giskard out after you. He was very eloquent. His responses with respect to you are very intense, Elijah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daneel remained behind, of course. It made him very unhappy, but Giskard insisted that I order him to stay at the very top of my voice. You must have given Giskard some mighty strict orders. Then we got in touch with Dr. Fastolfe and, after that, we took my personal airfoil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley shook his head wearily. \"You should not have come along, Gladia. Your place was here, making sure Daneel was safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGladia\u0027s face twisted into scorn. \"And leave you dying in the storm, for all we knew? Or being taken up by Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s enemies? I have a little holograph of myself letting that happen. No, Elijah, I might have been needed to keep the other robots away from you if they had gotten to you first. I may not be much good in most ways, but any Solarian can handle a mob of robots, let me tell you. We\u0027re used to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how did you find me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t so terribly hard. Actually, your airfoil wasn\u0027t far away, so that we could have walked it, except for the storm. We - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"You mean we had almost made it to Fastolfe\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Gladia. \"Either your airfoil, in being damaged, wasn\u0027t damaged sufficiently to force you to a standstill sooner or Giskard\u0027s skill kept it going for longer than the vandals had anticipated. Which is a good thing. If you had come down closer to the Institute, they might have gotten you all. Anyway, we took my airfoil to where yours had come down. Giskard knew where it was, of course, and we got out - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you got all wet, didn\u0027t you, Gladia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a bit,\" she replied. \"I had a large rain shade and a light sphere, too. My shoes got muddy and my feet got a little damp because I didn\u0027t have time to spray on Latex, but there\u0027s no ham in that. - Anyway, we were back at your airfoil less than half an hour after Giskard and Daneel had left you and, of course, you weren\u0027t there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had tried - \" began Baley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we know. I thought they - the others - had taken you away because Giskard said you were being followed. But Giskard found your handkerchief about fifty meters from the airfoil and he said that you must have wandered off in that direction. Giskard said, it was an illogical thing to do, but that human beings were often illogical, so that we should search for you. So we looked - both of us - using the lightsphere, but it was he who found you. He said he saw the infrared glimmer of your body heat at the base of the tree and we brought you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, with a spark of annoyance, \"Why was my leaving an illogical thing to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t say, Elijah. Do you wish to ask him?\" She gestured toward Giskard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"Giskard, what\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiskard\u0027s impassivity was disrupted at once and his eyes focused on Baley. He said, \"I felt that you had exposed yourself to the storm unnecessarily. If you had waited, we would have brought you here sooner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The other robots might have gotten to me first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did - but you had sent them away, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were many robotic footprints around the doors on either side, sir, but there was no sign of dampness within the airfoil, as there would have been if wet arms had reached in to lift you out. I judged you would not have gotten out of the airfoil of your own accord in order to join them, sir. And, having sent them away, you need not have feared they would return very quickly, since it was Daneel they were after - by your own estimate of the situation - and not you. In addition, you might have been certain that I would have been back quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley muttered, \"I reasoned precisely in that manner but I felt that confusing the issue might help further. I did what seemed best to me and you did find me, even so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, \"But why bring me here? If we were close to Gladia\u0027s establishment, we were just as close, perhaps closer, to Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite, sir. This residence was somewhat closer and I judged, from the urgency of your orders, that every moment counted in securing Daneel\u0027s safety. Daneel concurred in this, though he was most reluctant to leave you. Once he was here, I felt you would want to be here, too, so that you could, if you desired, assure yourself of his safety firsthand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley nodded and, said grumpily (he was still annoyed at that remark concerning his illogicality), \"You did well, Giskard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGladia said, \"Is it important that you see Dr. Fastolfe, Elijah? I can have him summoned here. Or you can view him trimensionally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley leaned back in his chair again. He had leisure to realize that his thought processes were blunted and that he was very tired. It would do him no good to face Fastolfe now. He said, \"No. I\u0027ll see him tomorrow after breakfast. Time enough. And then I think I\u0027ll be seeing this man, Kelden Amadiro, the head of the Robotics Institute. And a high official - what d\u0027you call him? - the Chairman. He will be there, too, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look terribly tired, Elijah,\" said Gladia. \"Of course, we don\u0027t have those microorganisms - those germs and viruses - that you have on Earth and you\u0027ve been cleaned out so you won\u0027t get any of the diseases they have all over your planet, but you\u0027re clearly tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley thought: After all that, no cold? No flu? No pneumonia? - There was something to being on a Spacer world at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I admit I\u0027m tired, but that can be cured by a bit of rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hungry? It\u0027s dinnertime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley made a face. \"I don\u0027t feel like eating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s wise. You don\u0027t want a heavy meal, perhaps, but how about some hot soup. It will do you good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley felt the urge to smile. She might be Solarian, but given the proper circumstances she sounded exactly like art Earth-woman. He suspected that this would be true of Aurorans as well. There are some things that differences in culture don\u0027t touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Do you have soup available? I don\u0027t want to be a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be a problem? I have a staff - not a large one, as on Solaria, but enough to prepare any reasonable item of food on short order. - Now you just sit there and tell me, what kind of soup you would like. It will all be taken care of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley couldn\u0027t resist. \"Chicken soup?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Then innocently, \"Just what I would have suggested - and with lumps of chicken, so that it will be substantial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bowl was put before him with surprising speed. He said, \"Aren\u0027t you going to eat, Gladia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve eaten already, while you were being bathed and treated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Treated?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only routine biochemical adjustment, Elijah. You had been rather psychic-damaged and we wanted no repercussions. - Do eat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley lifted an experimental spoonful to his lips. It was not bad chicken soup, though it had the queer tendency of Auroran food to be rather spicier than Baley would prefer. Or perhaps it was prepared with different spices than those he was used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered his mother suddenly - a sharp thrust of memory that made her appear younger than he himself was right now. He remembered her standing over him when he rebelled at eating his \"nice soup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would say to him, \"Come, Lije. This is real chicken and very expensive. Even the Spacers don\u0027t have anything better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t. He called to her in his, mind across the years: They don\u0027t, Mom!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally! If he could trust memory and allow for the power of youthful taste buds, his mother\u0027s chicken soup, when it wasn\u0027t dulled by repetition, was far superior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sipped again and again - and when he finished, he muttered in a shamefaced way, \"Would there be a little more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As much as you want, Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a little more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGladia said to him, as he was finishing, \"Elijah, this meeting tomorrow morning - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Gladia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it mean that your investigation is over? Do you know what happened to Jander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said judiciously, \"I have an idea as to what might have happened to Jander. I don\u0027t think I can necessarily persuade anyone that I am right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you having the conference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not my idea, Gladia. It\u0027s Master Roboticist Amadiro\u0027s idea. He objects to the investigation and he\u0027s going to try to have me sent back to Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he the one who tampered with your airfoil and tried to have his robots take Daneel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, can\u0027t he be tried and convicted and punished for that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He certainly could,\" said Baley feelingly, \"except for the very small problem that I can\u0027t prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And can he do all that and get away with it - and stop the investigation, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid he has a good chance of being able to do so. As he himself says, people who don\u0027t expect justice don\u0027t have to suffer disappointment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he mustn\u0027t. You mustn\u0027t let him. You\u0027ve got to complete your investigation and find out the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley sighed. \"What if I can\u0027t find out the truth? Or what if I can - but can\u0027t make people listen to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can find out the truth. And you can make people listen to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a touching faith in me, Gladia. Still, if the Auroran World Legislature wants to send me back and orders the investigation ended, there\u0027s nothing I\u0027m going to be able to do about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely you won\u0027t be willing to go back with nothing accomplished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I won\u0027t. It\u0027s worse than just accomplishing nothing, Gladia. I\u0027ll go back with my career ruined and with Earth\u0027s future destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then don\u0027t let them do that, Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he said, \"Jehoshaphat, Gladia, I\u0027m going to try not to, but I can\u0027t lift a planet with my bare hands. You can\u0027t ask me for miracles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGladia nodded and, eyes downcast, put her fist to her mouth, sitting there motionlessly, as though in thought. It took a while for Baley to realize that she was weeping soundlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e68\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley stood up quickly and walked around the table to her. He noted absently - and with some annoyance - that his legs were trembling and that there was a tic in the muscle of his right thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gladia,\" he said urgently, \"don\u0027t cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bother, Elijah,\" she whispered. \"It will pass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood helplessly at her side, reaching out to her yet hesitating. \"I\u0027m not touching you,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t think I had better do so, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, touch me. Touch me. I\u0027m not all that fond of my body, and I won\u0027t catch anything from you. I\u0027m not - what I used to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Baley reached out and touched her elbow and stroked it very slightly and clumsily with his fingertips. \"I\u0027ll do what I can tomorrow, Gladia,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll give it my very best try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose at that, turned toward him, and said, \"Oh, Elijah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomatically, scarcely knowing what he was doing, Baley held out his arms. And, just as automatically, she walked into them and he was holding her while her head cradled - against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her as lightly as he could, waiting for her to realize that she was embracing an Earthman. (She had undoubtedly embraced a humaniform robot, but he had been no Earthman.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sniffed loudly and spoke while her mouth was half obscured in Baley\u0027s shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"It isn\u0027t fair. It\u0027s because I\u0027m a Solarian. No one really cares what happened to Jander and they would if I were an Auroran. It just boils down to prejudice and politics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley thought: Spacers are people. This is exactly what Jessie would say in a similar situation. And if it were Gremionis who was holding Gladia, he\u0027d say exactly what I\u0027ll say - if I knew what I would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he said, \"That\u0027s not entirely so. I\u0027m sure Dr. Fastolfe cares what happened to Jander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he doesn\u0027t. Not really. He just wants to have his way in the Legislature, and that Amadiro wants to have his way, and either one would trade Jander for his way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise you, Gladia, I won\u0027t trade Jander for anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? If they tell you that you can go back to Earth with your career saved and no penalty for your world, provided you forget all about Jander, what would you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no use setting up hypothetical situations that can\u0027t possibly come to pass. They\u0027re not going to give me anything in return for abandoning Jander. They\u0027re just going to try to send me back with nothing at all except ruin for me and my world. But, if they were to let me, I would get the man who destroyed Jander and see to it that he was adequately punished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean if they were to let you? Make them let you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley smiled bitterly. \"If you think Aurorans pay no attention to you because you\u0027re a Solarian, imagine how little you would get if you were from Earth, as I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her closer, forgetting he was from Earth, even as he said the word. \"But I\u0027ll try, Gladia. It\u0027s no use raising hopes, but I don\u0027t have a completely empty hand. I\u0027ll try - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keep saying, you\u0027ll try. - But how?\" She pushed away from him a bit to look up into his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaley said, bewildered, \"Why, I may - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find the murderer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. - Gladia, please, I must sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out for the table, leaning on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"What is it, Elijah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had a difficult day, obviously, and I haven\u0027t quite recovered, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better go to bed, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To tell the truth, Gladia, I would like to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe released him, her face full of concern and with no further room in it for tears. She lifted her arm and made a rapid motion and he was (it seemed to him) surrounded by robots at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when, he was in bed eventually and the last robot had left him, he found himself staring up at darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not tell whether it was still raining Outside or whether some feeble lightning flashes were still making their last sleepy sparks, but he knew he heard no thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew a deep breath and thought: Now what is it I have promised Gladia? What will happen tomorrow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast act: Failure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as Baley drifted into the borderland of sleep, he thought of that unbelievable flash of illumination that had come before sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e69\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwice before, it had happened. Once the night before when, as now, he was falling asleep and once earlier this evening when he had slipped into unconsciousness beneath the tree in the storm. Each time, something had occurred to him, some enlightenment that had unmystified the problem as the lightning had undarkened the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it had stayed with him as briefly as the lightning had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould it come to him again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, he tried consciously to seize it, to catch the elusive truth. - Or was it the elusive illusion? Was it the slipping away of conscious reason and the coming of attractive nonsense that one couldn\u0027t analyze properly in the absence of a properly thinking brain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe search for whatever it was, however, slid slowly away. It would no more come on call than a unicorn would in a world in which unicorns did not exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was easier to think of Gladia and of how she had felt. There had been the direct touch of the silkiness of her blouse, but beneath it were the small and delicate arms, the smooth back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould he have dared to kiss her if his legs had not begun to buckle beneath him? Or would that have been going too far?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard his breath exhale in a soft snore and, as always, that embarrassed him. He flogged himself awake and thought of Gladia again. Before he left, surely - but not if he could gam nothing for her in ret - Would that be payment for services then - He heard the soft snore again and cared less this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGladia - He had never thought he would see her again - let alone touch her - let alone hold her - hold her -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had no way of telling at what point he passed from thought to dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was holding her again, as before - But there was no blouse - and her skin was warm and soft - and his hand moved slowly down the slope of shoulder blade and down the hidden ridges of her ribs -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a total aura of reality about it. All of his senses were engaged. He smelled her hair and his lips tasted the faint, faint salt of her skin - and now somehow they were no longer standing. Had they lain down or were they lying down from the start? And what had happened to the light?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the mattress beneath him and the cover over him darkness - and she was still in his arms and her body was bare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shocked awake. \"Gladia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising inflection - disbelieving -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh, Elijah.\" She placed the fingers of one hand gently on his lips. \"Don\u0027t say anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe might as well have asked him to stop the current of his blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Don\u0027t you know what I\u0027m doing? I\u0027m in bed with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I want to.\" Her body moved against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pinched the top of his night garment and the seam that held it together fell apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t move, Elijah. You\u0027re tired and I don\u0027t want you to wear yourself out further.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElijah felt a warmth stirring within him. He decided not to protect Gladia against herself. He said, \"I\u0027m not that tired, Gladia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Rest! I want you to rest. Don\u0027t move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth was on his as though intent on forcing him to keep quiet. He relaxed and the small thought flitted past him that he was following orders that he was tired and was willing to be done to rather than to do. And, tinged with shame, it occurred to him that it rather diluted his guilt. (I couldn\u0027t help it, he heard, himself say. She made me.) Jehoshaphat, how cowardly! How unbearably demeaning!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut those thoughts washed away, too. Somehow there was soft music in the air and the temperature had risen a bit. The cover had vanished and so had his nightclothes. He felt his head moved into the cradle of her arms and pressed against softness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a detached surprise, he knew, from her position, that the softness was her left breast and that it was centered, contrastingly, with its nipple hard against his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoftly, she was singing to the music, a sleepily joyful tune he did not recognize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rocked gently back and forth and her fingertips grazed his chin and neck. He relaxed, content to do nothing, to let her initiate and carry through every activity. When she moved his arms, he did not resist and let them rest wherever she placed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not help and, when he did respond with heightened excitement and climax, it was only out of helplessness to do otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed tireless and he did not want her to stop. Aside from the sensuality of sexual response, he felt again what he had felt earlier, the total luxury of the infant\u0027s passivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, finally, he could respond no more and, it seemed, she could do no more and she lay with her head in the hollow where his left shoulder met his chest and her left arm lay across his ribs, her fingers stroking the short, curling hairs tenderly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to hear her murmuring, \"Thank you - Thank you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor what? he wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was scarcely conscious of her now, for this utterly soft end of a hard day was as soporific as, the fabled nepenthe and he could feel himself slipping away, as though his fingertips were relaxing from the edge of the cliff of harsh reality in order that he might drop - drop - through the soft clouds of gathering sleep into the slowly swaying ocean of dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as he did so, what had not come on call came of itself. For the third time, the curtain was lifted and all the events since he had left Earth shuffled once more into hard focus. Again, it was all clear. He struggled to speak, to hear the words he needed to hear, to fix them and make them part of his thought processes, but though he clutched at them with every tendril of his mind, they slipped past and through and were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that, in this respect, Baley\u0027s second day on Aurora ended very much as his first had. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-robots-of-dawn-robot-3/page-16.html","bookId":2431,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:24 PM"}
