Nothing got inside during those three days; we were sure of that, and so we thought we were safe. But we didn\u0027t stop to think-what if the dragon was already inside when we put the wards up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s the dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could take on any shape, assume any animal\u0027s form, and know all that the animal knew. A human being was an animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why couldn\u0027t it touch a human and know all the human knew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be the perfect disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we all fell for it, Keller thought. I knew there was something creepy about him, but I just put it down to him being obnoxious. And he\u0027s been here all the time, inside the wards, laughing at us, waiting for Iliana to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Iliana\u0027s with him right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller felt sure of that in her gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to throw herself against the door again, but that wouldn\u0027t do any good. She needed to be calm now, to think, because she couldn\u0027t afford to waste any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller tried to open it, looking down at a hedge of rhododendron bushes below. The sash was stuck, nailed fast. But it didn\u0027t matter. Glass was more breakable than wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped back and changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelting, flowing, jumpsuit becoming fur. Tail shooting free. Ears. Whiskers. Heavy paws thumping down. A single long stretch to get used to the new body and being on four feet instead of two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a panther, and she felt good. Strong and mean. Her muscles were like steel under her soft coat, and her big paws were twitching to bat someone silly. That dragon would be sorry he\u0027d ever messed with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a rasping yowl that she couldn\u0027t help, she gathered herself and sprang straight at the window. The full weight of her panther body hit the glass, and it shattered, and then she was flying in the cold night air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got cut. Panthers actually had thin and delicate skin compared to other animals. But she was indifferent to the pain. She landed and took off running, shaking her paws in flight to get rid of little bits of glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raced around the mansion, looking for a place to enter. Eventually, she found a low, unshuttered window, and once again, she gathered herself and jumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe landed in a sitting room with glass falling all around her onto a fine, old carpet Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Iliana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would smell them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her muzzle, smelling currents in the air. At the same time, she expanded her sense of hearing to its fullest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Iliana. She couldn\u0027t get even a whiff of her. That was bad, but she would try again from the game room, where Iliana had been last. That was where she was going anyway, because that was where Brett was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot Brett, she reminded herself as she loped through corridors and rooms. The dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raced through the ballroom and heard a scream. She barely turned her head to notice a girl standing frozen, just lifting her hand to point. The college band crashed to a halt, almost as one, except the drummer, who went on playing for a moment with his eyes shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller ignored them all, running at top speed and leaping down the stairs, her heavy front paws hitting the carpeted floor first, then her back paws hitting almost on either side of them. Each spring propelled her into the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe burst into the game room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant, she stood still, taking in the scene. She wanted to make sure with her eyes that what her ears and her nose told her was true: Iliana wasn\u0027t here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true. Winnie was missing, too, and Keller couldn\u0027t smell them anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen someone spotted her, a full-grown panther, jet black, with glowing eyes and long teeth just showing as she panted gently, standing in the doorway with her tail lashing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God!\" The voice soared over the babble. \"Look at that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone froze for an instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChaos erupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGirls were screaming. Boys were yelling. Plenty of boys were screaming, too. They saw her, and they fell over themselves, diving for the exits or for hiding places. They poured out of the room, dragging each other, sometimes trampling each other. Keller gave a loud, snarling yowl to help them on, and they scattered like chickens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only one Keller cared about was the Brett-dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and ran down a corridor. Luring her? He must be. Maybe he didn\u0027t realize she had found out yet Maybe he had some reason for continuing the charade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw her head back and gave a snarl that resounded through the house. It wasn\u0027t just anger. It was calling Nissa and Galen. If they could hear her, they would understand and come running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she took off after the dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she loped down the corridor, she changed again. This time, she couldn\u0027t just try to kill him; she needed to be able to talk. But she also needed her claws, so she changed to her half-and-half form, fur shriveling off her arms, body rearing up to run on booted feet, hair flying out behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon was almost at the end of the corridor when she jumped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knocked him down and rolled him over, straddling him. She was braced to feel the agony of the dark power crackling through her, but it didn\u0027t come. She pinned his arms and showed her teeth and screamed in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she? What did you do with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face looked back at her. It looked just like Brett, just like a human. It was sickly white, with rolling eyeballs and spittle at the corners of the mouth. The only answer she got was a moan of what sounded like terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me! Where is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-it\u0027s not my fault...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" She lifted his body and banged it down again. His head flopped on his neck like a dead fish. He looked like someone about to faint\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s in the bedroom with my parents. They\u0027re all asleep-or something-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis forehead. When she shook him, his hair flew around. It was uncharacteristically messy, but the forehead underneath was smooth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t help it He did something to my brain. I couldn\u0027t even think until a few minutes ago. I just did what he told me to do. I was like a robot! And you don\u0027t know what it was like, having him in the house the last three days, and feeling like a puppet,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand when he let go a few minutes ago, I thought I was going to be killed-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe babbling went on, but Keller\u0027s mind had disengaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had lots of thoughts all at once, like layers in a parfait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChalk up another ability for dragons: telepathic mind control. Of weak human subjects, anyway. Nissa was right* the Night World did know what had happened in the music room. The substitution was probably made right after that. They could have grabbed Jaime on her way back to class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car incident was designed to make us sympathetic and to lull our suspicions before they began. We thought of her as a victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctors at the hospital must have been controlled, too. They had to have been-they\u0027d looked at Jaime\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaime\u0027s headaches have kept her at home for the past three days, so she never had to cross the wards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana trusts Jaime implicitly and would go anywhere with her without a fight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaime wears bangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd on the last layer, rushing at her cold and sharp as crystal: Jaime is the dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaime is the dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vast, silent calm seemed to have filled Keller. She felt as if there was too much space inside her head. Very slowly, she looked down at Brett again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop talking.\" It was almost a whisper, but his gabble stopped as if she\u0027d turned off a faucet \"Now. Who\u0027s in the bedroom with your parents? Your sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, terrified. Tears spurted out of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your real sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey must have brought her in sometime, Keller thought. Certainly before we put the wards up and started checking cars, maybe even before the fake Jaime got back from the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy they\u0027d kept her alive was a mystery, but Keller didn\u0027t have time to worry about it \"Brett,\" she said, still in a careful whisper, \"what I want to know is where Iliana is. Do you know where she\u0027s been taken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe choked. \u00271 don\u0027t know. He didn\u0027t tell me anything, even when he was in my mind. But I noticed-4here were some people down in the cellar. I think they were making a tunnel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tunnel. Under the wards, of course. So we were made fools of twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to grit her teeth to keep from screaming. The floor plan of the house was a blur in her mind. She hauled Brett up by his shirt and said, \"Where\u0027s the basement door? Show me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIc-can\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved, staggering. She followed, pushing him along, until they got to a door and stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he collapsed. \"Down there. Don\u0027t ask me to go with you. I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t look at him again.\" He huddled, rocking himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller left him. Three stairs down, she bounded back up and grabbed him by the shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That phone call from Iliana\u0027s mother-does he really have the baby?\" She need to know if it came to bargaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Brett moaned in a sick voice. He was clutching his stomach as if he were wounded. \"There wasn\u0027t any phone call, but I don\u0027t know what he\u0027s been doing.\" He threw her a desperate look and whispered hoarsely, \"What is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller dropped him. \"You don\u0027t want to know,\" she said, and left him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the stairs very quietly but very quickly. Her senses were open, but the farther she went down, the less useful they were. They were being swamped by an overpowering sickly-sweet odor and by a rushing sound that seemed to fill her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time she got to the last step, her fur was bristling, and her heart was pounding. Her tail stood out stiffly, and her pupils were wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was very dark, but details of the room slowly came into focus. It was a large furnished basement, or had been. Now every piece of furniture seemed to be broken and piled in a heap in the corner. There was a raw hole in one concrete wall, a hole that opened into a black tunnel. And the sickly-sweet smell came from piles of dung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were lying on the floor all around, along with giant scratch marks that had dug grooves into the tile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire place looked like nothing so much as a huge animal\u0027s den.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t sense anything alive in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller moved toward the tunnel, fast but stealthy. Ripple, freeze. Ripple, freeze. Leopards could move this way across grassland bare of cover and not be seen. But nothing jumped out to attack her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mouth of the tunnel was wet, the soil crumbly. Keller climbed in, still moving lightly. Water dripped from the mat of roots and earth above her. The whole thing looked ready to cave in at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have made it The dragon. Goddess knows how; maybe with claws. Anyway, he wasn\u0027t too fussy about it; it was meant to be a temporary thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell was just as powerful here, and the rushing sound was even clearer. There must be an underground stream-or maybe just water pipes- very close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, girl, what are you waiting for? You\u0027re a grunt, it\u0027s your job to move! Don\u0027t stand around trying to think!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to make herself go deeper and deeper into that damp and confining place. Her senses were all useless, even sight, because the bore twisted and turned so she could never see more than a few feet ahead. She was heading blind and deaf into she had no idea what. At any moment, she might reach a shaft or a side tunnel where something could attack her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the feel of the earth above her was almost crushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease let her be alive. He doesn\u0027t need to kill her. He should try to make her join him first Please, please, don\u0027t let him have killed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter what seemed like forever, she realized that the angle of the tunnel was changing. She was heading up. Then a current of air swirled to her, barely sniffable under the thick dragon smell, and it was fresh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight air. Somewhere ahead. The end of the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new panic invaded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease don\u0027t let them have gotten away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw aside all caution and sprinted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp, up-and she could smell it clearly now. Cold air, unfouled. Up, up-and she could hear sounds. A yell that suddenly broke off. The voice sounded like-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalen! she thought, and her heart tore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she saw light Moonlight. She gathered her muscles and jumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scrambled out of the mouth of the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there, in moonlight that hurt her eyes, she saw everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car, a black Jeep, parked under a tree. The engine running but the seats empty. And in front of it, what looked like a battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were bodies everywhere. Several were vampires in black-dark ninjas. But also on the ground were the bodies of Nissa and Winnie and Galen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they followed, a distant part of Keller\u0027s mind said, not interfering in the slightest with the part that was getting ready for the fight. They followed the dragon-which must have done something to Winnie to get Iliana away from her. That was why I couldn\u0027t smell anybody; they all went into the tunnel while I was upstairs with brother Brett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t tell if they were dead. They were all tying very still, and there was blood on Winnie\u0027s head and on Nissa\u0027s right arm and back. Blood and daw marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Galen... he was sprawled out full-length, with no signs of breathing. He wasn\u0027t even a warrior. He\u0027d never had a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Keller saw something that drove the others out of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was standing near the Jeep, but frozen, as if it had just wheeled to face her. It was holding a limp figure in silvery-white casually, almost tucked under its arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it still looked like Jaime Ashton-Hughes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was wearing Jaime\u0027s pretty blue dress. Its soft brown hair blew gently about its face, and Keller could feel its dark blue eyes fixed on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were differences, too. Its skin was deadly pale, and something yellowish was oozing from a cut on its cheekbone. Its lips were drawn back from its teeth in a grinning snarl that Jaime never could have managed. And when the wind blew the soft hair off its forehead, Keller could see horns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere they were. Stubby and soft-looking-or at least soft on the outside, like downy skin over bone. They were so obviously real and yet so grotesque that Keller felt her stomach turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there were five of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book said one to three! Keller thought indignantly. And in rare cases four. But this thing has five! Five seats of shapeshifting power, not to mention the black energy, mind control, and whatever else it\u0027s been keeping up its sleeve just for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she had known that from the beginning, of course. She\u0027d known it six days ago when she first leaped for the dragon\u0027s back in the mall. But now the realization was more bitter, because not only was she dead, so was all hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t kill that thing. It\u0027s going to slaughter me as easily as the others. And then take Iliana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter. She had to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put the girl down,\" she said. She kept her half-and-half shape to say it. Maybe she could startle it by changing suddenly when she sprang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" the dragon said with Jaime\u0027s mouth. It had Jaime\u0027s voice down perfectly. But then it opened the mouth, and basso profundo laughter came out, so deep and startling that Keller felt ice down her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Keller said. \"Neither of us wants her hurt.\" While she was talking, she was moving slowly, trying to circle behind it. But it turned with her, keeping its back to the Jeep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may not,\" the dragon said. \"But I really don\u0027t care. She\u0027s already hurt; I don\u0027t know if she\u0027ll make it anyway.\" Its grin spread wider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put her down,\" Keller said again. She knew that it wouldn\u0027t. But she wanted to keep talking, keep it off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe also knew it wasn\u0027t going to let her get behind it. Panthers naturally attack from behind. It wasn\u0027t going to be an option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller\u0027s eyes shifted to the huge and ancient pine tree the Jeep was parked under. Or they didn\u0027t actually shift, because that would have given the dragon a clue. She expanded her awareness to take it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t even properly introduced ourselves-\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, in mid-sentence, she leaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-witchlight-night-world-9/page-16.html","bookId":2082,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:32:28 PM"}
