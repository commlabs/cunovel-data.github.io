And then when we comeacross three nice girls like you-well, we just natu rally want to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eget to know you better. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So if you girls play along, we can all have fun,\" Vic put in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fun-oh, no,\" Rowan said, dismayed. Jade knew she had caught part of Vic\u0027s thought and was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etryingvery hard not to pry further. \"Kestrel and Jade are much too young for anything like that. I\u0027m sorry,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebutwe have to say no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t do it even whenI amold enough,\" Jade said. \"But that isn\u0027t what these guys mean anyway\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey mean this.\" She projected some of the images she was getting from Vic into Rowan\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, dear,\" Rowan said flatly. \"Jade, you know we agreed not to spy on people like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, but look what they\u0027re thinking, Jade said soundlessly, figuring that if she had broken one rule, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emight as well break them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, look,\" Vic said in a tone that showed he knew he was losing control of the situation. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereached out and grabbed Jade\u0027s other arm, forcingher to face him. \"We\u0027re not here to talk. See?\" He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egave her a little shake. Jade studied his features a moment, then turned her head to look inquiringly into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan\u0027s face was creamy-pale against her brownhair. Jade could feel that she was sad and disap\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epointed. Kestrel\u0027s hair was dim gold and she was frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell?Kestrel said silently to Rowan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell?Jade said the same way. She wriggled as Victried to pull her loser. Come on, Rowan, he\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epinching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess we don\u0027t have any choice,Rowan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately Jade turned back to Vic. He was still trying to pull her, looking surprised that she didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseem to be coming. Jade stopped resisting and lethim drag her in close-and then smoothly detached one\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earm from his grip and slammed her hand upward. The heel of her hand made contact just under his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth clicked and his head was knocked backward, exposing his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade darted in and bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was feeling guilty and excited. She wasn\u0027t used to doing it like this, to taking down prey that was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eawake and struggling instead of hypnotized and docile. But she knew her instincts were as good as any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehunter who\u0027d grown up stalking humans in alleys. It was part of her genetic programming to evaluate\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanything she saw in terms of \"Is it food? Can I get it? What are its weaknesses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only problem was that she shouldn\u0027t been joying this feeding, because it was exactly the opposite of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat she and Rowan and Kestrel had come to Briar Creek to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was tangentially aware of activity in the backseat. Rowan had lifted the arm Todd had been using to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erestrain her. On the other side Kestrel had done the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTodd was fighting, his voice thunderstruck. \"Heyhey what are you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the freak are you doing? Who are you? What the freak are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thrashed wildly for a minute or so, and then subsided as Rowan and Kestrel mentally urged him into a trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only another minute or so before Rowan said, \"That\u0027s enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade said, Aw, Rowan ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027senough.Tell him not to remember anything about this-and find out if he knows where\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurdock Farm is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill feeding, Jade reached out with her mind,touching lightly with a tentacle of thought. Then she pulled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback, her mouth closing as if in a kiss as it leftVic\u0027s skin. Vic was just a big rag doll at this point,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand he flopped bonelessly against the steering wheeland the car door when she let him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The farm\u0027s back that way-we have to go back tothe fork in the road,\" she said. \"It\u0027s weird,\" she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadded, puzzled. \"He was thinking that he wouldn\u0027t get in trouble for attacking us because-because of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething about Aunt Opal. I couldn\u0027t get what.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably that she was crazy,\" Kestrel said unemotionally. \"Todd was thinking that he wouldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eget in trouble because his dad\u0027s an Elder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t have Elders,\" Jade said, vaguely smug.\"You mean a governor or a police officer or\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan was frowning, not looking at them. \"All right,\" she said. \"This was an emergency; we had to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now we\u0027re going back to what we agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until the next emergency,\" Kestrel said, smiling out the car window into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo forestall Rowan, Jade said, \"You think we should just leave them here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Kestrel said carelessly. \"They\u0027ll wake up in a few hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade looked at Vic\u0027s neck. The two little wounds where her teeth had pierced him were already almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclosed. By tomorrow they would be faint red marks like old bee stings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later they were on the road againwith their suitcases. This time, though, Jade was cheerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe difference was food-she felt as full of blood as a tick, charged with energy and ready to skip up\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emountains. She swung the cat carrier and her suitcase alternately, and Tiggy growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was wonderful being out like this, walking alonein the warm night air, with nobody to frown in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edisapproval. Wonderful to listen to the deer and rabbits and rats feeding in the meadows around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappiness bubbled up inside Jade. She\u0027d never felt so free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is nice, isn\u0027t it?\" Rowan said softly, lookingaround as they reached the fork in the road. \"It\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe real world. And we have as much right to it as anybody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s the blood,\" Kestrel said. \"Free-range humans are so much better than the kept ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhydidn\u0027t our dear brother ever mention that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh, Jade thought, and felt a cold wind. She glanced behind her, not looking for a car but forsomething\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emuch more silent and deadly. She realized suddenly how fragile her bubble of happiness was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going to get caught?\" she asked Rowan. Reverting, in the space of one second, to a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esix-yearold turning to her big sister for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Rowan, the best big sister in the world, said immediately and positively,\"No. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if Ash figures it out-he\u0027s the only one whomight realize-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are not going to get caught,\" Rowan said. \"Nobody will figure out that we\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade felt better. She put down her suitcase and held out a hand to Rowan, who took it. \"Together\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforever,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel, who\u0027d been a few steps ahead, glanced over her shoulder. Then she came back and put her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehand on theirs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Together forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan said it solemnly; Kestrel said it with a quicknarrowing of her yellow eyes. Jade said it with utter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edetermination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they walked on, Jade felt buoyant and cheerfulagain, enjoying the velvet-dark night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road was just dirt here, not paved. They passed meadows and stands of Douglas fir. A farmhouse\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon the left, set back on a long driveway. And finally, dead ahead at the end of the road, another house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" Rowan said. Jade recognized it, too, from the pictures Aunt opal had sent them. It had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwo stories, a wraparound porch, and a steeplypitched roof with lots of gables. A cupola sprouted out of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe rooftop, and there was a weather vane on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA real weather vane, Jade thought, stopping to stare. Her happiness flooded _back full force. \"I love it,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan and Kestrel had stopped, too, but their expressions were far from awed. Rowan looked a hairs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreadth away from horrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a wreck,\" she gasped. \"Look at that barnthe paint\u0027s completely gone. The pictures didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshow that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the porch,\" Kestrel said helpfully. \"It\u0027s fallingto pieces. Might go any minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The work,\" Rowan whispered. \"The work it would take to fix this place up ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the money,\" Kestrel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade gave them a cold look. \"Why fix it? I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s different.\" Rigid with superiority, she picked up her luggage and walked to the end of the roadThere was a ramshackle, mostly fallen-down fence around the property, and a dangerous-looking gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond,on a weed-covered path, was a pile of white pickets as if somebody had been planning to fix the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efencebut had never got around to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade put down the suitcase and cat carrier and pulled at the gate. To her surprise, it moved easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See, it may not look good, but it still works-\"She didn\u0027t get to finish the sentence properly. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egate fell on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it may not work, but it\u0027s still ours,\" she said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas Rowan and Kestrel pulled it off her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s Aunt Opal\u0027s,\" Kestrel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan just smoothed her hair back and said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a board missing from the porch steps, and several boards gone from the porch itself. Jade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elimped around them with dignity. The gate had given her a good whack in the shin, and since it was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewood,it still .hurt. In fact, everything seemed to be made of wood here, which gave Jade a pleasantly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealarmed feeling. Back home, wood was revered-,and kept outof the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have to be awfully careful to live in this kindof world, Jade thought. Or you\u0027re going to get hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan and Kestrel were knocking on the door,Rowan politely, with her knuckles, Kestrel loudly, with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe side of her hand. There wasn\u0027t any answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t seem to be here,\" Rowan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s decided she doesn\u0027t want us,\" Kestrel said, golden eyes gleaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she went to the wrong bus station,\"Jade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh-that\u0027s it. I bet that\u0027s it,\" Rowan said. \"Poorold thing, she\u0027s waiting for us somewhere, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe\u0027s going to be thinking that we didn\u0027t show up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\"Sometimes you\u0027re not completely stupid,\" Kestrel informed Jade. High praise from Kestrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let\u0027s go in,\" Jade said,to conceal howpleased she was. \"She\u0027ll come back here sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Human houses have locks,\" Rowan began, but this house wasn\u0027t locked. The doorknob\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned in Jade\u0027s hand. The three of them stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dark, even darker than the moonless nightoutside, but Jade\u0027s eyes adjusted in a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, it\u0027s not bad,\" she said. They were in ashabby but handsome living room filled with huge,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eponderous furniture. Wood furniture, of course dark and highly polished. The tables were topped with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emarble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan found a lightswitch, and suddenly the roomwas too bright. Blinking, Jade saw that the walls were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epale apple green, with fancy woodwork andmoldings in a darker shade of the same green. It made Jade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeel oddly peaceful. And anchored, somehow, as if she belonged here. Maybe it was all the heavy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efurniture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Rowan, who was looking around tall graceful body slowly relaxing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan smiled and met her eyes. She noddedonce. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade basked for a moment in the glory of having been right twice in five minutes--and then she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremembered her suitcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see what the rest of the place is like,\" she said hastily. \"I\u0027ll take the upstairs; you guys look\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just want the best bedroom,\" Kestrel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade ignored her, hurrying up a wide, carpeted flight of stairs. There were lots of bedrooms, and each\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone had lots of room. She didn\u0027t want the best, though, just the farthest away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the very end of the hall was a room painted sea-blue. Jade slammed the door behind her and puther\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esuitcase on the bed. Holding her breath, she opened the suitcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. Oh, no.Oh, no ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree minutes later she heard the click of the doorbehind her, but didn\u0027t care enough to turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"Kestrel\u0027s voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade looked up from her frantic efforts to resuscitate the two kittens she held. \"They\u0027redead!\" she wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what did you expect?

How did you expect them to make it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough two days of traveling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade sniffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rowan told you that you could take only one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade sniffled harder and glared. \"I know.That\u0027s why I put these two in the suitcase.\" She hiccuped. \"At\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleast Tiggy\u0027s all right.\" She dropped to her knees and peered in the cat carrier to make sure he was all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eright. His ears were laid back, his golden eyes gleaming out of a mass of black fur. He hissed, and Jade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esat up. He was fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For five dollars I\u0027ll take care of the dead ones,\" Kestrel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Jade jumped up and moved protectively in front of them, fingers clawed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not likethat,\" Kestrel said, offended. \"I don\u0027t eat carrion. Look, if you don\u0027t get rid of them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomehow,Rowan\u0027s going to find out. For God\u0027s sake,girl, you\u0027re a vampire,\" she added as Jade cradled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe limp bodies to her chest. \"Act like one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to bury them,\" Jade said. \"They shouldhave a funeral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel rolled her eyes and left. Jade wrapped the small corpses in her jacket and tiptoed out after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shovel, she thought. Now, where would that be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping her ears open for Rowan, shesidledaround the first floor. All the rooms looked like the living\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eroom: imposing and in a state of genteel decay. The kitchen was huge. It had an open fireplace and a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshed off the back door for washing laundry. It also had a door to the cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade made her way down the steps cautiously. Shecouldn\u0027t turn on a light because she needed both\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehands for the kittens. And, because of the kittens, she couldn\u0027t see her feet. She had to feel with her toe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor the next step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the bottom of the stairs her toe found something yielding, slightly resilient. It was blocking herpath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly Jade craned her neck over the bundle of jacket and looked down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dim here. She herself was blocking the light that filtered down from the kitchen. But she could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emake out what looked like a pile of old clothes. A lumpy pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was getting a very, very bad feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nudged the pile of clothes with one toe. It moved slightly. Jade took a deep breath and nudged it hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all one piece. It rolled over. Jade looked down, breathed quickly for a moment, and screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good, shrill, attention-getting scream. She addeda nonverbal thought, the telepathic equivalent of a siren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan! Kestrel! You guys get down here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty seconds later the cellar light went on andRowan and Kestrel came clattering down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have told you and toldyou,\" Rowan was sayingthrough her teeth. \"We don\u0027tuse our-\" She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estopped, staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s Aunt Opal,\" Jade said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-2.html","bookId":1862,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:54 PM"}
