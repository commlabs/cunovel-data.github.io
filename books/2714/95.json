I couldn’t turn him down now, not with Gamble listening in; he’d know something was up if I rejected a challenge like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too,” Hart said. His grin spread a little too wide and a little too knowingly. “Unless you have a reason why you’d have to say...no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth fell open. What a prick. He must really like Caroline, enough to fuck with me tonight in some evil plot to get her away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and mumbled, “Whatever,” because I couldn’t say no in front of Gam and no way in hell was I voicing the word yes aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the first second I had after we opened the doors and Gamble was busy at the bar, I shoved the prick from behind. “Go up to the bar where Gam can hear you and call this fucking bet off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” He looked startled. “Why would I do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I’d kill him if he didn’t. I lifted my hands and sent him an incredulous glare. “Why do you think? I can’t fucking hit on other women. I’m with someone, numb nuts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you call it off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t. Gamble will realize something fishy is going on, like I’m sleeping with his sister behind his back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you are, so—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you.” I shoved him in the chest. “We’re going to tell him. Someday. But first, I want to show him I can grow up and take care of her before I drop the big bomb. Maybe that way, he won’t kill me quite so fast when he finds out. Except playing a dumbass game to accumulate phone numbers won’t show him any such shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then call it off, man. Show him you’re growing up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growled. “Like he’ll believe that. Everyone knows I couldn’t grow up that fast. It has to be a slow progressive change to maturity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh God.” Hart rolled his eyes. “You’re giving me a headache.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved him again. “Just call off the fucking bet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept he didn’t. And so...the night started with his stupid bet itching at my conscience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any numbers yet?” Gam asked a half hour into our shift as I approached the bar with a list of drinks to fetch for customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my face to where he was watching me from behind the counter. “Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled his eyes and snapped his fingers in front of my face. “Chicks. Numbers. The bet. Any of that ring a bell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, right. Yeah, no. No numbers yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? You must be off your game tonight. Hart already has three.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does he?” I glanced around to a table where Hart was grinning down at the table of girls. The fucker. I narrowed my eyes at him before turning back to Gam. “Must be the musician thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm.” Gamble eyed me censoriously, as if he knew better. Then he folded his arms over his chest. “I was sure you’d get something from the table you just served.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I’d actually been playing in Hart’s damn game, yeah, I probably would have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back at them. “They all had boyfriends,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And how the hell could you tell that?” Gamble asked. “You barely talked to them long enough to take their drink orders much less gain relationship statuses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set my empty serving tray on top of the bar—a little too hard—and sent Gam a glare. “Why the fuck is this bet so damn important to you? Jesus, it’s like you’re trying to relive your bachelor years through me now, or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me?” Gam wrenched back at my outburst, and I realized I’d gone too far. Shit. “Christ, man. I don’t know what’s got your pussy so dry and irritable lately, but there is definitely something up with you. Now...what is going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned in to rest my elbows on the bar and then I buried my face into my hands. I just about told him everything, then. I don’t know why; I hadn’t discussed it with Caroline, but I was seriously fucking tired of keeping it from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or is it because of her?” Gamble’s question made me lift my face. I glanced over my shoulder to see Caroline passing clearance through the doorman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face drained of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, shit, shit. What was she doing here? What if she learned about the bet? What if she thought I was cool with it and had willingly volunteered to participate? What if—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus, you really do have it bad for Hamilton’s woman, don’t you?” Gamble murmured. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-95.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
