We\u0027d been at odds too much lately and Cary\u0027s warning about making sure we had as much fun as not was ever-present in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaying with the ring on Gideon\u0027s finger, I told him about the conversation I\u0027d had with my dad on Saturday and how his fellow cops had been ribbing him over the gossip about me dating the Gideon Cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, I faced him. \"It\u0027s not your fault you\u0027re news. You can\u0027t help being insanely attractive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of these days,\" he said dryly, \"I\u0027ll figure out whether my face is a curse or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if my opinion counts for anything, I\u0027m rather fond of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon\u0027s lips twitched and he touched my cheek. \"Your opinion is the only one that means anything. And your dad\u0027s. I want him to like me, Eva, not think I\u0027m exposing his daughter to invasions of her privacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll win him over. He just wants me to be safe and happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe visibly relaxed and pulled me closer. \"Do I make you happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" I rested my cheek over his heart. \"I love being with you. When we\u0027re not together, I wish we were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you didn\u0027t want to fight anymore,\" he murmured in my hair. \"It\u0027s been bugging me. Are you getting tired of me f**king up all the time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not f**k up all the time. And I\u0027ve screwed up, too. Relationships are hard, Gideon. Most of them don\u0027t have kick-ass sex like we do. I put us in the lucky column.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cupped water in his hand and poured in down my back, over and over, soothing me with its sinuous warmth. \"I don\u0027t really remember my dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" I tried to not tense up and reveal my surprise. Or my agitated excitement and desperate hunger to learn more about him. He\u0027d never talked about his family before. It killed me not to prod with questions, but I didn\u0027t want to push if he wasn\u0027t ready....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chest lifted and fell on a deep exhale. There was something in the sound of his sigh that brought my head up and ruined my intention to be cautious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my hand over his hard pectorals. \"Want to talk about what you do remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just...impressions. He wasn\u0027t around much. He worked a lot. I guess I get my drive from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe workaholism - is that a word? - is something you have in common, but that\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you know?\" he shot back, defiant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching up, I brushed the hair back from his face. \"I\u0027m sorry, Gideon, but your father was a fraud who took the easy, selfish way out. You don\u0027t have it in you to be that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that way, no.\" He paused. \"But I don\u0027t think he ever learned how to connect to people, how to care about anything but his own immediate needs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied him. \"Do you think that describes you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he answered quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I know, and it doesn\u0027t.\" I pressed a kiss to the tip of his nose. \"You\u0027re a keeper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I better be.\" His arms tightened around me. \"I can\u0027t think about you with someone else, Eva. Just the idea of another man seeing you the way I do, seeing you like this...putting his hands on you...It takes me to a dark place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not going to happen, Gideon.\" I knew how he felt. I wouldn\u0027t be able to bear it if he was intimate with another woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve changed everything for me. I couldn\u0027t stand losing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged him. \"The feeling\u0027s mutual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilting my head back, Gideon took my mouth in a fierce kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn moments it became clear we were soon going to be sloshing water all over the floor. I pulled away. \"I need to eat if you want to go at it again, fiend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Says the girlfriend rubbing her wet na**d body all over me.\" He sat back with a sinful smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s order cheap Chinese and eat it out of the box with chopsticks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s order good Chinese and do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary joined us in the living room for excellent Chinese, a sweet plum wine, and Monday night television. As we flipped channels and laughed over the hilarious names of some reality television shows, I watched as two of the most important men in my life enjoyed some relaxation time and each other. They got along well, ribbing and playfully insulting each other in that way men had. I\u0027d never seen that side of Gideon before and I loved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I hogged one whole side of our sectional sofa, the two guys sat cross-legged on the floor and used the coffee table as a dining table. Both were wearing loose sweatpants and fitted T-shirts, and I appreciated the view. Was I a lucky girl or what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCracking his knuckles, Cary dramatically prepared to open his fortune cookie. \"Let\u0027s see. Will I be rich? Famous? About to meet Mr. or Ms. Tall, Dark, and Tasty? Traveling to distant lands? What\u0027d you guys get?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine\u0027s lame,\" I said. \"In the end all things will be known. Duh. I didn\u0027t need a fortune to figure that out.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-80.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
