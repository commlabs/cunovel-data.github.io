I had been putting off so much shit because I couldn\u0027t focus in the last two weeks, and now I was behind. Tomorrow my lawyer would be sending out the letters to the former board members letting them know that they were no longer needed. I expected the shit to hit the fan but I was letting my lawyer deal with the blows. I wasn\u0027t in the mood for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Finlay here to see you, sir,\" Vince\u0027s voice said over the intercom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send him in,\" I replied. I had called Rush\u0027s father, Dean Finlay, before Della had left. I figured if I put someone on the board who was a celebrity, then it would help with the members and the town when they heard of the new board. Besides, Dean had put a lot of money into the Kerrington Club and my father had never approved of him. He\u0027d acknowledged him because he wasn\u0027t a complete fool but he hadn\u0027t liked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gotta say, Woods, you look pretty goddamn good sitting in that seat,\" Dean drawled as he sauntered into the room. He reeked of rock star, from his long hair to his tattoo-covered body and many piercings. He even had on eyeliner. The man was a legend and I had grown up with him as the father of one of my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Dean,\" I said, standing up and reaching across the desk to shake his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got me for about thirty minutes. Then I\u0027m gonna have to get back to that grandson of mine. I had to leave him all giggly and playful and that\u0027s pretty fucking hard to do. The kid\u0027s adorable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. I will make this quick,\" I assured him, and motioned for him to sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean sat down in the leather wingback chair and propped his feet up on the edge of my desk. \"What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m letting my father\u0027s board members go. They were close confidants of my father; however, I don\u0027t feel the same way about them. I have no need for a board that I can\u0027t share my ideas with and whose opinions I can\u0027t trust. I\u0027m replacing the board with people I want to have input into the future of the Kerrington Club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean held up a hand to stop me, then he cocked one dark eyebrow. \"Are you saying you fired all their uppity asses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean threw his head back and cackled with laughter. \"Damn, that\u0027s the funniest shit I\u0027ve heard in a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I could have managed a smile these days I would have smiled then. \"I want you on my board, sir. Rush will also be asked, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean dropped his feet to the floor and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, and studied me a moment. \"You want me on your board?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do. My group of friends are all young. We need wisdom on the board and you\u0027re the only man I know that I would want advising me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slow smile spread across Dean\u0027s face. \"I\u0027ll be damned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably, but I wasn\u0027t going to agree with him. I just waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell yeah, I\u0027ll be on your board. My grandson is going to grow up in this town and the Kerrington Club and the members here will be a big part of his life. I want to make sure he has the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had hoped he would feel that way. \"Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. I\u0027m honored that you will be a part of the future of the club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" he said, leaning back in his chair. \"But, Woods, if we\u0027re gonna do this, then should you stop calling me sir. Makes me sound old. I bang chicks younger than you, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might not have been able to smile but I was amused. \"I\u0027m sure you do,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was pretty damn funny. What\u0027s wrong with you, boy? I can\u0027t seem to get you to crack a smile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to talk about Della with Dean. He wouldn\u0027t understand. Like he said, he was with a different girl every night. \"Personal stuff. I\u0027m working through it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean rubbed his chin, then tilted his head as he looked at me too closely. \"It\u0027s a woman. That look is always caused by a fucking woman. Don\u0027t bother denying it. I can see it all over your face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t admit it but I didn\u0027t deny it. Instead, I dropped my eyes to the table and shifted through some paperwork. I had a contract Dean needed to sign and we needed to discuss his monthly salary, not that he needed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is she? What did she do? She getting under your skin and you\u0027re ready to run, or has she already got you on her hook and she\u0027s trying to let you go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out the contract and took my pen and pushed them across the table. \"Neither. I need you to sign the contract saying everything we discuss about the club is confidential. Your salary is listed as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean didn\u0027t lean forward and take the paper. He was still focused on me. He started to shake his head and let out a low whistle. \"Woods motherfucking Kerrington is in love. Damn, it\u0027s in the water down here. I need to get my ass back to LA. You young boys going manic over one pretty little girl. There\u0027s lots of fish. Lots of fucking beautiful fish. Why worry about one when you can have \u0027em all? Brunette on Monday and a redhead on Tuesday, twins on Wednesday, a blonde with big ole titties on Thursday, an Asian beauty on Friday, and her sister on Saturday, then on Sunday is when you get you one of each and have one big-ass party all damn day. No need to get wrapped up in just one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was very similar to a speech he\u0027d given us one summer when Rush had taken us on a road trip to see Slacker Demon in Atlanta. We had, of course, been granted backstage access and hung out with the band. It was Dean\u0027s life. I had thought it was a lonely life back then. Now that I\u0027d had Della, I knew it was a lonely life. I wasn\u0027t interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just want the one,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She must be special,\" he said, and leaned forward to pick up the pen. \"I\u0027m not signing my life away or adding you to my will, am I?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, just agreeing to keep the club\u0027s business confidential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need the money. Put it in a trust fund for Nate. Have Rush set it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d expected as much. \"Yes, sir\"---his head snapped up---\"I mean, Dean,\" I said, correcting myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Better.\" Then he stood up and slapped his hand down on the desk. \"Looks good on you, boy. Looks real good on you,\" he said, then turned and walked out of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had Dean. Now I needed to make my next call. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-21.html","bookId":1992,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
