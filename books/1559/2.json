Winston Churchill was a late bloomer and so are you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to ask her who he played for but there was something in her tone that made me know enough not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Einstein.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim I also didn’t know. Or what a late bloomer was either. But boy, did I ever want to be one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was twenty-six, my first novel, The Temple of Gold, was published by Alfred A. Knopf. (Which is now part of Random House which is now part of R.C.A. which is just part of what’s wrong with publishing in America today which is not part of this story.) Anyway, before publication, the publicity people at Knopf were talking to me, trying to figure what they could do to justify their salaries, and they asked who did I want to send advance copies to that might be an opinion maker, and I said I didn’t know anybody like that and they said, “Think, everybody knows somebody,” and so I got all excited because the idea just came to me and I said, “Okay, send a copy to Miss Roginski,” which I figured was logical and terrific because if anybody made my opinions, she did. (She’s all through Temple of Gold, by the way, only I called her “Miss Patulski”—even then I was creative.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?” this publicity lady said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This old teacher of mine, you send her a copy and I’ll sign it and maybe write a little—” I was really excited until this publicity guy interrupted with, “We were thinking of someone more on the national scene.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery soft I said, “Miss Roginski, you just send her a copy, please, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he said, “yes, by all means.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou remember how I didn’t ask who Churchill played for because of her tone? I must have hit that same tone too just then. Anyway, something must have happened because he right away wrote her name down asking was it ski or sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With the i,” I told him, already hiking through the years, trying to get the inscription fantastic for her. You know, clever and modest and brilliant and perfect, like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought me back fast. I didn’t know her first name. “Miss” was all I ever called her. I didn’t know her address either. I didn’t even know if she was alive or not. I hadn’t been back to Chicago in ten years; I was an only child, both folks gone, who needed Chicago?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Send it to Highland Park Grammar School,” I said, and first what I thought I’d write was “For Miss Roginski, a rose from your late bloomer,” but then I thought that was too conceited, so I decided “For Miss Roginski, a weed from your late bloomer” would be more humble. Too humble, I decided next, and that was it for bright ideas that day. I couldn’t think of anything. Then I thought, What if she doesn’t even remember me? Hundreds of students over the years, why should she? So finally in desperation I put, “For Miss Roginski from William Goldman—Billy you called me and you said I would be a late bloomer and this book is for you and I hope you like it. I was in your class for third, fourth and fifth grades, thank you very much. William Goldman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book came out and got bombed; I stayed in and did the same, adjusting. Not only did it not establish me as the freshest thing since Kit Marlowe, it also didn’t get read by anybody. Not true. It got read by any number of people, all of whom I knew. I think it is safe to say, however, no strangers savored it. It was a grinding experience and I reacted as indicated above. So when Miss Roginski’s note came—late—it got sent to Knopf and they took their time relaying it—I was really ready for a lift. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-2.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
