Is this for real!?” Lin Ming was shocked. This was the first time that his Flow like Silk had been resisted. The Witch Slave had actually devoured all of the Flow like Silk filaments. This proved that the defensive power of its organs, skeleton, muscles, and skin were on a completely terrifying level!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It really is a monster!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBecause of that Flow like Silk attack a moment ago, the Witch Slave seemed to be mad with anger.

As soon as the Witch Slave missed, it flick its arm and gathered the chain before firing it at Lin Ming once again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Power of Thunder!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s silver spear shined with a purple arc of lightning. The spearpoint met the chain, and that lightning arc was like a fierce purple snake that threaded up the chain and directly plunged into the Witch Slave.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCha!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Witch Slave was struck by the lightning.

If I use Thunderfire Annihilation now, then how will I cross the next three? But if I don’t use Thunderfire Annihilation, then none of my other attack methods will work against this monster; this fellow’s defensive power is simply too abnormal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Fortunately, only its defensive capabilities are unbelievable. its attack patterns are very simple and predictable, and its speed is also slow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“There’s no point in dragging this one. Once I open the Heretical God Force, I’ll be able to know if it even has any effect. However, once I use up the compressed true essence of the Heretical God Force, then it will take a long time to restore. I might as well use Thunderfire Annihilation to kill it now! As for the later trials, if my strength is not enough, then there’s nothing left to say.” Lin Ming clenched his teeth. Flashes of lightning began to flitter on his long spear, and a lotus of flame sparked into life. As the thunder and fire intersected, there was a terrifying explosive sound as if an unstoppable tide was approaching.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming shouted, and thrust out his spear towards the Witch Slave!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe roar of flame and thunder swallowed every other sound. An incomparably keen true essence flashed out like a bolt of white light as it tore through space. Thunder and fire interwove into a brilliant sphere of red and purple light that flew forwards like a blazing meteor!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Witch Slave bellowed and waved its chains to attack the glowing ball of thunder and fire.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere was a earth shattering sound just like a clap of thunder. The brilliant light was like 10,000 golden swords that shot out in all directions.

Under the effects of Golden Roc Shattering the Void, Lin Ming’s speed had reached the pinnacle!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePuff!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe spear pierced into the wound on the Witch Slave’s chest that had been opened by the Thunderfire Annihilation attack. The spear finally managed to break through the torn flesh, Flow like Silk erupted within the monster and rushed towards the heart of the Witch Slave. With a new injury added to the old, the Witch Slave gave one final roar as it unwillingly went down.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIts corpse rapidly dissolved, turning into a green energy that poured into Lin Ming’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm… this energy is…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming felt that the green energy was extremely oppressive and tyrannical. Before, whether it was the energy of blood vitality from the blood demon or the soul force from the hungry ghost, or even the vicious beast’s energy that was able to transform the strength of a human’s body, it was all very gently and effortlessly absorbed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut this green energy was extremely savage. It brutally rampaged through his body, and sent waves of agonizing pain rolling through its path.

In this smelting trial, you are the first martial artist in the last 6,000 years to pass the trial of the Witch Slave.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You do not need to fear. This energy has simply been saved up for too long; a full six millennia of time. Therefore, it is a bit overbearing. It will only transform your body; it will not bring you harm.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Six… six millennia?” \u0026nbsp;Lin Ming found it difficult to speak through the pain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yes. 6,000 years ago there was a man named Qin Yu that was able to pass the fourth level of the smelting trial. However, he was defeated in the fifth level, the Mortal trial. After he went back, he founded a vast empire in the Southern Wilderness, and was called the Feather Emperor by the people of the South.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRight… so it had already been 6,000 years since someone managed to pass through the Witch Slave trial. This wasn’t too surprising. It was only because he had accidently comprehended the Thunderfire Annihilation skill that he would have such an abnormal striking power. A normal martial artist would never be able to get past the freakish defensive capabilities of the Witch Slave.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSlowly, Lin Ming found that the green energy had fused into his skeleton. His skeleton had become denser, and his muscles had become tougher.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe physical defense had experienced a crazy increase in power.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBefore now, Lin Ming’s body strength was formidable. However, that did not mean that his defensive power was similarly formidable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor instance, an iron armored cow could easily break steel plate, and if a sharp axe were to fall on their body, it wouldn’t leave any damage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Lin Ming wanted to fend off a sword with just his bare hand, he could only rely upon his Flow like Silk technique to vibrate the weapon and send it flying away. If his fist really did meet the blade of a sword, then his hand would simply be split in two.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, Lin Ming had absorbed the green energy which had augmented his body, and he felt his body grow more solid, and his defensive capabilities increased. Now if he faced a martial artist on the level of Zhang Cang, Lin Ming believed that he wouldn’t even need to use true essence; he could simply use his own bare hand to stop the other’s attacks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming unceasingly integrated with the green energy, the aching pain he felt gradually weakened. Lin Ming’s entire body was covered in sweat, and mixed within the sweat were black, oily drops. These were clearly the impurities that were in Lin Ming’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the past, Lin Ming had taken the Golden Deer Pills to temper his body. However, that was only the lowest level of medicine used to temper one’s body; it naturally wasn’t able to be compared to something so fantastic like this green energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter his muscles and marrows were purified, Lin Ming collapsed to the ground.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYan Mo said, “After passing the fourth trial, from here on out, you will have three hours of rest between each trial. You may use that period of time to restore your body to its best condition.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I wish you good luck, smelting trial human.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Yan Mo said this, its body began to twist in space as it gradually faded away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming exhaled one long breath and plopped down on the ground.
