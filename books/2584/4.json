A scoop of eggs, half a roast potato, a slice of bread thinly coated with butter, and a cup of well water. Always a little less than he wanted, always leaving a little extra for the next person. After the first couple of hungry days, Benny began to feel good about that. Now it was his ritual. He also spent time every day working in the bean fields and fruit groves, doing unskilled grunt labor to help. It was exhausting work, but it felt good. And there was the side benefit of approaching it as exercise to reclaim his strength and muscle tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to get some of the monks working the fields to sing a few of the off-color work songs Morgie had learned from his dad, but that kite wouldn’t fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday Riot was on the other side of the mess hall, seated next to Eve, the tiny blond-haired girl Benny had rescued after they’d both fallen into a ravine filled with zoms. Eve was laughing at something Riot said, and even from that distance Benny could hear the strange, fractured quality of that laughter. The poor kid had been through too much. Reapers had raided and burned the settlement in which she’d lived and slaughtered nearly everyone. The refugees spent several mad days running through deserts and forests, only to be hunted down and sent “into the darkness.” Eve had witnessed the terrible moment when reapers cut down her father and mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monks worked with Eve every day, coaxing the little girl inch by inch out of the red shadows of her trauma, but even though there had been some progress, it was apparent that Eve might be permanently damaged. Benny was almost as worried about Riot as he was about Eve—the former reaper seemed to take it as her personal mission to “save” the girl. Benny dreaded what might happen to Riot if Eve’s fragile sanity finally collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made Benny both sad and furious, because the reapers were so much worse than the zoms. The dead were mindless, acting according to the impulses of whatever force reanimated their bodies; the reapers knew what they were doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his calmer moments, Benny tried to explore the viewpoint that the reapers actually believed that what they were doing was right, that they believed they were serving the will of their god. But he could not climb into the mind-set of a religion based on extinction. Even if the reapers believed that their god wanted everyone dead, they had no right to force that belief on everyone else. They had no right to turn the life of a child like Eve into a living horror show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo right at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” said a familiar voice behind him, and he turned, already smiling because a bad day had just gotten a whole lot better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey yourself,” he said, and leaned across the table to give Nix Riley a quick, light kiss. She was a beautiful girl with wild red hair, emerald green eyes that sparkled with intelligence, and more freckles than there were stars in the sky. A long pink scar ran from her hairline almost to her jaw, but even with that she looked young, and fresh and happy. It had been months since she looked this good. Like Eve, Nix had suffered through the absolute horror of seeing her mother murdered in front of her. Not by reapers—those killers were not yet a part of their lives—but by the brutal bounty hunters Charlie Pink-eye and the Motor City Hammer. Nix herself had been beaten and kidnapped by the pair. They were going to make her fight in the zombie pits of Gameland. Tom and Benny had rescued her, but from then on life for Nix had become a constant nightmare, running from one room in hell to another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix sat down, but caught him staring at her. “What? Do I have something on my face?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just this,” he said, and blew her a handful of kisses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are too corny for words,” she said, but she was smiling. “You were in the blockhouse a long time today. What did they talk about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix’s smile leaked away as he told her about Chong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought Lilah said that he was alive!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But . . . he tried to bite you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, so he’s sick, he’s messed up—but he’s still Chong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How? How is he still Chong? He’s totally infected, Benny. They’re keeping him in a cage, for God’s sake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny’s face grew instantly hot. “What are you saying? You think they should put him down like a dog?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not like a dog, Benny. He’s a zom and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what? They should quiet him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix sat back and folded her arms tightly across her chest. “What do you think is going to happen, Benny? Do you think that Chong is going to suddenly snap out of it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe he will!” Benny yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe he can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe you’re giving up on him, Nix. This is Chong. Chong! He’s our friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was that really Chong down in that cage? Would Chong try to take a bite out of you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny whammed the table with his fist. “He’s not a zombie, Nix. He’s sick and he needs our help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What help?” she demanded, her voice jumping a whole octave. “What can we possibly do for him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny had to fish for how to answer her. When he spoke, his voice was a hot whisper. “We need to give the scientists time to figure it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. Fine. What happens in the meantime? We go visit him like he’s a zoo animal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you being such a bitch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix stood up so suddenly that her belt buckle caught the edge of her plate and flipped it over, flinging eggs everywhere. Surprise, embarrassment, and anger warred on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Save it,” snapped Benny as he got up and stalked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made it almost all the way to the door before Nix caught up to him. He heard her coming and quickened his stride, but she ran the last few steps, caught his sleeve, and spun him around. Before he could say anything, she stuck a finger in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You listen to me, Benjamin Imura. I love Chong every bit as much as you do. I loved Tom, too. And I loved my mother—but people die. In this world, people die. Everyone dies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, thank you, Lady Einstein. Here I was thinking that everyone lived forever and every day was apple pie and puppies.” He glared at her. “I know people die. I’m not stupid, and I’m not kidding myself about how much trouble Chong’s in. Maybe he can’t come back, maybe he’s already too sick . . . but I heard him speak today, and even though it was only one word, it proves that some part of him is still there. He’s not gone yet, and I won’t give up on him. Not until there’s no hope and no chance at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Benny, I—” she began, but he shook his head and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed past some monks who were on their way into the mess hall. Behind him he heard Nix call his name, but she did not follow him outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMILES AND MILES AWAY . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name was Morgan Mitchell, but everyone called him Morgie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgie was big for his age, looking more like eighteen than fifteen. Beefy shoulders, arms heavy with muscle, and a dusting of beard smudging cheeks and chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis clothes were soaked with sweat, and his eyes were filled with shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn old truck tire hung by a rope from a limb of the big oak tree. The weathered rubber was scarred by thousands of impacts from the bokken—the wooden sword Morgie held in his hands. Each blow made the tire dance and swing, and Morgie shifted this way and that to chase it, to continue hammering it, to smash at it over and over again. The force of each blow threw echoes against the rear of the house that stood vacant and silent at the other end of the yard. The bokken was hand-carved from a piece of hickory. It was his sixth sword. The first five had cracked and broken in this yard, defeated not by the tire but by the force of the hands that swung the wood, and by the muscle in arms and shoulders and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd by pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach blow hurt. It wasn’t the shock that vibrated back from the point of impact and shivered through Morgie’s muscles and bones. It wasn’t that at all. The pain was in his heart. And he hammered at it every day. Several times a day. The training leaned him, burning away childhood fat, revealing muscles forged in a furnace of grief and regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgie knew he was being watched, but he didn’t care. It was like that all the time, almost every day. Randy Kirsch, mayor of Mountainside and former neighbor of the Imuras, sat on his porch. Two men sat with him, each of them drinking coffee from ceramic mugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two ration dollars says he breaks another sword today,” said Keith Strunk, captain of the town watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sucker’s bet,” said Leroy Williams, a big black man sitting to his left. He was a corn farmer who’d lost his right arm in a car crash after bringing a group of people through a horde of zoms after First Night. “Kid’s working on some real fury down there. He’ll break that sword or knock the tire out of the damn tree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mayor glanced at his watch. “He’s been at it for two hours now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Makes me sweat just watching him,” said Strunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all nodded and sipped their coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thump, thump, thump of the sword was constant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ever find out what happened between him and Benny?” asked Strunk. “Heard they had some kind of fight right before Tom took those kids out of town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mayor shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard it was over the girl,” said Leroy. “Little Phoenix. Remember, Morgie went courtin’ at the Riley place that night Jessie was killed. Morgie got his head near stove in by Marion Hammer. And then seven months later Nix goes off with Benny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” said Strunk. “A girl. That’ll do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all sighed and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think it’s just the girl,” said Mayor Kirsch. “I think it was that fight. I heard Morgie knocked Benny down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If they were fighting,” said Leroy, “then they were fighting over the Riley girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Strunk said, “Morgie asked me the other day if I’d let him join the town watch. When I told him he was too young, he got a job as an apprentice fence guard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugly work for a boy,” said the mayor. “And he asked me for an application to the Freedom Riders. He wants to roll out with Solomon Jones and that crew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thought you had to be eighteen for that,” said Leroy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do. But he’s trying to get a special dispensation because he trained with Tom Imura.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” said Strunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeroy grunted. “Maybe they should let him in. Tom trained those kids good . . . and besides, look at him. Kid’s bigger and tougher than any eighteen-year-old I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tom did a good job,” said Strunk as they watched Morgie hammer away at the tire. “Bet Tom would be proud of him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wooden sword whipped and flashed and pounded, again and again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBENNY WALKED ALONG THE TRENCH—well away from Lilah—until the weight of the sun’s heat slowed him to a less furious pace. Finally, drenched in sweat and feeling about as low as he could feel, he stopped, shoved his hands into his pockets, and stood there, staring across the trench at the dead. A few of them moved restlessly, but the rest stood as still as if they were the tombstones of their own graves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovement caught his eye, and Benny turned to see Riot as she walked Eve to the playground and handed her over to the head nun, Sister Hannahlily. Then Riot spotted him and came his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” she said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” said Benny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw that fuss in the dining room. You fighting with Red?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This about Chong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” said Benny. “I suppose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s pretty messed up, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s sick . . . and if you want to lecture me, too, about—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa—slow your roll, boy,” she said. “Just asked a question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Benny said slowly. “He’s in bad shape.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Red wants to put him down, is that the size of it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She know that Lilah’d skin her quick as look at her, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She knows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, where’s that leave everyone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny sighed. “In trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Life don’t never get easy, does it? It just keeps getting harder in stranger ways.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched Lilah, who had stopped pacing and now stood as silent as the dead, staring across the trench toward the blockhouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That Lilah’s a puzzle,” said Riot quietly. “I must’a tried fifty times to talk to her. Not deep conversation, just jawing about the time of day. All she did was tell me to go away. That’s it, two words. Go away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lilah’s had a really hard life,” said Benny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiot’s face took on a mocking cast. “Did she now? Well, she sure don’t hold the deed on grief and loss, son. We all been mussed and mauled by bad times. But that girl’s done gone and shut down. I met gray people with more personality.” She tapped her temple with a finger. “I’m beginning to suspect there ain’t nobody home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’ll snap out of it once they do something for Chong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiot cocked her head to one side. “Y’all really think so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” said Benny with far more certainty than he felt. In truth he was frightened for Lilah. Any gains she had made since he and Nix had found her—wild and almost unable to communicate with people—seemed to have crumbled away. And secretly, he agreed with Riot’s assessment that Lilah’s personality seemed to be . . . well, gone. She would participate in combat training, but otherwise there was nothing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fire-and-ash-benny-imura-4/page-4.html","bookId":2584,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:10:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:10:53 PM"}
