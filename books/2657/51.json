Even she’d convinced herself that marrying Fraser was her only option, that he’d provide financial salvation for her and her father, saving them from the poorhouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, Aidan would still come for her. He’d sweep her into his arms, and steal her away, telling her with a kiss that she belonged to none but him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they disembarked, and they were whisked into a carriage, and they were taken to Fraser’s property, yet there was no Aidan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The minister will be here soon,” Fraser said. He’d set her up in a dismal salon in his so-called grand Arbroath estate, which was naught but a dank, drafty seaside manor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled her arisaid tight around her shoulders. “You’ve never seen reason to take a bride before. Of all women, why me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her an oily smile. “You’ve the mind of a man, but the body of a woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe recoiled. “You don’t seem to think much of the female sex.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never seen the need for a wife before, no. But despite your plain ways, you strike me as brighter than the others. Over time, you’ll come to see how like-minded we are.” His gaze slithered down her body, then back up again. “I imagine we’ll be well matched in other ways too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d agreed to this union to save herself and her father from the poorhouse. But surely there was no worse fate than the one she faced now. “Do you expect me to take your words for a compliment?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, and to be grateful for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe no longer took pains to hide her disgust. She’d spent a lifetime being grateful for scraps, now she was expected to be thankful for casual indignities as well? This man was a louse, a scoundrel. She’d not marry him, even if it meant she’d have to end her days as a charwoman on a faraway plantation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed Aidan. Surely he’d come to stop this madness, to save her. She only hoped he’d forgive her. What she’d done was dreadful. In thinking this union was the only way to get free of debt, she’d sold Aidan short. Because they could figure anything out, if only they were together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her life would end the moment the minister arrived. He would perform the ceremony, even though the banns hadn’t been proclaimed. And then she’d be wed for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d not make a second mistake—she wouldn’t let it happen. She’d trust Aidan was coming for her, and she’d hold on until he did. She’d be a worthy pirate bride and help save herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStall him. She racked her brain for an excuse to keep Fraser talking. “What if I’ve changed my mind? What if I don’t want to marry you after all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFraser laughed. Looking bored, he stood to take a turn around the room. “You’ve no choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if I do?” As long as Aidan was alive, she had a choice. They could sail away, live off the fruits of the sea, docking in uninhabited isles and charmingly exotic ports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you thinking of someone else?” He stopped his pacing to give her a pointed look. “I assure you, I am the only man with means enough to save your family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFraser spoke the truth, and she hated him for it. In destroying her home, he’d taken her options. He stepped closer, putting words to her thoughts. “Only through our marriage will your father be spared the poorhouse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot upright in her seat. “A poorhouse you put him in yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A man does as he must,” he said with a rueful shrug. “But now I am ready to pull you from the ashes, as it were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does as he must?” Her eyes widened. “So you confess it? You set the fire?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am capable of many things. Think of it as a lesson. And I’ve another one to teach you tonight, after we’re wed.” Fraser stroked a finger down her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered and looked away, unable to bear the sight of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought she had no choice, but she did, and she would make it. The greatest of heroines endured tragedy and overcame. And so would she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thinking of our wedding night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, she strode around him to the window. “You could say that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping her back to him, she dug her fingers down the front of her bodice, tying a few extra knots into her laces. And a little insurance never hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came to stand at her back, and she gripped the sill, staring blindly out the window. He traced a finger down her spine, making her flesh crawl. “You must relax yourself, settle into the notion. I always get what I want, Elspeth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot everything he wanted. Not this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes snapped into focus. There was a boat on the horizon. Could it be Aidan? She just needed to hold on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bell rang on the floor below, and voices carried up to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The minister,” he said with a smile. Fraser proffered his arm. “Are you ready to become the Lady Fraser?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart thundered in her chest. The moment was upon her. She strained, looking back out the window, but saw nothing but a white-and-gray haze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if that were Aidan, coming for her on his sloop? She needed to wait for him. Needed to delay, for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sidled away from Fraser. “You won’t get everything you want, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression narrowed. “And what is it I’m to be denied, Elspeth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My maidenhead.” She swooped behind an armchair, bracing herself on its back as if it might guard her. “I’m no longer a virgin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I’ve gathered.” He shook his head, looking amused. “I’m no fool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even now, I might carry his child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger hardened his features. He stalked toward her. “Then we’ll find a way to slip the babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dashed to the door, leaping for the knob. “I’ll escape.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut her off, slamming and bolting it shut. “Do I need to teach you your lesson before we’re wed? I can be quite an unforgiving teacher, ready to school you all the day long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gunshot rang out. Aidan. It had to be him. He’d arrived. He was coming for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard voices raised in the hallway. She hadn’t been the only one to hear the shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think he’s coming, don’t you?” Fraser prowled closer, reaching out to grab her arm. “But he can’t save you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran to the hearth, but the only tool at hand was a bellows. She snatched it up, holding it before her like a shield. “I’ll fight you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “Little fool. The time has come. There’s no avoiding it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt like a caged animal. Her eyes flicked to the locked door. “The moment you open those doors, I’ll run.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, he began to remove his overcoat. “Then I’ll simply have to restrain you,” he said, his voice gone steely. “I’d feared this, and so borrowed a little something from our good captain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the heavy suitcase he’d been carrying and opened it. Dull metal glimmered within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShackles? “You wouldn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I do is up to you. Will you succumb willingly, or must I bind you to make you say the words I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another gunshot. The voices in the hallway grew louder. Someone jiggled the doorknob. Fraser glanced from his suitcase to the door, weighing his next move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body trembled with desperate energy. There was nothing left to her but extreme measures. It seemed Fraser wanted her to bow to him, so bow she must.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let the bellows slip from her fingers and fluttered a hand over her brow as she slumped against the back of the sofa. Inhaling deeply, she lent a dramatic quaver to her voice. “You win. I shall yield.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing eerily still, Fraser gaped at her, looking as though he didn’t trust his ears. “You surrender to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face flushed hot. Never. But she had a charade to maintain, and so forced herself to speak the words. “Yes, you may begin your … lesson, if you must.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 35\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAidan steered into Arbroath harbor, and though it was far smaller than Aberdeen’s, navigating the waterway was simple. Since it was not nearly as thriving a port, dockage was easily had—found just next to a ship he’d recognize better than his own face in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Endeavor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tied up his sloop, feeling eyes upon him. Rather than glance up, he prolonged the moment, letting the gaze bore into him, steadily going about his work. Because he knew whom he’d find when he looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d felt the gaze as a child, and recognized its stillness now. Dead eyes that’d bored into him, raking his soul. But now he was a man, and he knew who he was and what he was about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAidan glanced up, finally, his work finished. The man with the black pearl stood at the bow of his ship, docked not twenty feet away, silent as a sphinx and just as unreadable. They stared at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was his one chance. Captain Will’s crew bustled about, readying to cast off. Aidan needed to kill his enemy now—it was what he’d dreamed of doing for most his life. He could lure him away, take him in a sword fight. Aidan had spent the past thirteen years growing bigger, stronger, faster—he knew he’d best the man. Or he could watch him sail away forever, bound for God knew where, never to be seen again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could kill his enemy, or he could have Elspeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited to feel the familiar thirst for vengeance, but found the rage had burned through him. All he wanted now was his Beth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis choice was clear. Exhilaratingly simple. He’d regret not killing his enemy. But even more would he regret losing her. There was only one thing for him to do. He needed to stop her wedding, before it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he refused to lose her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Will touched a finger to his head in a mockery of a salute. Only then did their gazes unlock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAidan jogged up the harbor, scanning for a likely source of information. He needed to find Fraser’s home, and quickly. It was while a dock rat was pointing him in the right direction that he sensed the Endeavor get under way at his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll just have to avenge you in hell,” he murmured, and then raced to find Elspeth. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-own-clan-macalpin-2/page-51.html","bookId":2657,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:43 AM"}
