Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or both,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn\u0027t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\u0027s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\u0027t want everybody knowing you\u0027ve got a broomstick or they\u0027ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\u0027clock for your first training session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor McGonagall\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I\u0027ve never even touched one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You\u0027ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\u0027t allowed them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon couldn\u0027t resist it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it\u0027s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you\u0027ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they\u0027re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\u0027t afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\u0027s elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Potter\u0027s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes, that\u0027s right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\u0027s face. \"And it\u0027s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\u0027ve got it,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\u0027s obvious rage and confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn\u0027t stolen Neville\u0027s Remembrall I wouldn\u0027t be on the team...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I suppose you think that\u0027s a reward for breaking rules?\" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you weren\u0027t speaking to us?\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, don\u0027t stop now,\" said Ron, \"it\u0027s doing us so much good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\u0027d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\u0027s bedspread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs seven o\u0027clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Potter, come down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I\u0027m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\u0027ll be joining team practice three times a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\u0027s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This ball\u0027s called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\" Harry recited. \"So -- that\u0027s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s basketball?\" said Wood curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, there\u0027s another player on each side who\u0027s called the Keeper -- I\u0027m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are the Bludgers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry\u0027s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\u0027s why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it\u0027s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So -- think you\u0027ve got all that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry reeled off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good,\" said Wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never at Hogwarts. We\u0027ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\u0027s you. And you don\u0027t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-- unless they crack my head open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean, they\u0027re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it\u0027s the most important ball of the lot. It\u0027s very hard to catch because it\u0027s so fast and difficult to see. It\u0027s the Seeker\u0027s job to catch it. You\u0027ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\u0027s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\u0027s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s it, any questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won\u0027t practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"it\u0027s too dark, we might lose it. Let\u0027s try you out with a few of these.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry didn\u0027t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\u0027t carry on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Quidditch Cup\u0027ll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\u0027t gone off chasing dragons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he\u0027d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they\u0027d seen him make Neville\u0027s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry\u0027s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\u0027t spoken to either of them since the day Harry\u0027s broomstick had arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, don\u0027t forget that nice wrist movement we\u0027ve been practicing!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \u0027s\u0027 instead of \u0027f\u0027 and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon, at the next table, wasn\u0027t having much more luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It\u0027s Wing- gar -dium Levi- o -sa, make the \u0027gar\u0027 nice and long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do it, then, if you\u0027re so clever,\" Ron snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger\u0027s done it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"she\u0027s a nightmare, honestly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she heard you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must\u0027ve noticed she\u0027s got no friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione didn\u0027t turn up for the next class and wasn\u0027t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\u0027 bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\u0027s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore\u0027s wand to bring silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy was in his element.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I\u0027m a prefect!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ask me, they\u0027re supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve just thought -- Hermione.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t know about the troll.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon bit his lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy\u0027d better not see us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls\u0027 bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn\u0027t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Search me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\u0027s fading footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you smell something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn\u0027t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they\u0027d just chained up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the girls\u0027 bathroom!\" Harry gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hermione!\" they said together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\u0027t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\u0027t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll\u0027s neck from behind. The troll couldn\u0027t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry\u0027s wand had still been in his hand when he\u0027d jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll\u0027s nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe club flew suddenly out of the troll\u0027s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\u0027s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Hermione who spoke first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it -- dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" said Harry, I think it\u0027s just been knocked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\u0027s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Urgh -- troll boogers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiped it on the troll\u0027s trousers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn\u0027t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\u0027s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \"You\u0027re lucky you weren\u0027t killed. Why aren\u0027t you in your dormitory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Granger!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I\u0027ve read all about them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they hadn\u0027t found me, I\u0027d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\u0027t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\u0027t new to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well -- in that case... \" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I\u0027m very disappointed in you. If you\u0027re not hurt at all, you\u0027d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hurried out of the chamber and didn\u0027t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five, you mean, once she\u0027s taken off Hermione\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind you, we did save her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She might not have needed saving if we hadn\u0027t locked the thing in with her,\" Harry reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pig snout,\" they said and entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\u0027t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone-harry-potter-1/page-10.html","bookId":1563,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:29 PM"}
