But as they sailed past the rocks of a ness, a certain man hailed the ships, and asked who was captain over that navy; then was it told him that the chief and lord was Sigurd, the son of Sigmund, the most famed of all the young men who now are.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then said the man, “Naught but one thing, certes do all say of him, that none among the sons of kings may be likened unto him; now fain were I that ye would shorten sail on some of the ships, and take me aboard.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then they asked him of his name, and he sang —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hnikar I hight,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When I gladdened Huginn,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And went to battle,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bright son of Volsung;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now may ye call\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The carl on the cliff top,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Feng or Fjolnir:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fain would I with you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They made for land therewith, and took that man aboard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then quoth Sigurd,33 as the song says —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Tell me this, O Hnikar,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Since full well thou knowest\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fate of Gods, good and ill of mankind,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What best our hap foresheweth,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When amid the battle\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e About us sweeps the sword edge.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Quoth Hnikar —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good are many tokens\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If thereof men wotted\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the swords are sweeping:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fair fellow deem I\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The dark-winged raven,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In war, to weapon-wielder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The second good thing:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When abroad thou goest\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For the long road well arrayed,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Good if thou seest\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Two men standing,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fain of fame within the forecourt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A third thing:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Good hearing,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The wolf a howling\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Abroad under ash boughs;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Good hap shalt thou have\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dealing with helm-staves,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If thou seest these fare before thee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No man in fight\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His face shall turn\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Against the moon’s sister\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Low, late-shining,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For he winneth battle\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Who best beholdeth\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Through the midmost sword-play,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the sloping ranks best shapeth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Great is the trouble\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of foot ill-tripping,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When arrayed for fight thou farest,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For on both sides about\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Are the Disir 34 by thee,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Guileful, wishful of thy wounding.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Fair-combed, well washen\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Let each warrior be,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nor lack meat in the morning,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For who can rule\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The eve’s returning,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And base to fall before fate grovelling.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the storm abated, and on they fared till they came aland in the realm of Hunding’s sons, and then Fjolnir vanished away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then they let loose fire and sword, and slew men and burnt their abodes, and did waste all before them: a great company of folk fled before the face of them to Lyngi the King, and tell him that men of war are in the land, and are faring with such rage and fury that the like has never been heard of; and that the sons of King Hunding had no great forecast in that they said they would never fear the Volsungs more, for here was come Sigurd, the son of Sigmund, as captain over this army.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So King Lyngi let send the war-message all throughout his realm, and has no will to flee, but summons to him all such as would give him aid. So he came against Sigurd with a great army, he and his brothers with him, and an exceeding fierce fight befell; many a spear and many an arrow might men see there raised aloft, axes hard driven, shields cleft and byrnies torn, helmets were shivered, skulls split atwain, and many a man felled to the cold earth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now when the fight has long dured in such wise, Sigurd goes forth before the banners, and has the good sword Gram in his hand, and smites down both men and horses, and goes through the thickest of the throng with both arms red with blood to the shoulder; and folk shrank aback before him wheresoever he went, nor would either helm or byrny hold before him, and no man deemed he had ever seen his like. So a long while the battle lasted, and many a man was slain, and furious was the onset; till at last it befell, even as seldom comes to hand, when a land army falls on, that, do whatso they might, naught was brought about; but so many men fell of the sons of Hunding that the tale of them may not be told; and now whenas Sigurd was among the foremost, came the sons of Hunding against him, and Sigurd smote therewith at Lyngi the king, and clave him down, both helm and head, and mail-clad body, and thereafter he smote Hjorward his brother atwain, and then slew all the other sons of Hunding who were yet alive, and the more part of their folk withal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now home goes Sigurd with fair victory won, and plenteous wealth and great honour, which he had gotten to him in this journey, and feasts were made for him against he came back to the realm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But when Sigurd had been at home but a little, came Regin to talk with him, and said —\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Belike thou wilt now have good will to bow down Fafnir’s crest according to thy word plighted, since thou hast thus revenged thy father and the others of thy kin.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sigurd answered, “That will we hold to, even as we have promised, nor did it ever fall from our memory.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1417/42500.html","bookId":1390,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:12:08 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:12:08 AM"}
