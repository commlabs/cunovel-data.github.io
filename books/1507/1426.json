One, for example, was the Green Coffin Vortex. In such locations, the magical laws of the Vast Expanse were different, making it difficult for cultivators to enter them, even 9-Essences experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Meng Hao hadn\u0027t known it originally, he came to be aware that such places were said to be created by Transcendent cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly someone who had Transcended could create a location that could cause problems for 9-Essences Paragons. Furthermore, such locations were few and far between in the Vast Expanse; there were only a few in existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupposedly, some of those locations were related to the Vast Expanse Society. Others were connected to the Immortal God Continent. The rest had to do with the Devil Realm. Apparently... all the forces which had produced a Transcendent cultivator were connected to such places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome such places were well known, while others were kept secret by various powerful factions, and held their respective organizations’ greatest secrets. They were secrets that wouldn’t necessarily endanger those groups if they came to be known, but were kept hidden anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Vast Expanse’s necropolis was just such a place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exact location of the necropolis was unknown, and the only way to enter it was via the nine altars on the half-planet of the Vast Expanse School.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, people had speculated that the necropolis was not even located within the starry sky of the Vast Expanse. Some said that it was a location in some other world... where there was no Heavenly Dao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupposedly, the reason there was no Heavenly Dao was because magical techniques were thrown into chaos in such places. Sometimes, certain magics couldn’t even be used. For example, some locations were places incompatible with the aura of the Vast Expanse, which some people cultivated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Meng Hao and the others appeared, he looked around and saw a starry sky stretching out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a real and true starry sky, with none of the mist that was pervasive in the Vast Expanse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were nine land masses floating out in front of them. Upon closer examination, it was possible to see that they were connected by bridges, although the bridges were not stable; they were constantly swaying and swinging back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurrounding the nine land masses was a seemingly infinite field of drifting asteroids. Occasionally, they would emit strange fluctuations which provoked sensations of intense danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no paths visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now that we’re here, we don’t have much time,” said the Sect Leader. “Only one month. Follow me, and be careful not to lose your way. Don’t interact with anything you see, whether it\u0027s a painting or a person or anything else. If you do... even those of you with nine Essences will perish.” With a final look at everyone, he flickered into motion as he flew out into the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone else followed along as if they had done so before. Meng Hao was the only one who seemed more cautious than ever as he followed along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis two subordinate Paragons followed him, looking around vigilantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group was soon speeding along through the asteroids. The Sect Leader seemed to have mastered some method of travel that ensured they didn\u0027t encounter any restrictive spells. Nor did any of the floating asteroids enter their path of travel. However, the result was that the Sect Leader’s face was a bit pale. His eyes shone with the glow of augury; clearly, leading the group in this way was not an easy task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime passed. Four hours later, Meng Hao noticed one of the 8-Essences Paragons up ahead suddenly stop in place and turn to the side with an expression of shock and disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis man could shake the Vast Expanse with a single stomp of a foot, and would count as the pinnacle of existence in virtually any world or Realm. And yet, before anyone could warn or remind him of the dangers of the place, his body deflated like a popped balloon. In the blink of an eye, he withered up into a pile of dessicated flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis bones, flesh, and everything about him melted, and then vanished without a trace. Not even his soul had a chance to flee. He died without even making a cry of alarm....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing left behind was his skin, which slowly floated away into the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was completely shaken, and everyone else felt their scalps tingling in shock. No one spoke. As they watched the pile of skin float away, laughter could suddenly be heard, at which point they noticed that, unexpectedly, the pile of skin was smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you want to stay alive, don\u0027t randomly look around,” the Sect Leader said. “Keep your eyes on the person in front of you. We will follow this path for three days, and if all goes well, we will pass through this perimeter region into the first land of the Patriarch’s necropolis.” With that, he proceeded onward without another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao said nothing, but his eyes flickered. Then, he proceeded along, keeping his eyes on the cultivator in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime passed. A day later, and after a bit of calculation, Meng Hao came to the conclusion that they had already traveled seventy percent of the distance, and that they would soon be nearing the first land mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the most part, the journey was frightening but not dangerous. However, another 8-Essences Paragon died. He wasn’t transformed into a pile of flesh. Instead, he began to suddenly rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, he didn’t notice. Then the person behind him cried out in alarm. The 8-Essences Paragon spun around, and when he looked down at his body, his eyes fell out of their sockets. Everyone watched as he dissolved into a mass of blood that dropped down into the depths below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao\u0027s vigilance grew. The surrounding asteroids would occasionally pulse with a faint light, and yet everything was absolutely silent. As silent as death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sect Leader moved slower and slower, until finally it reached the point where he needed to make long calculations before each movement. After a bit of observation, Meng Hao came to the conclusion that the Sect Leader’s methods of augury and calculation had to do with the movement patterns of the asteroids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he contemplated the matter, a cry of alarm could be heard behind him from Su Yi. Meng Hao spun and saw the beautiful Xin Yue, head turned to the side, expression blank as she apparently spoke to some unseen person. Her expression flickered, and then she nodded, and a rapturous look of joy appeared on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she nodded, her body began to wither up. Meng Hao frowned, reached out, and tapped her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremor ran through her, and the withering slowed but didn\u0027t cease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSu Yi’s expression flickered with anxiety, and she was about to unleash some sort of magic to provide aid, when suddenly her expression also turned blank. She turned to the side in disbelief, then reached out into the void as if to grab something. Then she also started to wither up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao\u0027s frown deepened, and he quickly opened his Dao eye. His aura spread out, turning into a vortex that swept out in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the Sect Leader and the other Paragons turned to look at what was happening. The Sect Leader’s face fell, and after a moment of hesitation, he gritted his teeth and made his way toward Meng Hao. The other Paragons’ faces flickered with hesitation, but seeing that the Sect Leader was approaching, they did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before anyone could get close, Meng Hao suddenly raised his hand and said, “Stay back. I should be able to handle this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression was somber, and even as he spoke, a murderous aura began to rise up from him, which rapidly turned into a raging tempest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sect Leader and the other Paragons were people who were no strangers to slaughter. However, after seeing Meng Hao’s murderous aura, their pupils constricted. That was especially true of the Sixth Paragon, who gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a murderous aura so intense that ordinary people couldn’t compare to it. Not even this group of Paragons contained someone who came close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many people has he killed...?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve never met someone who has slaughtered so many!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this Ninth Paragon some sort of jinx, or what...?” Both the 9-Essences Paragons and their 8-Essences subordinates were all completely shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” thought the Sect Leader, “he really is... Meng Hao!” It was as if that murderous aura which surrounded Meng Hao contained innumerable screaming souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments ago….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s face was very serious as he looked around with his third eye, and saw a completely different world!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the void of the starry sky was an enormous city. The asteroids around them were actually buildings in that city, and the entire place looked incredibly ancient, as if it couldn\u0027t even exist in modern times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat left Meng Hao even more shaken was that, unexpectedly... they were surrounded by countless figures. There were men and women, old and young, and all of them were cultivators. They were everywhere, and although most of them were simply walking to and fro, some would occasionally turn to look curiously at Meng Hao and the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figures were blurry, their faces pale, their bodies devoid of life force. In fact, what filled the entire area was a boundless aura of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral women were standing next to Xin Yue, smiling as they tugged at her garments. It was as if they were trying to get her to become one of them. The same thing was happening to Su Yi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShockingly, there were even some figures next to Meng Hao who were reaching out to grab him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath as he realized that this place... was actually a Ghost City!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering the level of his cultivation base, he was able to tell that all of these figures were ghosts, and there were so many of them that it would be impossible to count their number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brief moment after Meng Hao’s third eye opened and he looked around, all of the ghosts in the entire city stopped what they were doing and turned to look at him. Countless gazes came to be fixed on Meng Hao, whereupon strange glows rose up in their eyes. Only a brief moment passed before they began to scream noiselessly, and then rush madly toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be surrounded by so many ghosts left even Meng Hao feeling like he had fallen victim to a curse; his life force was fading, and an aura of death was threatening to engulf him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the moment in which his murderous aura suddenly erupted out fully, creating a vortex which swept out in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1422\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1424\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1423","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
