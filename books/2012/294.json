Instead, you deliver me … home.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed on her, suspicious – as he knew he would always be, with this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Join your kin, Nimander. There is little time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What of you?’ he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhaed seemed to soften before his eyes. ‘A mother will sit in a tower, awaiting her son. She will keep the door locked. She will wait for the sound of boots upon the stairs. I go to keep her company.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Phaed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost smiled. ‘Shall we call this penance, brother?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlows rang, skittered off his armour, and beneath the banded ribbons of iron, the scales and the chain, his flesh was bruised, split and crushed. Withal swung his mace, even as a spear point gouged a score above the rim of his helm, twisting his head round. He felt a shield shatter beneath his attacking blow, and someone cried out in pain. Half blinded – blood was now streaming down the inside of his helm, clouding the vision of his left eye – he pushed forward to finish the Liosan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he was shield-bashed from the side. Stumbling, tripping in a tangle of dead limbs, Withal fell. Now I’m in trouble .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Liosan loomed over him, thrust down with his sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange black flash, blocking the blow – a blur, and the Liosan howled in agony, toppling back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrouching now over Withal, a half-naked woman, her muscles sheathed in sweat, an obsidian knife in one hand, dripping blood. She leaned close, her face pressing against the visor’s bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Thief!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What? I – what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My armour! Your stole it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I didn’t know—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But you stood long – and there’s more standing ahead, so get off your arse!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grasped him by the collar of his hauberk, and with one hand pulled him to his feet. Withal staggered for balance. Brought his shield round and readied the mace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were surrounded. Fighting to the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverhead, two black dragons – where in Hood’s name did they come from? – were at the centre of a storm of white- and gold-hued dragons. They were torn, shredded, hissing like gutted cats, lashing out in fury even as they were being driven down, and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe half-naked woman fought beside him with serpentine grace, her ridiculous obsidian knives whispering out like black tongues, returning wet with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfusion roared through Withal. This woman was a stranger – but that was impossible. Through the grille of his visor, he shouted, ‘Who in Hood’s name are you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharl sank back, knees folding, and suddenly she was lying on the ground. Figures crowded above her, twisted faces, thrusting spear shafts, feet fighting for purchase. She’d lost her sword, and blood was welling from somewhere below her rib cage. Her fumbling fingers probed, found a puncture that went in, and in. ‘Ah, I am slain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can you breathe? Take a breath, woman! A deep breath, and that’s an order!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘C-captain?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You heard me!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharl couldn’t see her – somewhere behind her head – and her voice was barely recognizable, but who else would it be? Who else could it be? The ground trembled beneath her. Where was that trembling coming from? Like a thousand iron hearts. Beating. Beating . She drew fetid air into her lungs. Deeper, and deeper still. ‘Captain! I can breathe!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then you’ll live! Get up! I want you with me – till the end, y’understand?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharl tried to sit up, sank back in gasping pain. ‘Been stabbed, Captain—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s how y’get into this damned club! Stand up, damn you!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled on to her side – easier this way to draw up her legs, to make her way to her hands and knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrevity was gasping out words. ‘Girl without a friend … Nothing worse! Know what happens when a girl’s got no friend?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Captain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They get married!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharl saw a sword nearby – a corpse was gripping it. She reached out and prised the weapon free. ‘All right, Captain,’ she said, ‘I’ll be your friend.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Till the end?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Till the end.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Swear it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I swear! I swear!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand reached under an armpit, lifted her up. ‘Steady now, love. Let’s go kill us some men.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZevgan Drouls had killed his debt-holder, and then the bastard’s whole family. Then he had burned down the estate and with it all the records of the hundreds of families swindled into indebtedness by a man who thought he had the right to do whatever he damn well pleased with as many lives as he could chain and shackle. Zevgan had gone on to burn down the bank, and then the Hall of Records – well, only half of it, to be sure, but the right half. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-294.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
