His gaze was intense - intensely hot, intensely focused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feel of his lips against my skin sent goose bumps racing up my arm and stirred memories of that sinful mouth on other parts of my body. I was instantly aroused. \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmusement warmed his eyes. \"Hi, yourself. You look amazing. I can\u0027t wait to show you off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed through the delight I felt at the compliment. \"Let\u0027s hope I can do you justice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight frown knit the space between his brows. \"Do you have everything you need?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary appeared beside me, carrying my black velvet shawl and opera length gloves. \"Here you go. I tucked your gloss into your clutch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the best, Cary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winked at me - which told me he\u0027d seen the condoms I had tucked into the small interior pocket. \"I\u0027ll head down with you two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon took the shawl from Cary and draped it over my shoulders. He pulled my hair out from underneath it and the feel of his hands at my neck so distracted me, I barely paid attention when Cary pushed my gloves into my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator ride to the lobby was an exercise in surviving acute sexual tension. Not that Cary seemed to notice. He was on my left with both hands in his pockets, whistling. Gideon, on the other hand, was a tremendous force on the other side of me. Although he didn\u0027t move or make a sound, I could feel the edgy energy radiating from him. My skin tingled from the magnetic pull between us, and my breath came short and fast. I was relieved when the doors opened and freed us from the enclosed space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo women stood waiting to get on. Their jaws dropped when they saw Gideon and Cary, and that lightened my mood and made me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies,\" Cary greeted them, with a smile that really wasn\u0027t fair. I could almost see their brain cells misfiring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, Gideon gave a curt nod and led me out with a hand at the small of my back, skin to skin. The contact was electric, sending heat pouring through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed Cary\u0027s hand. \"Save a dance for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always. See you in a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA limousine was waiting at the curb, and the driver opened the door when Gideon and I stepped outside. I slid across the bench seat to the opposite side and adjusted my gown. When Gideon settled beside me and the door shut, I became highly conscious of how good he smelled. I breathed him in, telling myself to relax and enjoy his company. He took my hand and ran his fingertips over the palm, the simple touch sparking a fierce lust. I shrugged off my shawl, feeling too hot to wear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva.\" He hit a button and the privacy glass behind the driver began to slide up. The next moment I was tugged across his lap and his mouth was on mine, kissing me fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did what I\u0027d wanted to do since I saw him in my living room: I shoved my hands in his hair and kissed him back. I loved the way he kissed me, as if he had to, as if he\u0027d go crazy if he didn\u0027t and had nearly waited too long. I sucked on his tongue, having learned how much he liked it, having learned how much I liked it, how much it made me want to suck him elsewhere with the same eagerness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were sliding over my bare back and I moaned, feeling the prod of his erection against my hip. I shifted, moving to straddle him, shoving the skirt of my gown out of the way and making a mental note to thank my mom for the dress - which had such a convenient slit. With my knees on either side of his hips, I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and deepened the kiss. I licked into his mouth, nibbled on his lower lip, stroked my tongue along his...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon gripped my waist and pushed me away. He leaned into the seat back, his neck arched to look up at my face, his chest heaving. \"What are you doing to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my hands down his chest through his dress shirt, feeling the unforgiving hardness of his muscles. My fingers traced the ridges of his abdomen, my mind forming a picture of how he might look naked. \"I\u0027m touching you. Enjoying the hell out of you. I want you, Gideon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught my wrists, stilling my movements. \"Later. We\u0027re in the middle of Manhattan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one can see us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not the point. It\u0027s not the time or place to start something we can\u0027t finish for hours. I\u0027m losing my mind already from this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So let\u0027s make sure we finish it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grip tightened painfully. \"We can\u0027t do that here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Then a surprising thought struck me. \"Haven\u0027t you ever had sex in a limo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" His jaw hardened. \"Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking away without answering, I saw the traffic and pedestrians surging around us. We were only inches away from hundreds of people, but the dark glass concealed us and made me feel reckless. I wanted to please him. I wanted to know I was capable of reaching into Gideon Cross, and there was nothing to stop me but him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rocked my h*ps against him, stroking myself with the hard length of his cock. His breath hissed out between clenched teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you, Gideon,\" I said breathlessly, inhaling his scent, which was richer now that he was aroused. I thought I might be slightly intoxicated, just from the enticing smell of his skin. \"You drive me crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released my wrists and cupped my face, his lips pressing hard against mine. I reached for the fly of his slacks, freeing the two buttons to access the concealed zipper. He tensed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need this,\" I whispered against his lips. \"Give me this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t relax, but he made no further attempts to stop me either. When he fell heavily into my palms, he groaned, the sound both pained and erotic. I squeezed him gently, my touch deliberately tender as I sized him with my hands. He was so hard, like stone, and hot. I slid both of my fists up his length from root to tip, my breath catching when he quivered beneath me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-26.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
