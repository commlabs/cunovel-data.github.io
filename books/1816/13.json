Morning sex contributed to that, of course. Also the sight of Gideon getting dressed for the day, watching him transform from the private man I knew and loved into the dark and dangerous global magnate. The day only got better when I exited on the twentieth floor and saw Megumi sitting at her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved at her through the glass security doors, but my smile faded the moment I got a good look at her. She was pale and had dark circles under her eyes. Her usually sassy asymmetrical haircut looked limp and overlong, and she was wearing a long-sleeved blouse and dark slacks that were out of place with the August mugginess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” I greeted her when she buzzed me through. “How are you? I’ve been worried about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a weak smile. “I’m sorry I didn’t call you back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry about it. I’m totally antisocial when I get sick. I just want to curl up in bed and be left alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lower lip quivered and her eyes grew shiny with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” I glanced around, worried about her privacy as other employees passed through the reception area. “Did you see a doctor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorrified, I stood frozen for a minute. “Megumi. What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled off her headset and stood, tears spilling down her face. She shook her head violently. “I can’t talk about it now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When is your break?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was already hurrying to the bathroom, leaving me staring after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed to my cubicle and dropped off my bag, then went down the hall to Will Granger’s desk. He wasn’t there, but I found him in the break room when I stopped to grab some coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, you.” His eyes behind his square-framed glasses looked as worried as I felt. “Did you see Megumi?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. She looks wiped out. And she started crying when I asked how she’s doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid the carton of half-and-half over to me. “Not good, whatever it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m bad with not knowing. My imagination runs wild. I’m bouncing between cancer, pregnancy, and everything in between.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill shrugged helplessly. With his neatly trimmed sideburns and subtly quirky-patterned shirts, he was the sort of affable and easy-natured guy who was hard to dislike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva.” Mark stuck his head in the door. “I’ve got news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy boss’s bright eyes told me he was excited about something. “I’m all ears. Coffee?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Thanks. See you in my office.” He ducked back out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill grabbed his mug off the counter. “Have a good one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left. I hurried to get the coffee ready, then went to Mark’s office. He’d taken his jacket off and was studying something on his monitor. He looked up, smiling when he saw me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve got a new RFP request.” His smile widened. “And they asked for me specifically.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tensed. Setting his coffee down, I asked warily, “Is it another Cross Industries product?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as I loved Gideon and admired all that he’d accomplished, I didn’t want to be totally overshadowed by his world. Part of who we were as a couple was two people who had separate working lives. I enjoyed riding to work with my husband, but I needed to say good-bye to him, too. I needed those few hours when he didn’t consume me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it’s bigger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brows rose. I couldn’t think of anything or anyone bigger than Cross Industries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark slid a picture of a silver-and-red box across the desk to me. “It’s the new PhazeOne gaming system from LanCorp.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI settled into the seat in front of his desk with an inner sigh of relief. “Sweet. Sounds fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT was a little after eleven when Megumi called to see if I was free for lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someplace quiet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered our options. “I’ve got an idea. Leave it to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great. Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat at my desk. “How’s your morning been?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Busy. I have to get caught up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me know if I can help with anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Eva.” She took a deep, shaky breath, her composure slipping. “I appreciate you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hung up. I called Gideon’s office, and his secretary answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Scott. It’s Eva. How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m good.” I could hear the smile in his voice. “What can I do for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet tapped restlessly. I couldn’t help but be worried about my friend. “Could you ask Gideon to give me a call when he has a free minute?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll put you through now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Okay, great. Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hang on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later I heard the voice I loved. “What do you need, Eva?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was startled for a minute by his brusqueness. “Are you busy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m in a meeting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck. “My bad. Bye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up, and then called Scott again to discuss how we should handle calls in the future so I didn’t come out looking like an ass. Before he answered, the secondary line flashed with an incoming call. I switched over. “Mark Garrity’s office—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t ever hang up on me,” Gideon snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bristled at his tone. “Are you in a meeting or not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was. Now I’m dealing with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell if anyone was going to “deal” with me. I could be as pissy as him any day of the week. “You know, I asked Scott to give you a message when you had time for it and he patched me through. He shouldn’t have done that, if you were busy with—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He has standing orders to always connect your calls. If you want to leave me a message, send a text or an e-mail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, excuse me for not knowing the etiquette for getting in touch with you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind that now. Say what you need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing. Forget it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhaled roughly. “Don’t play games with me, angel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was reminded of the last time I’d called him at work and how off he’d sounded then, too. If something was bugging him, he sure wasn’t sharing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hunched over my desk and lowered my voice. “Gideon, your attitude pisses me off. I don’t want to deal with you when you’re aggravated. If you’re too busy to talk to me, you shouldn’t have standing orders that interrupt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m never going to be unreachable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? ’Cause you seem that way right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For fuck’s sake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing his exasperation gave me a surge of satisfaction. “I didn’t text you because I didn’t want to bother you in a meeting. I didn’t send an e-mail, because it’s a time-sensitive favor and I don’t know how often you get to your inbox. I figured a message with Scott would get the job done best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now you have my complete attention. Tell me what you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to get off the phone, and I want you to get back to your meeting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What you’re going to get,” he said, with dangerous evenness, “is me at your desk if you don’t cut the shit and explain why you called.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at his photo. “You make me want to find a job in New Jersey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You make me crazy.” He growled softly. “I can’t function when we’re fighting, you know that. Just say what you need, Eva, and forgive me for now. We can argue and have makeup sex later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tension left me. How could I stay mad at him after he admitted how vulnerable I could make him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn you,” I muttered. “I hate when you get reasonable after irritating me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a low sound of reluctant amusement. I instantly felt better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Angel mine.” His voice took on the sexy, raspy warmth I needed to hear. “Definitely not a quiet, comfortable ornament.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry about it. You’re perfect. Tell me why you called.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that tone. I’d turned him on somehow. “You’re a maniac. Seriously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway, ace, I wanted to see if I could borrow one of your conference rooms for lunch with Megumi. She’s back, but she’s a mess and I think she wants to talk about it but there’s really not a good place to go nearby that’s private and quiet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Use my office. I’ll have something ordered in and you’ll have the space to yourself while I’m out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For real?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. However, I have to remind you that when you work for Cross Industries you’ll have your own office to lunch in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head fell back. “Shut up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE research involved in prepping for the PhazeOne RFP kept me hopping, but I was antsy for information from Megumi, so the hour seemed to drag anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met up with her at the reception desk at noon. “If it’s not too weird,” I said, as she pulled her purse out of a drawer, “we’re going to use Gideon’s office for lunch. He’s out and it’s private.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh man.” She shot me an apologetic look. “I’m sorry, Eva. I should’ve congratulated you. Will told me about your engagement, but I spaced.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s totally okay. Don’t worry about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out and squeezed my hand. “I’m really happy for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy concern deepened. Megumi always followed the latest gossip. The friend I knew would’ve heard about the engagement almost before I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took an elevator to the top floor. The Cross Industries vestibule was as striking as Gideon himself. It was much bigger than others in the building and decorated with lilies and ferns in hanging baskets. CROSS INDUSTRIES was etched into the smoked-glass security doors in a masculine but elegant font.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Impressive,” Megumi murmured, as we waited for the receptionist to buzz us through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe redhead I was used to seeing at the reception desk must have been out to lunch, because a guy with dark hair let us in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood when we approached. “Good afternoon, Miss Tramell. Scott said you should just go right in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has Mr. Cross left?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure. I just took over here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. Thank you.” I led Megumi back. We rounded the corner to reach Gideon’s office just in time to see him stepping out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFierce pride and possession moved me. Pleasure, too, when his stride faltered just a bit when he saw me. We met each other halfway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” I greeted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a nod in return and held his hand out to Megumi. “I don’t think we’ve been officially introduced. Gideon Cross.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Megumi Kaba.” She gave him a firm shake. “Congratulations to you and Eva.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ghost of a smile touched his sexy mouth. “I’m a lucky man. Make yourselves comfortable. If you need anything, just call up to reception and Ron will see to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll be fine,” I told him. “You won’t even know we had a raging party in there while you’re gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled outright. “Good. I have a meeting later. Shot glasses and streamers would be interesting to explain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expected him to head out. Instead, he cupped my face, tilted my head to the angle he wanted, and pressed his lips to mine in an unhurried, chaste kiss that left me with little stars in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he whispered in my ear, “Looking forward to making up later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy toes curled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling back, he slid easily into the reserved persona he showed the rest of the world. “Enjoy your lunch, ladies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked away with the confident, innately sexual stride that turned heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re still standing upright,” Megumi murmured, shaking her head. “Kills me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t explain how weak Gideon made me. How shaken and needy I could so easily become. “Come on,” I said breathlessly. “Let’s eat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed me into Gideon’s office. “I don’t think I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she took in the sprawling space with its panoramic views and monochromatic color scheme, I went to the bar, where lunch awaited us. I remembered how I’d felt the first time I walked into the room. Despite the multiple seating areas that might have invited guests to sit and stay awhile, the progressively contemporary, cutting-edge design kept visitors from getting too comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were so many sides to the man I’d married. His office reflected only one. The classically European style of his penthouse reflected another. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/captivated-by-you-crossfire-4/page-13.html","bookId":1816,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:14 PM"}
