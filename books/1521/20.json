As ever, much remained unsaid between the two friends and soldiers. \"Fabius, I could get used to you helping to save my life. I may have to write a poem in your honour,\" the centurion called out to the recruit. \"Now attend to Teucer, before I have to give you another compliment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youth smiled sheepishly and attended to his comrade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must thank you too, legionary,\" Oppius remarked to the soldier who had rushed out of the forest with Roscius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier turned around, after pulling his javelin out of the barbarian.

He was a good man, tough as leather. It seems you can handle yourself in a fight too. I also saw you on the beach. You\u0027re your father\u0027s son,\" Tiro Casca announced, nodding in approval and respect.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/standard-bearer-sword-of-rome-1/page-20.html","bookId":1521,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:43:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:43:45 AM"}
