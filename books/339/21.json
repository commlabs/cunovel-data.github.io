Common rectangular fluorescent lights were spaced evenly along theceiling. It was warmer here, for which I was grateful. This hall seemed very benign after the gloom of theghoulish stone sewers.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward didn\u0027t seem to agree with my assessment. He glowered darkly down the long hallway, towardthe slight, black shrouded figure at the end, standing by an elevator.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He pulled me along, and Alice walked on my other side. The heavy door creaked shut behind us, andthen there was the thud of a bolt sliding home.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jane waited by the elevator, one hand holding the doors open for us. Her expression was apathetic.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Once inside the elevator, the three vampires that belonged to the Volturi relaxed further. They threwback their cloaks, letting the hoods fall back on their shoulders. Felix and Demetri were both of a slightlyolive complexion—it looked odd combined with their chalky pallor. Felix\u0027s black hair was cropped short,but Demetri\u0027s waved to his shoulders. Their irises were deep crimson around the edges, darkening untilthey were black around the pupil. Under the shrouds, their clothes were modern, pale, and nondescript. Icowered in the corner, cringing against Edward. His hand still rubbed against my arm. He never took hiseyes off Jane.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 The elevator ride was short; we stepped out into what looked like a posh office reception area. The wallswere paneled in wood, the floors carpeted in thick, deep green. There were no windows, but large,brightly lit paintings of the Tuscan countryside hung everywhere as replacements. Pale leather coucheswere arranged in cozy groupings, and the glossy tables held crystal vases full of vibrantly coloredbouquets. The flowers\u0027 smell reminded me of a funeral home.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　In the middle of the room was a high, polished mahogany counter. I gawked in astonishment at thewoman behind it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She was tall, with dark skin and green eyes. She would have been very pretty in any othercompany—but not here. Because she was every bit as human as I was. I couldn\u0027t comprehend what thishuman woman was doing here, totally at ease, surrounded by vampnes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She smiled politely in welcome. \"Good afternoon, Jane,\" she said. There was no surprise in her face asshe glanced at Jane\u0027s company. Not Edward, his bare chest glinting dimly in the white lights, or even me,disheveled and comparatively hideous.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jane nodded. \"Gianna.\" She continued toward a set of double doors in the back of the room, and wefollowed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　As Felix passed the desk, he winked at Gianna, and she giggled.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　On the other side of the wooden doors was a different kind of reception. The pale boy in the pearl graysuit could have been Jane\u0027s twin. His hair was darker, and his lips were not as full, but he was just aslovely. He came forward to meet us. He smiled, reaching for her. \"Jane.\"\"Alec,\" she responded, embracing the boy. They kissed each other\u0027s cheeks on both sides. Then helooked at us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"They send you out for one and you come back with two… and a half,\" he noted, looking at me. \"Nicework.\"She laughed—the sound sparkled with delight like a baby\u0027s cooing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Welcome back, Edward,\" Alec greeted him. \"You seem in a better mood.\"\"Marginally,\" Edward agreed in a flat voice. I glanced at Edward\u0027s hard face, and wondered how hismood could have been darker before.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Alec chuckled, and examined me as I clung to Edward\u0027s side. \"And this is the cause of all the trouble?\"he asked, skeptical.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward only smiled, his expression contemptuous. Then he froze.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Dibs,\" Felix called casually from behind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward turned, a low snarl building deep in his chest. Felix smiled—his hand was raised, palm up; hecurled his fingers twice, inviting Edward forward.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Alice touched Edward\u0027s arm. \"Patience,\" she cautioned him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They exchanged a long glance, and I wished I could hear what she was telling him. I figured that it wassomething to do with not attacking Felix, because Edward took a deep breath and turned back to Alec.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Aro will be so pleased to see you again,\" Alec said, as if nothing had passed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 \"Let\u0027s not keep him waiting,\" Jane suggested.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward nodded once.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Alec and Jane, holding hands, led the way down yet another wide, ornate hall—would there ever be anend?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They ignored the doors at the end of the hall—doors entirely sheathed in gold—stopping halfway downthe hall and sliding aside a piece of the paneling to expose a plain wooden door. It wasn\u0027t locked. Alecheld it open for Jane.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I wanted to groan when Edward pulled me through to the other side of the door. It was the same ancientstone as the square, the alley, and the sewers. And it was dark and cold again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The stone antechamber was not large. It opened quickly into a brighter, cavernous room, perfectly roundlike a huge castle turret… which was probably exactly what it was.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Two stories up, long window slits threw thin rectangles of bright sunlight onto the stone floor below.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　There were no artificial lights. The only furniture in the room were several massive wooden chairs, likethrones, that were spaced unevenly, flush with the curving stone walls. In the very center of the circle, in aslight depression, was another drain. I wondered if they used it as an exit, like the hole in the street.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The room was not empty. A handful of people were convened in seemingly relaxed conversation. Themurmur of low, smooth voices was a gentle hum in the air. As I watched, a pair of pale women insummer dresses paused in a patch of light, and, like prisms, their skin threw the light in rainbow sparklesagainst the sienna walls.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The exquisite faces all turned toward our party as we entered the room. Most of the immortals weredressed in inconspicuous pants and shirts—things that wouldn\u0027t stick out at all on the streets below. Butthe man who spoke first wore one of the long robes. It was pitch-black, and brushed against the floor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　For a moment, I thought his long, jet-black hair was the hood of his cloak.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Jane, dear one, you\u0027ve returned!\" he cried in evident delight. His voice was just a soft sighing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He drifted forward, and the movement flowed with such surreal grace that I gawked, my mouth hangmgopen. Even Alice, whose every motion looked like dancing, could not compare.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was only more astonished as he floated closer and I could see his face. It was not like the unnaturallyattractive faces that surrounded him (for he did not approach us alone; the entire group convergedaround him, some following, and some walking ahead of him with the alert manner of bodyguards). Icouldn\u0027t decide if his face was beautiful or not. I suppose the features were perfect. But he was asdifferent from the vampires beside him as they were from me. His skin was translucently white, likeonionskin, and it looked just as delicate—it stood in shocking contrast to the long black hair that framedhis face. I felt a strange, horrifying urge to touch his cheek, to see if it was softer than Edward\u0027s orAlice\u0027s, or if it was powdery, like chalk. His eyes were red, the same as the others around him, but thecolor was clouded, milky; I wondered if his vision was affected by the haze.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He glided to Jane, took her face in his papery hands, kissed her lightly on her full lips, and then floatedback a step.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Yes, Master.\" Jane smiled; the expression made her look like an angelic child. \"I brought him back alive,just as you wished.\"\"Ah, Jane.\" He smiled, too. \"You are such a comfort to me.\" He turned his misty eyes toward us, and the smile brightened—became ecstatic.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"And Alice and Bella, too!\" he rejoiced, clapping his thin hands together. \"This is a happy surprise!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Wonderful!\"I stared in shock as he called our names informally, as if we were old friends dropping in for anunexpected visit.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He turned to our hulking escort. \"Felix, be a dear and tell my brothers about our company. I\u0027m sure theywouldn\u0027t want to miss this.\"\"Yes, Master.\" Felix nodded and disappeared back the way we had come.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"You see, Edward?\" The strange vampire turned and smiled at Edward like a fond but scoldinggrandfather. \"What did I tell you? Aren\u0027t you glad that I didn\u0027t give you what you wanted yesterday?\"\"Yes, Aro, I am,\" he agreed, tightening his arm around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I love a happy ending.\" Aro sighed. \"They are so rare. But I want the whole story. How did thishappen? Alice?\" He turned to gaze at Alice with curious, misty eyes. \"Your brother seemed to think youinfallible, but apparently there was some mistake.\"\"Oh, I\u0027m far from infallible.\" She flashed a dazzling smile. She looked perfectly at ease, except that herhands were balled into tight little fists. \"As you can see today, I cause problems as often as I cure them.\"\"You\u0027re too modest,\" Aro chided. \"I\u0027ve seen some of your more amazing exploits, and I must admit I\u0027venever observed anything like your talent. Wonderful!\"Alice flickered a glance at Edward. Aro did not miss it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I\u0027m sorry, we haven\u0027t been introduced properly at all, have we? It\u0027s just that I feel like I know youalready, and I tend get ahead of myself. Your brother introduced us yesterday, in a peculiar way. Yousee, I share some of your brother\u0027s talent, only I am limited in a way that he is not.\" Aro shook his head;his tone was envious.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"And also exponentially more powerful,\" Edward added dryly. He looked at Alice as he swiftlyexplained. \"Aro needs physical contact to hear your thoughts, but he hears much more than I do. Youknow I can only hear what\u0027s passing through your head in the moment. Aro hears every thought yourmind has ever had.\"Alice raised her delicate eyebrows, and Edward inclined his head.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Aro didn\u0027t miss that either.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"But to be able to hear from a distance…\" Aro sighed, gesturing toward the two of them, and theexchange that had just taken place. \"That would be so convenient.\"Aro looked over our shoulders. All the other heads turned in the same direction, including Jane, Alec,and Demetri, who stood silently beside us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was the slowest to turn. Felix was back, and behind him floated two more black-robed men. Bothlooked very much like Aro, one even had the same flowing black hair. The other had a shock ofsnow-white hair—the same shade as his face—that brushed against his shoulders. Their faces hadidentical, paper-thin skin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 The trio from Carlisle\u0027s painting was complete, unchanged by the last three hundred years since it waspainted.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Marcus, Caius, look!\" Aro crooned. \"Bella is alive after all, and Alice is here with her! Isn\u0027t thatwonderful?\"Neither of the other two looked as if wonderful would be their first choice of words. The dark-hairedman seemed utterly bored, like he\u0027d seen too many millennia of Aro\u0027s enthusiasm. The other\u0027s hice wassour under the snowy hair.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Their lack of interest did not curb Aro\u0027s enjoyment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Let us have the story,\" Aro almost sang in his feathery voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The white-haired ancient vampire drifted away, gliding toward one of the wooden thrones. The otherpaused beside Aro, and he reached his hand out, at first I thought to take Aro\u0027s hand. But he justtouched Aro\u0027s palm briefly and then dropped his hand to his side. Aro raised one black brow. Iwondered how his papery skin did not crumple in the effort.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward snorted very quietly, and Alice looked at him, curious.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Thank you, Marcus,\" Aro said. \"That\u0027s quite interesting.\"I realized, a second late, that Marcus was letting Aro know his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Marcus didn\u0027t look interested. He glided away from Aro to join the one who must be Caius, seatedagainst the wall. Two of the attending vampires followed silently behind him—bodyguards, like I\u0027dthought before. I could see that the two women in the sundresses had gone to stand beside Caius in thesame manner. The idea of any vampire needing a guard was faintly ridiculous to me, but maybe theancient ones were as frail as their skin suggested.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Aro was shaking his head. \"Amazing,\"\u0027 he said. \"Absolutely amazing.\"Alice\u0027s expression was frustrated. Edward turned to her and explained again in a swift, low voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Marcus sees relationships. He\u0027s surprised by the intensity of ours.\"Aro smiled. \"So convenient,\" he repeated to himself. Then he spoke to us. \"It takes quite a bit to surpriseMarcus, I can assure you.\"I looked at Marcus\u0027s dead face, and I believed that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"It\u0027s just so difficult to understand, even now,\" Aro mused, staring at Edward\u0027s arm wrapped around me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It was hard for me to follow Aro\u0027s chaotic train of thought. I struggled to keep up. \"How can you standso close to het like that?\"\"It\u0027s not without effort,\" Edward answered calmly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Butstill—la tua cantante! What a waste!\"Edward chuckled once without humor. \"I look at it more as a price.\"Aro was skeptical. \"A very high price.\"\"Opportunity cost.\" Aro laughed. \"If I hadn\u0027t smelled her through your memories, I wouldn\u0027t have believed the call of anyone\u0027sblood could be so strong. I\u0027ve never felt anything like it myself. Most of us would trade much for such agift, and yet you…\"\"Waste it,\" Edward finished, his voice sarcastic now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Aro laughed again. \"Ah, how I miss my friend Carlisle! You remind me of him—only he was not soangry.\"\"Carlisle outshines me in many other ways as well.\"\"I certainly never thought to see Carlisle bested for self-control of all things, but you put him to shame.\"\"Hardly.\" Edward sounded impatient. As if he were tired of the preliminaries. It made me more afraid; Icouldn\u0027t help but try to imagine what he expected would follow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I am gratified by his success,\" Aro mused. \"Your memories of him are quite a gift for me, though theyastonish me exceedingly. I am surprised by how it… pleases me, his success in this unorthodox path he\u0027schosen. I expected that he would waste, weaken with time. I\u0027d scoffed at his plan to find others whowould share his peculiar vision. Yet, somehow, I\u0027m happy to be wrong.\"Edward didn\u0027t reply.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"But your restraint!\" Aro sighed. \"I did not know such strength was possible. To inure yourself againstsuch a siren call, not just once but again and again—if I had not felt it myself, I would not have believed.\"Edward gazed back at Aro\u0027s admiration with no expression. I knew his face well enough—time had notchanged that—to guess at something seething beneath the surface. I fought to keep my breathing even.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Just remembering how she appeals to you…\" Aro chuckled. \"It makes me thirsty.\"Edward tensed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Don\u0027t be disturbed,\" Aro reassured him. \"I mean her no harm. But I am so curious, about one thing inparticular.\" He eyed me with bright interest. \"May I?\" he asked eagerly, lifting one hand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Ask her,\" Edward suggested in a flat voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Of course, how rude of me!\" Aro exclaimed. \"Bella,\" he addressed me directly now. \"I\u0027m fascinated thatyou are the one exception to Edward\u0027s impressive talent—so very interesting that such a thing shouldoccur! And I was wondering, since our talents are similar in many ways, if you would be so kind as toallow me to try—to see if you are an exception for me, as well?\"My eyes flashed up to Edward\u0027s face in terror. Despite Aro\u0027s overt politeness, I didn\u0027t believe I really hada choice. I was horrified at the thought of allowing him to touch me, and yet also perversely intrigued bythe chance to feel his strange skin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward nodded in encouragement—whether because he was sure Aro would not hurt me, or becausethere was no choice, I couldn\u0027t tell.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I turned back to Aro and raised my hand slowly in front of me. It was trembling.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He glided closer, and I believe he meant his expression to be reassuring. But his papery features weretoo strange, too alien and frightening, to reassure. The look on his face was more confident than hiswords had been.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 Aro reached out, as if to shake my hand, and pressed his insubstantial-looking skin against mine. It washard, but felt brittle—shale rather than granite—and even colder than I expected.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　His filmy eyes smiled down at mine, and it was impossible to look away. They were mesmerizing in anodd, unpleasant way.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Aro\u0027s face altered as I watched. The confidence wavered and became first doubt, then incredulity beforehe calmed it into a friendly mask.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"So very interesting,\" he said as he released my hand and drifted back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　My eyes flickered to Edward, and, though his face was composed, I thought he seemed a little smug.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Aro continued to drift wnh a thoughtful expression. He was quiet for a moment, his eyes flickeringbetween the three of us. Then, abruptly, he shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"A first,\" he said to himself \"I wonder if she is immune to our other talents… Jane, dear?\"\"No!\" Edward snarled the word. Alice grabbed his arm with a restraining hand. He shook her off.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Little Jane smiled up happily at Aro. \"Yes, Master?\"Edward was truly snarling now, the sound ripping and tearing from him, glaring at Aro with baleful eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The room had gone still, everyone watching him with amazed disbelief, as if he were committing someembarrassing social faux pas. I saw Felix grin hopefully and move a step forward. Aro glanced at himonce, and he froze in place, his grin turning to a sulky expression.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Then he spoke to Jane. \"I was wondering, my dear one, if Bella is immune to you.\"I could barely hear Aro over Edward\u0027s furious growls. He let go of me, moving to hide me from theirview. Caius ghosted in our direction, with his entourage, to watch.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jane turned toward us with a beatific smile.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Don\u0027t!\" Alice cried as Edward launched himself at the little girl.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Before I could react, before anyone could jump between them, before Aro\u0027s bodyguards could tense,Edward was on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　No one had touched him, but he was on the stone floor writhing in obvious agony, while I stared inhorror.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jane was smiling only at him now, and it all clicked together. What Alice had said about formidable gifts, why everyone treated Jane with such deference, and why Edward had thrown himself in her path beforeshe could do that to me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Stop!\" I shrieked, my voice echoing in the silence, jumping forward to put myself between them. ButAlice threw her arms around me in an unbreakable grasp and ignored my struggles. No sound escapedEdward\u0027s lips as he cringed against the stones. It felt like my head would explode from the pain ofwatching this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Jane,\" Aro recalled her in a tranquil voice. She looked up quickly, still smiling with pleasure, her eyesquestioning. As soon as Jane looked away, Edward was still.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Aro inclined his head toward me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 Jane turned her smile in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I didn\u0027t even meet her gaze. I watched Edward from the prison of Alice\u0027s arms, still struggling pointlessly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"He\u0027s fine,\" Alice whispered in a tight voice. As she spoke, he sat up, and then sprang lightly to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　His eyes met mine, and they were horror-struck. At first I thought the horror was for what he had justsuffered. But then he looked quickly at Jane, and back to me—and his face relaxed into relief.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I looked at Jane, too, and she no longer smiled. She glared at me, her jaw clenched with the intensity ofher focus. I shrank back, waiting for the pain.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward was by my side again. He touched Alice\u0027s arm, and she surrendered me to him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Aro started to laugh. \"Ha, ha. ha,\" he chuckled. \"This is wonderful!\"Jane hissed in frustration, leaning forward like she was preparing to spring.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Don\u0027t be put out, dear one,\" Aro said in a comforting tone, placing a powder-light hand on her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"She confounds us all.\"Jane\u0027s upper lip curled back ever her teeth as she continued to glare at me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Ha, ha, ha,\" Aro chortled again. \"You\u0027re very brave, Edward, to endure in silence. I asked Jane to dothat to me once—just out of curiosity.\" He shook his head in admiration.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward glared, disgusted.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"So what do we do with you now?\" Aro sighed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward and Alice stiffened. This was the part they\u0027d been waiting for. I began to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s any chance that you\u0027ve changed your mind?\" Aro asked Edward hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Your talent would be an excellent addition to our little company.\"Edward hesitated. From the corner of my eye, I saw both Felix and Jane grimace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward seemed to weigh each word before he spoke it. \"I\u0027d… rather… not.\"\"Alice?\" Aro asked, still hopeful. \"Would you perhaps be interested in joining with us?\"\"No, thank you,\" Alice said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"And you, Bella?\" Aro raised his eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward hissed, low in my ears. I stared at Aro blankly. Was he joking? Or was he really asking me if Iwanted to stay for dinner?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It was the white-haired Caius who broke the silence.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"What?\" he demanded of Aro; his voice, though no more than a whisper, was flat.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Caius, surely you see the potential,\" Aro chided him affectionately. \"I haven\u0027t seen a prospective talentso promising since we found Jane and Alec. Can you imagine the possibilities when she is one of us?\" Caius looked away with a caustic expression. Jane\u0027s eyes sparked with indignation at the comparison.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward fumed beside me. I could hear a rumble in his chest, building toward a growl. I couldn\u0027t let histemper get him hurt.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"No, thank you,\" I spoke up in barely more than a whisper, my voice breaking in fright.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Aro sighed. \"That\u0027s unfortunate. Such a waste.\"Edward hissed. \"Join or die, is that it? I suspected as much when we were brought to this room. Somuch for your laws.\"The tone of his voice surprised me. He sounded irate, but there was something deliberate about hisdelivery—as if he\u0027d chosen his words with great care.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Of course not.\" Aro blinked, astonished. \"We were already convened here, Edward, awaiting Heidi\u0027sreturn. Not for you.\"\"Aro,\" Caius hissed. \"The law claims them.\"Edward glared at Caius. \"How so?\" he demanded. He must have known what Caius was thinking, but heseemed determined to make him speak it aloud.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Caius pointed a skeletal finger at me. \"She knows too much. You have exposed our secrets.\" His voicewas papery thin, just like his skin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"There are a few humans in on your charade here, as well,\" Edward reminded him, and I thought of thepretty receptionist below.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Caius\u0027s face twisted into a new expression. Was it supposed to be a smiled.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Yes,\" he agreed. \"But when they are no longer useful to us, they will serve to sustain us. That is not yourplan for this one. If she betrays our secrets, are you prepared to destroy her? I think not,\" he scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"I wouldn\u0027t—,\" I began, still whispering. Caius silenced me with an icy look.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Nor do you intend to make her one of us,\" Caius continued. \"Therefore, she is a vulnerability. Though itis true, for this, only her life is forfeit. You may leave if you wish.\"Edward bared his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"That\u0027s what I thought,\" Caius said, with something akin to pleasure. Felix leaned forward, eager.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Unless…\" Aro interrupted. He looked unhappy with the way the conversation had gone. \"Unless you dointend to give her immortality?\"Edward pursed his lips, hesitating for a moment before he answered. \"And if I do?\"Aro smiled, happy again. \"Why, then you would be free to go home and give my regards to my friendCarlisle.\" His expression turned more hesitant. \"But I\u0027m afraid you would have to mean it.\"Aro raised his hand in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Caius, who had begun to scowl furiously, relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward\u0027s lips tightened into a fierce line. He stared into my eyes, and I stared back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 \"Mean it,\" I whispered. \"Please.\"Was it really such a loathsome idea? Would he rather die than change me? I felt like I\u0027d been kicked inthe stomach.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward stared down at me with a tortured expression.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　And then Alice stepped away from us, forward toward Aro. We turned to watch her. Her hand wasraised like his.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She didn\u0027t say anything, and Aro waved off his anxious guard as they moved to block her approach. Aromet her halfway, and took her hand with an eager, acquisitive glint in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He bent his head over their touching hands, his eyes closing as he concentrated. Alice was motionless,her face blank. I heard Edward\u0027s teeth snap together.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　No one moved. Aro seemed frozen over Alice\u0027s hand. The seconds passed and I grew more and morestressed, wondering how much time would pass before it was too much time. Before it meant somethingwas wrong—more wrong than it already was.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Another agonizing moment passed, and then Aro\u0027s voice broke the silence.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Ha, ha, ha,\" he laughed, his head still bent forward. He looked up slowly, his eyes bright withexcitement. \"That was fascinating!\"Alice smiled dryly. \"I\u0027m glad you enjoyed it.\"\"To see the things you\u0027ve seen—especially the ones that haven\u0027t happened yet!\" He shook his head inwonder.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"But that will,\" she reminded him, voice calm.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Yes, yes, it\u0027s quite determined. Certainly there\u0027s no problem.\"Caius looked bitterly disappointed—a feeling he seemed to share with Felix and Jane.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Aro,\" Caius complained.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Dear Caius,\" Aro smiled. \"Do not fret. Think of the possibilities! They do not join us today, but we canalways hope for the future. Imagine the joy young Alice alone would bring to our little household…Besides, I\u0027m so terribly curious to see how Bella turns out!\"Aro seemed convinced. Did he not realize how subjective Alice\u0027s visions were.\u0027 That she could make upher mind to transform me today, and then change it tomorrow? A million tiny decisions, her decisions andso many others\u0027, too—Edward\u0027s—could alter her path, and with that, the future.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　And would it really matter that Alice was willing, would it make any difference if I did become a vampire,when the idea was so repulsive to Edward? If death was, to him, a better alternative than having mearound forever, an immortal annoyance? Terrified as I was, I felt myself sinking down into depression,drowning in it…\"Then we are free to go now?\" Edward asked in an even voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Yes, yes,\" Aro said pleasantly. \"But please visit again. It\u0027s been absolutely enthralling!\" \"And we will visit you as well,\" Caius promised, his eyes suddenly half-closed like the heavy-lidded gazeof a lizard. \"To be sure that you follow through on your side. Were I you, I would not delay too long. Wedo not offer second chances.\"Edward\u0027s jaw clenched tight, but he nodded once.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Caius smirked and drifted back to where Marcus still sat, unmoving and uninterested.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Felix groaned.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Ah, Felix.\" Aro smiled, amused. \"Heidi will be here at any moment. Patience.\"\"Hmm.\" Edward\u0027s voice had a new edge to it. \"In that case, perhaps we\u0027d better leave sooner rather thanlater.\"\"Yes,\" Aro agreed. \"That\u0027s a good idea. Accidents do happen. Please wait below until after dark, though,if you don\u0027t mind.\"\"Of course,\" Edward agreed, while I cringed at the thought of waiting out the day before we couldescape.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"And here,\" Aro added, motioning to Felix with one finger. Felix came forward at once, and Arounfastened the gray cloak the huge vampire wore, pulling from his shoulders. He tossed it to Edward.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Take this. You\u0027re a little conspicuous.\"Edward put the long cloak on, leaving the hood down.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Aro sighed. \"It suits you.\"Edward chuckled, but broke off suddenly, glancing over his shoulder. \"Thank you, Aro. We\u0027ll waitbelow.\"\"Goodbye, young friends,\" Aro said, his eyes bright as he stared in the same direction.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Let\u0027s go,\" Edward said, urgent now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Demetri gestured that we should follow, and then set off the way we\u0027d come in, the only exit by the lookof things.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward pulled me swiftly along beside him. Alice was close by my other side, her face hard.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Not fast enough,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I stared up at her, frightened, but she only seemed chagrined. It was then that I first heard the babble ofvoices—loud, rough voices—coming from the antechamber.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Well this is unusual,\" a man\u0027s coarse voice boomed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"So medieval,\" an unpleasantly shrill, female voice gushed back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　A large crowd was coming through the little door, filling the smaller stone chamber. Demetri motioned forus to make room. We pressed back against the cold wall to let them pass.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The couple in front, Americans from the sound of them, glanced around themselves with appraising eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Welcome, guests! Welcome to Volterra!\" I could hear Aro sing from the big turret room.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 The rest of them, maybe forty or more, filed in after the couple. Some studied the setting like tourists. Afew even snapped pictures. Others looked confused, as if the story that had led them to this room wasnot making sense anymore. I noticed one small, dark woman in particular. Around her neck was arosary, and she gripped the cross tightly in one hand. She walked more slowly than the others, touchingsomeone now and then and asking a question in an unfamiliar language. No one seemed to understandher, and her voice grew more panicked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward pulled my face against his chest, but it was too late. I already understood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　As soon as the smallest break appeared, Edward pushed me quickly toward the door. I could feel thehorrified expression on my face, and the tears beginning to pool in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The ornate golden hallway was quiet, empty except for one gorgeous, statuesque woman. She stared atus curiously, me in particular.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Welcome home, Heidi,\" Demetri greeted her from behind us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Heidi smiled absently. She reminded me of Rosalie, though they looked nothing alike—it was just that herbeauty, too, was exceptional, unforgettable. I couldn\u0027t seem to look away.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She was dressed to emphasize that beauty. Her amazingly long legs, darkened with tights, were exposedby the shortest of miniskirts. Her top was long-sleeved and high-necked, but extremely close-fitting, andconstructed of red vinyl. Her long mahogany hair was lustrous, and her eyes were the strangest shade ofviolet—a color that might result from blue-tinted contacts over red irises.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Demetri,\" she responded in a silky voice, her eyes flickering between my face and Edward\u0027s gray cloak.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Nice fishing,\" Demetri complimented her, and I suddenly understood the attention-grabbing outfit shewore… she was not only the fisherman, but also the bait.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Thanks.\" She flashed a stunning smile. \"Aren\u0027t you coming?\"\"In a minute. Save a few for me.\"Heidi nodded and ducked through the door with one last curious look at me.\u003c/p\u003e     \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/144/5939.html","bookId":339,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:33:42 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:33:42 AM"}
