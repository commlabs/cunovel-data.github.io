I had seen my mother lying in a pool of her own blood. That was fear. But seeing Woods out in that water going under and not coming up---that had been all-consuming terror. Nothing compared to that. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace hadn\u0027t come back up, though. My chest hurt so bad I couldn\u0027t take deep breaths. Jace was gone. I had seen it happen, and the broken sobs coming from Bethy as Blaire held her on the sand only ripped through me harder. I couldn\u0027t imagine that. That had almost been me. That could have been me on that sand, knowing the man I loved wasn\u0027t coming back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods\u0027s body shuddered and reality started to hit me. The idea of losing him had been all I could think about. But he\u0027d been out there for a reason. He had gone to save his best friend. He\u0027d watched his best friend be pulled under, unable to save him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tightened my hold on him. How was he going to survive this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethy continued to wail and Woods\u0027s body went stiff. He was strung so tight he was trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get her the fuck out of my sight!\" he roared. I jumped back, startled by the angry hate that laced his words. His eyes were glaring and focused on someone behind me. I turned to see that he was looking at Bethy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlaire\u0027s face went pale and Bethy cried harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said to get her selfish, trashy ass off my beach! Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed hard and watched as Bethy looked up at him with big, pain-filled eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush was behind Blaire, helping Bethy stand up. I heard him telling her they needed to take Bethy somewhere else. Woods was yelling at Bethy. He was blaming her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Woods?\" I was almost afraid of the man in front of me. He swung his gaze to mine and there was an emptiness in them I couldn\u0027t reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She killed him,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she had. She had gone into the water and almost drowned. Jace had died saving her. But she had been drinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She loved him,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods shook his head. \"No. She didn\u0027t love him. You don\u0027t do what she did and call that love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back and saw Blaire lead Bethy up to the boardwalk. The cops would want to question her. She wouldn\u0027t be able to go far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Woods, she lost him, too. We all did,\" Thad said as he stood watching Woods, afraid to get too close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lost him because he wanted me to save her worthless, drunk ass. I did what he wanted and I lost him.\" Woods\u0027s voice was cold and emotionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeadlights lit up the beach as ambulances and police cars arrived. Paramedics swarmed the stretch of sand and I watched as they were told by several of the people at the party what they had seen. A paramedic approached Woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were one of the people who were in the water?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Woods replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to check you out,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched as the paramedic started to argue and stepped between him and Woods. \"He\u0027s fine. If I think he needs medical attention I will make sure he gets it. Please, he needs to be left alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked up at Woods and then back at me. \"Okay,\" he said, then turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving until they\u0027ve found him,\" Woods said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around and reached for his hand. He laced his fingers through mine. \"Okay,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll stay right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll stay with me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving your side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat there for the next four hours. Rush had brought Woods a blanket from one of the ambulances to keep him from getting cold since he was soaking wet. He didn\u0027t say anything, he just dropped it on his shoulders. Rush had been out there, too. He had been the reason Woods hadn\u0027t drowned. They had both lived this nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the police questioned Bethy, Darla came and took her home. Blaire took Nate and went home at Rush\u0027s insistence. The crowd had thinned. Helicopters spotlighted the dark water and boats searched in vain. It was impossible to see in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods sat there beside me, not letting go of my hand and staring at the water. Watching them look for Jace. He wanted Jace\u0027s body found. I understood that. He didn\u0027t want to leave the beach until he knew Jace wasn\u0027t out there alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the helicopters left. The boats went away. The paramedics packed up and drove off. A police officer tried to get us to leave but they weren\u0027t going to argue with the owner of the Kerrington Club. They finally left us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe weren\u0027t alone, though. Rush stood off in the distance, his hands in the pockets of his jeans. At some point he\u0027d changed clothes. He was staring off at the dark water, too. I kept thinking this was a dream I would wake up from, but it never ended. I glanced over to our left and Thad sat there on the sand with his arms wrapped around his legs and his knees bent, like a little boy who was lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was nothing I could do. Nothing anyone could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the ocean crashing against the shore wasn\u0027t soothing like it had once been. It now felt like a taunt. Reminding us that it was stronger. It was in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone else moved in the darkness and I watched as Grant came running down the boardwalk. He hadn\u0027t been at the party. I never knew if he was in town or somewhere else. The guy never stayed in one place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped at Rush and Rush turned his eyes to look at him. They stood there for a moment, then Grant hung his head and dropped to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was morning when the searchers found Jace\u0027s body washed up one mile down the shore. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-42.html","bookId":1992,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
