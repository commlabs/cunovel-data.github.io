Yes, if one changes their body.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Men are fools, but ecclesiastics are their leaders.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I do not believe even eye-witnesses when they tell me things opposed to common sense.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The fanatics begin with humility and kindness, and have all ended with pride and carnage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Pope is an idol, whose hands are tied and whose feet are kissed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What an immense book might be composed on all the things once believed, of which it is necessary to doubt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That which can be explained in many ways does not merit being explained in any.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Theology is in religion what poison is among food.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Theology has only served to upset brains, and sometimes States.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That which is an eternal subject of dispute is an eternal inutility.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To pray is to flatter oneself that one will change entire nature with words.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Names of sects; names of error.
