Said it was breaking codes every six minutes even as we speak. Thanked me for checking up on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s lying,\" Midge snapped. \"I\u0027ve been running these Crypto stats for two years.

The DDO just told a blatant lie to the director\u0027s office. I want to know why!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrinkerhoff suddenly wished he hadn\u0027t called her back in. Strathmore\u0027s phone call had set her off. Ever since Skipjack, whenever Midge had a sense that something suspicious was going on, she made an eerie transition from flirt to fiend. There was no stopping her until she sorted it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Midge, it is possible our data is off,\" Brinkerhoff said firmly. \"I mean, think about it-a file that ties up TRANSLTR for eighteen hours? It\u0027s unheard of. Go home. It\u0027s late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a haughty look and tossed the report on the counter. \"I trust the data. Instinct says it\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrinkerhoff frowned. Not even the director questioned Midge Milken\u0027s instincts anymore-she had an uncanny habit of always being right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something\u0027s up,\" she declared. \"And I intend to find out what it is.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-49.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:06 PM"}
