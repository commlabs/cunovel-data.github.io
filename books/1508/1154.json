It was impossible for him to stop just because of some words, but if he really did continue to attack then he would need to burn Mo Eversnow’s soul force. Thus, Lin Ming wasn’t willing to recklessly send out such a strike. He didn’t dare to confirm whether or not Mo Eversnow would experience permanent damage to her soul after falling into a deep slumber twice. At that time, perhaps even using dragon marrow blood wouldn’t be enough to awaken her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s nerves were taut, fully alert of his surroundings to prevent any surprise attack from the ancient soul.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hehe, it’s like you don’t believe me. If I said you can stop then I naturally won’t attack you again, otherwise, do you think that in a situation where I am prepared, you could rely on yourself and that other soul force within you to use that tool and kill me?” The ancient soul sneered.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ancient soul had seen through Mo Eversnow’s existence. This was also reasonable. Mo Eversnow had originally been hiding in the Magic Cube space, so the ancient soul hadn’t been able to sense her. But afterwards, Mo Eversnow had released her soul force and began to gather up energy for an attack. The ancient soul’s soul force was much more powerful than Mo Eversnow’s so it was naturally able to discover her!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming hesitated for a moment and then temporarily cut off the connection between his spiritual sea and the Magic Cube. Otherwise, if the Magic Cube continued to spin, it would consume more and more of Mo Eversnow’s soul force.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough the Magic Cube had stopped spinning, Mo Eversnow’s soul was still momentarily joined with Lin Ming’s. The two of them could activate the Magic Cube to counterattack at any moment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Where did you get that?” The ancient soul suddenly asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming remained silent, not replying. The ancient soul chuckled, as if it didn’t care if Lin Ming answered or not, “In truth, this question doesn’t matter! No matter what you say, you obtaining this object is your good fortune! I never thought that after 3.6 billion years, that object would appear in this world once more. It seems that the great calamity of this world is approaching once more.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ancient soul whispered. But, these words dumbfounded Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e3.6 billion years!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis soul had lived for 3.6 billion years!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJust what sort of concept was 3.6 billion years? The evolution of life on a planet often only happened for several hundred million years. 3.6 billion years was enough for a star to be born and then perish!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was an unimaginable amount of time. Even an Empyrean could not live this long!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLet alone 3.6 billion years, there was no one that was capable of living for 100 million years. 100 million years seemed to be one of the limits that the Laws of the world placed on a martial artist’s life. 100 million years could be called its own era within the Divine Realm, and no one was able to live past an era. Although an Empyrean could control the world Laws to a certain degree, it wasn’t absolute control, nor could they couldn’t control every Law. There were certain Laws that even they had to submit to, just like everyone else.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor instance, the ebb and flow of time!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hehe, you seem to be very surprised? Then I might as well tell you that the reason I am able to live this long is because I am not a human, but… an artifact spirit!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was surprised yet again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eArtifact spirit!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHeavens! If an artifact spirit was powerful to this degree, just what rank of spirit artifact did it occupy?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAn artifact spirit was a type of life, however it was not one with a flesh and blood body, but an energy life form. In the past, when Lin Ming had met the temple spirit from Divine Phoenix Island’s mystic realm, that had been a similar existence. Their lives were much longer than humans’ and even vicious beasts’. It wasn’t strange for them to sleep for 100,000 years at a time. According to that temple spirit, their lives lasted as long as rocks!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSo, surviving for several hundred million years wasn’t strange. Moreover, Lin Ming had heard this ancient spirit say that it had used some special technique called the Destruction Sundering Art. Although he didn’t know what it was, he could guess that it was some special technique that could extend one’s life through placing oneself into a deep sleep.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeeing that this ancient existence before him was an old monster that had lived for 3.6 billion years, Lin Ming felt as if all of this were unreal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Great calamity… what do you mean by great calamity?” Lin Ming asked, his voice low.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That is the great calamity of the world! In this world, there is nothing that could exist in perpetuity, forever and eternal. Nothing can resist the withering of time. Empyreans cannot, God Beasts cannot, artifacts spirits cannot, this independent world cannot, and even the boundless universe cannot! This world will always encounter a great calamity. And if this calamity is too great, then even this universe may collapse and be forever destroyed! As for what this eventual disaster is, not even I can foretell!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHearing the ancient soul’s words, Lin Ming was stricken, “Destruction of the universe?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDid that mean that not only the billion worlds of the lower realms, but also the 3000 great worlds of the Divine Realm, including all life that dwelled within them would be completed exterminated!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn front of such a world-shattering storm, even an Empyrean would be as weak as an ant!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yes! However, that is something that may occur every several hundred million years or dozens of billions of years. As for this great calamity, the universe may not necessarily be destroyed.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“So are you saying that 3.6 billion years ago, there was such a great calamity?” Lin Ming could feel that what this ancient soul said was true. Could it mean that this Magic Cube which appeared during these great calamities was actually an ominous object?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yes, that disaster caused the world Laws to change. Because of that, body transformation Laws were no longer suitable for humans, and that is when the essence gathering system began to flourish throughout all civilizations.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This…” Lin Ming was suddenly enlightened. He had heard that the rules of the world had changed, and thus dual body and energy cultivation had become something that defied the heavens’ will. But as for why or when that happened, even Mo Eversnow wasn’t able to answer him. Only today did he learn the reason why!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA calamity that could change the very Laws of this world; what kind of terrifying storm had the universe passed through?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hehe, I feel that you also dual cultivate body and energy. Really, you’ve got guts and talent, and you’re not too weak either. You have found many lucky chances and you even practice transcendent divine mights. If you can truly walk further down the road of dual body and energy cultivation and break through the shackles that bind you, there is a faint chance that you will become an Empyrean in the future!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ancient soul evaluated. This was already an extremely high estimate of Lin Ming. Since ancient times, no matter how talented a genius was, they would never have 100% confidence of becoming an Empyrean. For someone to have even a faint ray of hope already meant that they were an extraordinary genius of their generation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the ancient soul spoke to here, it suddenly grinned. It playfully said, “Hehe, that little girl in your body is still standing guard against me. Aren’t you afraid that her soul will suffer tremendous damage once again?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA cyan light suddenly shot out from between the ancient soul’s eyebrows, straight into Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was startled, nearly subconsciously counterattacking. However, he immediately realized that this cyan light didn’t have any hostility to it at all. Rather, it was a soft, gentle strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe didn’t stop it. As this cyan light covered his body, a cool feeling spread throughout him as if all the pores in his body were opening.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s mind stirred. He knew that the light this ancient soul released was helping to soothe and heal Mo Eversnow’s soul injuries.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMo Eversnow had briefly combusted her soul just now to activate the Magic Cube. Although she hadn’t sent out a true attack, she still had to consume a tremendous amount of soul force all this time. This caused more wounds to stack up on top of her previous injuries.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe soul energy that this ancient soul sent out was able to supplement Mo Eversnow’s damaged soul force. At least, it would help her so that her hidden wounds wouldn’t suddenly erupt.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWoosh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMo Eversnow and Lin Ming’s souls separated. She didn’t form a soul projection but remained in Lin Ming’s spiritual sea. Clothed in pure white, her face was pale and wan. Briefly activating the Magic Cube just now had greatly consumed her energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, that artifact spirit…” Mo Eversnow never imagined that this ancient artifact spirit would actually help heal her wounds.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ancient soul had undergone a complete change in personality from before discovering the Magic Cube to after discovering the Magic Cube. Mo Eversnow thought this was somewhat strange. She didn’t think that this ancient soul was some kind-hearted savior. Everything must have been because of the Magic Cube.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming thought for a moment and then said, “I deeply thank Senior for helping my friend. Could Senior have some sort of fate with the Magic Cube? Could it be that…” As Lin Ming spoke, an inexplicable idea suddenly popped up in his mind. “Could Senior be an artifact spirit of a treasure similar to the Magic Cube?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere were two treasures similar to the Magic Cube. Could this ancient soul be an artifact spirit of one of those treasures?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Magic Cube… hehe, that name is quite suitable.” The ancient soul casually said, “Not only do you possess the Magic Cube but you also know that there are two other similar objects. Quite interesting, you two are. However, I am not an artifact spirit of those treasures.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ancient soul shook its head, “Those three objects do not seem to have ever had an artifact spirit. If they did, then if an artifact spirit was able to activate the power of those three tools themselves, the power of that would be unimaginable!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I am the life transcendent spirit treasure forged by Empyrean Divine Sea himself – the Ancient Elysium Seal. In fact, you have already seen my true form. That is the violet sun crystal mountain in front of you!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the ancient soul spoke, Lin Ming was shocked. It turned out that this giant violet sun crystal mountain was actually a transcendent spirit treasure, the Ancient Elysium Seal!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is…” Lin Ming was at a loss for words. When Fishy had bitten into the crystal, what she had been biting into was a transcendent spirit treasure. And, strangest of all was that she had actually managed to bite off a piece. That was simply too ridiculous!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA transcendent spirit treasure was an existence on the same level as a transcendent divine might. This sort of thing surpassed the reach of the Heavenly Dao and could control the world Laws to a certain degree. It was an existence that the Heavenly Dao would not abide. Once one was born, it would have to undergo heavenly tribulation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFishy had actually bitten off a piece of a transcendent spirit treasure?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ancient soul seemed to know what Lin Ming was thinking. It laughed and said, “The violet sun crystal mountain that that little girl bit into is only a manifestation of my body. The core of my being, the true Ancient Elysium Seal, is still stabilizing the eye of this Divine Seal Array. Although that little girl is special, she hasn’t yet grown. Causing some insignificant damage to an Empyrean’s array formation is already her limit. If she wanted to destroy it, or even me, the transcendent spirit treasure guarding it, that would simply be impossible.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the ancient soul spoke, an idea popped up in Lin Ming’s mind. In the past, Empyrean Divine Sea had gone to every extreme, sparing no expense to lay down this array formation and had even used his own life transcendent spirit to do it. So, just what was sealed underneath this Divine Seal Array Formation? It had actually been sealed away for 3.6 billion years!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1149\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1151\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1150","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:19 AM"}
