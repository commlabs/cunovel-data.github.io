He had been the one to lead the strike on Tar Valon, and the success of that attack had gained him great favor in Fortuona’s eyes. Symbols and omens spun around his head, like those above Galgan’s—and, indeed, Beslan’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight, Min thought. Am I really starting to think of \"omens\" like Fortuona? I need to leave these people. They’re mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel that the Prince views this battle too much as a game\", Yulan said again. \"Though his initial gambles were keen ones, he has over extended himself. How many a man has stood around the table of dactolk and looked like a genius because of his bets, when really just random chance made him seem capable? The Prince won at first, but now we see how dangerous it is to gamble as he has\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYulan inclined his head toward the Empress. His assertions grew increasingly bold, as she gave him no reason to quiet himself. From the Empress, in this situation, that was an indication he should continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have heard . . . rumors about him \", Galgan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mat’s a gambler, yes\", Beslan said. \"But he’s uncannily good at it. He wins, General. Please, you need to go back and help\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYulan shook his head emphatically. \"The Empress—may she live forever—pulled us away from the battlefield for good reason. If the Prince could not protect his own command post, he is not in control of the battle\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolder and bolder. Galgan rubbed his chin, then looked at another person there. Min didn’t know much of Tylee. She remained quiet at these meetings. With graying hair and broad shoulders, the dark-skinned woman had an indefinable strength to her. This was a general who had led her people directly, in battle, many times. Those scars proved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These mainlanders fight better than I ever assumed they would\", Tylee said. \"I fought alongside some of Cauthon’s soldiers. I think they will surprise you, General. I, too, humbly suggest that we return to help\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But is it in the best interests of the Empire to do so?\" Yulan asked. \"Cauthon’s forces will weaken the Shadow, as will the Shadow’s march to Ebou Dar from Merrilor. We can crush the Trollocs with air attacks along the way. The long victory should be our goal. Perhaps we can send damane to fetch the Prince and bring him to safety. He has fought well, but he is obviously overmatched in this battle. We cannot save his armies, of course. They are doomed\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin frowned, leaning forward. One of the images above Yulan’s head . . . it was so odd. A chain. Why would he have a chain above his head?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s a captive, she thought suddenly. Light. Someone is playing him like an instrument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat feared a spy. Min felt cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Empress, may she live forever, has made her decision\", Galgan said. \"We return. Unless her mind, in its wisdom, has been changed . . . ?\" He turned toward her, a questioning look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur spy can channel, Min realized, inspecting Yulan. That man is under Compulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA channeler. Black Ajah? Darkfriend damane? A male Dreadlord? It could be anyone. And the spy would be wearing a weave for disguise, too, in all likelihood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, then, how would Min ever spot this spy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViewings. Aes Sedai and other channelers always had viewings attached to them. Always. Could she find a clue in one of those? She knew, by instinct, that Yulan’s chain meant he was a captive of another. He wasn’t the true spy, then, but a puppet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started with the other nobility and generals. Of course, many of them had omens above their heads, and those types commonly did. How would she spot something out of the ordinary? Min scanned the watching crowd, and her breath caught as she noticed for the first time that one of the so’jhin, a youthful woman with freckles, carried an array of images above her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin didn’t recognize the woman. Had she been serving here the whole time? Min was certain she’d have noticed earlier if the woman had come close to her; people who were not channelers, Warders or ta’veren rarely had so many images attached to them. Oversight or happenstance, though, she hadn’t thought to look specifically at the servants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, the cover-up was obvious to her. Min looked away so as to not raise the servant’s suspicions, and considered her next move. Her instincts whispered that she should just attack, take out a knife and throw it. If that servant were a Dreadlord—or, Light, one of the Forsaken—striking first might be the only way to defeat her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was also a chance, however, that the woman was innocent. Min debated, then stood up on her chair. Several of the Blood muttered at the breach of decorum, but Min ignored them. She stepped up onto the arm rest of her chair, balancing there to put herself even with Tuon. Min leaned in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mat has asked for us to return\", Min said softly. \"How long will you debate doing what he asked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuon eyed her. \"Until I am convinced this is best for my Empire\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is your husband\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One man’s life is not worth that of thousands\", Tuon said, but she sounded genuinely troubled. \"If the battle really does go as badly as Yulan’s scouts say . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You named me Truthspeaker\", Min said. \"What exactly does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is your duty to censure me in public, if I do something wrong. However, you are untrained in the station. It would be best for you to hold yourself back until I can provide proper—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin turned to face the generals and the watching crowd, her heart beating frantically. \"As Truthspeaker to the Empress Fortuona, I speak now the truth. She has abandoned the armies of humankind, and she withholds her strength in a time of need. Her pride will cause the destruction of all people, everywhere\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blood looked stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not so simple, young woman\", General Galgan said. From the looks others gave him, it seemed he wasn’t supposed to debate a Truthspeaker. He barreled forward anyway. \"This is a complex situation\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would be more sympathetic\", Min said, \"if I didn’t know there was a spy for the Shadow among us\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe freckled so’jhin looked up sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have you, Min thought, then pointed at General Yulan. \"Abaldar Yulan, I denounce you! I have seen omens that prove to me you are not acting in the interests of the Empire!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real spy relaxed, and Min caught a hint of a smile on her lips. That was good enough. As Yulan protested loudly the accusation, Min dropped a knife into her hand and whi \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-272.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
