I had my eye peeled, you bet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed said, \"Ssh. Look. You take this stuff and stick it in the cage. I\u0027ve got to scoot back to the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Slim reached reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ground meat. Holy smokes, haven\u0027t you ever seen ground meat? That\u0027s what you should\u0027ve got when I sent you to the house instead of coming back with that stupid grass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim was hurt. \"How\u0027d I know they don\u0027t eat grass? Besides, ground meat doesn\u0027t come loose like that. It comes in cellophane and it isn\u0027t that color.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure-in the city. Out here we grind our own and it\u0027s always that color till it\u0027s cooked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean it isn\u0027t cooked?\" Slim drew away quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed looked disgusted. \"Do you think animals eat cooked food? Come on, take it. It won\u0027t hurt you. I tell you there isn\u0027t much time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? What\u0027s doing back at the house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Dad and your father are walking around. I think maybe they\u0027re looking for me. Maybe the cook told them I took the meat. Anyway, we don\u0027t want them coming here after me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you ask the cook before you took this stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who? That crab? Shouldn\u0027t wonder if she only let me have a drink of water because Dad makes her. Come on. Take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim took the large glob of meat though his skin crawled at the touch. He turned toward the barn and Red sped away in the direction from which he had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed slowed when he approached the two adults, took a few deep breaths to bring himself back to normal, and then carefully and nonchalantly sauntered past. (They were walking in the general direction of the barn, he noticed, but not dead on.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Hi, Dad. Hello, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Industrialist said, \"Just a moment, Red. I have a question to ask you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed turned a carefully blank face to his father. \"Yes, Dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother tells me you were out early this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not real early, Dad. Just a little before breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said you told her it was because you had been awakened during the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed waited before answering. Should he have told Mom that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he said, \"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was it that awakened you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed saw no harm in it. He said, \"I don\u0027t know. Dad. It sounded like thunder, sort of, and like a collision, sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you tell where it came from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounded like it was out by the hill.\" That was truthful, and useful as well, since the direction was almost opposite that in which the barn lay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Industrialist looked at his guest \"I suppose it would do no harm to walk toward the hill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Astronomer said, \"I am ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed watched them walk away, and when he turned, he saw Slim peering cautiously out from among the briers of a hedge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed waved at him. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim stepped out and approached. \"Did they say anything about the meat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I guess they don\u0027t know about that. They went down to the hill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Search me. They kept asking about the noise I heard. Listen, did the animals eat the meat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Slim cautiously, \"they were sort of looking at it and smelling it or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Red said, \"I guess they\u0027ll eat it. Holy smokes, they\u0027ve got to eat something. Let\u0027s walk along toward the hill and see what Dad and your father are going to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the animals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll be all right. A fellow can\u0027t spend all his time on them. Did you give them water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. They drank that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See. Come on. Well look at them after lunch. I tell you what. We\u0027ll bring them fruit. Anything\u0027ll eat fruit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether they trotted up the rise, Red, as usual, in the lead. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-15.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
