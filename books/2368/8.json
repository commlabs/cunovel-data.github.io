How is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you come up to San Francisco for dinner tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dreaded the thought of facing him, but she could think of no excuse. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you at Restaurant Lulu. Eight o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley was waiting at the restaurant when her father walked in. Again, she saw the admiring glances of recognition on people\u0027s faces. Her father was a famous man. Would he risk everything he had just to - ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good to see you, sweetheart. Sorry about our Christmas dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced herself to say, \"So am I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was staring at the menu, not seeing it, trying to get her thoughts together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I\u0027m not really hungry,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to eat something. You\u0027re getting too thin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have the chicken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched her father as he ordered, and she wondered if she dared to bring up the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was Quebec City?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was very interesting,\" Ashley said. \"It\u0027s a beautiful place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must go there together sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a decision and tried to keep her voice as casual as possible. \"Yes. By the way... last June I went to my ten-year high school reunion in Bedford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Did you enjoy it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She spoke slowly, choosing her words carefully. \"I - I found out that the day after you and I left for London, Jim Cleary\u0027s body... was found. He had been stabbed... and castrated.\" She sat there, watching him, waiting for a reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson frowned. \"Cleary? Oh, yes. That boy who was panting after you. I saved you from him, didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did that mean? Was it a confession? Had he saved her from Jim Cleary by killing him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley took a deep breath and went on. \"Dennis Tibble was murdered the same way. He was stabbed and castrated.\" She watched her father pick up a roll and carefully butter it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he spoke, he said, \"I\u0027m not surprised, Ashley. Bad people usually come to a bad end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this was a doctor, a man dedicated to saving lives. I\u0027ll never understand him, Ashley thought. I don\u0027t think I want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time dinner was over, Ashley was no closer to the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToni said, \"I really enjoyed Quebec City, Alette. I\u0027d like to go back someday. Did you have a good time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlette said shyly, \"I enjoyed the museums.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you called your boyfriend in San Francisco yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not my boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet you want him to be, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forse.

I just sold one of my paintings to a really well-known collector.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fantastic!\" She was delighted. And she could not help thinking. It\u0027s so different when I\u0027m with him. If it were anyone else, I would have thought, Who is tasteless enough to pay money for your paintings? or Don\u0027t give up your day job or a hundred other cruel remarks. But/ don\u0027t do that with Richard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gave Alette an incredible feeling of freedom, as though she had found a cure for some debilitating disease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had lunch at the museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you like?\" Richard asked. \"They have great roast beef here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a vegetarian. I\u0027ll just have a salad. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young, attractive waitress came over to the table. \"Hello, Richard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Bernice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnexpectedly, Alette felt a pang of jealousy. Her reaction surprised her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready to order?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Miss Peters is going to have a salad, and I\u0027m going to have a roast beef sandwich.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress was studying Alette. Is she jealous of me? Alette wondered. When the waitress left, Alette said, \"She\u0027s very pretty. Do you know her well?\" Immediately she blushed. I wish I hadn\u0027t asked that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard smiled. \"I come here a lot. When I first came here, I didn\u0027t have much money. I\u0027d order a sandwich, and Bernice would bring me a banquet. She\u0027s great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seems very nice,\" Alette said. And she thought, She has fat thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they had ordered, they talked about artists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One day I want to go to Giverny,\" Alette said, \"where Monet painted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know Monet started out as a caricaturist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true. Then he met Boudin, who became his; teacher and persuaded him to start painting out of doors. There\u0027s a great story about that. Monet got so hooked on painting out of doors that when he decided to paint a picture of a woman in the garden, with a canvas over eight feet high, he had a trench dug in the garden so he could raise or lower the canvas by pulleys. The picture is hanging at the Musee d\u0027Orsay in Paris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time went by swiftly and happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter lunch, Alette and Richard walked around looking at the various exhibits. There were more than forty thousand objects in the collection, everything from ancient Egyptian artifacts to contemporary American paintings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlette was filled with the wonderment of being with Richard and her complete lack of negative thoughts. Che cosa significa?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA uniformed guard approached them. \"Good afternoon, Richard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afternoon, Brian. This is my friend, Alette Peters. Brian Hill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian said to Alette, \"Are you enjoying the museum?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. It\u0027s wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Richard\u0027s teaching me to paint,\" Brian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlette looked at Richard. \"You are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard said modestly, \"Oh, I\u0027m just guiding him little bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s doing more than that, miss. I\u0027ve always wanted to be a painter. That\u0027s why I took this job at the museum because I love art. Anyway, Richard comes here and paints. When I saw his work, I thought, I want to be like him. So I asked him if he\u0027d teach me, and he\u0027s been great. Have you seen any of his paintings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have,\" Alette said. \"They\u0027re wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they left him, Alette said, \"It\u0027s lovely of you to do that, Richard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to do things for people,\" and he was looking at Alette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were walking out of the museum, Richard said, \"My roommate is at a party tonight. Why don\u0027t we stop up at my place?\" He smiled. \"I have some paintings I\u0027d like to show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlette squeezed his hand. \"Not yet, Richard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you say. I\u0027ll see you next weekend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had no idea how much she was looking forward to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard walked Alette to the parking lot where she had parked her car. He waved good-bye as she drove off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Alette was going to sleep that night, she thought. It\u0027s like a miracle. Richard has freed me. She fell asleep, earning of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt two o\u0027clock in the morning, Richard Melton\u0027s roommate, Gary, returned from a birthday party. The apartment was dark. He switched on the lights in the living room. \"Richard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started toward the bedroom. At the door he looked inside and was sick to his stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, son.\" Detective Whittier looked at the shivering figure in the chair. \"Now, let\u0027s go over it again. Did he have any enemies, someone mad enough at him to do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary swallowed. \"No. Everyone... everyone liked Richard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone didn\u0027t. How long have you and Richard lived together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you lovers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake,\" Gary said indignantly. \"No. We were friends. We lived together for financial reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetective Whittier looked around the small apartment. \"Sure as hell wasn\u0027t a burglary,\" he said. \"There\u0027s nothing here to steal. Was your roommate seeing anyone romantically?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Well, yes. There was a girl he was interested in. I think he was really starting to like her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know her name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Alette. Alette Peters. She works in Cupertino.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetective Whittier and Detective Reynolds looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cupertino?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Reynolds said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes later, Detective Whittier was on the phone with Sheriff Dowling. \"Sheriff, I thought you might be interested to know that we have a murder here that\u0027s the same M.O. as the case you had in Cupertino -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;multiple stab wounds and castration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just had a talk with the FBI. Their computer shows that there have been three previous castration killings very similar to this one. The first one happened in Bedford, Pennsylvania, about ten years ago, the next one was a man named Dennis Tibble - that was your case - then there was the same M.O. in Quebec City, and now this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t make sense. Pennsylvania... Cupertino... Quebec City... San Francisco... Is there any link?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re trying to find one. Quebec requires passports. The FBI is doing a cross-check to see if anyone who was in Quebec City around Christmas was in any of the other cities at the times of the murders....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the media got wind of what was happening, their stories were splashed across the front pages across the world:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSERIAL KILLER LOOSE...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQUATRES HOMMES BRUTALEMENT TUES ET CASTRES...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSUCHT WIRD EIN MANN DER SEINE OFFER KAS-TRIERT...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQUATTRO UOMINI SONO STATI CASTRATI E UCCISI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the networks, self-important psychologists analyzed the killings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... and all the victims were men. Because of the way they were stabbed and castrated, it is undoubtedly the work of a homosexual who...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...so if the police can find a connection between the victims, they will probably discover that it was the work of a lover the men had all scorned....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... but I would say they were random killings committed by someone who had a dominating mother....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday morning, Detective Whittier called deputy Blake from San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deputy, I have an update for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just got a call from the FBI. Cupertino is listed as the residence of an American who was in Quebec on the date of the Parent murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s interesting. What\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her. Patterson. Ashley Patterson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt six o\u0027clock that evening, deputy Sam Blake rang the bell at Ashley Patterson\u0027s apartment. Through the closed door he heard her call out cautiously, \"Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deputy Blake. I\u0027d like to talk to you. Miss Patterson\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence, then the door opened. Ashley was standing there, looking wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course.\" Is this about Father? I must be careful. Ashley led the deputy to a couch. \"What can I do for you, Deputy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you mind answering a few questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley shifted uncomfortably. \"I - I don\u0027t know. Am I under suspicion for something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled reassuringly. \"Nothing like that. Miss Patterson. This is just routine. We\u0027re investigating some murders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know anything about any murders,\" she said quickly. Too quickly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were in Quebec City recently, weren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you acquainted with Jean Claude Parent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jean Claude Parent?\" She thought for a moment, \"No. I\u0027ve never heard of him.

This was about her father. She said cautiously, \"I didn\u0027t work with him. He worked for the same company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. You go into San Francisco occasionally, don\u0027t you. Miss Patterson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley wondered where this was leading. Careful. \"From time to time, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ever meet an artist there named Richard Melton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I don\u0027t know anyone by that name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeputy Blake sat there studying Ashley, frustrated. \"Miss Patterson, would you mind coming down to headquarters and taking a polygraph test? If you want to, you can call your lawyer and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need a lawyer. I\u0027ll be glad to take a test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe polygraph expert was a man named Keith Rosson, and he was one of the best. He had had to cancel a dinner ate, but he was happy to oblige Sam Blake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley was seated in a chair, wired to the polygraph chine. Rosson had already spent forty-five minutes chatting with her, getting background information and evaluating her emotional state.
