Right now, those elders even wanted to take action against them, how could she not be further enraged? Her figure flashed; Shangguan Bing’er first took a step forward, and swiftly equipped herself with the Legendary Set. Even though it was not complete, the Saint Core Nucleus condensed by Shangguan Fei’er was exceedingly peculiar - unlike others, her Saint Core Nucleus did not amplify the Elemental Jewel Attributes but the Physical Jewel instead. Hence, her body was considered to be as resilient as Zhou Weiqing’s. Moreover, she was second only to Zhou Weiqing, who was at the Heavenly Emperor Stage. A formidable power erupted immediately, about to strike.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er said in a low voice, “Fei’er, wait a minute. sidhe elders, will you please listen to what I have to say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe First Elder replied in a low voice, “Her Majesty is of utmost important to our tribe, I am sorry. Perhaps, all of you might have malicious intent, but for the sake of ensuring our survival, we have no choice but to offend all of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er’s face fell; an invisible majestic aura erupted from her body, “First Elder, do you know what this signifies? If anything happens to us here, I can confidently tell you that the sidhe will cease to exist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words were not a simple threat. Be it Zhou Weiqing’s newly established Peerless Sect or the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, or even Heavenly Snow Mountain - they were all one of the best in the human world, in terms of power and might. If they were to deal with the sidhe at full force, it would most likely end up in their extermination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe First Elder had a troubled look on his face - having spent over a day with them, he had already known that those ladies were not to be trifled with. Putting everything else aside, after all, those ladies had reached such impressive cultivation bases at a young age, something that ordinary human beings were not able to do. Hence, one could well imagine just how formidable the powers of the people backing them would be. Of course, he was unaware that the only reason why the five girls could achieve such a feat was because of Zhou Weiqing alone.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the Sidhe Queen was more important. Furthermore, he had no intention of hurting those girls. There was some hesitation in his eyes but soon after, it was replaced with resolve. The only way they could threaten Zhou Weiqing was to capture the girls first. Getting the Sidhe Queen back was their first priority at the moment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er sensed something amiss the moment she saw the change in the First Elder’s facial expression. She said in a low voice, “Protect Tian’er.” As she spoke, she made the first move by stepping forward, shielding Tian’er. Amongst the five women, the pregnant Tian’er was undoubtedly the person who needs protection the most.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTian’er did not utter a single word the entire time. In actual fact, amongst the five women, she had the highest cultivation base. She merely wanted to see what Shangguan Xue’er would choose to do in such a situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the group, the most powerful cultivators were Tian’er and Shangguan Xue’er. Shangguan Xue’er was the successor of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the big sister amongst the three Shangguan sisters. The three of them were sisters! Hence, Tian’er had been trying her best to build a good rapport with them. Since Tian’er had received Saint Energy at the same time as Zhou Weiqing, she was the most important person when it came to helping Zhou Weiqing with his cultivation. Hence, the other three women naturally would not try to vie with her for the position of ‘first wife’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, when Shangguan Xue’er shielded Tian’er, Tian’er had finally truly acknowledged her as her sister. In any case, in times of trouble, they were a family. Because of Zhou Weiqing, the five of them had already become a family!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTian’er slowly closed her eyes. Piece by piece, her body was equipped with the God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set. Strong Divine Energy ripples were continuously released from her body. Almost immediately, pure Saint Energy had enveloped all five women within it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer Saint Energy did not have the same color as Zhou Weiqing’s - it was of a shimmery sheer shade of gold with specks of starlight. After it enveloped the five women, an enormous phantom image of an angel appeared in the sky, albeit indistinctly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twelve sidhe elders immediately had a gloomy look on their face. They could clearly sense what the enormous phantom image of an angel brought. It was not as simple as the Hell’s Angel that Zhou Weiqing summoned, but the actual Divine Angel. Furthermore, the Divine Angel had six wings on its back.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Seraph, an existence that was on par with the Demon God! Perhaps it was slightly inferior to the Demon God, but gods such as the Nature Goddess could not be compared to it.\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing managed to summon the Demon God the last time and even caused the Sidhe Queen to deal with it at full force. This time, one of his women could actually summon a Divine Angel. How strong were they exactly?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Divine Seraph descended from the sky; its strong power had suppressed the twelve Heavenly Emperor Stage elders of the sidhe to the point where they were unable to mobilize the atmospheric energy. Even the Nature Elements in the air were constantly refueling the Divine Angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTian’er stood in the middle of the four women. She was currently experiencing bouts of weakness. However, what shocked her was the fact that an extremely pure Saint Energy was gradually channeled into her body from her belly, causing the weakness to slowly vanish.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on Tian’er’s current cultivation base, her deterrence force was greater than her combat strength - just like Zhou Weiqing when he summoned the Demon God. The Divine Seraph’s power could sufficiently intimidate Heavenly God Stage powerhouses, but she had no control over it. At most, she could only forcefully help to raise their defense.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twelve elders, who were about to take action, were stuck. Under such circumstances, they would not dare to make any move without careful deliberation. They were confused! They had already experienced the Sword of the Demon God once, but this time, they did not have the Sidhe Queen’s guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, a sidhe powerhouse rushed over at top speed. He was a Heavenly King member of the sidhe. Shock was written all over his face, but he did not seem to have seen the enormous Divine Seraph. Before he got there, his voice had been heard.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elders, quick take a look. The ancient tree of life…something seems to have happened to the ancient tree of life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twelve elders recognized him. He was a tribe member who was in-charge of guarding the ancient Sidhe tree. When they heard what he said, the faces of the twelve elders immediately turned pale with fright. They could no longer be bothered to deal with Tian’er and the other women. They quickly retreated and headed in a different direction.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er and company heaved a sigh of relief. Tian’er, who was in the middle, said, “Let’s take a look too.” At once, without withdrawing the Seraph, a golden light flashed, sweeping all five of them before following the elders who were headed in the same direction.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancient tree of life was undoubtedly of extreme importance to the sidhe. It was also the entire sealed grounds’ source of energy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore importantly, the ancient tree of life was vital in producing the offsprings of the sidhe - every single member was born from it. They were initially born as energy bodies, but in the course of time, they would gradually grow into sidhe. Once there was something wrong with the ancient tree of life, the sidhe would face extermination. They would have to sacrifice the Sidhe Queen in order to restore the ancient tree of life again. However, at the moment, the Sidhe Queen had been missing for more than a day.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twelve elders immediately rushed over to the ancient tree of life. However, when they saw it, they couldn’t help but go into a trance - their concerns from before had vanished completely.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancient tree of life was an enormous ancient tree that stood about a hundred meters tall, and was almost two hundred meters in diameter. Its trunk was extremely thick and solid; its countless branches were extended, with every leaf looking like they were carved from emerald jadeites. It was brimming with endless vitality.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was also where the Sidhe Queen resided. The life aura emitted by every inch of the ancient tree of life played an important role in sustaining the sidhe’s sealed grounds, as well as ensuring its survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, at this very moment, the ancient tree of life had undergone an earth-shattering change. Every single branch of the enormous ancient tree started moving, but instead of wilting, they were releasing auspicious qi.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaint golden auspicious qi fluttered around those huge branches, enveloping the entire ancient tree of life within it. As each branch moved, it would cause the life aura of the tree to become denser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the area where the ancient tree of life was connected to the earth could clearly be seen. The surrounding soil was broken up, and the ancient tree of life was growing upwards continuously. Additionally, as the branches continued dancing, they were also extending at the same time. The terrifyingly massive life aura ignited a brand new feeling in all the sidhe that were gathered around the ancient tree of life. Their cultivation base seemed to be making gradual progress, without them cultivating.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This… this is?” After the twelve elders snapped out of their momentary daze, they had looks of disbelief in their eyes. Perhaps ordinary sidhe might not be aware of what was happening, but the elders who had been living for more than a thousand years were able to see what was going on. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything that had happened to the ancient Sidhe Tree before their eyes could only mean one thing - evolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ancient tree of life is actually evolving?” The First Elder swallowed his saliva. After he had gotten over his disbelief, he was overwhelmed with extreme joy. He even started jumping around, hugging the elder next to him while crying out, “The ancient tree of life has evolved, it really has evolved. This is great, simply amazing! It has evolved. Did you guys see it? It has evolved.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter receiving confirmation from the First Elder, every member of the sidhe couldn’t help but cheer jubilantly. Yes, they had witnessed the most unbelievable sight. Furthermore, to the sidhe, the evolution brought about incredible benefits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evolution of the ancient tree of life meant that their survival and the continuation of their lineage would be a lot easier. It also meant that the sidhe would become stronger.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-281-3\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-282-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-282-1","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
