Enough for dear old dad to buy a sparkling new tennis racket and a new can of bright neon- yellow tennis balls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a little tinge of melancholy as I picked up my sweater to leave Armstrong Travel, my check safely in my purse. Ruby gave me a huge hug, a real hug, not like Janice\u0027s porcelain babydoll hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved good-bye to Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower, and the Hawaiian sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feel free to come back anytime!\" Ruby said. \"I\u0027m really going to miss you. You\u0027re one of a kind, Raven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are, too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really was, and it was nice to have finally bonded with someone who was different from the average Dullsvillian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some day you\u0027ll find a one-of-a-kind guy who is just like you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Ruby!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the most tender thing anyone had ever said to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Kyle Garrison, Dullsville\u0027s golf pro, came in to flirt with Ruby. She had found a lot of one-of-a-kinds for herself. But she deserved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed my paycheck on my night table, and I curled up in bed, happy that my prison sentence was over and that I could cash the check tomorrow and proudly hand all my earnings over to Dad. But of course I couldn\u0027t sleep. I lay awake all night, wondering what my one- of-a-kind guy would look like. I prayed he didn\u0027t wear plaid pants like Kyle the golf pro. Then I thought about the guy at the Mansion. And wondered if I\u0027d already met my one-of-a-kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you so smiley about?\" Trevor asked me the next day after lunch. I couldn\u0027t help but smile, even to Trevor. I was that happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m retired.\" I beamed. \"Now I can just live off the interest!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Congratulations. But I got so used to seeing you in your cute secretary outfits. You can wear them just for me now,\" he said, leaning in close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get off,\" I yelled, pushing him away. \"You\u0027re not going to spoil my day!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t spoil your day,\" he said, standing back. \"I\u0027m proud of you.\" He smiled a gorgeous smile, but it was mixed with underlying evil. \"Now you should have enough money to take me out. I like horror films.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they\u0027re too scary for children like you. I\u0027ll call you in a couple years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and walked on. This time he didn\u0027t stop me. I guess he really wasn\u0027t going to spoil my day after all. Eighth period was finally over. I quickly went to meet Becky at my locker for an after-school ice cream and Mansion plan update. There was a crowd of students standing around my locker. Becky tried to lead me away, but I pushed past her, through the gawking students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I approached, the gawking students stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my locker, and my heart fell to the floor. Hanging by rope attached to silver duct tape was my father\u0027s Prince tennis racket and a sign that read, GAME OVER! I WIN! My head started to spin like in The Exorcist. Trevor Mitchell had kept the racket the whole time. Could he have somehow gotten it the day Creepy Man came to school?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body shook with fury. All those ringing phone lines, all those angry customers, all the boring faxes, the sickening taste of envelopes. Watching people fly, drive, and ski their way out of Dullsville as I handed them their tickets to freedom. All because Trevor had been waiting for the right moment to return the racket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a scream that started in my boots and ended echoing off the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral startled teachers ran out to see what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raven, are you okay?\" Ms. Lenny asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know if the crowd had dispersed or was still hanging on; I only saw the tennis racket. I couldn\u0027t breathe, much less speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Mr. Burns shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you choking? Do you have asthma?\" Ms. Lenny asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trevor Mitchell--\" I began through gritted teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s been beaten up. He\u0027s in the hospital!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where? When?\" the panicked teachers inquired alternately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. \"I don\u0027t know how or where!\" I turned to them, my body fuming and my head ready to explode. \"But I\u0027ll tell you this-- it\u0027ll be soon!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe puzzled teachers stared back. I grabbed the tennis racket with all my might, yanking it so hard the duct tape ripped off a band of green paint from my already grungy locker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bolted out of school, thirsting for blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudents were scattered on the front lawn, waiting for rides. When I didn\u0027t find Trevor, I marched around the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spotted him at the bottom of the hill on the soccer field. Waiting for me. He was surrounded by the entire soccer team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor had planned this. He had patiently waited for this day as I impatiently worked. He knew I\u0027d come after him. He knew I\u0027d be fuming. He knew I\u0027d want to fight. And now he could prove to his buddies that he was king again, that he had gotten Gothic Girl, if not by the tree, then by the racket. And he wanted all his buddies to witness it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved quickly, charged with a bloodthirsty rage. I stormed down the hill to the soccer field, thirteen jocks and one proud antagonist staring at me. Everyone waiting for me to get the bait, and the bait was Trevor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed past the soccer snobs and walked up to Trevor, clutching my dad\u0027s racket, ready for the kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had it the whole time,\" he confessed. \"I chased that freaky butler dude down that day after school. He wanted to give the racket back himself, but I told him I was your boyfriend. He seemed disappointed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told him you were my boyfriend? Gross!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s grosser for me, babe. You\u0027d be going out with a soccer player. I\u0027d be going out with a freak show!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled back the racket to take a swing. \"I was going to return it sooner, but you looked so happy going to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to have to wear more than a golf glove when I get through with you this time!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swung at him and he jumped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d come running after me. Girls always do!\" he announced proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis crowd of puppets laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re running after me, too, aren\u0027t you, Trevor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" I continued. \"Tell your friends! They\u0027re all here. But I\u0027m sure they knew it all along. Tell them why you\u0027re doing this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about, freak?\" I could see by his expression he was ready for a battle, but he wasn\u0027t expecting to play this kind of game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m talking about love,\" I said coyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole crowd laughed. I had a weapon that was better than any two-hundred-dollar racket: humiliation. To accuse a soccer snob of being attracted to a Gothic girl was one thing, but to use this mushy gushy word in front of a sixteen-year-old macho guy was sure to bring the house down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re really freaking out!\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so embarrassed. It\u0027s rather cute, really,\" I said smugly and smiled at the goalie. \"Trevor Mitchell loves me. Trevor Mitchell loves me!\" I sang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor didn\u0027t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re on drugs, girl,\" Trevor declared. \"Lame comeback, Trevor.\" I looked at all his smiling soccer snob friends and then glared at him. \"It was so obvious the way you felt, I should have known all along.\" Then I said in my loudest voice, \"Trevor Mitchell, you\u0027re in love with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, you clown! Like I have a poster of you on my bedroom wall. You\u0027re nothing but a skank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skank bit hurt, but I let the pain fuel me for the next round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t go to Oakley Woods with a poster. You didn\u0027t dress up like a vampire to impress a poster. And you didn\u0027t hide my dad\u0027s racket so you could gain the attention of a raging poster!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soccer guys must have been impressed by my argument, because they didn\u0027t attack me or defend Trevor, but instead waited to see what would happen next. \"None of your friends here give me the time of day,\" I went on. \"It\u0027s \u0027cause they don\u0027t care about me, but you care. You care like crazy. You\u0027re telling me the time every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re crazy! You\u0027re nothing but a drugged-up, freaked-out loser girl, and that\u0027s all you\u0027ll ever be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor looked at Matt, who only smiled awkwardly and shrugged his shoulders. There were snickers from his other mates and whispered words I couldn\u0027t hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me so bad,\" I shouted in his face. \"And you can\u0027t have me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came at me, everything swinging, and it was a good thing I had my dad\u0027s tennis racket to defend myself against his punches. There must have been something pitiful about a furious jock trying to attack a girl, or maybe Trevor\u0027s gang of soccer dudes secretly enjoyed seeing him humiliated, because they pulled him back and Matt, along with the goalie, stepped in front of me like a handsome barricade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Mr. Harris blew his whistle for practice. There was no time for thank-yous to Matt and the others or \"Gee, this has been fun--we\u0027ll have to do it again some time.\" I ran back up the hill triumphantly. I couldn\u0027t wait to tell Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I really believe Trevor was in love with me? No. It seemed as unlikely as the existence of vampires. Mr. Popular loves Ms. Unpopular. But I had made a good case, and the important thing was, everyone had bought it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was finally free. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-kisses-vampire-kisses-1/page-12.html","bookId":2137,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:52 PM"}
