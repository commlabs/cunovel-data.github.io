He swaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, in Harry\u0027s opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is it, Draco?\" simpered Pansy Parkinson. \"Does it hurt much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw him wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Settle down, settle down,\" said Professor Snape idly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn\u0027t have said \u0027settle down\u0027 if they\u0027d walked in late, he\u0027d have given them detention. But Malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in Snape\u0027s classes; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and generally favored his own students above all others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up his cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir,\" Malfoy called, \"sir, I\u0027ll need help cutting up these daisy roots, because of my arm --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weasley, cut up Malfoy\u0027s roots for him,\" said Snape without looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon went brick red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing wrong with your arm,\" he hissed at Malfoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalfoy smirked across the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon seized his knife, pulled Malfoy\u0027s roots toward him, and began to chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor,\" drawled Malfoy, \"Weasley\u0027s mutilating my roots, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots, then gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, sir --!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" said Snape in his most dangerous voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at Malfoy, then took up the knife again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, sir, I\u0027ll need this shrivelfig skinned,\" said Malfoy, his voice full of malicious laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Potter, you can skin Malfoy\u0027s shrivelfig,\" said Snape, giving Harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry took Malfoy\u0027s shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use. Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking. Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seen your pal Hagrid lately?\" he asked them quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of your business,\" said Ron jerkily, without looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid he won\u0027t be a teacher much longer,\" said Malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow. \"Father\u0027s not very happy about my injury --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep talking, Malfoy, and I\u0027ll give you a real injury,\" snarled Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"¨C he\u0027s complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of Magic. Father\u0027s got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury like this\" -- he gave a huge, fake sigh -- \"who knows if my arm\u0027ll ever be the same again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s why you\u0027re putting it on,\" said Harry, accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger, \"To try to get Hagrid fired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, \"partly, Potter. But there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was his worst subject, and his great fear of Professor Snape made things ten times worse. His potion, which was supposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned --\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orange, Longbottom,\" said Snape, ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the cauldron, so that everyone could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn\u0027t you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one cat spleen was needed? Didn\u0027t I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he was on the verge of tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, sir,\" said Hermione, \"please, I could help Neville put it right --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,\" said Snape coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. \"Longbottom, at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me!\" he moaned to Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Harry,\" said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry\u0027s brass scales, \"have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning -- they reckon Sirius Black\u0027s been sighted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other side of the table, Malfoy looked up, listening closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not too far from here,\" said Seamus, who looked excited. \"It was a Muggle who saw him. \u0027Course, she didn\u0027t really understand. The Muggles think he\u0027s just an ordinary criminal, don\u0027t they? So she phoned the telephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he was gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not too far from here ...\" Ron repeated, looking significantly at Harry. He turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely. \"What, Malfoy? Need something else skinned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Malfoy\u0027s eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed Harry. He leaned across the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s right,\" said Harry offhandedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalfoy\u0027s thin mouth was curving in a mean smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, if it was me,\" he said quietly, \"I\u0027d have done something before now. I wouldn\u0027t be staying in school like a good boy, I\u0027d be out there looking for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about, Malfoy?\" said Ron roughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you know, Potter?\" breathed Malfoy, his pale eyes narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalfoy let out a low, sneering laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027d rather not risk your neck,\" he said. \"Want to leave it to the Dementors, do you? But if it was me, I\u0027d want revenge. I\u0027d hunt him down myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" said Harry angrily, but at that moment Snape called, \"You should have finished adding your ingredients by now; this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away while it simmers and then we\u0027ll test Longbottom\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly. Hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth, so that Snape wouldn\u0027t see. Harry and Ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did Malfoy mean?\" Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle\u0027s mouth \"Why would I want revenge on Black? He hasn\u0027t done anything to me -- yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s making it up,\" said Ron savagely. \"He\u0027s trying to make you do something stupid...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to Neville, who was cowering by his cauldron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone gather \u0027round,\" said Snape, his black eyes glittering, \"and watch what happens to Longbottom\u0027s toad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don\u0027t doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins looked excited. Snape picked up Trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into Neville\u0027s potion, which was now green. He trickled a few drops down Trevor\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment of hushed silence, in which Trevor gulped; then there was a small pop, and Trevor the tadpole was wriggling in Snape\u0027s palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor, and he reappeared suddenly, fully grown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five points from Gryffindor,\" said Snape, which wiped the smiles from every face. \"I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall. Harry was still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething about Snape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right! Why didn\u0027t you lie, Hermione? You should\u0027ve said Neville did it all by himself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione didn\u0027t answer. Ron looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry turned too. They were at the top of the steps now, watching the rest of the class pass them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was right behind us,\" said Ron, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He smirked at Harry and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There she is,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched her bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you do that?\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" said Hermione, joining them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back at the bottom of the stairs again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Hermione looked slightly confused. \"Oh -- I had to go back for something. Oh no --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA seam had split on Hermione\u0027s bag. Harry wasn\u0027t surprised; he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you carrying all these around with you?\" Ron asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know how many subjects I\u0027m taking,\" said Hermione breathlessly. \"Couldn\u0027t hold these for me, could you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But --\" Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking at the covers. \"You haven\u0027t got any of these subjects today. It\u0027s only Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes,\" said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same. \"I hope there\u0027s something good for lunch, I\u0027m starving,\" she added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"D\u0027you get the feeling Hermione\u0027s not telling us something?\" Ron asked Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Lupin wasn\u0027t there when they arrived at his first Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their books, quills, and parchment, and were talking when he finally entered the room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teacher\u0027s desk. He was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train, as though he had had a few square meals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon,\" he said. \"Would you please put all your books back in your bags. Today\u0027s will be a practical lesson. You will need only your wands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books. They had never had a practical Defense Against the Dark Arts class before, unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right then,\" said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. \"If you\u0027d follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePuzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor Lupin out of the classroom. He led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the Poltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeeves didn\u0027t look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; then he wiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loony, loopy Lupin,\" Peeves sang. \"Loony, loopy Lupin, loony, loopy Lupin --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRude and unmanageable as he almost always was, Peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor Lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise, he was still smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,\" he said pleasantly. \"Mr. Filch won\u0027t be able to get in to his brooms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. However, Peeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin\u0027s words, except to blow a loud wet raspberry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a useful little spell,\" he told the class over his shoulder. \"Please watch closely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised the wand to shoulder height, said, \"Waddiwasi!\" and pointed it at Peeves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down Peeves\u0027s left nostril; he whirled upright and zoomed away, cursing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool, sir!\" said Dean Thomas in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Dean,\" said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again. \"Shall we proceed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with increased respect. He led them down a second corridor and stopped, right outside the staffroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inside, please,\" said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sitting in a low armchair, and he looked around as the class filed in. His eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth. As Professor Lupin came in and made to close the door behind him, Snape said, \"Leave it open, Lupin. I\u0027d rather not witness this.\" He got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowing behind him. At the doorway he turned on his heel and said, \"Possibly no one\u0027s warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough that he bullied Neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front of other teachers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Lupin had raised his eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation,\" he said, \"and I am sure he will perform it admirably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville\u0027s face went, if possible, even redder. Snape\u0027s lip curled, but he left, shutting the door with a snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, then,\" said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing to worry about,\" said Professor Lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm. \"There\u0027s a Boggart in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about. Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks -- I\u0027ve even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a Boggart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione put up her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a shape-shifter,\" she said. \"It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t have put it better myself,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione glowed. \"So the Boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a Boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This means,\" said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville\u0027s small sputter of terror, \"that we have a huge advantage over the Boggart before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very off-putting, but Harry had a go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er -- because there are so many of us, it won\u0027t know what shape it should be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Precisely,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down, looking a little disappointed. \"It\u0027s always best to have company when you\u0027re dealing with a Boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a Boggart make that very mistake -- tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The charm that repels a Boggart is simple, yet it requires force of mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a Boggart is laughter. What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please...riddikulus!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Riddikulus!\" said the class together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Very good. But that was the easy part, I\u0027m afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you come in, Neville.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, Neville,\" said Professor Lupin. \"First things first: what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville\u0027s lips moved, but no noise came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t catch that, Neville, sorry,\" said Professor Lupin cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, \"Professor Snape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor Lupin, however, looked thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor Snape...hmmm...Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er -- yes,\" said Neville nervously. \"But -- I don\u0027t want the Boggart to turn into her either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, you misunderstand me,\" said Professor Lupin, now smiling. \"I wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville looked startled, but said, \"Well...always the same hat. A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top. And a long dress...green, normally...and sometimes a fox-fur scarf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a handbag?\" prompted Professor Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A big red one,\" said Neville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right then,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Can you picture those clothes very clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind\u0027s eye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Neville uncertainty, plainly wondering what was coming next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the Boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees you, it will assume the form of Professor Snape,\" said Lupin. \"And you will raise your wand -- thus -- and cry \"Riddikulus\" -- and concentrate hard on your grandmother\u0027s clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with that big red handbag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled more violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Neville is successful, the Boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn,\" said Professor Lupin. \"I would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, and imagine how you might force it to look comical...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room went quiet. Harry thought...What scared him most in the world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first thought was Lord Voldemort -- a Voldemort returned to full strength. But before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a Boggart-Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black cloak...a long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth...then a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed. Many people had their eyes shut tight. Ron was muttering to himself, \"Take its legs off.\" Harry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron\u0027s greatest fear was spiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone ready?\" said Professor Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn\u0027t ready. How could you make a Dementor less frightening? But he didn\u0027t want to ask for more time; everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neville, we\u0027re going to back away,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Let you have a clear field, all right? I\u0027ll call the next person forward...Everyone back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone beside the wardrobe. He looked pale and frightened, but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the count of three, Neville,\" said Professor Lupin, who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe. \"One -- two -- three -- now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin\u0027s wand and hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor Snape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing down upon him, reaching inside his robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"R -- r -- riddikulus! \" squeaked Neville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a long, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a roar of laughter; the Boggart paused, confused, and Professor Lupin shouted, \"Parvati! Forward!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was another crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged mummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising --\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Riddikulus!\" cried Parvati.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bandage unraveled at the mummy\u0027s feet; it became entangled, fell face forward, and its head rolled off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seamus!\" roared Professor Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeamus darted past Parvati.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack! Where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal, green-tinged face -- a banshee. She opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek that made the hair on Harry\u0027s head stand on end -- \"Riddikulus!\" shouted Seamus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack! The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle, then -- crack!- became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before -- crack! -- becoming a single, bloody eyeball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s confused!\" shouted Lupin. \"We\u0027re getting there! Dean!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean hurried forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack! The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Riddikulus!\" yelled Dean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent! Ron, you next!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon leapt forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then --\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Riddikulus!\" bellowed Ron, and the spider\u0027s legs vanished; it rolled over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at Harry\u0027s feet. He raised his wand, ready, but --\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here!\" shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. Crack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked wildly around to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air in front of Lupin, who said, \"Riddikulus!\" almost lazily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forward, Neville, and finish him off!\" said Lupin as the Boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach. Crack! Snape was back. This time Neville charged forward looking determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Riddikulus!\" he shouted, and they had a split second\u0027s view of Snape in his lacy dress before Neville let out a great \"Ha!\" of laughter, and the Boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent!\" cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause. \"Excellent, Neville. Well done, everyone...Let me see...five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the Boggart -- ten for Neville because he did it twice...and five each to Hermione and Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I didn\u0027t do anything,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class, Harry,\" Lupin said lightly. \"Very well, everyone, an excellent lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on Boggarts and summarize it for me...to be handed in on Monday. That will be all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry, however, wasn\u0027t feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the Boggart. Why? Was it because he\u0027d seen Harry collapse on the train, and thought he wasn\u0027t up to much? Had he thought Harry would pass out again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no one else seemed to have noticed anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see me take that banshee?\" shouted Seamus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the hand!\" said Dean, waving his own around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Snape in that hat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my mummy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder why Professor Lupin\u0027s frightened of crystal balls?\" said Lavender thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we\u0027ve ever had, wasn\u0027t it?\" said Ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He seems like a very good teacher,\" said Hermione approvingly. \"But I wish I could have had a turn with the Boggart --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would it have been for you?\" said Ron, sniggering. \"A piece of homework that only got nine out of ten?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-harry-potter-3/page-7.html","bookId":1564,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:34 PM"}
