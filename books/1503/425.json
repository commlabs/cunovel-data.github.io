(1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhan LingTian’s question might seem like a very simple question on the surface, but it truly showed many things. Firstly, with his status at the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, asking such a question already showed that he now thought of Zhou Weiqing as someone on the same level as himself, and no longer with that superior lofty attitude he once had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, it was clear that he had been impressed, or at least held some respect, towards Zhou Weiqing’s intelligence; otherwise, he would not have asked such a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, Zhou Weiqing did not answer his question directly, instead laughing and saying: “Bro Zhan, being able to step forward at such a critical time of danger, such a courageous and bold move to be able to stare death in the face like that, this little brother here admits freely that I cannot compare in that regard. Respect, respect.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTowards Zhou Weiqing’s flattery, Zhan LingTian showed some disdain, only giving a humph. However, if one looked carefully, they would see the enmity in his eyes towards Zhou Weiqing had already subsided. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the side, Shangguan Fei’er chided him slightly: “Bro Zhan asked you what we should do next.” As she said that, she shook Zhou Weiqing’s arm. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhan LingTian’s gaze was filled with a hint of surprise. The subconscious close intimacy that Shangguan Fei’er displayed towards Zhou Weiqing gave him curious pause.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er also noticed the strange look in his eyes, and she quickly let go of Zhou Weiqing’s arms. Alas, by attempting to cover it up like that, it only made things seem more suspicious. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing said: “There is no rush to leave this place. We have already entered the WanShou Empire borders, it will be better for us to heal up and recover our Heavenly Energy first before we discuss any further action. Otherwise, if we meet any other danger, we might not be so lucky again. After all, it is a rare occurrence that we will be able to just talk our enemies into letting us off.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOriginally, Zhan LingTian thought that Zhou Weiqing would recommend that they leave immediately, and was surprised to hear him recommend the reverse. Starting momentarily, he asked: “Aren’t you afraid that the Blood Red Hell members will turn back and attack us?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing grinned and said: “No, they won’t. That Han Tianyou might seem like a rash and impetuous person, but he is a wily old fox indeed. Do you really think he can’t tell that I was intimidating him with some lies? The Lustre Gem and sending of news, he would at most have a fifty percent belief in it. The main reason is because of Little Red Bean that he actually retreated. Furthermore, it looks like his injuries are more serious than it looks. Otherwise, with his cultivation level, there is no other reason he would be unable to stop Little Red Bean. As such, I judge that they will not return. Having his entire midsection pierced through, and losing an arm, that is definitely something serious for him to take care of. Alright, let’s all start treating our wounds and recovering Heavenly Energy. Fei’er, you stand guard for us first. Hmm… strange… with such a major commotion here, how come the Snow Deer Tribe hasn’t reacted at all?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRight at that moment, a loud booming voice rang out. “That is because this old man ordered them not to.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs soon as that voice rang out, Zhou Weiqing and the others’ faces changed. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat booming voice seemed to come from all directions, as if they were in a wide and spacious valley, with it echoing all around. The voice rumbled on in their ears, and they all felt as if their blood was actually trying to break free of their bodies from the reverberation of the voice. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e*Chitter* The Silver Emperor Little Red Bean gave out a shrill cry as it rose into the sky, looking out for an enemy. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, in the next moment, its body froze in midair, a faint green light appearing all around it, clearly what was restricting its movement totally. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat faint green like was extremely familiar, a Skill that Zhou Weiqing had used many times, the Fetters of Wind. However, Silver Emperors were Dual Attribute Heavenly Beasts with both the Wind and Spatial Attributes, and Little Red Dot was also at the maximum Zong Stage power… being able to restrict its movement totally with just a Fetters of Wind, what kind of cultivation level and power did that require? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShock filled the hearts of all the watching companions. The Wind Attribute signified that the owner of the booming voice was not one of the Blood Red Hell members from earlier. Yet, his cultivation level was definitely not lower than Han Tianyou’s. After all, without a Heavenly King Stage level or higher, how could his Fetters of Wind be that powerful?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Who is it?” Shangguan Fei’er exclaimed out loud. In a flash, she took a defensive stance in front of Zhou Weiqing. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this point, one could tell a bit of her feelings. She did not stand in front of Zhan LingTian, who also came from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and was equally exhausted, but defended Zhou Weiqing. It was clear that in her heart, Zhou Weiqing held a much higher place than Zhan LingTian. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA figure appeared in their sights, walking from the Snow Deer Tribe tents. His height was average, but had a large paunch indeed, with his waistline almost like his height. A head of short black hair, the equally rotund head with a maroon red face. From just a first look, it was as if he was some rich man who had eaten too much good food, and his walk almost seemed unstable. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe was dressed in long black roles, clearly custom made, otherwise it would not be able to totally cover his immense round body like that. The robes were not adorned with any extra ornaments, and the man looked to be around forty-ish years old. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this point, Zhou Weiqing had already stood up. His could clearly sense that when this man appeared, both Shangguan Fei’er and Zhan LingTian seemed at a loss; clearly neither of them knew who this man was. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eForty odd years old Heavenly King Stage powerhouse? That was not impossible, but such a person could not possibly be unknown in the world. Could it be someone from the Heavenly Snow Mountain?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, Zhou Weiqing quickly denied that thought. From Tian’er, he knew that those from the Heavenly Snow Mountain would usually be garbed in white. Even if they were not dressed in white, as those who self profess to be powerhouses born from the snow, the colour they hated most was black. As a result, even the entire WanShou Empire disdained the colour black. For this oversized man to be wearing black, he should not be from the WanShou Empire or the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Furthermore, he did not have any signs of being a beastman. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You do not need to guess anymore, you young kids will not know who this old man is. In the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the only who would know who I am would be that little rascal Shangguan Tianyang.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs soon as the fat man opened his mouth, his words shocked them all. He had actually called Shangguan Tianyang a little rascal. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhan LingTian was enraged, taking a step forward as he exclaimed: “You dare insult my master?” Gathering the bit of Heavenly Energy he had just recovered, he brought out his Light-Dark Divine Spear once more. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, the fat man did not even look at him. Lifting his hand, it was as if Little Red Dot frozen in midair was dragged along by a rope, falling into his palm. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAn insidious, crafty smile appeared on the fat man’s face as he said: “Although I have not personally seen this Lustre Gem you all speak of, I do know that no matter what object tries to send anything, there will be a certain level of energy fluctuations. Only that little fool Han Tianyou would believe you. As for this little Silver Emperor, trying to escape from my hands would be impossible. So… you… Zhou Little Fatty right, come on and try and fool this old man, let’s see what means you have to get me to let you all go.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis fat man had appeared so suddenly, and his words were indeed strange. His gaze was fixed on Zhou Weiqing, and though Shangguan Fei’er stood before him defensively, Zhou Weiqing could somehow sense that he could not hide anything from this fat man’s eyes. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAuthor\u0027s Note: A critical character has appeared!
