Don\u0027t tug, Jenny didn\u0027t let me pack very many T-shirts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, fuck that. We\u0027ll hit a souvenir shop later, you can load up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said, and laughed. \"Fuck me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, boy.\" This time he said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex yawned. \"Mm-hmm, that was an energetic twenty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-five,\" he corrected.Energetic twenty minutes . Jesus Christ, she was just like a guy. Weren\u0027t women supposed to be all google-eyed and mushy about sex? Especially just afterward? Shouldn\u0027t she be halfway in love with him by now? Why wasn\u0027t she, dammit? Why wasn\u0027t she all soft-eyed and sexily smiley and clingy, instead of looking like she was ready to get up and make a sandwich? Assuming royalty did such things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know how to make a sandwich?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just checking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put out his right hand and rested it on her bare thigh. Ithad been an energetic twenty-five minutes. They\u0027d wrestled all over the room, finally ending up in the middle of her king-size bed, kissing and licking and sucking and groaning. He\u0027d held off as long as he could, which was a fucking miracle given how she\u0027d used that soft skin and those big eyes to great effect, given how she\u0027d stroked and teased and sighed against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now they were done and… what? If it was any other woman, he\u0027d get dressed and go home and promise to call her in the morning, and he always did. And they\u0027d get together a few more times and then he\u0027d move away, or she would, or they\u0027d decide they weren\u0027t compatible, or they would just stop returning phone calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t want to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe yawned again. \"Well, that was fun, but we both have to get up early tomorrow. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShewas just like a guy. He didn\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry. After years of not giving a rat\u0027s ass if a girl wanted him around or not, he didn\u0027t want to leave and she couldn\u0027t wait to see him gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t come,\" he said by way of answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged against his shoulder. \"It\u0027s all right. I had fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t come last time, either. I figured it was because it was so quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Itwas quick,\" she agreed with irritating cheer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t, anymore, is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anymore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed and crossed one knee over the other, swinging her small foot back and forth. \"No, no. I had kind of a tough year last year and it\u0027s hard for me to relax… you know. With a gentleman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled in the dark. \"Have there been that many gentlemen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No you don\u0027t. I\u0027m not touching that one with a barge pole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no good, Shel. And I\u0027m not saying this to challenge your male ego in any way. It just… doesn\u0027t work for me anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even by yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even by myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since…\" He thought about what he\u0027d seen in the news, way back. \"Since those terrorists or whatever almost killed your dad? And your brother had to take over the country? Since then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess,\" she said stiffly. \"I didn\u0027t mark the date on my calendar when I stopped having orgasms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no big deal, Shel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It really isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed her thigh, thinking. \"But you could come before, right?\" He tried to remember how old she was. Twenty-four, twenty-five? \"I mean, you weren\u0027t a virgin last year, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. And that\u0027s all we\u0027re saying about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you give it some thought—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just saying, we could probably figure this out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Rivers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooh, I love it when you go all gritty and steely on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, she laughed. \"Shut up, you ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And as a matter of fact, I do have to get up early tomorrow. Everyone has to get up early on Tuesdays. It\u0027s like a law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up. \"What\u0027d you do with my pants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check over by the lamp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one? There\u0027s a hundred of them in this place.\" He tripped over something and stifled a curse. \"And they\u0027re all off. Are you laughing? You\u0027d better not be laughing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Dr. Rivers,\" she said gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally found them and in short order had dressed, then sat on the bed to tie his shoes. \"It\u0027s no trouble to stay,\" he said, somewhat lamely, because she obviously wanted him to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to.\" He could see her smiling in the gloom of the room. \"I\u0027m glad you came over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll see me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s not necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent and kissed her. \"You will, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel her gaze on him all the way to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny rapped on the bedroom door. Alex glanced at her watch and smiled. \"Put it through,\" she called through the door. \"And go to bed, for the love of God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer bedside phone beeped. She folded the magazine in half, dropped it beside her, and picked up the phone. \"I was sound asleep,\" she said by way of greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lie like old people drive, m\u0027dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hoped Iwas waking you up. You know what time it is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what time is it? That wasn\u0027t rhetorical; Edmund took the clocks out of here—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying to keep you in the office during salmon season?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—and my damned watch stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, buy a battery-operated one. Honestly. It\u0027s three-thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn! What\u0027s Jenny still doing up? Isn\u0027t what\u0027s-his-name, that guy we hired last year—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reynolds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, how come he\u0027s not answering on third shift?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny had a hot date. And, being Jenny, she can\u0027t take an evening off without punishing herself, so I guess she\u0027s pulling an all-nighter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny had a hotwhat ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, seriously, did you really call me in the dead of night to get all the gossip on the staff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Edmund won\u0027t tell me shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because you go around trying to fix things. I can\u0027t imagine anything worse than finding out the King of Alaska is meddling in your love life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, shaddup. So, did I interrupt you getting ready for bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" she said, humoring him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liar! How can you look me in the face—so to speak—and lie like that, you little brat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it helps that my father is a sociopath, and my lady-in-waiting is a neurotic, tightly wound bundle of nerves with a crush—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? That\u0027s who she had the hot date with? The crush?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got a name, Dad,\" she said with exaggerated scorn, then realized that she\u0027d forgotten it again. It wasn\u0027t an ordinary name like John. Heron? Vulture?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah. So what were you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked the magazine up, flipped it over, and read the cover story aloud: \"Those Wacky Royals Are Just Like Us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently. They got a picture of Prince Harry outside a pub—morons, like they don\u0027t know he hasn\u0027t touched a drop in two years—and there\u0027s one of David and Christina at the send-off of the Queen Mary III. God, I can\u0027t believe you talked her into that one, she\u0027s so sick of cruise ships. Oh, and here\u0027s one of Nicky on the slopes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddammit!\" the king cursed. \"The press was supposed to leave the kid alone on his spring break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just one candid. It\u0027s amazing—they got the names right, but not the place or the day. How do you get the place wrong when you bought the picture? I mean, you\u0027d think the photog would say, \u0027FYI, I was on the Swiss Alps when I took this,\u0027 or whatever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who gives a rat shit? I\u0027ll have Edmund chew some ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Dad. Besides, what was he even doing on the slopes in the first place? I thought he was in disgrace after the explosion thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This happened just before. Dammit! I\u0027ll get \u0027em all fired, just watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad. Relax. It\u0027s not that big a deal, why are you turning it into one? Nicky smiling, he doesn\u0027t even care. You have to admit, we don\u0027t have to put up with it nearly as much as most royals. Don\u0027t rock the boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027twhat ? Did you get mixed up and forget who you were talking to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A deal\u0027s a deal. They said they\u0027d leave him alone for spring break, and I\u0027d give \u0027em you for this aquarium thing. Punks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, very nice,\" she said dryly, but without heat, as that was how it worked. For all his protests, at fourteen Nicky was still a child, and the family tried to limit his dealings with the national and international press.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor her part, Alex didn\u0027t much care. They were as much a part of her life as her blue eyes and carefully chosen wardrobe. It\u0027s how things were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re lying in your bed, wide awake, reading trash about yourself at three o\u0027clock in the morning. Is that about right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to these guys, the real reason I\u0027m here in Minot is to cover up my raging heroin drug use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a sly one, girly. I had no idea you were a junkie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t say that anymore. And actually—I haven\u0027t been up here alone all night. I mean, I\u0027m alone now, but earlier—I—I met someone, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" She could hear her father try to keep the shock out of his voice. \"Who is it? What\u0027s he like?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-11.html","bookId":2790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM"}
