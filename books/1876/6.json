I\u0027m sitting in my new room, on my bed, with my head against the wall. It\u0027s a little guest room off the main hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl wraps her knuckles on my door and pushes it open. \"Hello?\" she says. A massive amount of red hair peers around the door with a strikingly pretty pale face at the center. Impossibly green eyes blink at me. \"Are you Anna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and scoot the edge of my bed. \"Yes. Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks into the room. \"I\u0027m Regina Davenport. I\u0027m Mr. Stevens\u0027 assistant. I heard you\u0027re the new intern, well, the only intern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfused, I ask, \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs, \"I\u0027m sorry. I thought it was common knowledge. Every year Le Femme takes in one intern, and every year that intern quits before it\u0027s over. Sottero usually scoops them up and it pisses Mr. Stevens off to no end. We\u0027ve never seen him on speaking terms with someone interning after this long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth is hanging open, \"It\u0027s only been a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyebrows lift, \"Yeah, like I said, a long time in internland.\" She hesitates and then asks shyly, \"Is it true? Do you really get to run this if you finish the internship? I mean, it seems like a sweet deal, assuming you can tolerate Stevens...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod slowly. \"He chases off the other interns? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegina looks back toward the door like she shouldn\u0027t be talking, but she\u0027s the only person I\u0027ve seen today that is within a few years of me. I know we\u0027ll be working together if I stay here and so does she. She grins, \"He\u0027s just difficult to get along with. He\u0027s got his own ideas about things and if yours don\u0027t line up, well, there\u0027s no future for you here. But he offered you this, so he must respect you an awful lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what to say, so I nod. She says, \"He\u0027s looking for you. He said something about some artwork to show you. I told him I\u0027d check, that I thought you were sleeping. What would you like me to tell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s protecting me from him. I don\u0027t really understand why. I don\u0027t even know her. A thought occurs to me and I blurt out, \"You\u0027re trying to make sure that I don\u0027t burn out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles like she\u0027s guilty and nods. \"A girl\u0027s gotta make a living, Miss Lamore. And it\u0027s so much prettier out here than in Manhattan. No commuting. Can you imagine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally understand, \"You\u0027d be the assistant who stays out here, with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, smiling, hope flowing from her eyes. \"That\u0027s the plan, Ma\u0027am. So, what should I say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him I\u0027ll be right there. And Regina...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call me, Ma\u0027am. I\u0027m younger than you. And if you talk to me like I\u0027m an old person, I\u0027ll truly lose my mind.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-6.html","bookId":1876,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:12 PM"}
