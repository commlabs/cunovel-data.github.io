It’s going to be insane. People are going to start following you around. Oh! I can pretend to be your assistant!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we can double date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, dear…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Chad always comes to the Daniels Family Christmas Dinner Extravaganza, which you never come to even though I’ve invited you every year, you hooch.” Madison clamped her hands together. “Now you can’t get out of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe so wasn’t a fan of the holidays, and honestly, it hurt to see Madison making happy plans. She was going to be so disappointed when, at the beginning of the year, Chad and Bridget went their separate ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison finally settled down, and Bridget opted to eat in for lunch. She was half afraid to visit any of the local joints. Just before three in the afternoon, their office door opened and a delivery guy stood there, awkwardly carrying four dozen red roses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour dozen roses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow. Last night must’ve been amazing for Chase to send Madison an arrangement like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget went back to staring at her computer screen. She needed to e-mail the catering company if they hadn’t gotten a definite amount back for the—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there a Bridget Rodgers here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting her chin, her gaze landed on the flower guy. Confused, she glanced over at a grinning Madison. “Um, that’s me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man smiled as he moved toward her desk. She hastily cleared off a little section on the corner. “Someone must really love you,” the man said, placing the vase down. “Have a nice day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget stared at the delivery guy as he strode out of her office, and then her gaze fell back to the roses. Holy crap…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Gore must’ve ordered them or made Chad do it. That could be the only reason why they were for her, but they…they were beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there a card?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, barely able to see Madison from behind the forest of stems. There was a card, tucked neatly between a dewy green stem and baby’s breath. Very carefully, she pulled the card out and slid open the little envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten in pretty calligraphy was a short message that might not have told why the flowers were sent but definitely who had sent them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m still very relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she stared at the little card, there was no fighting the slow smile that crept over her face. Yeah. He was still relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter getting an earful from Chase about “dating” his woman’s good friend and then putting up with Chandler’s snide-ass comments about going the way of every guy around them and settling down, Chad was ready to bang his head through the wall when his cell went off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpecting the hourly check-in from Miss Gore, because who knew what kind of trouble he could get into in his own apartment, he swiped the cell off his kitchen counter. The text wasn’t from his babysitter. Oh, no, it was Bridget. His publicist all but forced them to exchange numbers before they went out to dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you for the roses. They’re beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout two seconds later another text came through. Still not relevant, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile hit his lips, and it was a good thing his brothers had left by then because he was sure he looked like a dumbass. He liked her response—a lot—and he also liked that she didn’t text like a sixteen-year-old girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike most of the women he hung out with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad put the phone back on the counter and went to the fridge, grabbing the chicken he’d marinated earlier. Dumping it on the Foreman grill, he poked the breasts around with a fork until they were placed perfectly in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the lid. Juices sizzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he glanced over the counter at his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to the counter and tossed the fork onto the countertop. Rocking back on his heels, he stared at the grill. That lasted about thirty seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell,” he muttered, spinning toward his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicking it up, he tapped the screen and stared at the message. There were no plans tonight, but tomorrow was supposed to be a movie. He hadn’t gone to a theatre since he was in high school. Movie premieres not included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnically, he had no reason to be in contact with Bridget, since this was kind of like a day off. And he really hadn’t had a reason for sending her flowers other than…he’d wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, there was more to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning around, he leaned against the counter and stretched out the kink in his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t because of the kiss they’d shared. Although just thinking about that kiss got him hard as a rock, but it was what she’d said. That she’d agreed to pretend to be his girlfriend because it would help out her dating after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat. The. Fuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst off, he doubted she needed the help. Secondly, he wasn’t too keen on being a stepping-stone. So he sent her roses. Strange response to something like that, sure, but he doubted she was thinking about her future boyfriends now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sent her a text back. Glad you liked the flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could put the phone back down, his fingers just kept on typing. And glad you liked the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped the cell and checked his chicken. About a minute later, his phone went off and he piddled around the kitchen for another three minutes before he went to check it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never said I liked the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin pulled at his lips as he sent a message back. You didn’t have to. I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe response was immediate. Do I need to remind you that YOU kissed ME both times?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad tipped his head back and laughed, but he checked his chicken before responding. Otherwise it looked like he was just standing in the kitchen, holding his phone, which he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter slopping the grilled bird on a plate and cutting it up into tiny pieces like he was preparing it for a child, he sent another text. Do I need to remind you that YOU enjoyed it both times?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe response was pretty quick. Le sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckling to himself, he carried his food to the couch and ate his dinner while watching the evening news. Exciting stuff there. He let his food settle before he hit the treadmill in his library for the obligatory evening run. Afterward, he stripped off his sweat-soaked shirt and unbelievably did a load of laundry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach time he passed his phone, he looked at it. Each time it rang, there was a stupid feeling in his stomach. By the time he got done cleaning the guest bathroom downstairs and taking a shower, he found himself holding his cell. It was past ten, probably too late to call, not that he was planning to call Bridget. Miss Gore had already set plans for the movie date. He was to pick her up at her place and blah blah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce in bed, his fingers got the best of him. He texted: Good night, Bridget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo minutes later he got the same kind of response, and then he put the phone on the farthest corner of the bedside table. Having an early morning with his off-season trainer, he needed to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, he was still staring at the ceiling, tired, but his mind started messing with him, bringing forth images of Bridget against that very wall of his bedroom, her head thrown back, breasts jutted out as he watched her from his knees. He breathed in deeply and swore he could still taste her sharp arousal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw the sheet off and moved his hand down his stomach. Palming his heavy erection, his back bowed clear off the mattress. Jesus. He hadn’t been strung this tight since college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand stroked down his throbbing shaft and his eyes fell shut. Immediately, the image of Bridget formed in his mind, except he was standing against the wall and she was on her knees. Her mouth replaced his hand and yep, that was all it took. His release pounded down his spine and his hips punched up at his own hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was much later when his heart slowed down, and he was hard again, Bridget’s face firmly planted in his thoughts. This was going to be a long, long night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome Thursday night, Bridget stared at her reflection in the mirror. A movie date…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePepsi meowed in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing over her shoulder, she smiled. “I can’t believe I’m going to the movies with Chad Gamble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cat cocked its head. Shell had the same response during lunch when Bridget had told her that going to the movies with Chad wasn’t that big of a deal. Apparently everything with the ball player was a big deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget turned back to the mirror and tucked her hair behind her ears. The distressed blue jeans and red sweater seemed casual enough for a movie date. Sticking her leg out, she turned her ankle. Her heels were red, blue, black, and yellow. Striped. Awesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStraightening the hem on her sweater, she turned. The roses sat beside her bed. She hadn’t planned on bringing them home yesterday, but she couldn’t leave them in the office. Her ex had sent her flowers once, and they’d been the kind that came in a box. Somewhere between the card, the text messages, and tonight, Bridget decided she should at least enjoy some of the advantages of having a pretend boyfriend, especially the three Fs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlowers. Fine dining. Fine-looking man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd threw in an N: No expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole blackmail aspect was terrible and still irked the hell out of Bridget, but she wasn’t the type of person to continuously dwell on the negative. She had her bitchy moments that lasted a couple of days. She had a right to be ticked off, but this was the hand she was dealt. Though spending the next month mouthing off to Chad might be entertaining for the masses, it wasn’t particularly fun for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she might as well enjoy it because a part of her did like hanging out with him. When they’d been in the club, they’d really clicked. All she had to do was keep her head in the game. Don’t read into anything and most of all do not fall for him. And to keep that from happening, all she had to do was remember the three girls in the paper he’d slept with a few days after they met at the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when was the last time she went to the movies with a guy? Too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way out, she stopped by Pepsi and scratched him under the chin and then placed a quick kiss on his furry little head. She grabbed her bag and rushed down her apartment steps before he got there. She didn’t want him to be in her apartment. The place was her sanctuary and that was entirely too intimate for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad in her place was a line she wasn’t going to cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she hit the front lobby door, she saw Todd Newton. It was strange seeing him wearing more than boxers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled when he saw her and caught the door, holding it open. “Hey, Miss Rodgers…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget grinned. “Hi, Todd.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze dipped. “You’re looking good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering their conversations had always been limited to seeing each other across the hall, this was the first time they were within breathing distance. Up close, she noticed Todd’s hazel eyes were more green than brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s really good-looking, she realized. “Thanks. Same goes for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTodd’s smile spread. He didn’t have dimples like Chad, but it was still a great smile. “You heading out?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Bridget could respond, a deep male voice cut in. “Yes. She’s going out with me.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tempting-the-player-gamble-brothers-2/page-19.html","bookId":2004,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:04 PM"}
