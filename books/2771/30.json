Right here, right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb, please, not so loud.\" My mom glances nervously at the neighbors\u0027 houses, making sure they don\u0027t witness the scene I\u0027m about to make. God, I wish she\u0027d stop worrying about appearances and see that her family is falling apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are people saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, Caleb. Everything\u0027s fine. Now stop this nonsense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step into the middle of the front yard and say as loud as I can, \"Are they saying I\u0027ve been starting fights at school? Are they saying I\u0027m harassing Maggie? Making my friends drink alcohol? You think it\u0027s true, don\u0027t you? Come on, hit me with the fucking gossip already!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027ve crossed the line,\" Dad says, stepping between us. \"Go inside the house and calm down. You can apologize to your mother before supper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snap, like a rubber band that\u0027d been pulled so tight for so long it just breaks apart violently. Kissing Maggie, school suspension, Kendra\u0027s manipulations, my sister\u0027s warning, my parents\u0027 inability to face reality, my mom\u0027s addiction problem, the false gossip ... all of it is driving me nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving this spot until we have it all out on the table,\" I say. I look at my sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb!\" Leah cries. \"Please stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad\u0027s posture stiffens even more, his lips purse and the expression in his eyes is hard. \"This is my home,\" he says. \"And as long as you live here you\u0027ll abide by my rules. Now go inside the house, leave your mother in peace, and ... calm ... down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow, hard. It\u0027s not easy for me to say the next words coming from my mouth, but I can\u0027t hold it in any longer. My family is screwed up, each and every one of us. They want to stay ignorant, to forget reality and live in a made-up world they\u0027ve created. It\u0027s fake, it\u0027s sick ... and I can\u0027t do it. I think the only way they\u0027ll heal is if I\u0027m not here. I\u0027m the root of their problems. If I take the root away, I\u0027ll remove the problem. \"I\u0027m leaving,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thoughts turn to Maggie, the one girl who I used to think wasn\u0027t worth a second glance. But when it comes right down to it, she\u0027s the strongest girl I know. She confronted me about Kendra before the accident, she goes to school even though people laugh at the way she moves, and she worked her ass off for Mrs. Reynolds in order to achieve her dream of going to Spain. The accident made her a stronger person. Hell, she made me a stronger person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you think you\u0027re going?\" Dad demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inside to pack, then I\u0027m out of here. I can\u0027t live with shame and denial around me. And you shouldn\u0027t, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is who we are now, son. The accident changed us ... all of us. We were fine until you messed it all up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"Don\u0027t you want to go back to the way it was before? I would do anything to make this family normal again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t you have thought of that before you hit Maggie? I would have never thought I\u0027d say this to my own son, but you ... Caleb Becker ... are a selfish bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk past my parents and Leah, heading to my room. Pulling a duffle bag out of my closet, I stuff it without really thinking. I\u0027m ready in five minutes, then look back at my room one last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lightsaber is still on my shelf, waiting for me until I return. But I\u0027m not coming back. Hopefully, after I leave, my mom won\u0027t have to drug her life to make it bearable and Leah can live her life the way she wants--with or without the truth. And Dad ... well, one day he\u0027ll have to face reality. When he\u0027s ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s up to me now to pave the way for myself and to stop trying to make sure life is back to normal. Screw normal. Normal doesn\u0027t exist. Caleb Becker\u0027s family doesn\u0027t exist. I\u0027m on my own now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh of determination I step back in the room, snatch the lightsaber, shove it in the duffle, and head out. Leah is at the front door, blocking it. \"Don\u0027t leave,\" she begs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom and Dad need you, Caleb. I need you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give a short laugh. \"Mom and Dad\u0027ll be just fine. They like living in denial. As for you ...\" I take in her black attire. \"You\u0027ve got to get past the accident. Face the facts before people like Kendra make you face them. I can\u0027t protect you anymore. It\u0027s time to protect yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move around her and walk outside. I have no clue where I\u0027m going or what to do, but I feel free. Tossing my duffle over my shoulder, I start walking. When I reach Maggie\u0027s house, I don\u0027t see her but I know she\u0027s inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give her a goodbye salute and keep walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reynolds\u0027 gazebo is where I spend the cold, lonely night. When a shooting star flies above me as I stare up at the sky, I wonder if it\u0027s the old lady giving me a sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORTY-FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb kissed me last night at the basketball courts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekissed him back. I still can\u0027t believe either of those things happened. I thought I was okay without needing him so much. I should have wiped off my lips and washed them with soap before I\u0027d gone to bed, but instead I kept looking in the mirror. My lips are still puffy, a reminder of how Caleb\u0027s own lips were hot and demanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years I\u0027d imagined what kissing Caleb would feel like and taste like. To be honest, I wanted to push him away, to make him want me like I wanted him and to reject him like he rejected me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll those feelings from my childhood came back, from the time Caleb urged me down from the tree in front of my house to the time he took the blame for that broken statue. I can\u0027t even forget the times he patted my back while I was crying to Leah about my parents\u0027 divorce. For the past year, the accident ruled my life and molded me into who I\u0027ve become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve taken back my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on my bed, I pull up my pant leg. I notice that my heart is racing a little less as I scan the scars with my eyes. I used to think of them as angry scars, but now I don\u0027t see them as angry. They aren\u0027t even scary. I trace the lines with my fingers, and I don\u0027t even wish they\u0027d disappear. They\u0027re a part of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes, remembering the accident. It\u0027s so strange to think about that night without massive emotions running rampant through my veins. Through the darkness behind my lids, the image of Caleb driving the car that hit me is outlined in my head. But something doesn\u0027t feel right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChills run up and down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause, as I shut my eyes tight, the image of the driver becomes clearer and the foggy haze dissipates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s Leah. A look of horror and fear in her eyes as she loses control of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah was the one who hit me that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would he ... why would they ... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rings while I\u0027m still trying to sort it all out. My stomach is queasy. I want to throw up. But I can\u0027t, because my mother is calling me downstairs. I almost fall down as I greet a man and a woman wearing matching dark navy suits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, we\u0027re from the Illinois Juvenile Department of Corrections. We\u0027re here to investigate your complaint about Caleb Becker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t file a complaint,\" I tell them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman opens her briefcase and pulls out a folder. \"We have documentation you called the 1-800 juvenile justice number complaining to the operator that Caleb Becker was harassing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my God. I shake my head and look to my mom. \"I didn\u0027t call. Mom, I swear I didn\u0027t call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" the man asks. \"You don\u0027t have to be afraid, Maggie. We\u0027re here to make sure you\u0027re protected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up. \"I\u0027m not afraid of Caleb. We\u0027re friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom says, \"Please excuse my daughter. She doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s talking about. She\u0027s been instructed not to have any contact with that boy. Right, Maggie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite down on my bottom lip. \"Mom ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night at the park makes sense now, why he was testing me. Oh, how he must hate me, thinking I\u0027d call and complain when I would never do anything to hurt him. Kendra would hurt him. I wouldn\u0027t. \"I have to go see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, come back here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hobble over to the Beckers\u0027 house before anyone can stop me. Mrs. Becker answers the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Caleb home?\" I ask frantically. \"I really, really need to talk to him. I know you probably hate me for being the reason he went to jail, but I think it was all a mistake and--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb is gone,\" she says, totally unfazed by the words coming from her mouth. She even has a strange smile on her face. \"He left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now my mom has followed me over to the Beckers\u0027 house with the investigators in tow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom regards Mrs. Becker strangely. \"Penny, what\u0027s wrong with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as my mom says it, Mrs. Becker slips and falls right into my mom\u0027s arms. After Mom shrieks, the two investigators help her carry Mrs. Becker into the house. \"She\u0027s passed out,\" one of them says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they\u0027re taking care of Mrs. Becker, I step back. What did Mrs. Becker mean when she said Caleb has gone? I rush home, grab my keys and drive to Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house. I check the garage, gazebo ... he\u0027s not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll along, I blamed Caleb for hitting me, without questioning his guilt. He pleaded guilty, but deep down I detected something strange in him. I thought it was a lack of remorse for hitting me, when all along it was a lack of guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart sinks lower with each passing moment as I drive around Paradise. I\u0027m looking for Caleb, or some sign he\u0027s still here. Before I know it, I\u0027m at the place where my life changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene of the accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skid marks from the car are still on the curb, a dark reminder of that day. I haven\u0027t come here since the accident. I wouldn\u0027t have had the strength before to relive it up close. I step out of the car and walk over to the fading skid marks, staring at them for what seems like forever. Will they eventually disappear altogether, so the only physical reminders of the accident will be the ones I carry with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know the truth, though. That the visible scars aren\u0027t as deep as the emotional ones Leah and Caleb have been struggling with. I have a burning desire to help them, just as Caleb helped me. The most important thing I\u0027ve learned the past few months is that friends are invaluable. People you love can get you through the toughest of times. They need me just as I need them. I miss Leah as my confidante, my best friend. And the love I have for Caleb is the forever kind that will never go away, no matter how hard I try to deny it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn around. Caleb is riding in a black Toyota, a guy I don\u0027t recognize at the wheel. Caleb tells the guy to stop the car, then he walks up to me. He looks sad and lonely and worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did we get here?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s where it all started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t call and complain about you,\" I say hurriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see, these investigators came to my house this morning and said they were following up on a complaint I made and I insisted I never made it and then I realized you must have thought I did and then--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb puts a finger to my lips, stopping my babble. \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it does. And I trust you. Isn\u0027t that what we\u0027re all about? Trust and honesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to prove it to him, a sign that I trust him without any reservations. I pull up my left pant leg with one hand, revealing all my scars up to my knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows knit together in pain, as if he was the one who put them on my leg. I take his hand in mine and together we trace the swollen lines with our fingers. \"You see, there\u0027s nothing I want to hide from you anymore. Do you feel the same, Caleb? No secrets, no lies?\" I need him to tell me the truth about what happened that night. I need to hear it from his own lips, his own words. Tell me you didn\u0027t hit me, I want to say. Tell me the truth. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-30.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
