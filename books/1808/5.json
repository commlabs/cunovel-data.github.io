She has been informed that she will be bedridden for two to three weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She can go then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval flatted his lips at Severin and plucked the slate from the illegitimate prince’s fingers. He meticulously wiped the slate with a handkerchief before writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. She must stay in bed for two to three weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin narrowed his eyes at his castle’s attending barber-surgeon. “How long do you plan for this intruder to stay here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp to six months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely not,” Severin said. “The break in her leg couldn’t have been that bad—the bone didn’t separate much or break through the skin. It shouldn’t take months for her to heal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuval wrote on his slate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want her to be healed enough to survive the journey back to her village it will be six months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three months. That is all I am giving her. Keep her out of my sight, the less I hear of her the better,” Severin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pleased smile twitched on Duval’s lips, and Severin flattened his cat ears as he wondered if he hadn’t made the exact orders Duval wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good evening, Duval,” Severin said before returning his attention to his paperwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barber-surgeon waddled out of the room, closing the door behind him. Severin was able to get to the bottom of the first page of notes before there was another knock at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin dropped his hands—and the notes he held—to the desk with a thump and breathed out heavily—eliciting a growl deep in his throat. “Enter,” he said, his deep voice lowered in warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmele glided into the room with a smile, raising Severin’s ire. “What,” he said, his voice flat and void of questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmele smiled and presented her smaller and supposedly more feminine slate to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Highness, if you wouldn’t mind coming to speak to Elle—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin swiped his paw/hand across the slate, erasing the chalk words before bothering to read them all. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmele pursed her lips and took her slate back to write on it some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she’s a lovely girl, and I—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I suggest you rid yourself of whatever ridiculous idea you have floating around your frill infused head. I will not interact with this intruder. Tell the other servants to stop gossiping and hoping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmele moved, as if to write again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good night, Emele,” Severin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmele’s shoulders drooped, and she left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin’s ears flicked as he listened to the ladies maid traipse down the hallway. He relaxed and gathered his papers, keeping one ear cocked as he immersed himself in papers. He was on the fourth page when he heard another set of footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a confident plod, which bespoke much of the walker’s confidence and pushy tendencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hair on the back of Severin’s neck stood on end, and he leaped to his clawed feet. He grabbed a stack of papers and hustled through the study, slipping outside to the balcony. He secured his papers and gracefully climbed over the balcony banister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one person in Chanceux Chateau walked like that, and Severin avoided confronting her at all costs as he usually came out on the losing side—cursed prince or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin dropped down to a walkway on the next floor, disappearing from sight just as the door to his study was thrown open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footsteps moved around his study before disappearing back into the hallway, making Severin’s shoulders collapse in a sigh of thankfulness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had escaped, this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle briefly opened her eyes and glanced at the door. Emele was there with a clutch of women. Most smelled like food—kitchen maids most likely—but there was a housemaid and two scullery maids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood together, exchanging slates and reading messages as they gawked at Elle like a flock of birds hoping for scraps. The housemaid was forever smoothing her clothes, and the kitchen maids continuously wiped their hands on their white aprons if they weren’t writing out a message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle was surprised, even the scullery maids—the lowest of all servants—were schooled in writing, busily trading slates with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmele smiled when she realized Elle was awake, and began pushing the women out of the room. The female servants smiled at Elle, and the housemaid resisted Emele long enough to curtsey at Elle before she was shoved out of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmele closed the door behind them and leaned her back against the fine wooden surface, smiling sheepishly. Her mouth formed an ‘O’ shape when she was shoved aside like a kitten as the door was flung open. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-and-the-beast-timeless-fairy-tales-1/page-5.html","bookId":1808,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:06 PM"}
