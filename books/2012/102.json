We bring you greeting, Adjunct, from the Crippled God.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at that something seemed to crumple inside Tavore, for she leaned forward, set her hands to her face, and said, ‘Thank you. I thought … out of time … too late. Oh gods, thank you .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d stood unnoticed for some time, just one more marine, there on the edge of the crowd. Holding back, unsure of what he was witnessing here. Fiddler wasn’t saying anything. In fact, the bastard might well be sleeping, with his head sunk down like that. As for the soldiers in the basin, some muttered back and forth, a few tried to sleep but were kicked awake by their companions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Fiddler lifted his gaze, the marines and heavies fell silent, suddenly attentive. The sergeant was rummaging in his kit bag. He drew something out but it was impossible to see what. Peered at it for a long moment, and then returned it to his satchel. ‘Cuttle!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He’s here. Go find him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sapper rose and slowly turned. ‘All right, then,’ he growled, ‘I ain’t got the eyes of a rat. So show yourself, damn you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slow heat prickled through Bottle. He looked round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler said, ‘Aye, Bottle. You. Don’t be so thick.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Here,’ Bottle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFigures close to him swung round then. A few muffled curses, and all at once a space opened around him. Cuttle was making his way over, and even in the gloom his expression was severe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think Smiles sold off your kit, Bottle,’ he said as he arrived to stand before him. ‘At least you scrounged up some weapons, which is saying something.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You all knew?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Knew what? That you survived? Gods no. We all figured you dead and gone. You think Smiles would’ve sold off your stuff if we didn’t?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see the rest of the squad drawing up behind Cuttle. ‘Well, yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sapper grunted. ‘Got a point there, soldier. Anyway, we didn’t know a damned thing. He just made us sit here and wait, is what he did—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I thought this was Faradan Sort’s meeting—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fid’s cap’n now, Bottle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And since he’s now a captain, official and everything, he’s got decorum t’follow.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Right. Of course. I mean—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So instead of him doing this, it’s me.’ And with that the veteran stepped close and embraced him, hard enough to make Bottle’s bones ache. Cuttle’s breath was harsh in his ear. ‘Kept looking at a card, y’see? Kept looking at it. Welcome back, Bottle. Gods below, welcome home.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy halted the Ve’Gath. Grainy-eyed, aching, he stared at the massed army seething in motion on the flats below as the dawn sliced open the eastern horizon. Bonehunter standards to the left, companies jostling to form up for the march – far too few companies for Stormy’s liking. Already assembled and facing southeast, the Letherii legions, and with them Perish ranks, and the gilt standards of some other army. Scowling, he swung his gaze back to the Bonehunters. Positioned to march due east. ‘Gods below.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scattering of Khundryl outriders had spotted him, two setting off back to the vanguard while a half-dozen, bows drawn and arrows nocked, rode swiftly in his direction. Seeing their growing confusion as they approached, Stormy grinned. He lifted one hand in greeting. They pulled up thirty paces away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranks of the Bonehunters were all halted now, facing in his direction. He saw the Adjunct and a handful of officers emerging from the swirling dust near the column’s head to ride towards him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered meeting them halfway, decided not to. Twisting round, he looked back at his K’ell Hunter escort and the drones. Weapon points were buried in the hard ground. The drones had settled on their tails, tiny birds dancing on their hides and feeding on ticks and mites. From them all, a scent of calm repose. ‘Good. Stay there, all of you. And don’t do anything … unnerving.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorses shied on the approach, and it was quickly apparent that none of the mounts would draw within twenty long strides of the Ve’Gath. Across the gap, Stormy met the Adjunct’s eyes. ‘I’d dismount,’ he said, ‘but I think my legs died some time in the night. Adjunct, I bring greetings from Mortal Sword Gesler, Destriant Kalyth, and the Gunthan K’Chain Che’Malle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slipped down from her mount and walked towards him, slowly drawing off her leather gloves. ‘The Nah’ruk, Corporal, were seeking their kin, correct?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-102.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
