Everyone who saw it said, \"Aw.\" \"Aw,\" said Jenny. \"He has such a sweet face.\" \"Aw,\" said Stephen. \"Look at her darling eyes.\" \"Aw,\" said Deedee. \"Isn\u0027t he the cutest puppy you\u0027ve ever seen?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aw,\" said Calvin. \"Isn\u0027t she adorable?\" Joy sat at the desk behind Todd. Big deal, she thought. It\u0027s just a hunk of plastic that happens to look like a dog.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 44\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But even though Joy didn\u0027t like Todd\u0027s toy, she decided to steal it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wait,\" said Todd. \"Let me show you the best part.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before he could show them the best part, Mrs. Jewls rang her cowbell. \"Take your seats!\" she commanded. \"The bell has rung!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the children returned to their desks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Todd, go write your name on the blackboard.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd was the only one who had been in his seat, yet he was the one who got in trouble. That was typical.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls had a system. The first time someone got in trouble, he had to write his name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE. The second time he got in trouble, he had to put a check next to his name. And if he got in trouble a third time, he had to circle his name and then go home early, at twelve o\u0027clock, on the kindergarten bus.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd went home on the kindergarten bus every day. Some of the other kids thought he was lucky, but he wished just once he could make it to twelve o\u0027clock without getting into trouble three times.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He walked to the front of the room and wrote his name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While Todd was at the board, Joy reached over her desk and into Todd\u0027s. She felt around for the toy. But as she tried to lift it out, it caught on something and dropped to the floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 45\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd returned to his seat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Todd, is that your toy on the floor?\" asked Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, how\u0027d that get there?\" asked Todd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know the rules, Todd,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Toys must be kept inside your desk, or else I take them. Now bring it here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd gave his toy to Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Awwww, how precious,\" cooed Mrs. Jewls. \"He\u0027s the most lovable puppy I\u0027ve ever seen.\" She kissed Todd\u0027s plastic puppy on its plastic nose. \"I guess I can let you off this time,\" she said. \"But try to keep him in your desk.\" She kissed Todd\u0027s toy again, then handed it back to him. \"You can erase your name from the board, too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd could hardly believe it. For the first time ever, he erased his name from the board.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he headed back to his seat, Mrs. Jewls said, \"Here, take a Tootsie Roll Pop too, for the sweeeeeet puppy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd was amazed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So was Joy. Now, more than ever, she wanted that toy!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Out at recess everyone wanted to see Todd\u0027s toy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s magic,\" said Bebe. \"It kept you from getting into trouble.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Mrs. Jewls is just a nice teacher,\" said Todd. \"Here, let me show you the best part.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He grabbed hold of the dog\u0027s tail and turned it like\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 46\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e a crank. Suddenly the cute floppy ears stood straight up. The mouth opened wide, and the teeth grew into sharp fangs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wow,\" breathed Deedee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd wasn\u0027t finished. He pulled the dog\u0027s nose and stretched out its face. The cheeks became thin and bony. The eyes were no longer sweet, but grim and frightening.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What a great toy!\" said Calvin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cute little puppy had turned into a mean, hungry, man-eating wolf.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I still haven\u0027t shown you the best part,\" said Todd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But before he could show them the best part, the bell rang, and everyone ran up the stairs to class.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve got to get that puppy dog, thought Joy as she stared at the back of Todd\u0027s neck. Then I\u0027ll never get in trouble again! She didn\u0027t know Todd\u0027s toy had changed into a man-eating wolf.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her lunch box was on her lap. She quietly opened it and took out a carton of cranberry juice and a tiny straw.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She stuck the straw into the carton and sucked up some juice into it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She waited for Mrs. Jewls to turn around, then blew the juice out of the straw. It splattered against Todd\u0027s neck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He slapped the back of his neck with his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy laughed to herself. She sucked up some more juice, took careful aim, and fired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 47\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd turned around, but Joy already had the straw out of her mouth and was looking down at her book.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd rubbed his neck and faced front.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy sucked up more juice and blew it onto Todd\u0027s neck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey!\" he shouted, turning around.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Leave me alone, Todd-I\u0027m trying to work,\" said Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Todd, what\u0027s the matter with you?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"I try to be nice, but you just take advantage. Now go write your name on the blackboard.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd walked to the front of the room. He still thought Mrs. Jewls was the nicest teacher in the world. He looked up at the clock. It was almost eleven. I might just make it today, he thought. I just might make it. He started to write his name when he heard a loud scream.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned around and saw Joy jumping up and down and waving her hand in the air. His toy was biting her pinky, and she couldn\u0027t shake it off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Help!\" screamed Joy as she hopped around the room. \"Todd, how do I get it off? Todd? Please?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd smiled. \"There,\" he said. \"That\u0027s the best part.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56865.html","bookId":626,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:15 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:15 AM"}
