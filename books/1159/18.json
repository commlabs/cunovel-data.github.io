The subject of debate was a proposed treaty with Portugal for improving the navigation of the Douro. One of the deputies rose and said: \"If the navigation of the Douro is improved in the way now proposed, the traffic will be carried on at less expense. The grain of Portugal will, in consequence, be sold in the markets of Castile at a lower price, and will become a formidable rival to our national industry. I oppose the project, unless, indeed, our ministers will undertake to raise the tariff of customs to the extent required to re-establish the equilibrium.\" The Assembly found the argument unanswerable. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Three months afterwards I was at Lisbon. The same question was discussed in the Senate. A noble hidalgo made a speech: \"Mr President,\" he said, \"this project is absurd. You place guards, at great expense, along the banks of the Douro to prevent Portugal being invaded by Castilian grain; and at the same time you propose, also at great expense, to facilitate that invasion. This is a piece of inconsistency to which I cannot assent. Let us leave the Douro to our children, as it has come to us from our fathers.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Afterwards, when the subject of improving the navigation of the Garonne was discussed, I remembered the arguments of the Iberian orators, and I said to myself, If the Toulouse deputies were as good economists as the Spanish deputies, and the representatives of Bordeaux as acute logicians as those of Oporto, assuredly they would leave the Garonne\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dormir au bruit flatteur de son onde naissante;\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n for the canalisation of the Garonne would favour the invasion of Toulouse products, to the prejudice of Bordeaux, and the inundation of Bordeaux products would do the same thing to the detriment of Toulouse.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2879/79683.html","bookId":1159,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 11:21:05 PM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 11:21:05 PM"}
