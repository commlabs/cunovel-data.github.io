Then he’d f**ked around for a year and a half. A year and a half. Every night he left her he told himself he’d never go back and then every night he fought going back until he couldn’t fight it anymore and he had to taste her, touch her, hear her soft, sweet voice whisper “baby”, feel her limbs hold him tight after he made her come, feel her eyes on him while he dressed and struggled with climbing right back into her bed and holding her close until he could see the sun shine on her beautiful face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d had her in his arms and he had no idea he was in her heart and he’d denied she’d touched his for a year and a f**king half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d never get that back and now he knew exactly what he’d been missing and he’d never f**king get that back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Delgado?” he heard and he opened his eyes to turn and see a doctor in scrubs walking into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone but Tracy and Elvira stood.
