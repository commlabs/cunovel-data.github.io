After a moment, Max touched her face. “You taste nice,” he whispered, sounding unlike himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her lashes. “So do you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward and kissed her again as though testing his own observation. She clung to him. His kiss was urgent, needy, and once again desire sparked between them, scorching Bethanne’s senses. She turned her head away and buried her face in his shoulder, trying to understand what was happening to them. Max ran his fingers through her hair and continued kissing the side of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnywhere else Bethanne would have been embarrassed. Thankfully, no one here seemed to notice or care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey danced and kissed and became so involved with each other that it was after two in the morning before she was aware of the time. Resting her forehead against his, Bethanne sighed. “I have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hold on her briefly tightened. “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t think that’s what I want,” she said. “I’d like nothing better than to spend the rest of my time in Vegas with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, we’re leaving for the Grand Canyon tomorrow morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s spectacular. You’ll love it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she whispered. “I’m so glad you called.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am, too. Can I call you again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t know how to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell you what,” Max said. “You call me. You should have my cell number in your phone index. If I don’t hear from you…let’s say by August first, after your son’s wedding, then I’ll know you’ve decided to go back to Grant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax escorted her to the hotel and kissed her one last time. He was wrong about one thing, she thought. What happened in Vegas wouldn’t stay here. It would always be with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Ruth, Annie and Bethanne left Las Vegas, it was almost noon. They’d slept in until after ten, eaten a late breakfast, packed up the car and were now on their way. This was the new rental and once again they’d opted to do without a navigational device. They had their map and an atlas; that should be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one seemed to be talking much, and the tension inside the car remained high as Bethanne headed toward Henderson, Nevada, and then over Hoover Dam south on Highway 93. It went without saying that Annie and Ruth were upset with her for staying out so late with Max, but neither commented. Just as well. Her relationship with Max was none of their business, regardless of what they might think. Soon the map directed them toward the cutoff for Grand Canyon National Park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Annie broke the ice. “Will you be seeing Max again?” she asked from the backseat. Although the question was thrown out casually, Bethanne could see that both her daughter and Ruth were keenly interested in her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould she see him again? That depended on what she decided about Grant—a decision that was hers alone. She’d told Max she’d contact him after Andrew’s wedding. The beginning of August, he’d suggested, but that seemed so long to wait. Even after she’d slipped into bed beside Annie, all Bethanne could think about was the kisses she’d shared with Max. No man had affected her the way he did, not since she was in college and first met Grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom?” Annie prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I don’t know,” she said. “Will you be seeing Jason again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably not,” Annie admitted reluctantly, “but he has my cell number.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax had hers, too, but he wouldn’t use it, wouldn’t phone until she’d called him. That was how they’d left it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re in a different time zone,” Ruth announced, changing the subject as they crossed the state line. “Arizona isn’t on daylight savings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne knew that her mother-in-law had always been uncomfortable with conflict and tried to avoid it whenever possible. Bethanne had been much the same for most of her married life. But that had gradually changed; she’d reinvented herself as a businesswoman, which had required her to negotiate, to compete and to promote her services. A woman who lacked confidence couldn’t do those things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tension in the car eased, and the silence became companionable. Bethanne turned on the radio, filling the car with ABBA and the Fifth Dimension. It wasn’t long before Ruth and Bethanne were singing along and Annie’s voice harmonized with theirs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s just plain good music,” her daughter said, apparently surprised that she’d be enjoying the same songs as her mother and grandmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drove out of range and lost that station after half an hour or so. Bethanne snapped off the radio, and they lapsed back into silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are the wedding gloves progressing?” Ruth asked after another lengthy period when no one seemed inclined to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When has Mom had time to knit?” Annie joked. “Frankly, I never imagined I’d see my mother on a Harley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer daughter didn’t know her nearly as well as she thought, but Bethanne didn’t say anything. Annie’s vision of her was a contradictory one—including both the independent businesswoman of today and the complacent wife of years past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is all too weird for me,” Annie was saying. “My mom and Mad Max? It’s just…odd, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Odd?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t get me wrong, Mom. I realize this is your life and everything, but a guy on a bike? Really? My mother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t find it odd at all,” Bethanne muttered. But it was a moot point, since she likely wouldn’t see Max again, although the prospect saddened her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth broke into a half smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That reminds me of my family’s opinion of Royce and me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s Royce?” Annie immediately asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think he’s another friend your grandmother hopes to see in Florida.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh-h-h,” Annie said, dragging out the word in a meaningful way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBethanne could only assume her mother-in-law wanted to discuss this man—or else why bring him up?—but she had to grin at Ruth’s blush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, tell us about Royce,” Bethanne said, taking advantage of the change in subject so she wouldn’t have to answer questions about Max. She wasn’t so different from Ruth, after all, trying to maintain the peace and avoid discord. Perhaps she hadn’t changed as much as she thought….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh…” Ruth stared down at her hands. “As you’ve already guessed, we dated during our senior year. We broke up after I went to college and he became a marine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So he’s attending the reunion, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re hoping to reconnect with him?” Bethanne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth nodded. “We had a…nasty falling-out, so I’m a bit apprehensive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Grandma, he’s probably just as excited about getting together as you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you really think so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth’s question was so sincere and charming that Bethanne wished she could lean over and hug her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So it’s been years and years since you last saw him?” Annie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes…so many that I can hardly believe it. I heard he lost his wife a few years back, and Richard’s gone, and, well, I hoped… Oh, I don’t know, other than that this would give me the opportunity to resolve things between us. We parted on such bitter terms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does he realize you’re coming to the reunion?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to fall in love all over again and marry him, Grandma?” Annie teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Annie,” Bethanne chastised. “Come on. Don’t put your grandmother on the spot like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth twisted around to look at Annie. “Honey, remember we haven’t seen each other in over fifty years and—and there’s a lot we have to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t you say it on the phone?” Annie asked. “You should call him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call him? When?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now. Or before you show up at the reunion, anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think I can do it,” Ruth murmured, pressing her palms against her cheeks. “What I need to tell him—well, it’s the sort of thing I’d rather do face-to-face.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” Annie said as though she understood. “You loved him, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Very much. And then I met your grandfather and…everything changed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you still love Royce?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could I possibly know? I was eighteen when we dated. He came from a poor family, and my father never really approved of our relationship. In retrospect, I know Daddy only wanted the best for me. He liked Richard and, well, it was such a long time ago….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth was so quiet all of a sudden that Bethanne glanced in her direction, shocked to see tears making wet tracks down her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ruth,” she whispered. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking her head, Ruth buried her face in her hands and started to weep in earnest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandma?” Annie leaned forward, touching her grandmother’s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it, Ruth?” Bethanne asked softly. Whatever it was must have to do with Royce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t understand,” Ruth managed between sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will if you explain it to us,” Annie said in a gentle voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth shook her head again. “I don’t know if I can face Royce after what I did to him.” Ruth’s hands trembled and she took a gasping breath. “I hurt him deeply.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ruth, you were young. I’m sure he’s gotten over it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth refused to make eye contact. “He might have, but I’m not sure I ever can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie handed Ruth a tissue, which she clenched as if it were a lifeline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We promised to love each other and be true…” she choked out. “That’s what we called it back then—being true.” She closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And…you weren’t?” Bethanne probed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth looked down at her purse, winding the strap around her hand. “I went to a party with friends soon after I got to college. I’d never drunk anything stronger than beer. Someone brought vodka and mixed it with orange juice and gave me a glass. I remember how good it tasted and I had more of them…and the next thing I knew, I was necking with this boy and I didn’t even know his name.” She tried to stem the tears, swiping at them with the crumpled tissue. “I told him I needed to get back to my dorm and he offered to walk me there. He seemed friendly and nice, and when we arrived, I let him kiss me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ruth, you were on your own for the first time,” Bethanne said. She found it painful that after all the years, her mother-in-law still couldn’t forgive herself for a youthful indiscretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandma, so what if you let a boy kiss you?” Annie said. She rubbed her grandmother’s shoulder with soothing strokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth continued in a ragged voice. “I told him I already had a boyfriend and…and he said that was fine.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8/page-22.html","bookId":1940,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:04 AM"}
