My friends were Freaking Out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I anticipated some of what may happen with Caleb, and I certainly had some foreknowledge of what may happen with Jade.\" He shrugged and looked at Sophie. \"He will be your guard. You can convince her to come here. She\u0027ll need to go with you when you return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted her with me, that was a no-brainer. But why couldn\u0027t I get the shit, come back to our world and give her a dose?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker gave me steady eyes. \"She has the least amount of time, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed past my misery. \"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at all my friends. \"They may have a few weeks, some,\" his eyes touched on the Weller kids, Jonesy, \"somewhat more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Jade?\" I asked in a hoarse voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Days, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why me?\" I asked in a low voice and Gramps frowned as Clyde moved forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember what I said to you upon our first acquaintance?\" Clyde\u0027s eyes searched mine and I nodded dully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To whom much is given, much is expected,\" I responded in a reactive fugue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were given much, Caleb,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Parker added to the torture, \"what you experience now is critical to who you\u0027ll be in the future, Caleb. You must be tested with these experiences to become the man you\u0027ll be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I don\u0027t want to be him,\" I said in a voice that brooked no argument, drenched with my impotent rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already are, Caleb. You already are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade moved her hand to her temple again, massaging the tender pain that pulsed there. She\u0027d felt sick for two days and her head swam with disturbing images of suffering and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would try to think in a linear way and a press of sickening memories and images would wash away her thought processes like water running down glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt muddled. For some reason, Howie was taking her to school every day and she wasn\u0027t fighting it. It seemed so much more reasonable to go along with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jade was frightened. This fog inside her head made her hands shake. They trembled now as she pulsed the lock Caleb had installed on her door that led to the dungeon where she lived. In the bowels of the Frazier home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last two nights Howie had waited until his parents were drinking at the local tavern and his soft rapping on the door had been replaced by his foot kicking it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered the first night with perfect recall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade,\" Howie used his big knuckles to hit the door, their hollow banging causing the metal of the door to echo. \"Let me in, let\u0027s talk,\" he\u0027d said in conspirator\u0027s tones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand had hovered over the lock, her mind in a fog of swirling confusion. She knew there was some kind of warning here, she just couldn\u0027t think of it. All she could think of was her dead father\u0027s words about how bad of a girl she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow slutty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow dirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe licked her dry lips, her fingers caressing over the locking pulse mechanism, her thumb hovering dangerously close to release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Howie said the words that made the pain stab relentlessly in her head. He slapped his open palm against the metal of the door. \"Open this goddamned lock, you bitch!\" he yelled through the metal slab, his palm\u0027s impact lifting her forehead away from the cool surface where it\u0027d been resting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe backed away then, his words following her no matter where she went in the room. Jade gave a soft whimper as the pain bloomed like a sickened flower inside her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That cocksucker boyfriend of yours isn\u0027t here to save your ass. It\u0027s me that you need, Jade. Not some pretty boy like Hart. Me,\" he slapped the metal and the door shuddered, \"ME!\" He began kicking it at the base and the metal rippled and squealed in protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease hold, Jade thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd on the heels of her muddled consciousness she had a small hope flare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she remembered that she\u0027d let him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t remember why now. It seemed... vague, soft. When she tried to grab hold of it, it slipped through her fingers like smoke through a gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff in the distance Brett Mason felt the echo of her feelings and shot straight up in his bed. Their inadvertent connection bound them together. He felt her fear, her confusion. He didn\u0027t know the cause of the latter but he knew the fear well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d felt it many times in the past. As fists rained down on his body, as words pierced his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett threw his shit on, hopping to his windowsill, he balanced expertly on the edge, jumping the three meters to the dead grass below, his foot kicking up dirt from a gopher mound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled without knowing it, his memory bank supplying the one person that had ever stood up for him beside Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb Hart. Brett hated him... but he admired him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole thing was a warped fucking mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh well, shit happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then ya die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett raced to Jade\u0027s house. He\u0027d beat Frazier until he wasn\u0027t standing. Nobody was gonna ever hurt Jade again. Not like he\u0027d been hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t let it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, he loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe always had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to be kidding me?\" I asked. I couldn\u0027t believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not. You\u0027ve got to find one of the brothers, stab him with this,\" he held up a small device that had many small \"teeth\" embedded on it. A collection disc. I\u0027d seen a buttload of those things in the med clinics. They took blood and other bodily crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We gotta collect their piss or something?\" Jonesy asked with distaste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s a blood collection extractor,\" John answered him and Parker nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a relief,\" Tiff said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, so easy to collect, Parker!\" Bry threw up his hands, frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah, we\u0027ll get it,\" Alex said with certainty and Randi looked up at him, fluttering her eyelashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand up. \"Why their blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the ultimate security. No matter what happened to the drug, the deactivation code remains embedded in their blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"WTF? The sleazeballs!\" Jonesy said, kicking a tin can, making it skitter into the gloom of the twilight that\u0027d descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker nodded. \"Dumping them off to be dealt with by the...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at me and I filled in the word, \"fragment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"It was clever but now you\u0027ll have to find them, get a sample of their blood, combine it with this,\" he pulled a small vial out of his pocket and swirled the amber-colored fluid that was inside and said, \"and administer one drop under the tongue of everyone present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah...\" Bry raised a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" he said, muttering, \"I knew it was cool to be a mundane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know about that. His sister had gotten nailed. Maybe they only needed to do in one Weller brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t one of us guys go with Soph? Why does Tracker get to go? He\u0027s a proven lying sack \u0027o shit,\" Jonesy\u0027s eyes narrowed on Tracker and he moved forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy\u0027s hands clenched into fists, \"Wanna go, ya dick hole?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I do...\" Logan said, moving toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker inclined his head and the zombies sprinted to the two, pulling them apart before they could start in on each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker said, \"Get a hold of it, Tracker. Forget the girl. She\u0027s a target, that\u0027s it. You volunteered for this assignment after your lengthy punishment. So don\u0027t do anything to screw this up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracker elbowed one of the zombies in the gut and a smell of decay washed over the area. It hissed and clamped down on Tracker and he grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just a love clench now, Logan. You know what their potential is.\" Parker raised his brows. Logan nodded reluctantly, throwing Parker a glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombie released Tracker, hissing as he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriendly bunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker looked at Jonesy. \"Tracker is a trained agent. He is a sixth belt in Karate, he understands and can execute hand to hand combat with exactness. Some teenage boys aren\u0027t going to deter him from his goal. Which is?\" Parker promoted, cocking a brow in Logan\u0027s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Acquisition of Jade LeClerc, protection of Sophia Morris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears rolled down Sophie\u0027s cheeks in strangled tendrils of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan and Jonesy glared at each other as her tears fell to the soft dirt at everyone\u0027s feet. Dampening the ground with her sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You boys understand what\u0027s at stake here?\" Parker asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps answered for us all, \"Yeah, I think we\u0027ve got the low-down. Now stop jawing and get that girl. I, for one, want to shut these jag-ups down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forever,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade ran from one end of her sparse room to the other, lifting and looking through her books, her pink pack that Caleb had gotten her a year ago for her birthday. Her room was a slob-fest. She hadn\u0027t kept it neat like normal, she\u0027d been so slow, so confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot at the moment. With Howie trying to beat her door down, she had one thing on her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulse Sophie. She could get help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now, as she found her pulse and wrapped her hand around its cool shiny pink exterior she could feel Brett moving toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Howie was crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he wasn\u0027t a mundane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was that new thing... she rummaged through her addled brain. Ah! She remembered now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Manipulative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d just been categorized. An ability so dangerous, he was in a class by himself, taught by a powerful, five-point Null. He could not make Jade do his bidding with just his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if he touched her, she would be putty in his hands. Her Empath nature would act as a a natural complement to his directives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett would be similarly vulnerable. She needed to get a message to Sophie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade depressed the thumb pad even as she felt Brett enter the house, his emotional signature, linked to her as she had tried to slip from this world almost a year ago, a pulse all its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh Emotive Response\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u0027s hands shook as she thought Sophie\u0027s contact pulse signature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you require medical or emergency response? Emergency Auto Protection Response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShall we pulse 911 on your behalf? Emergency Auto Protection Response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Jade thought, my pulse will activate it. She was relieved. Maybe she wouldn\u0027t have to screw with bugging Sophie. Jade jumped when Howie\u0027s foot slammed into the door again, a dent bowing the door into a grotesque lump of metal on her side. Her anxious eyes traveled back to her pulse, the luminescent green characters floating into the familiar configuration used to contact a recipient. Her knuckles whitening with the exertion of her grip, the etched hearts on the surface biting into her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes- Jade LeClerc\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einitializing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eemergency response intercept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade brows drew together in confusion, she shook the pulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eemergency response [national security] intercept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eemergency response failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade looked at her pulse for a heartbeat and realized that not all was what it seemed. She scratched the irritating mark on her arm and pulsed Sophie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason her pulse wasn\u0027t going through to 911.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was supposed to go through no matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade swiped her thumb and thought: new contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTop Five Contact- BFF\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einitializing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophia Morris- BFF\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade watched anxiously as the characters came together and solidified. Howie\u0027s foot pounded a staccato rhythm on the door. Rat-a-tat-tat. She looked at the door, her hair flying in front of her face, she looked back at her pulse, swinging it behind her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einitializing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econtact failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u0027s head whipped up as she heard footsteps on the stairs, then scuffling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett had arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade couldn\u0027t contact anyone for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer pulse had been neutralized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy who, her mind screamed inside her cotton-filled head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy who?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie looked at Caleb, then Parker. \"I can\u0027t get her!\" she relayed anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved toward her, grabbing her pulse. I used my thumb and depressed it on her unlocked catalog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought, Jade LeClerc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulse History:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBFF initialized, contact failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[national security intercept]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes snapped to Parker. \"They\u0027re already involved.\" Then, \"Jade\u0027s in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI showed him the pulse intercept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" is all Parker said. He looked at me. \"You\u0027ll have to decide what to do, Caleb. They want Jade taken down.
