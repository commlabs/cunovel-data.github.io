She felt a burning in her head-a painful searing that built until a light like one of Lewis\u0027s flashbulbs went off in her brain. Then, through the explosion, she heard a voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet out of there! He just came in the back door!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Kait stood paralyzed. Knowing that Gabriel could communicate directly with her mind was very different from feeling it. Her first reaction was that she was hallucinating; it was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob was gasping. \"God. He\u0027s a telepath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up, Kessler. Move. Do something. You\u0027re about to get caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn felt another wave of astonishment. The communication was two-way-Gabriel could hear Rob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen some primitive instinct within her awoke and shoved all speculation aside. This wasn\u0027t the time to think-it was time to act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw the letters back in the tray and slid the drawers of the file cabinet shut. Then she had an idea and she tried to do something she\u0027d never done before. She tried to send a thought. She didn\u0027t know how to send one, but she tried, concentrating on the burning-roses sensation in her head. Gabriel-can you hear me? You need to tell Anna he\u0027s here. Tell her to hang on to the dogs until-I can hear you, Kaitlyn. It\u0027s Anna. The answer was lighter, calmer, than Gabriel\u0027s communication. It was a lot like Anna\u0027s speaking voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn realized something. Not only could she hear Anna, but she had a sense of where Anna was, and what Anna was doing. It was as if she could feel Anna\u0027s presence. And Lewis\u0027s . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis, shut the panel, she thought. And then get upstairs. Anna, let the dogs go as soon as he does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what are you going to do? Lewis asked. Kait could sense that he was working on the panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHide, Rob said briefly, turning off the fluorescent lights in the hallway and the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it seemed like hours since the explosion in Kaitlyn\u0027s mind, she knew it was only a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis strange telepathy might be very, very disconcerting, but it was an extraordinarily efficient way to communicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got the panel shut. I\u0027m going upstairs, Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m letting the dogs go-quick, Lewis! Come on! Anna\u0027s voice sharpened, and Kait felt a surge of urgency from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s happening? Kait demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait-I think it\u0027s all right. Yes. Now what Kait felt from Anna was relief. He was coming around through the dining room just as we went up the stairs, but I don\u0027t think he saw us. He was looking down at the dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou two had better get into bed. He might come upstairs, Rob said. Kaitlyn turned toward him in the dark. It was fascinating-his silent mental voice sounded just like his ordinary voice, but more so. It was more honest, it seemed to carry more of him in it. Right now it was full of quiet concern for Anna and Lewis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or he might come down here,\" Rob\u0027s real voice whispered to Kait. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand. How he could navigate in the dark was beyond her, but he guided them both to the corner desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get under it,\" he whispered. \"The file cabinets block off the view from the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn found herself squeezing into a very tight place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they waited. There was nothing else to do. Kaitlyn\u0027s heart was beating violently, seeming loud in the quietness. Her hand in Rob\u0027s was slick. Sitting still was much harder than moving and talking had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother fear had gripped her. This was Gabriel\u0027s power, right? The one that had killed Iris, the girl in Durham; that had driven the Mohawk volunteer crazy after forty-five seconds. How long had Gabriel kept their minds linked up tonight? And how much longer before he started to suck their brains out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has to get unstable, she reminded herself. That\u0027s what he said. He can control it if he keeps the contact short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still afraid. Even though Gabriel hadn\u0027t said anything since the beginning, she could feel him out there. A strong presence, surrounded by smooth, hard walls. He was keeping them all in contact. And every second that ticked by made the contact more dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her, Rob stiffened. Listen, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn heard. A sliding, rattling sound. The panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think that\u0027s Lewis, Rob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not. I\u0027m in bed, Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna\u0027s mental voice was clear and purposeful. Do you want us to do anything, Kait?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait took a deep breath, then sent the thought, No, just sit tight. We\u0027ll be fine. At the same time she felt Rob squeeze her hand. There were some things that could be said without even telepathy. She and Rob both knew that they wouldn\u0027t be fine-but she couldn\u0027t think of any way for Anna to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight suddenly showed in a diffuse fan pattern on the office floor. Mr. Zetes had turned on the fluorescents in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease don\u0027t let him come in. Please don\u0027t let him come in, Kaitlyn thought. Then she tried to stop thinking, in case the others could hear her panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office door was opening, light spilling in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the desk, Kaitlyn buried her face in Rob\u0027s shoulder, trying to keep absolutely still. If he didn\u0027t actually come in-if he only looked in ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore light. Mr. Z had turned on the office switch. Now he had only to step beyond the file cabinets to see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if we\u0027ll be terminated, Kait thought. Like Sabrina. Like Marisol. She wanted to jump out and get it over with, to confront Mr. Zetes. They were lost anyway. The only thing that kept her from moving was Rob\u0027s arm around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstairs, she heard a wild clamor. An explosion of barking and baying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it? she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel\u0027s voice, cool sarcasm underlaid with heated anger, came back. I\u0027ve riled the dogs a little. I figure that should bring him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn held her breath. There was a pause, then the lights in the office went off and the door shut. A minute later the light in the hallway went off, too- and then she heard a rattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sagged against Rob. He squeezed her with both arms and she clung back, even though it was really too warm for clinging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove, the barking went on and on. Then, gradually, it faded as if getting more distant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel\u0027s voice came again. He\u0027s taking them out to the limo. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s coming back, but Joyce might be-any minute now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis, Rob said, get us out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, they were all upstairs in the study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was perfectly dark except for the moonlight coming in the window. They could barely see each other, but that didn\u0027t matter. They could feel each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn had never been so aware of other people in her life. She knew where each of them was; she had a vague sense of what each was doing. It was as if they were not quite separate creatures-isolated and yet attached somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike insects caught in a huge web, she thought. Tied together by almost invisible threads. Every pull on the strands lets you know someone else is moving. Her artist\u0027s mind gave her an image: the five of them hanging trapped, spread-eagled, and the silken strands between them humming with power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice picture. But I don\u0027t want to be trapped in a web with you,\" Lewis said mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I don\u0027t want to have you reading my thoughts,\" Kaitlyn told him. \"That was private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow am I. . . \"I mean, how am I supposed to tell?\" Lewis asked, changing from mental voice to ordinary voice in midsentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody likes it,\" Rob said. \"Switch it off, Gabriel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence which Kaitlyn sensed with both mind and ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone turned to look at Gabriel. He looked back with cold defiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" he said. \"Just tell me how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn stared into the darkness where Gabriel was sitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you mean? Rob asked, deadly quiet. He didn\u0027t even seem to notice he wasn\u0027t speaking out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you done before?\" Anna put in quickly. \"I mean, how does it stop, usually?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel turned to her. \"Usually? When people drop dead or start screaming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another blank silence, then a sudden gabble of voices, both mental and otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you saying it\u0027s going to kill us?-that was Lewis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute; let\u0027s all stay calm.\"-Anna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think you\u0027d better start explaining, buddy!-Rob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel sat for a moment, and Kait had the feeling of raised hackles and bared teeth from him-like one of the rottweilers. Then, slowly and coldly, he began to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the story he\u0027d told Kaitlyn about his powers:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout how Iris, the girl in Durham, had died, about his escape afterward, about the man who\u0027d tried to kill him, the man he\u0027d killed instead. He told it without emotion-but Kaitlyn could feel the emotion that was suppressed behind the wall. They all could- and Kaitlyn could tell that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate this as much as you do, Gabriel finished. The last thing I want is to see what\u0027s in your helpless little minds. But if I knew how to control it, I wouldn\u0027t be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe feels more trapped than anyone else. Like a spider caught in its own web, Anna commented, and Kaitlyn wondered if it was meant to be a shared insight, or if Anna was just thinking it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then why did you do it to us tonight?\" Rob demanded. Kait could feel the bewilderment emanating from him. Direct contact with Gabriel\u0027s mind had shaken his view of Gabriel as a selfish, ruthless killer-Kaitlyn could tell that. Which was funny, she thought, because the image of a selfish, ruthless killer was exactly what Gabriel was trying so hard to project right now. \"If you knew you couldn\u0027t control it, why did you use telepathy on us?\" Rob said angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I couldn\u0027t think of any other way to save your useless necks! Gabriel\u0027s reply had the force of a knockout blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob sat back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There probably wasn\u0027t another way,\" Kaitlyn said judiciously. \"Mr. Zetes was just about to walk in on us when the dogs started barking. What did you do to them, by the way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrew a shoe at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt those dogs? Jeeeez, Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel seemed to give a mental shrug. I figured he\u0027d have to come up and see what was going on. Then he couldn\u0027t get them to shut up, so he finally had to take them outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Anna broke in, \"maybe we shouldn\u0027t be using this thing so much. Maybe it\u0027ll go away sooner if we all just ignore it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll go away when we go to sleep,\" Gabriel said flatly-but aloud, Kaitlyn noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" Lewis asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn decided not to mention that Gabriel didn\u0027t feel as sure as he sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We really should go to sleep, anyway,\" she said. It was only now, when all the panic and excitement were over, that she could begin to realize how tired she was. She was stiff from tension and from sitting under that desk. And her mind was exhausted from trying to take in everything that had gone on today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Marisol\u0027s seizure, to Mr. Zetes appearing by the hidden door, to her drawing in art class, to the burglary-so much had happened that her brain was simply giving up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t tell us what was down there behind the panel,\" Lewis said. \"Did you find anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We found plenty, all bad,\" Rob said. \"But Kaitlyn\u0027s right. We can talk about it tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn could feel Anna biting her lip on questions, judging that it was wiser to wait. She could feel Lewis sighing. But it was all muffled by an enormous sense of weariness-even of dizziness, of illness. She wasn\u0027t just feeling her own fatigue, she realized. Gabriel was on the verge of collapse. He was-Rob, she said urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob was already moving. In trying to stand up, Gabriel had staggered and fallen to his knees. Kaitlyn helped Rob put him back on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s bad off-like you when you burned up so much energy yesterday, Kait,\" Rob told her. He was holding Gabriel\u0027s arm-and Gabriel was resisting feebly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t burn energy doing this. I take energy,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you burned something this time,\" Rob said. \"Maybe because you were connecting so many people. Anyway.. .\" Kaitlyn could hear him take a deep breath-and sense him getting a better grip on Gabriel\u0027s arm. \"Anyway, maybe I can help you. Let me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Gabriel shouted. \"Let go of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you need energy. I can-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, let go! Once again, the thought itself was an attack. Kaitlyn winced and everyone backed up a little-everyone except Rob. He stood his ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis said weakly, \"I think he\u0027s got enough energy right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel\u0027s attention was still on Rob. \"I don\u0027t need anything from anyone,\" he snarled, trying to pull out of Rob\u0027s grip. \"Especially not from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel, listen-\" Kait began. But Gabriel wasn\u0027t in a mood to listen. She could feel waves of defensive, destructive fury beating at her like the icy battering of a storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t need any of you. This doesn\u0027t change anything, so don\u0027t think it does. By tomorrow it\u0027ll be gone-and until then, just leave me alone!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob hesitated, then released Gabriel\u0027s arm. \"Whatever you want,\" he said almost gently. He stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Kaitlyn thought, comes the interesting part. Whether Gabriel can make it to his room on his own or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did. Not very steadily, but belligerently. Not needing words to send the message that they\u0027d all better keep away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the large bedroom shut hard behind him. Kaitlyn could still feel his presence on the other side, but it was a feeling of walls, of spiky barriers. She herself used to have walls like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor guy,\" Lewis muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027d all better go to bed,\" Anna suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did. Kaitlyn\u0027s clock said 2:52 a.m. She wondered vaguely how they were going to make it to school tomorrow, and then exhaustion overcame her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing she remembered, as her defenses lowered in sleep, was thinking, By the way, Gabriel, thanks. For risking your own neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got only nasty images of icy walls and locked doors as an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was dreaming, and it was the old dream about the peninsula-the rocky peninsula and the ocean and the cold wind. Kaitlyn shivered in the spray. The sky was so dark with clouds that she couldn\u0027t tell if it was day or evening. A single, lonely gull circled over the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a desolate place, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kaitlyn!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes, Kaitlyn remembered. The voice calling my name; that was in my first dream, too. And now I turn around and there\u0027s no one there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling resigned, she turned. And started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob was climbing down the rocks. His gold-blond hair was flecked with spray and there was damp sand on his pajama bottoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re supposed to be here,\" Kaitlyn told him with the confused directness of dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to be here. It\u0027s freezing,\" Rob said, hopping and slapping his bare arms with his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you should have worn more sensible clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m freezing, too,\" a third voice said. Kaitlyn looked. Lewis and Anna were behind her, both looking chilled and windswept. \"Whose dream is this, anyway?\" Lewis added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a very strange place,\" Anna said, gazing around with dark, thoughtful eyes. Then she said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel-are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel was standing a little way down the peninsula, his arms folded. Kaitlyn felt that this dream was getting crowded-and ridiculous. \"It\u0027s funny-\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think it\u0027s funny, and I\u0027m not going to play, Gabriel\u0027s voice said in her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... if it was a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Kaitlyn was very much in doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really here?\" she asked Gabriel. He just looked at her coldly, with eyes the color of the ocean around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn turned to the others. \"Look, you guys, I\u0027ve had this dream before-but not with all of you in it. But is it really you, or am I just dreaming you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not dreaming me,\" Lewis said. \"I think I\u0027m dreaming you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRob ignored him and shook his head at Kait. \"There\u0027s no way for me to prove I\u0027m real-not until tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely, that convinced Kait. Or maybe it was just the nearness of Rob, the way her pulse quickened when she looked at him, the certainty that her mind couldn\u0027t be making up anything this vivid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now we\u0027re sharing dreams?\" she asked edgily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must be the telepathic link. That web of yours,\" said Anna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Kaitlyn\u0027s had the dream before, it\u0027s her fault,\" said Lewis. \"Isn\u0027t it? And where are we, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn looked up and down the narrow spit of land. \"I don\u0027t have a clue. I\u0027ve only had this dream a couple of times before, and it never lasted this long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you dream us somewhere warmer?\" Lewis asked, teeth chattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn didn\u0027t know how. This dream didn\u0027t feel like a dream exactly-or, rather, she felt much more like the waking Kaitlyn than the fuzzy Kaitlyn who moved semiconsciously through dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna, who seemed least affected by the cold, was kneeling near the edge of the water. \"This is strange,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said. \"You see these piles of stones everywhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was something Kaitlyn hadn\u0027t noticed before. The peninsula was bordered with rocks, most of which looked as if they had just washed up. But some of the rocks were gathered into stacks, piled one on top of another to form whimsical towers. Some rocks had their long axis up and down, some were placed horizontally. Some of the towers looked a bit like buildings or figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did it?\" Lewis asked, aiming a kick at a pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, don\u0027t,\" Rob said, blocking the kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna stood up. \"He\u0027s right,\" she told Lewis. \"Don\u0027t spoil things. They\u0027re not ours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re not anyone\u0027s. This is just a dream, Gabriel said, throwing a look more chilling than the wind at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s just a dream, how come you\u0027re still in it?\" Rob asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel turned away silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn knew one thing: This particular dream had gone on much longer than any of the others. And they might not really be here, but Rob\u0027s skin was covered with gooseflesh. They needed to find shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There must be somewhere to go,\" she said. Where the peninsula joined the land, there was a very wet and rocky beach. Above that, a stony bank, and then trees. Tall fir trees that formed a dark and uninviting thicket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side, water . . . and across the water, a lonely cliff, bare in some places, black with forest in others. There was no sign of human habitation, except-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" she said. \"That white thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could scarcely make it out in the dimness, but it looked like a white house on the distant cliff. She had no idea how one might get to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s useless,\" she murmured, and at the same moment a surge of warmth swept over her. How strange-everything was getting cloudy. She was suddenly aware that while she was standing on the rocky peninsula, she was also lying down . . . lying down in bed....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment it seemed as if she could choose where she wanted to be. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-strange-power-dark-visions-1/page-11.html","bookId":2124,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:44 PM"}
