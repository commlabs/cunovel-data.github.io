past life, the hero had been born within the Diaz Kingdom. \u0026nbsp;When the hero turned 12 years old, she was dragged straight into the palace. \u0026nbsp;This was the biggest mistake that had occurred in the past hero’s life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe palace followed a Hero Support Manual that was created several hundred years ago. \u0026nbsp;While she was reared with the utmost care, the hero’s first party member was added during this time. \u0026nbsp;He was none other than this country’s crown prince Silpennon Le Diaz. \u0026nbsp;He was a thief.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘Of course, it isn’t my business as to why Silpennon had turned down his seat as the crown

Artpe, but his eyes remained planted on Maetel. \u0026nbsp;His cheeks were red. \u0026nbsp;It seemed he had fallen for her on first sight.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was understandable. \u0026nbsp;In her past life, Maetel could have easily ruined couple kingdoms with her beauty. \u0026nbsp;She was only thirteen years old right now, but her budding beauty could be seen even now. \u0026nbsp;This was why it wasn’t far-fetched to think that the crown prince had fallen for her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eStill, Silpennon had witnessed Maetel shed blood with his two eyes. \u0026nbsp;It was a bit baffling that he was able to show such pure ardor towards her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I don\u0027t want your answer. \u0026nbsp;I want to hear it from the

he lightly tapped Maetel’s shoulder.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“....if you put it that way, I have no choice. \u0026nbsp;You do whatever you want,

yet, but she was released from Artpe’s embrace. \u0026nbsp;She faced the crown prince. \u0026nbsp;The crown prince looked on with pity when he saw her puffy

his life. \u0026nbsp;His pride took a big hit, and he started talking incoherently.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“W...why not…. \u0026nbsp;I promise to

stepped on a mine, so his face turned pale.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ah. \u0026nbsp;I...I didn’t mean it like
