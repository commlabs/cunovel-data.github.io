He had seen many people fleeing along the way. However, most of these were ordinary folk and the strongest amongst them was only within the three creation stages.

He discovered that there were over ten thousand people in this group. Their overall strength was much stronger than the groups they had seen earlier. Moreover, one of them seemed to have reached the initial Profound Death stage. Even in the super sects, such a strength would allow one to have an elder position.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, these people wore an express of panic and were clearly from a defeated party.

The Eastern Xuan Region was currently extremely chaotic. Most of it was due to the war between the empires under Yuan Gate and those under the other super sects. They did not have the mood to bother with a fight of this level.
