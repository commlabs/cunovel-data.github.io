They had been casually recommended by the mission issuer at Black God Fort, but after he had hired them he had been pleasantly surprised with their skills.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hehe, us brothers are the strongest God Burying Ridge guides of Heavendevil City. The several other guides are all within our control. We’ve already secretly placed tracking symbols on their bodies.” Red Spider cackled, his voice hoarse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Spider Brothers were imp race martial artists. They originally excelled in tracking, cursing, poisons, and assassinations. Many years ago they obtained a set of god runes that allowed them to mark the other guides and quietly track their positions. Once these guides obtained a rare treasure from God Burying Ridge, they would kill them and steal their goods.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow, they were using this tracking technique to locate Fatty Zhou and attack him with a curse technique.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBecause they were too far away, the curse technique wasn’t too strong.

Since he was doing all of this he might as well do it to the limit.

If he were to do anything to her then he would have to cleanly handle the matter; he couldn’t allow even a hint of a rumor to escape, otherwise the alliance between the saints and the Divine Realm monster race would shatter. If so, then it would be difficult for him to escape severe punishments. Moreover, his greatest opponent, the Good Fortune Saint Son, would take this chance and launch an all-out attack to eliminate him while he was down.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThinking of this, Naqi licked his lips.

If you think that a mere curse technique will kill him then you’re simply fantasizing too much!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi had no scruples when he spoke, even mocking Imperial Prince Naqi. Although Imperial Prince Naqi wasn’t happy, he didn’t refute these words. As the saying went, the one who understood you most was not your friend but your enemy, and against someone like Lin Ming, Tian Mingzi indeed had the right to say all of this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It doesn’t matter if he doesn’t die. First we will ruin them. It’s best if we can make that fatty leading them lose his combat strength. As long as they don’t have that fatty leading them then the others will be nothing but headless flies. It will be easy to capture them all then.” Imperial Prince Naqi gloomily said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKacha!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA large section of the force field that Fatty Zhou laid down was torn apart.

But as he spoke, there was a miserable cry as a middle Divine Lord martial artist had his arm touched by this black wind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a mere moment, that man’s arm seemed to be cut by countless knives.

The other people also felt a creepy chill crawl over their scalp and spine. As martial artists who had fought through endless slaughter fields, they were used to seeing life or death situations. But, this gruesome scene was 10 times more horrifying than dying normally!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSomeone couldn’t resist the pressure of the black winds and turned tail to run.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Do not run away!

The martial artist who fled was immediately sucked up into the black winds. The mourning cries of infinite ghosts became even louder. The ghost king suddenly stepped forwards, its claws grasping towards the chest of that fleeing martial artist and instantly sucking away the flesh and blood of his heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe martial artist screamed in agony and fear. In just several breaths of time he turned into a dried up corpse that scattered to dust in the wild winds!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“His flesh and blood was sucked dry!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFatty Zhou frowned.

Dragon Cloud and Dragon Moon took out two 10 foot long dragon spears.

The most eye-catching among them was the small youth with the bandage-wrapped hands. He held a black sword and repeatedly slashed out. Every time he did, one or two ghosts would be savagely killed. Although this was less than the dragon siblings, his sword speed was extremely fast and his total kill count was no lower.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for the others, they were weaker than Dragon Cloud and Dragon Moon.
