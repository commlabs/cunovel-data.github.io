Originally published under the somewhat misleading title of “Highland Rambles and Long Legends to Shorten the Way,” it has been thought desirable that the title be abbreviated, and made more decidedly descriptive of the volume, as the “rambles” form no important part of the work. In all other respects the present edition is a verbatim reprint of the work as it came from the hands of the distinguished Author.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2815/77812.html","bookId":1262,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 11:25:57 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 11:25:57 AM"}
