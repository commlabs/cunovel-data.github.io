Cool.\" She tries to find a track on a CD Meghan Reynolds had burned for me last summer. \"He might have mentioned something about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know him?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did some work for him,\" she says. \"A long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like an assistant. Freelance,\" she says. \"It was a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I actually know that you know him,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" she asks, concentrating on locating the song. \"You say that so weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he right now?\" I ask. \"I\u0027m just wondering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would I know that?\" she asks, pretending to be annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, aren\u0027t you his girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything is suddenly in slow motion. It\u0027s as if suddenly she forgot her lines. Her only response is to laugh. \"You\u0027re crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s call him up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Sure. Whatever, Crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t believe me, do you?\" I say. \"You think this is a joke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re crazy,\" she says. \"That\u0027s what I think this is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know about you and him, Rain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do you think you know?\" Her voice remains playful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you were in San Diego with Julian last week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was with my mother, Clay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you were also with Julian.\" Saying this relaxes me. \"Didn\u0027t you think I was going to find out about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the light on Doheny she stares straight out the windshield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you know I was going to find out that you\u0027re still f**king him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly cracks. She whirls toward me in the passenger seat. A series of questions pour out in a pleading rush. \"So what? What does it matter? What are you doing? What do you think this is about? Will you just leave it alone? What does it matter what I do when I\u0027m not with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It matters,\" I say. \"In this situation, for you to get what you want, it matters very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does it matter?\" she shouts. \"You\u0027re crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI calmly make the left and start heading down Doheny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t even play this part for a f**king month?\" I ask quietly. \"What, you needed his c**k so badly that you had to jeopardize everything for yourself? If being with me was so important to you, Rain, why did you f**k it up? You could\u0027ve played me but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t play people, Clay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Rip Millar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Rip Millar?\" she says. \"Jesus, you need to get over yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blurry headlights from oncoming cars cause me to pull the BMW to the side of the road across from the Doheny Plaza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out. Just get out of the f**king car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clay ... \" She reaches for me. \"Please, stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re panicking.\" I smile, pulling away from her. \"Look at this: you\u0027re really panicking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, I\u0027ll do whatever you want,\" she says. \"What do you want? Just tell me what you want and I\u0027ll do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"End things with Julian now,\" I say. \"At least until you get the part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls back. \"How do I even know that you\u0027ll help me get the part?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" I say. \"But just tell Julian to go away. I\u0027m not even going to try until he\u0027s out of the picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you get me the part I\u0027ll do anything,\" she says quietly. \"I\u0027ll do anything you want. If you can get me that part I\u0027ll do anything you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabs my face. She pulls me to her. She kisses me hard on the mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the darkness of the bedroom Rain asks me, \"Why did you do this now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what?\" I\u0027m propped on a pillow sipping vodka and melted ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring this all up,\" she says. \"Try and wreck everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to prove that you were lying to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who told you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rip Millar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe immediately tightens up and her voice becomes chilled. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-27.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
