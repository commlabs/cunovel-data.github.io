The difference between an Empyrean and a Revolving Core or Divine Sea martial artist was even greater than the difference between an emperor and a commoner.

His inner world is completely chaotic right now, and even seems as if it will collapse. This disciple is useless and does not know what is happening. Although this disciple can forcefully stop this change, I believe that would be the incorrect decision. Thus, I quickly enveloped Lin Ming in another time enchantment to delay the changes in his inner world as much as possible before Honorable Master was able to arrive.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf a time enchantment could accelerate time, it could also decelerate time.

He probed Lin Ming’s inner world with his senses and only felt that there were some unknown changes occurring within him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis inner world had become unfathomably deep, even faintly seeming as if it would swallow his own senses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough this attractive force was very weak on Empyrean Vast Universe, it was still enough for him to draw back his senses. This was also because Empyrean Vast Universe’s divine sense was too strong. If it were a martial artist with a lower cultivation, then perhaps their divine sense really would be sucked in by this absorbing force.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This inner world is…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEmpyrean Vast Universe was startled. Many martial artists had special bloodlines or physiques. For instance, Xiao Moxian’s phoenix true form or Hang Chi’s reincarnated Buddha.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd every so often, there would be those with strange inner worlds and souls. These variation souls and variation inner worlds weren’t too rare. Empyrean Vast Universe suspected that Lin Ming was also in this sort of situation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Inner world variation?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis thought instantly raced through Empyrean Vast Universe’s mind. If so, then Lin Ming really was too heaven-defying. If a talent like him also had a variation inner world, how could other geniuses still live?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, within the samsara dreamland, Lin Ming was still meditating in that vast and boundless space of nothingness. His complexion became increasingly pale but his halted breathing had subsided.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis inner world had been swept over by a wild storm with everything left in a chaotic mess. Besides the Heretical God Tree, all of the mountains and rivers and lakes and plains were all utterly destroyed!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, above this region, there was an invisible anomaly in space. As light passed near a certain point in the void, it curved, bending around it. Unless one was skilled in the Space Laws it would be impossible to see this, because this point was hidden in the void, twisting all light around it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis spot was the black hole seed that Lin Ming had condensed with the Divine Seal Art!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA black hole was the most terrifying celestial body in the universe. There was almost nothing that could destroy a black hole. If a black hole fell into a sun, it would eventually swallow that sun, ultimately causing an unimaginable explosion!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming had simulated the explosion of a fire star with his true essence and then finally condensed it into a black hole seed. Although it was far from truly achieving the level of an actual black hole, as Lin Ming’s cultivation rose, the total energy within that black hole seed would become higher and higher and the traction force would become increasingly terrifying until the moment when all space and time would be sucked into it, finally evolving into an end point of all space and time!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe moment that Lin Ming’s black hole seed had truly formed, he seemed to have opened wide a great and mystical door before him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs this door opened, the aura of the Great Dao blew towards him with indescribable glory!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis aura of the Great Dao had an essential difference from the baptism of the Heavenly Dao Laws one experienced during the crossing of Ninefall. This aura contained the Concept of the 33 Layered Heavens and stood at almost the highest point of all Laws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe aura of the endless Great Dao surged into Lin Ming’s inner world. Then, his inner world that was reduced to rubble and ruins by the explosion of true essence and energy began to glow with reborn vitality.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe explosion of that sphere of energy had been far too terrifying.

New mountains rose and new rivers began to flow. An incomparably rich world power condensed, forming origin energy clouds in the skies. Because these clouds were too thick and heavy, they began to rain down with drops of origin energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis origin energy rain gathered into the dry streams and channels as it fell, turning into fresh and wonderful currents.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the land was watered, plants began to sprout and colorful spirit flowers started to bloom.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that moment, Lin Ming’s strength rapidly climbed, reaching unprecedented heights!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHu - !\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfterwards, that vast aura swept out from Lin Ming’s body, recklessly spinning around him like heavy mercury!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Empyrean Vast Universe felt this boundless aura, he was startled. This was clearly the aura of the 33 Layered Heavens’ Great Dao. Empyrean Vast Universe had obtained the remnant soul of the ancient Divine Seal Altar’s artifact spirit.

But behind these three masters, the four young jade bunny girls that were kneeling were baptized by this aura.

This was a tremendous lucky chance. It was no longer a question of helping them break through to the next realm, but instead caused the Laws within their bodies to change on a qualitative level.
