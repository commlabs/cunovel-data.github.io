Arcs of heat and light stormed over the body of the cannon like miniature bolts of lightning, and the laser found the once-Nemesis\u0027s writhing, pulsating body and began to eat. The creature that had once been the pride of Um-brella\u0027s development section whined and thrashed, flailing its multiple limbs in a frenzy of agonized confusion.

A few seconds later, the cannon overheated and shut itself down. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis-resident-evil-5/page-30.html","bookId":2460,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:40 PM"}
