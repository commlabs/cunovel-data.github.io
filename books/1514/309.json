Throughout the year, a formidable bone-cutting cold enveloped this mountain range, hence ordinary people did not dare to stay here for too long, or else the cold qi would enter their bodies and freeze their blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was said that there was an even more terrible and renowned Mother Earth Mysterious Black Yin Crevice in the deepest part of the Mysterious Black Yin Mountain Range. No one knew how deep this Mysterious Black Yin Crevice was, and an extremely terrifying Cold Primal Wind gathered there. Within it, Cold Primal Wind attacked from all directions, resulting in the formation of countless Cold Primal Vortexes of various sizes. Once pulled into one, even a Manifestation stage practitioner would be faced with certain death. Hence, the Mother Earth Mysterious Black Yin Crevice was undoubtedly a forbidden area within the Mysterious Black Yin Mountain Range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven among the many mountain ranges within the entire Great Desolate Province, the area covered by the Mysterious Black Yin Mountain Range ranked among the top. The mountain range was overflowing with Demonic Beasts and it was unknown how many powerful practitioners had died there. Furthermore, there were many alluring treasure remnants within the mountain range, and from time to time, some fortunate fellows would find places where some powerful practitioners had fallen, thus obtaining numerous martial arts and even Soul Treasures...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to this fact, although the Mysterious Black Yin Mount Range was very dangerous, it was one of the most popular places within the Great Desolate Province.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Ghastly Puppet City was established by the Ghastly Puppet Cult on the main mountain of the Mysterious Black Yin Mountain Range. The entire city was built on the mountain, an extremely magnificent sight. Numerous figures came and went within it, testament to its almost terrifying popularity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong stood at the foot of the Mysterious Black Yin Mountain as he gazed at the incomparably huge city, a little amazement in his eyes. This was the first time he had seen such a grand city and in comparison, Yan City was simply akin to a rural village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhastly Puppet City extended from the foot of the mountain to its peak, and along the way, there were countless streets. Each street was spacious and orderly as crowds flowed within them, wrapping the entire mountain in a bustling noises. No one could imagine that there was actually such a grand city within this perilous Mysterious Black Yin Mountain Range...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of one of the main streets at the foot of the mountain, an almost hundred meter tall city wall extended outwards. On the city wall, three harsh, big and pitch-black words appeared, Ghastly Puppet City. Faintly, a cold aura flowed like a malevolent skeleton, causing one to shiver all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the enormous city door, the crowd gathered like ants, while numerous Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners stood guard at the entrance to the city. There were extremely stringent as they checked every person who entered the city. Security could be said to be tight indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is my arrest warrant on the city walls.” Lin Dong slightly narrowed his eyes. He was able to see his picture all over the city entrance area. This meant that he could not enter from the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now that the Ghastly Puppet Cult has suddenly become so secured, troops from many other factions must have rushed over…” Lin Dong’s eyes looked towards the deep mountains surrounding Ghastly Puppet City. Faintly, he was able to sense some mysterious and powerful auras. Looks like the actions of the Ghastly Puppet Cult this time were seriously too conspicuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They want to break the seal on the ‘Devouring Ancestral Symbol, hence they will naturally not dare to make even the smallest mistake. This Mysterious Yin Mountain is surrounded by an extremely dense cold qi, forming a natural protective screen. If anyone forcibly charges in, it will alert the entire guard.” Little Marten stood on Lin Dong’s shoulder and explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have any ideas?” Lin Dong nodded his head, feeling a minor headache. As expected of the Ghastly Puppet Cult headquarters, their defenses were practically flawless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heh, although this cold qi is dense, it does not have much use against me.” Little Marten chuckled and proudly declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon hearing this, Lin Dong sighed in relief. His eyes swept about before his figure moved. By-passing the main entrance, he looked for a place where the defense was relatively weaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this infiltration, Lin Dong did not bring along Little Flame and instead had it outside waiting for his signal. After all, there were numerous powerful practitioners within Ghastly Puppet City and if they were somehow discovered, it would become a little troublesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mysterious Black Yin Mountain was extremely vast. Even with Lin Dong’s speed, a single trip around the foot of the mountain wasted a whole half an hour. Fortunately, he still managed to find an empty area with relatively weaker defenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong hid within the forests as he stared at the huge city wall before him. From time to time, Ghastly Puppet Cult guards patrolled atop the city wall. After observing for some time, Lin Dong discovered the patterns of the patrols. He only needed to break the cold qi protective screen before being able to enter the city in an instant without alerting anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis quiet wait lasted for about ten minutes before Lin Dong’s figure suddenly burst forth and flew towards the top of the city walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Woo woo!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lin Dong charged up the city walls, the dense cold qi immediately cut at him like sharp blades. They were formidable and chaotic, as felt as if they wanted to shred Lin Dong to bits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the face of the cold qi, Lin Dong did not dare to use Yuan Power to protect his body, afraid that he would be discovered by the Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners. Thankfully, Little Marten swiftly made its move, its claws dancing as a circle of purplish black membrane of light appeared around Lin Dong. Once this light membrane appeared, the tearing cold qi instantly disappeared. It looked as if it was directly gobbled up by the black colored light membrane, such that there wasn’t even the slightest bit of disturbance...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw this scene, Lin Dong stealthily sighed in relief before rapidly increasing his speed. In several blinks of an eye, he directly charged up the almost hundred meter tall city walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he reached the top of the city walls, the formidable cold qi also dispersed, but Lin Dong did not dare to tarry at all as his figure swept down the city walls before finally scuttling into the shadows of the buildings like a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking in the shadows, a wide black robe and bamboo hat once again appeared on Lin Dong’s body, securely wrapping around his entire body. Only then did he finally walk out and look at the busy streets before silently sighing in relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interior of Ghastly Puppet City was so huge it made one flabbergasted. Due to fact that it was built on the mountain, there were many layers or floors. However, only Ghastly Puppet Sect core members could enter the top most layer. Everyone else could only stay in the city below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong strolled in the city for half an hour and roughly figured out the extent of Ghastly Puppet City. Meanwhile, he had also secretly inquired about news related to the Ghastly Puppet Cult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMajority of the factions within Ghastly Puppet City were subordinate to Ghastly Puppet Cult. Yet this place was after all a famous great city within the Great Desolate Province, hence, there was naturally no lack of other factions. After paying some relatively expensive prices, Lin Dong obtained some of the information he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom these information, Lin Dong found out that most of the Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners were already gathered at the mountain top. The Ghastly Puppet Cult leader must plan to combine the might of the Ghastly Puppet Cult there to break the seal on the Devouring Ancestral Symbol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, the time to break the seal was likely five hours later, in the instant when the sun and moon alternated. At that time, the Mysterious Black Yin Mountain cold qi will become extremely powerful, and the Ghastly Puppet Cult may borrow the power of the cold qi to increases the chances of breaking the seal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five hours later. Is the Ghastly Puppet Cult leader really so impatient…” Lin Dong looked towards the depths of the city, the Mysterious Black Yin Mountain peak as he mumbled to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heh heh, now that he has caused such a commotion, he naturally needs to swiftly deal with it, so as to avoid long nights of restlessness.” Little Marten chuckled in Lin Dong’s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin dong nodded his head. Soon after, he swiftly strode towards the depths of Ghastly Puppet City. Since that was so, he needed to quickly reach the mountain top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deeper into Ghastly Puppet City he went, the tighter the security was. Moreover, many practitioners within Ghastly Puppet Cult focussed on Mental Energy cultivation, hence their sensing powers were extremely keen. Thus, even with Little Marten’s help, Lin Dong did not dare to be the slightest bit careless. After wasting two or three hours, Lin Dong finally successfully broke through the layers of security and reached the Mysterious Black Yin Mountain top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mysterious Black Yin Mountain top was extremely spacious and many imposing buildings towered on it. At the center, there was a plaza that was almost a thousand meters wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plaza was made of black rock and endless cold qi faintly diffused from below, condensing into a cold fog which spread out in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong stood in the shadow of a tall building. At this moment, his presence had been completely concealed with Little Marten’s help, and even his breathing had become extremely slow. It was likely that even a Manifestation stage practitioner would be unable to discover him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he hid in the shadows, Lin Dong looked down onto the huge plaza in the distance. At this moment, the plaza was occupied by countless Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners. These figures were scattered about, each person standing at a strange position, forming an extremely enormous formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring at the troops in the plaza, Lin Dong’s expression was extremely serious. For just Qi Creation stage practitioners alone, he had already discovered no less than ten of them. Furthermore, he had also found two half-step-to Manifestation practitioners. This kind of lineup was terribly frightening. Ghastly Puppet City was indeed Ghastly Puppet Cult’s old nest, the number of practitioners were actually at such a figure...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to this scene, Lin Dong could only secretly sigh in his heart as he even more carefully restrained his aura. If he was found, even escaping would be a little difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lin Dong silently waited, the sky gradually darkened. Not long later, a deep black brilliant sun and a bright round moon slowly appeared in the sky above at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Buzz!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as sun and moon alternated, the Mysterious Black Yin Mountain cold qi instantly intensified, such that it even faintly emitted countless ghost-like wailing which caused one’s hair to stand on ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong licked his lips as his heart thumped violently. He suddenly lifted his head, only to see three figures slowly flying over in the skies in front of the plaza before steadily landing at the center of the plaza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Ghastly Puppet Cult’s three Manifestation stage practitioners!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he stared at the three figures, Lin Dong’s pupils instantly shrank. From the trio, he sensed an oppressive aura, which he had never before felt even from Cao Zhen. Evidently, these three fellows were the Ghastly Puppet Cult leader and the two great elders...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-308\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-310\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-309","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:54 AM"}
