{"id":31761,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV. MR. LINCOLN’S FAVORITE POEM.","content":"One evening when Mr. Carpenter, the artist, was alone with Mr. Lincoln in his study, the President said: “There is a poem that has been a great favorite with me for years, to which my attention was first called when a young man, by a friend, and which I afterward saw and cut from a newspaper and carried in my pocket till, by frequent reading, I had it by heart. I would give a great deal to know who wrote it, but I could never ascertain.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He then repeated the poem, now familiar to the public, commencing, “Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This poem, which was written by William Knox, a young Scotchman, a contemporary of Sir Walter Scott, suits well the thoughtful, melancholy mood habitual to Mr. Lincoln. It is said{300} that a man may be known by his favorite poem. Whether this can be said of men in general may be doubted. In the case of Abraham Lincoln I think those who knew him best would agree that the sadness underlying the poem found an echo in the temperament he inherited from his mother. I am sure my readers will be glad to find the poem recorded here, even though they may have met with it before:\n\u003cbr\u003e Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?\n\u003cbr\u003e Like a swift-fleeting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,\n\u003cbr\u003e A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,\n\u003cbr\u003e He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.\n\u003cbr\u003e The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,\n\u003cbr\u003e Be scattered around and together be laid;\n\u003cbr\u003e And the young and the old, the low and the high,\n\u003cbr\u003e Shall moulder to dust, and together shall lie—\n\u003cbr\u003e The infant a mother attended and loved;\n\u003cbr\u003e The mother that infant’s affection who proved:\n\u003cbr\u003e The husband, that mother and infant who blest—\n\u003cbr\u003e Each, all, are away to their dwellings of rest.\n\u003cbr\u003e The maid on whose cheek, on whose brow, in whose eye\n\u003cbr\u003e Shone beauty and pleasure,—her triumphs are by;\n\u003cbr\u003e And the memory of those who loved her and praised,\n\u003cbr\u003e Are alike from the minds of the living erased.\n\u003cbr\u003e The hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne,\n\u003cbr\u003e The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn,{301}\n\u003cbr\u003e The eye of the sage and the heart of the brave,\n\u003cbr\u003e Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave.\n\u003cbr\u003e The peasant, whose lot was to sow and to reap,\n\u003cbr\u003e The herdsman, who climbed with his goats up the steep,\n\u003cbr\u003e The beggar, who wandered in search of his bread,\n\u003cbr\u003e Have faded away like the grass that we tread.\n\u003cbr\u003e The saint, who enjoyed the communion of Heaven,\n\u003cbr\u003e The sinner, who dared to remain unforgiven,\n\u003cbr\u003e The wise and the foolish, the guilty and just,\n\u003cbr\u003e Have quietly mingled their bones in the dust.\n\u003cbr\u003e So the multitude goes—like the flower or the weed\n\u003cbr\u003e That withers away to let others succeed;\n\u003cbr\u003e So the multitude comes—even those we behold,\n\u003cbr\u003e To repeat every tale that has often been told.\n\u003cbr\u003e For we are the same our fathers have been;\n\u003cbr\u003e We see the same sights our fathers have seen;\n\u003cbr\u003e We drink the same stream, we view the same sun,\n\u003cbr\u003e And run the same course our fathers have run.\n\u003cbr\u003e The thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think;\n\u003cbr\u003e From the death we are shrinking, our fathers would shrink\n\u003cbr\u003e To the life we are clinging, they also would cling,—\n\u003cbr\u003e But it speeds from us all like a bird on the wing.\n\u003cbr\u003e They loved—but the story we can not unfold;\n\u003cbr\u003e They scorned—but the heart of the haughty is cold;\n\u003cbr\u003e They grieved—but no wail from their slumber will come;\n\u003cbr\u003e They joyed—but the tongue of their gladness is dumb.\n\u003cbr\u003e They died—ay, they died; we things that are now,\n\u003cbr\u003e That walk on the turf that lies over their brow,{302}\n\u003cbr\u003e And make in their dwellings a transient abode,\n\u003cbr\u003e Meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road.\n\u003cbr\u003e ’Tis the wink of an eye—’tis the draught of a breath—\n\u003cbr\u003e From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,\n\u003cbr\u003e From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud:—\n\u003cbr\u003e Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The last stanza will call to mind the startling suddenness with which Abraham Lincoln, the Chief Magistrate of a great nation, passed from the summit of power to the solemn stillness of death. Was it a sad, prophetic instinct that caused the mind of the great martyr to dwell so constantly upon these solemn strains?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No man seems to have been more clearly indicated as the instrument of Providence than Abraham Lincoln. It seems strange in the eyes of men that a rough youth, born and reared in the backwoods, without early educational advantages, homely and awkward, and with no polish of manner save that which proceeded from a good heart, should have been selected as the Guide and Savior of a great nation. But God’s ways are not as our ways, nor is His choice as ours. Mr. Lincoln had this advantage,—coming from the ranks of the people, he never lost sight of his sympathy for{303} his class. His nature and his sympathies were broad and unconfined.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He has been well described by one reared like himself, in the free atmosphere of the West: “Nearly every great figure of history is a kind of great monstrosity. We know nothing about Washington. He is a steel engraving. No dirt of humanity clings to his boots. Lincoln lived where men were free and equal, and was acquainted with the people, not much with books. Every man is in some sort a book. He lived the poem of the year in the fields, the woods, the blessed country. Lincoln had the advantage of sociability. He was thoughtful, and saw on the horizon of his future the perpetual star of hope. To him every field was a landscape; every landscape a poem; every poem a lesson, and every grove a fairy land. Oaks and elms are far more poetical than streets or houses. A country life is in itself an education. It gives the man an idea of home. He hears the rain on the roofs, the rustle of the breeze, the music of nature’s fullest control. You have no idea how many men education spoils. Lincoln’s education was derived from men and things, and hence he had a chance to develop.{304} He had many sides. He not only had laughter, but he had tears, and never that kind of solemnity which is a wash to hide the features. He was not afraid to seek for knowledge where he had it not. When a man is too dignified he ceases to learn. He was always honest with himself. He was an orator; that is, he was natural. If you wish to be sublime you must keep close to the grass. You must sit close to the heart of human experience—above the clouds it is too cold. If you want to know the difference between an orator and a speaker read the oration of Lincoln at Gettysburg, and then read the speech of Everett at the same place. One came from the heart, the other was from out of the voice. Lincoln’s speech will be remembered forever. Everett’s no man will read. It was like plucked flowers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If you want to find out what a man is to the bottom, give him power. Any man can stand adversity—only a great man can stand prosperity. It is the glory of Abraham Lincoln that he never abused power only on the side of mercy. When he had power he used it in mercy. He loved to see the tears of the wife whose husband he had snatched from death.”{305}\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I draw near the close of my task, having given, as I hope, some fair idea of one whose memory will always remain dear to the hearts of his countrymen. In that chequered life there is much to imitate, much to admire, little to avoid or censure. Happy will be the day when our public men copy his unselfishness, his patriotic devotion to duty!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Within a few months, on the eighteenth anniversary of Mr. Lincoln’s assassination, a poem was read at his grave by John H. Bryant, of Princeton, which will fitly close my story of the Backwoods Boy:\n\u003cbr\u003e Not one of all earth’s wise and great\n\u003cbr\u003e Hath earned a purer gratitude\n\u003cbr\u003e Than the great Soul whose hallowed dust\n\u003cbr\u003e This structure holds in sacred trust.\n\u003cbr\u003e How fierce the strife that rent the land,\n\u003cbr\u003e When he was summoned to command;\n\u003cbr\u003e With what wise care he led us through\n\u003cbr\u003e The fearful storms that ’round us blew.\n\u003cbr\u003e Calm, patient, hopeful, undismayed,\n\u003cbr\u003e He met the angry hosts arrayed\n\u003cbr\u003e For bloody war, and overcame\n\u003cbr\u003e Their haughty power in Freedom’s name.\n\u003cbr\u003e ’Mid taunts and doubts, the bondsman’s chain\n\u003cbr\u003e With gentle force he cleft in twain,{306}\n\u003cbr\u003e And raised four million slaves to be\n\u003cbr\u003e The chartered sons of Liberty.\n\u003cbr\u003e No debt he owed to wealth or birth;\n\u003cbr\u003e By force of solid, honest worth\n\u003cbr\u003e He climbed the topmost height of fame\n\u003cbr\u003e And wrote thereon a spotless name.\n\u003cbr\u003e Oh! when the felon hand laid low\n\u003cbr\u003e That sacred head, what sudden woe\n\u003cbr\u003e Shot to the Nation’s farthest bound,\n\u003cbr\u003e And every bosom felt the wound.\n\u003cbr\u003e Well might the Nation bow in grief,\n\u003cbr\u003e And weep above the fallen chief,\n\u003cbr\u003e Who ever strove, by word or pen,\n\u003cbr\u003e For “peace on earth, good-will to men.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The people loved him, for they knew,\n\u003cbr\u003e Each pulse of his large heart was true\n\u003cbr\u003e To them, to Freedom, and the right,\n\u003cbr\u003e Unswayed by gain, unawed by might.\n\u003cbr\u003e This tomb, by loving hands up-piled,\n\u003cbr\u003e To him, the merciful and mild,\n\u003cbr\u003e From age to age shall carry down\n\u003cbr\u003e The glory of his great renown.\n\u003cbr\u003e As the long centuries onward flow,\n\u003cbr\u003e As generations come and go,\n\u003cbr\u003e Wide and more wide his fame shall spread,\n\u003cbr\u003e And greener laurels crown his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e And when this pile is fall’n to dust,\n\u003cbr\u003e Its bronzes crumbled into rust,{307}\n\u003cbr\u003e Thy name, O Lincoln! still shall be\n\u003cbr\u003e Revered and loved from sea to sea.\n\u003cbr\u003e India’s swart millions, ’neath their palms,\n\u003cbr\u003e Shall sing thy praise in grateful psalms,\n\u003cbr\u003e And crowds by Congo’s turbid wave\n\u003cbr\u003e Bless the good hand that freed the slave.\n\u003cbr\u003e Shine on, O Star of Freedom, shine,\n\u003cbr\u003e Till all the realms of earth are thine;\n\u003cbr\u003e And all the tribes, through countless days,\n\u003cbr\u003e Shall bask in thy benignant rays.\n\u003cbr\u003e Lord of the Nations! grant us still\n\u003cbr\u003e Another patriot sage, to fill\n\u003cbr\u003e The seat of power, and save the State\n\u003cbr\u003e From selfish greed.
