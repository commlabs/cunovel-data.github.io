Both of them said to Him, \"Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.\" Back of it all, we seem to read their thought: \"Lord, we do not understand why you have stayed away so long. We do not understand how you could let death come to the man whom you loved. We do not understand how you could let sorrow and suffering ravage our lives when your presence might have stayed it all. Why did you not come? It is too late now, for already he has been dead four days!\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd to it all Jesus had but one great truth: \"You may not understand; but I tell you if you believe, you will see.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAbraham could not understand why God should ask the sacrifice of the boy; but he trusted. And he saw the glory of God in his restoration to his love. Moses could not understand why God should keep him forty years in the wilderness, but he trusted; and he saw when God called him to lead forth Israel from bondage. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJoseph could not understand the cruelty of his brethren, the false witness of a perfidious woman, and the long years of an unjust imprisonment; but he trusted, and he saw at last the glory of God in it all. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJacob could not understand the strange providence which permitted the same Joseph to be torn from his father\u0027s love, but he saw the glory of God when he looked into the face of that same Joseph as the viceroy of a great king, and the preserver of his own life and the lives of a great nation. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, perhaps in your life. You say, \"I do not understand why God let my dear one be taken. I do not understand why affliction has been permitted to smite me. I do not understand the devious paths by which the Lord is leading me. I do not understand why plans and purposes that seemed good to my eyes should be baffled. I do not understand why blessings I so much need are so long delayed. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFriend, you do not have to understand all God\u0027s ways with you. God does not expect you to understand them. You do not expect your child to understand, only believe. Some day you will see the glory of God in the things which you do not understand.--J. H.
