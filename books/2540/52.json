If we push it today, it kills three people in this room: Bryn, Riley, and Annie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Four,” Joe said. Manny looked stricken. “Sorry. Meant to tell you but we haven’t exactly had a chance to catch up. It was this, or being dead on a cell floor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManny took in a deep breath. “Four people in this room. But it’s not only that. There are unknown numbers out there—the survivors from Pharmadene. The ones the Fountain Group has infected, deliberately. The ones already inoculated by other groups. I don’t have any idea how many lives this will take—thousands, maybe tens of thousands. My point is this: tomorrow, it will be more. How many days can pass before none of us can justify taking action?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence was profound enough that Bryn thought she could hear Patrick’s heartbeat. It seemed fast to her. Hers was rushing, too, driving adrenaline into her body like shimmering waves of discomfort. Fight or flight. In this case, neither one would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not pushing the button,” Manny said. “I can’t. I’ve thought about it, every single day since you disappeared; at the time, it was a way to get back for what those bastards did. That’s why I put it together—revenge. Revenge and paranoia, because you know me, I’m paranoid and I admit it. But you called. You came back.” He shook his head, got up, and looked out the window at the array of machines. “And I’m not a strong enough person to make this call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nobody is,” Riley said. “You can’t. We can’t. You’re talking about playing God as much as those people are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It has to be done.” That came from probably the most unexpected source: Annalie. She was still sitting down in the chair, looking young and sweet and utterly vulnerable. Her clear gaze was locked on Manny like a laser. “Guys, it has to be. Never mind us. Never mind who else dies that doesn’t deserve to. The point is, we stop it now or it doesn’t stop. Because if we don’t want to push the button on four people here, or a thousand out there . . . what happens at a million?” Her eyes filled with tears, and she blinked them away, fast. “I didn’t get a choice. None of us did, really. So I say push the button.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a vote,” Patrick said. “It’s your sister’s life, and I’m not letting that happen. I’ve fought too hard. I’m not going to just—give up. There’s another way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not one that works,” Manny said. He spun the computer around. “Just press enter. It’s ready to send.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the screen was a text box, a pop-up that read simply INITIATE TRANSMISSION? Two buttons. The OK button was highlighted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Liam?” Manny said. The older man stood still for a moment, and Bryn saw a tremor in his fingers . . . but then he shook his head and looked away. “Patrick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you,” Patrick said tightly. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pansy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she whispered. “I’m sorry. I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat left the four of them. The infected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Riley said, unprompted. “Not at that price.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean, at the price of your life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s exactly what I mean,” she said, and Bryn thought she saw the same flat, predatory expression in her eyes that Jane had so often flashed. We’ve changed, she thought, and felt a chill. We’ll keep changing. He’s right. We might still be human, but it won’t last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe just shook his head when Manny’s gaze flicked to him. That left Bryn and Annie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryn held out her hand. Annie took it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Together?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bryn!” Patrick grabbed her. “No. No, you can’t do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I can,” she said. “You don’t see it. You’ve never seen it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seen what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The monster,” she said. “And I don’t want you to ever see that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for the button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley hit her from behind and sent her crashing face-first onto the corner of the desk; bone shattered, blood splattered. Bryn rolled, throwing her off balance, and managed to get her arm up in time to stop Riley’s knife from punching into her eye. It went through the meat of her forearm, and caught between the bones; she used that, and twisted, yanking it out of Riley’s fingers. She punched Riley, punched her again, tossed her into the wall, and buried the knife in the other woman’s chest, low and center, cutting her diaphragm. Riley screamed, lost air, and clawed at Bryn desperately, opening gouges and drawing blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This,” Bryn managed to gasp out. “This is what we are now. No future, no family, no children coming after us. Just the monsters, until we’re gone, and we’ll get worse. This is the future. Push the button!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick had forgotten her sister, riveted by the horrifying violence she and Riley were inflicting on each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody thought to stop her as Annie, weeping, walked to the desk and pressed ENTER.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick screamed out a raw, wordless scream of denial and horror and loss, but it was too late. Her hand was steady and calm, and in the aftermath, Bryn went limp and sat back, waiting. They were all waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick rushed to her and took her in his arms, rocking her. “No,” he whispered. “No, no, God, no, don’t do this, don’t do this. . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never should have come back in the first place,” she said. “I’m sorry. I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie sat down next to her and crossed her long, elegant legs, sitting Indian-style like the little girl she’d been, not so long ago. “Do you remember what happened to Sharon?” she asked Bryn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sharon . . .” She walked away from home. She never came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brynnie, I swear—I swear it was an accident. I never meant it—we were just arguing, the way we always did. She pushed me and I was in the kitchen cutting an apple, and I fell down. Then she slipped and fell on the knife, and it cut her on the thigh, and the blood—there was so much blood. I didn’t try to do it—I didn’t. I wouldn’t. Dad tried to save her. He used that belt, you know, the one in the bathroom? He tied it up in a tourniquet around her leg, right here.” She traced the spot with her fingertips on her own leg. “But she died. And they didn’t want anyone to know. Dad took her away, and Mom and I cleaned it all up. I don’t know where he took her. But I’m a monster, too, Bryn. From that moment, I was a monster. I never told anybody, but—I wanted you to know before we go. I’m so sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryn hugged her, and held on to Patrick. Riley was still bleeding, and although the wound seemed to be knitting closed, it was taking longer than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe let out a slow, trembling sigh. “I feel—” He lurched, caught himself, and slid down into a chair. He ran both hands over his bald head. “Can I talk to Kylie and the kids?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePansy, tears coursing down her face, took out her cell phone and dialed a number. She held the phone up to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryn felt it, then. A lurch inside, as if something had started to glitch. A bad part in a smooth-running machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie’s breath caught, as if she felt it, too. Then she let out a slow sigh, and her head slid over to rest on Bryn’s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t any pain. She was just . . . gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t your fault,” Bryn told her. It was too late, but she said it anyway. “You were just a kid, sweetie. It wasn’t your fault.” She glanced down. Her sister’s eyes were open, and at peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley was still fighting, but it didn’t last long. She couldn’t speak, but the fire was there, raging and fighting, until it finally guttered out. Then she was gone, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe’s low voice stopped. Bryn heard Pansy let out a low, anguished sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. French had laid his warm weight down in her lap, and he was whimpering with distress. He knew, too. Poor thing. She put a hand on his warm head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to let me go,” Bryn said to Patrick. “Please let go now. I can’t be a monster. We can’t be that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew. Finally, at last, he knew. She felt it in the way he kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the last thing she felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last glimpse of light, one last whisper of sound. Manny’s voice. Get the . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was curious, even now. Get what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then it didn’t matter, and she was gone, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t feel it, that exact moment when the world came back; it happened in slow stages. A flare of light peeking in between her fluttering eyelids. A dreadful dry taste in her mouth, like smothering on dust. The shock of nerves sparking like short circuits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain. A lot of it, slow hot waves washing up and down her body like tides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s coming back,” someone said. She heard the words, but she didn’t understand them. Her brain felt sluggish and unresponsive, late to a party her body had already crashed. “Sinus rhythm. Oh my God.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so tired. Closed her eyes a moment, and opened them because someone was rubbing knuckles against her breastbone. “Ow,” she whispered. Her lips felt painfully dry. As she blinked away fog, she felt the firm pressure of a straw against her lips, and automatically sucked in a mouthful of sweet, cool water. She swallowed it, took a second mouthful, and then the straw was withdrawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” The voice was rough and familiar, and this time, when she blinked, she saw that it was Patrick. He looked . . . different. He’d grown his hair out, hadn’t he? Thinner, too. She reached out clumsily, more of a flail than a controlled motion, and he took her hand in his and kissed the back of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered, then. Not everything, just pieces . . . Manny. The computer. Annie’s slim fingers pressing ENTER.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she whispered. “Can’t—can’t come back—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t,” Patrick said. His eyes were shimmering with tears, but he blinked them away and didn’t let them quite fall. “Not on your own. Manny said that if you were healed well enough before the nanites died, your autonomic system might come back online. So he shocked you until your heart started beating again. It wasn’t the nanites that brought you back. We brought you back.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/terminated-revivalist-3/page-52.html","bookId":2540,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:00:52 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:00:52 AM"}
