{"id":89984,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re dead,\" I said, echoing the protests of my dream, which, in retrospect, appeared to have been a vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ripped out your throat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not completely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You healed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very old.\" Billy smiled, and the expression was more frightening than a scowl. \"I can heal just about anything. Except silver. Which is something we have in common. I always wondered what it was about you that bothered me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d found some clothes - Lord knows where since there weren\u0027t any outlets for the big and tall in this neck of the woods. The jeans and sweatshirt almost made him appear normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost. A single glance into his eyes and no one would mistake Billy Bailey for anything other than an escaped lunatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thor, the Thunder God,\" Nic murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouble damn. Had the old woman seen Billy? If I\u0027d known that, I could have exited Fairhaven screaming a long time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toss your weapon into the trees,\" Billy ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic complied, and Billy shoved Edward forward so he could keep the gun trained on all three of us. I didn\u0027t care for his expression when he glanced at Nic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re screwing my girl,\" Billy murmured. \"I don\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze as all of the horrible things Billy planned to do to me when he got out of his cell flooded my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed to kill him, really kill him, and quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mandenauer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward, who\u0027d been inching toward the rifle propped against the rear bumper of the Cadillac, stopped. I managed to sidle in front of Nic while Billy\u0027s attention was on my boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly didn\u0027t want me dead. Not yet. But I had a feeling he wouldn\u0027t feel the same way about the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough why he hadn\u0027t just shot them first and done his talking later, I wasn\u0027t sure, and I didn\u0027t plan to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t want a taste of what you\u0027ve served up so freely,\" Billy continued, \"you\u0027ll move far away from that gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward scowled but did as he was told. Unfortunately, he arrived at my side talking. \"You didn\u0027t make sure he was dead, then burn the body? Have you learned nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess not,\" Billy murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still couldn\u0027t find my voice through the fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the werewolf in human form,\" Nic said. \"You killed all those people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, that was her.\" Billy jerked a thumb in Lydia\u0027s direction. \"Except for Basil. That was me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He tried to shoot Dr. Hanover.\" Billy\u0027s eyes narrowed on Lydia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that gaze had been fixed in my direction, I certainly wouldn\u0027t have tossed my head and shrugged. Why wasn\u0027t Lydia afraid of him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promised I could have her when you were through,\" he said. \"That was our deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True.\" Lydia examined her fingernails. \" But I never promised she\u0027d be alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly growled and the hair on my arms lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s really very good.\" Lydia glanced at me. \"If you like your sex extremely rough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething wasn\u0027t adding up, but I was still too frightened to do the math.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look so scared. You\u0027ll be dead by then.\" Lydia returned her attention to Billy. \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve discussed this.\" He gave a long-suffering sigh. \"I fuck her until she dies, and then I do it some more. A deal is a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That just isn\u0027t going to work for me. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly swung the gun in her direction, and Lydia disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic and I stood gaping at the place where she\u0027d been an instant before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate it when she does that,\" Billy muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward had been creeping forward while Billy\u0027s attention was elsewhere. Almost as an afterthought, Billy\u0027s elbow shot out and clipped the old man in the mouth. Edward\u0027s head snapped back and he fell to the ground, but he didn\u0027t pass out. Sometimes I wondered if Edward was human himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly shifted his icy stare to mine. \"Soon, Doctor. Remember everything I ever told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack spots danced in front of my eyes. When they went away, so had Billy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic was at my side. I couldn\u0027t help it, I turned my face into his neck and hid. Even with ancient Ojibwe women buried in shallow graves, murder, mayhem, and a ghost wolf army on the rise, the world had still been a much cheerier place without Billy in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d found my voice. Hallelujah. So why wasn\u0027t I screaming mindlessly until someone locked me in a nice, safe, impenetrable white room?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause having Nic here helped more than I would have imagined. He was steady and sane - which put him two steps ahead of Billy. Sadly, Billy was about two hundred steps ahead when it came to strength and power. We just couldn\u0027t win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep whiff of Nic\u0027s scent, trying to clear any remnant of Billy\u0027s. Then I brushed my lips against his chin and lifted my head. Nic gazed at me with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that was Billy Bailey,\" he said. \"Creepy son of a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s kill him.\" Edward struggled to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You neglected to mention that Gypsies have superpowers, too.\" I looked at Nic. \"That I did not know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It explains how she found out about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" My mind wasn\u0027t keeping up very well - too full of Billy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she can disappear and appear at will, she could know anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Nic\u0027s point. Lydia didn\u0027t need to tap our phones or pay our enemies for information. All she had to do was become invisible and walk inside the compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t she kill me before now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She needed you here for...\" Nic shrugged. \"Something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Terrific.\" I glanced at Edward. \"So explain why Gypsies have superpowers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most do not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she, or did she not, just go poof?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She did.\" He sighed. \"Lydia is not only a Gypsy but a witch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Witch?\" Nic asked. \"Since when are there witches?\" He turned to me. \"Did you know there were witches?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you didn\u0027t tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want a rundown on every supernatural creature we\u0027ve encountered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought a minute, then said, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we\u0027re still alive next week, remind me to make you a list.\" I turned my ire on Edward. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell us she could disappear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if I had known, what good would it have done to tell you? Could you have prevented the disappearance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my forehead. \"What do you know about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I focused on Lydia, maybe I\u0027d quit seeing Billy\u0027s eyes fixed on me. I doubted it, but anything was worth a try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her grandmother was removed from one of the death camps and sent to Mengele.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her grandfather?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was also at the laboratory in the Black Forest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were released, along with the werewolf army.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Witches are hard to identify. They do not sprout tails. They do not suck blood. They do not rise from their graves. They are just magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does anyone find it odd that the usual familiar helps a witch, but a werewolf familiar is a witch?\" Nic pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all Gypsies are witches,\" Edward said. \"Only the pure have magic -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;witches for want of a better term. Mengele used that blood to concoct his werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Magic Gypsy witch blood to make werewolves,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did remember something about that in my notes, but since I\u0027d doubted it would help me find a cure, I\u0027d pushed the information to the back of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you meet Lydia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was acquainted with her grandmother.\" Something flickered in Edward\u0027s eyes, and he looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow well had he known the woman?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered the suspicion. Edward could no more have an affair with a werewolf familiar than he could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... what? Employ a werewolf?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t think it was a good idea to keep track of these people?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. But as they are magic, they have a habit of slipping out of our reach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the name Lydia didn\u0027t set off any alarm bells?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a common enough name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re lost in the forties,\" Nic muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will admit, I made an error not keeping better track of the witches.\" Edward steepled his fingers. \"But let us discuss your error, Elise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy isn\u0027t dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, that error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get over it,\" Nic interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\" Edward lifted a brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t dead, but he will be as soon as I find him.\" Nic reached for his weapon, frowned. \"And my gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started off in the direction of his pistol, then stopped and turned back. \"I\u0027m confused. To make the witchie wolves, dead people need to be bitten by a werewolf in human form?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the theory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As near as we can tell, the bites were all from the same mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, though he knew this as well as I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mouth we\u0027ll assume to be Billy\u0027s since there isn\u0027t a pack of werewolves in Fairhaven - unless you count the ghost wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a point soon, correct?\" Edward murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People were disappearing before we got here, and we have a lot more ghost wolves than two, so how could Billy have bitten anyone if he was locked in a compound in Montana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the silence that settled over the clearing, no one had a definite answer for that, but Edward usually had an educated guess. Today was no different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps another werewolf came first. Once Billy arrived, he killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be a Billy thing to do,\" I agreed. \"Except Damien said there was no werewolf here but him until I arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien could have been wrong,\" Edward pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould have been, but I doubted it. Damien had been a werewolf for nearly sixty years; he knew how to identify another like himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us find Billy, ask him, then kill him,\" Edward suggested. \"Or just kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what my vote is,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did they let us go?\" Nic asked. \"Billy could have killed any, or all, of us. Lydia wants you dead, Elise, yet she took off. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They must realize we will come after them,\" Edward continued. \"The full moon is tonight. Billy will have to change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll be waiting for him,\" Nic murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\" Edward held up a long bony hand. \"If they want us to hunt under the full moon, we will not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong,\" I said, at the same time Nic snapped, \"Like hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward and I turned to Nic as he lifted, then lowered, one shoulder. \"I don\u0027t like how Billy spoke to you, Elise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have heard him in the compound,\" I muttered, then shivered again at the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not say we would not hunt.\" Edward sounded exasperated. \"Nor that we would not kill him and anything else that gets in our way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\" Nic asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silver works on werewolves in the daytime as well as the night. In human form as well as the form of a wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding spread across Nic\u0027s face, followed closely by excitement. \"We\u0027ll shoot him in the daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe won\u0027t even know what hit him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only this one time,\" Edward ordered. \"Billy is a special case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward frowned on us shooting people with silver in broad daylight, no matter how certain we might be of their true nature. In his defense, flaming humans were a lot harder to explain than flaming wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. One-time deal only. Now where\u0027s my gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will need a rifle, as well,\" Edward said. \"I have an arsenal in the trunk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe always did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic practically skipped off to shop at the firearm bonanza, as I stalked toward Edward. I did not want Nic going after Billy. Billy was insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nic isn\u0027t a J��ger-Sucher\" I whispered. \"Since when does he get to pick a rifle and join the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since we are shorthanded, and you are nothing short of horrific with a gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chin went up. \"I have other talents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in the daytime. Besides.\" Edward nodded toward the Cadillac. \"I doubt you will be able to stop him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic was going through the rifles with an ease born of practice. His face held a determination I recognized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t be dissuaded from hunting Billy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\" I threw up my hands. \"But he goes with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the best. Except for Leigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward scowled but didn\u0027t argue since I was right, then he stomped over to the trunk, yanked out his favorite rifle, and began to bark orders. \"Franklin, you are with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \" Nic glanced in my direction, and I shrugged as if I had nothing to say about anything. Though I didn\u0027t want Nic out of my sight ever again, he\u0027d be safer with Edward. Especially since Billy seemed to have a hard-on for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will meet at the cabin before dusk. If one of us has accomplished the task, fire three rounds into the air, then return to town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the Cadillac. \"What about the car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s long-suffering sigh made me want to melt into the earth with shame, same as it had when I was three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drive the vehicle back to town. Walk out from there, Agent Franklin and I walk in from here. We will flush him from his hiding place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I supposed to know this trick without ever having been told? Apparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward moved toward the trees. Nic stepped after him, then glanced in my direction and paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough it was the height of unprofessionalism, I went into his arms. Edward didn\u0027t even bother to snicker, snort, or be snide. He must think we were all going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful,\" I couldn\u0027t help but murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, he was an FBI agent, but this was a Billy and Lord knows what else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t be safe until he\u0027s dead.\" Nic released me with a final squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried one more time. \"Maybe you should go - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?
