This is what he does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t lose my sense around him again. I can’t let myself become just another name in his long list of conquests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have too much to lose if I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI use the toilet, wash my hands, cool my face with the water, then with a clear straight head, I make my way back to our table in the VIP lounge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake is already there sitting with the guys, and also the girl Tom has acquired for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up at my approach and the second my eyes meet with his, whatever sense I had just talked myself into, packs its bags and fucks off, leaving me to the mercy of my hormones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe booth is full. Jake shuffles over, giving me a sliver of room to sit on, and also forcing me to sit next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts his arm around the back of the seat, behind me. My thigh is pressed up tight against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright?” he asks me quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, yes, briefly meeting his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe passes me a fresh beer. My fingers touch his and a charge flies through my hand and up my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought we could have one more then head back to the hotel,” Jake says quietly to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahum,” nodding, I take a mouthful of my beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moves his hand down, and then I feel his thumb start to gently stroke the bare skin on my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels intimate. So totally intimate, and that’s because it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chug harder on my beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the irony right now wishing I was sober so I could think clearer in this situation, and how exactly to extract myself from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I’ll rephrase that – figure out how to want to extract myself from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head and heart are not matching at the moment, and my hormones are raging a war all on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContinuing to sip on my beer, I listen to the guys talk, but I really can’t focus. All I can focus on is Jake’s thumb, gently stroking that one small part of my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like everything has homed in on this one small area. I’m heated. My skin is humming, buzzing under his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my beer down on the table, and bind my hands together in my lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFocus. I just need to focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jake put his hand under the table. He pushes his fingers in-between my palms, forcing my hands apart and takes hold of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake often holds my hand, that’s nothing new, but this time it’s different. There’s a different meaning there. Or was it there all the other times too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know, but what I do know now, is that this feels like he’s staking a claim on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I like the feeling. I want to be his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slides his fingers in-between mine, entwining our hands like lovers would, and rests our bound hands onto his hard thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could try to pretend his touch on my back was nothing. But not this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look across at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares back at me steadily, for a long moment before looking away, but I read his eyes clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants me tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd from what my eyes where saying back to him, I think I just said yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finish up our drinks and leave the club, heading straight into the waiting cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to untangle my hand from Jake’s on the way out of the club, so I make a quick dash for Ben’s waiting car, which Denny and Smith are just climbing into. Denny looks a little surprised to see me in their car, but he says nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel Jake’s eyes on me as I climbed into their car, leaving him with Tom and his girl for the night, but I don’t care. I just need to put some distance between us right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I can just get to the hotel first and back to my room alone, then tonight will be without incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf not … then I really don’t know what will happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even as I think it, I don’t really believe it. I know exactly what will happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Jake wants me tonight, then me travelling back in a separate car will not make the least bit of difference. Because I want him too, and I don’t think I can find the will to say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reach the hotel, Ben pulls up first and I clamber out of the car. My feet are still bare and my shoes are in my hand along with my handbag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m vaguely aware of the other car pulling up, but I’m too distracted by how cold this floor is outside the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus Christ! This floor is freakin’ freezing!” I cry out, hopping from one foot to the other on the tiled floor. The night air isn’t cold but it’s like there is air con blasting out across the tiles, deep freezing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmith chuckles at me, as I start to tread on my tiptoes carefully across the frozen tiles. “You okay there girlie? You need a hand?” He holds his hand out for me take, but I don’t get a chance to respond, because the next thing I know Jake is scooping me up in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Arggh! Put me down you idiot!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake says nothing, and just strides through the door and into the hotel lobby with purpose, and me in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone is staring at us and, Smith, Denny, Tom and his girl – whose name I still haven’t gotten, are all finding this highly amusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can put me down now,” I say, a little clearer and a little firmer, as we reach the carpeted floor in the hotel outside the lifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares straight into my eyes. “I know but I’m not going to. I start a job, I finish it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart takes a clear blast in my chest, and I gulp down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors ping open and Jake strides into the lift with me still in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even waiting for the others he presses the button for our floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We look silly like this,” I say quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And since when have you cared about how we look?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat can I say to that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd truth be told, I don’t want him to put me down, I like the feel of being in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake makes me feel like a girl. Like a woman. It’s not something Will’s ever truly managed to do. Not that Will’s not manly, of course he is, but Jake is in a whole other league. He’s alpha to the extreme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yes, I’m independent and strong, but sometimes … just sometimes, it’s nice to be taken care of. It’s nice to be made to feel like a lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lift quickly reaches our floor; the top floor of course, and Jake exits, taking a left, heading toward my suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy suite is next to his, so I’m praying he just drops me at my door, and goes to his. Actually thinking on it, my suite’s always next to Jake’s whichever hotel we stay in. Hmm…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so the rational side of me is praying that Jake will just leave me outside my room – what small part of it there is left. But I know he won’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Key,” he says stopping outside my door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rummage in my handbag, and pull my key card out. Reaching down, I put it into the slot and push the handle down, as Jake shoves my door open with his leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe carries me through the darkened living room of my suite, letting the door swing shut behind us. I drop my shoes to the floor and toss my handbag onto the sofa as he passes by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck!” he curses, walking into the coffee table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay,” I stifle a giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he grumbles. “It hurts like a mother fucker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll rub it better for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that a promise?” His tone is serious. He’s staring down at me, his eyes impenetrable in the darkness of my suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking away, I say nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reach the bedroom and Jake gently deposits me down on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why thank you kind, sir,” I say putting on a really bad Southern accent like Smith’s, except his is actually cool. “Your work here is done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet, it’s not.” He pulls his boots off and climbs onto the bed, lying down beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you staying?” I ask, nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I am. I’m not leaving my girl drunk and alone. You might be sick and choke on your own vomit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis girl? And also, worst excuse ever for climbing into my bed, Jake, seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I’m not exactly fighting him out of here either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not drunk,” I giggle. “And just trust me, I’ve taken care of myself in worse states than this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah? Well you shouldn’t have had to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s that supposed to mean? Was that a dig at Will?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns on his side and faces me in the darkness. “Do you want me to go?” he murmurs, and his voice suddenly sounds all deep and intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShivers envelop me. My heart-rate increases, and my breathing hitches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it’s fine, stay. But I need to pee,” I say, voice pitchy, as I climb off the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cross the bedroom on seriously wobbly legs, which have nothing to do with the alcohol in my system, and everything to do with Jake in my bed over there, and grab my pyjamas; a vest and short set, and stumble into the bathroom, closing the door behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pee, brush my teeth, take my make-up off and climb in the shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I finish my shower, I put my pyjamas on, towel dry my newly clean hair, and tie it damp into a messy knot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m hoping I’ve been gone long enough so that Jake has fallen asleep because I’ve got a feeling if he hasn’t, I’m soon going to be making the mistake, I really want to make with him tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn the light off before opening the bathroom door, then I quietly let myself back into the bedroom and pad my way across the carpeted floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I’m nearing the bed, Jake utters, “Well that was the longest pee in history. What the fuck were you doing in there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he is still awake. Crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I took a shower, just like you should.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You saying I smell?” he chuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull the duvet back and climb into bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s exactly what I’m saying, but if you’re too lazy to take a shower, can you at least take your stinky ass clothes off, and get your own blanket out of the wardrobe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaying on my back, I tuck the duvet safely around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike that will stop Jake getting near me if he wants to. The man could undress a woman with one look alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes ma’am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clambers up off the bed and I watch in the dark as he pulls his T-shirt off over his head and removes his jeans, leaving him in just his boxer shorts. His sexy, tight black boxer shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, I do stink,” he says sniffing his T-shirt, then his armpit. He tosses his shirt to the floor next to his jeans. “I’ll take a quick shower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe disappears off into the bathroom, leaving the door ajar and the light flooding into the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay here, my heart beating up a storm in my chest. My whole body on fire, as I listen to the running water, desperate to go climb back in that shower with Jake, and do things with him I shouldn’t want to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the water go off, then he re-emerges a few minutes later, wearing only a towel around his waist, his hair all damp and mussed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so done for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaves the bathroom door ajar again, a splay of light in the room illuminating his nearly naked form, his tattoos looking intricate in the low-light. He looks beautiful, and I wonder if he’s done it on purpose leaving the light on him, giving me a full view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he left the door open while he was getting a shower on purpose too. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-mighty-storm-the-storm-1/page-25.html","bookId":1998,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:44 PM"}
