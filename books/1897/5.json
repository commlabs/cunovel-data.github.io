{"id":85965,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me the chance to redeem myself; I know,\" I say. \"When you were obsessing over our conversation this weekend, did you take a moment to appreciate what a jerk kind of thing that is to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I offended you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not likely. I just thought you\u0027d want to know how it made you sound. You\u0027re obviously one of those people who really care about what other people think of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop; he stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t really think you wanted in my pants, Jake, but if you spent the whole weekend waiting for today just so you could clear that up, you have some issues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have issues?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There. Admitting you have a problem is half the battle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, you\u0027re not half as clever as you think you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This still makes me a lot cleverer than you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrive at homeroom. Perfect timing. I get to leave Jake sputtering in the doorway. It\u0027s almost worth being early for that alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room is only half-full and Becky is nowhere to be found, but Chris is seated in the middle row, working on his homework. He\u0027s almost as bad as I am, if not for the fact that he usually gets it done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-oh,\" he says, looking up as I approach. \"I know that face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you ever do your homework at home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About half.\" He finishes up some English and I sit down beside him for the hell of it. He closes his book. \"You\u0027re hungover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a hungover face?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s subtle, but it\u0027s there.\" It\u0027s stuff like this that makes me glad we broke up. He pauses. \"You want to talk about it?\" \"I think my face says it all. How was your date with Becky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forces a smile. The right corner of his mouth starts twitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" he says, in a voice that belies the word. \"It was good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-oh, I know that face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groans and leans back in his seat. \"Becky\u0027s a great girl--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clutch my heart. \"There\u0027s not going to be a second date!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, when you called her a great girl.\" This poses a problem. Becky\u0027s supposed to be my replacement, or at the very least they could distract each other from me for a while. I\u0027ll have to lie, but it\u0027s for a worthwhile cause. \"She is a great girl. You\u0027d be an idiot if you let her go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker, you hate Becky. And you\u0027re taking an unusual interest in my date with her. Jealous?\" I laugh and he gives me this look. \"No, really. Why do you care? And why are you hungover?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put on my most Obnoxious Teacher Talking to a Really, Really Stupid Student voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Chris, sometimes when someone overindulges--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do know that Becky and I are supposed to report any kind of behavior like this to Grey and Henley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s funny. Tell me another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was because she\u0027s not me, isn\u0027t it? That\u0027s why it didn\u0027t work out, huh? Becky\u0027s a great girl, but she\u0027s no Parker Fadley. It\u0027s okay. I understand. I am pretty awesome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you, too. And if you tell Henley or Grey, I\u0027ll kick your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorts. \"Oh, really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and I\u0027ll probably get away with it, because I\u0027m a girl. Make sure you hit me back. That\u0027ll only improve my odds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head. \"You have to take it that one step too far, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always.\" I won\u0027t do it. I won\u0027t. I will not. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddammit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it,\" he mutters, waving a hand. \"I won\u0027t tell on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not why I said it.\" Goddammit. \"Look, just give Becky another chance--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if you ease off on Jake Gardner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ease off? I\u0027ve only talked to him, like, three times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and every one of those times you\u0027ve been a bitch--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this? Have you taken a shine to the boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolls his eyes. \"Yeah, Parker. That\u0027s exactly it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, why didn\u0027t you say so? I\u0027ll lighten up on him then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. God, do you know who you\u0027re talking to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately,\" Chris says. The bell explodes in my head or rings, whatever. I wince and rub my temples. \"And consider this a favor. If you come to school hungover again, I\u0027ll go straight to Grey.\" \"Thanks, Chris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome, Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky makes a mad dash into the room a minute after the Pledge of Allegiance starts over the PA and I wonder if she\u0027s avoiding Chris, like if their date went that bad. After we recite the Apostles\u0027 Creed, I move back to where she\u0027s sitting despite Chris\u0027s best efforts to convince me not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d the date go?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles. \"Okay. Chris is a great guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s enough to make a girl depressed. When Chris says Becky\u0027s a great girl it means she\u0027s boring, but when Becky says Chris is a great guy it means she\u0027s probably started a scrapbook of the time they\u0027ve spent together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Details, details,\" I sing. \"Where did you go and what did you do and do you have a Tylenol on you? I\u0027ve got a killer headache.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe unzips her pencil case and retrieves a Baggie of white pills and I can\u0027t help but laugh at how suspect it looks. I help myself to two and swallow them dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We went for a ride around and we stopped at that diner out on Route Seven. It was mostly just talking, you know. He talked about you a lot. Like, the whole night was mostly about Parker, actually. It was lovely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pretend she didn\u0027t say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you make plans for a second date?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she says. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027ll be one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Come on! You said he\u0027s a great guy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also said he talked about you for the whole date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says it with a voice that totally hates me, even though I can\u0027t be held responsible for Chris being such a fuck. We stare at each other. It\u0027s way easier to not be Becky\u0027s friend than it is to not be Chris\u0027s girlfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He liked the sweater though,\" she adds. \"A lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head buzzes through history while I wait for the Tylenol to kick in. By the time art rolls around I feel less hungover and more charitable. We\u0027re working with paint today and I pick the easel next to Jake\u0027s. It thrills him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to apologize if you\u0027re offended by the way I am,\" I tell him. \"But that\u0027s the way I am with everyone. I was just trying to make you feel welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the crappiest apology I\u0027ve ever heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s because I\u0027m not really sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolls his eyes. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get to painting. I wish I could have art forever. Senior art, anyway. Norton\u0027s a hard-ass, but a lazy one. At our age, he figures, we\u0027ve learned everything about art that can be learned in high school, and now we spend the entire period trying to create things that he might not have seen in the last twenty- five years. Every forty minutes is another opportunity to surprise him. The bigger the surprise, the better the mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, where do you come from and how come you moved here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake reaches for the red paint. \"West Coast. My dad wanted a new scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t have waited until the end of the year?\" Jake snorts. \"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how are you finding St. Peter\u0027s? Do you like it here so far?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me a look. \"Generally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat can I say? I stare at the paper in front of me and try to figure out what to create. I glance across the room, at Chris\u0027s easel. Sure enough, he\u0027s painting a tree. I grin, reach for the black and get to work on a stick person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stick person with its head on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027s your deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes a minute before I realize Jake\u0027s talking to me. There\u0027s something very enthralling about painting a stick person with its head aflame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou just forget the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you used to be captain of the cheerleading squad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now where did you hear a crazy thing like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chris mentioned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it must be true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said you used to be popular.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mentioned that, too, did he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked, but if you were head cheerleader, I guess I didn\u0027t need to. I was surprised. Not many people give up those kinds of perks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I\u0027ll turn this stick person into Chris. All I have to do is put an orange jersey with the number 22 on it and he\u0027ll know it\u0027s him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027s your deal?\" Jake asks again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake, I barely know you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend lunch in the gym again, watching the boys scrimmage and the girls eating carrot sticks before they get ready to cheer. This kind of routine could get monotonous fast, and not in a good way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretch out on the bleachers, shoving aside the lunch Mom packed for me. My headache is gone, but I don\u0027t think I can handle food. I shouldn\u0027t have finished off the bottle of vodka in my room last night. It was left over from before, hidden in the back of my closet, and I drank until I fell asleep. That\u0027s the only reason to do it now and I don\u0027t do it very often, contrary to what everyone else thinks. Back then, I drank to be caught. It was the start of my great campaign to distance myself from everyone. I even had a checklist and everything. First item: indulge in alienating, self-destructive behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt worked beautifully at the start, but I hadn\u0027t counted on my family and former friends conspiring against me. The problem with alienating, self-destructive behavior is people get it into their heads it\u0027s a cry for help. It wasn\u0027t. It was just a really poorly executed plan to get everyone off my back. So now I\u0027m halfway between where I started (not alone) and where I want to end up (alone) and I just have to roll with it if I want to graduate or else I\u0027ll never be alone. It\u0027s stupid. And not just because of the homework thing. Oh shit. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-5.html","bookId":1897,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM"}
