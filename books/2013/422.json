The imperial road stretching down towards them from a main gate was, in the red glare of sunset, a seething serpent. Pouring out by the thousands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiots, apparently. An economy in ruins, people facing starvation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never knew we could cause such trouble, eh Fid?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can’t be us, Cuttle. Not just us, I mean. Haven’t you noticed? There are no Tiste Edur in this crowd. Now, either they’ve retreated behind their estate walls, or to the palace keep or whatever it is where the Emperor lives, or they were the first to run.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Like those behind us, then. Heading back to their homelands in the north.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Maybe.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So, if this damned empire is already finished, why are we bothering with the capital?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler shrugged. ‘Bottle might have hidden one of his rats in the Adjunct’s hair-why not ask him?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Adjunct ain’t got enough hair for that,’ Cuttle muttered, though he did glance back at the squad mage. Bottle did not deign to reply. ‘See anybody on those walls, Fid? My eyes are bad in bad light.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If there are, they’re not holding torches,’ Fiddler replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been so little time to think. About anything, beyond just staying alive. Ever since the damned coast. But now, as he walked on this road, Fiddler found his thoughts wandering dusty paths. They had set out on this invasion in the name of vengeance. And, maybe, to eradicate a tyrannical Emperor who viewed anyone not his subject as meat for the butcher’s cleaver. All very well, as far as it goes. Besides, that hardly makes this Emperor unique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why is this our battle? And where in Hood’s name do we go from here? He so wanted to believe the Adjunct knew what she was doing. And that, whatever came and however it ended, there would be some meaning to what they did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We must be our own witness.’ To what, dammit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Soldiers on the wall,’ Koryk called out. ‘Not many, but they see us clear enough.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler sighed. First to arrive, and maybe that’s as far as we’ll get. An army of eight hundred camped outside one gate. They must be pissing in their boots. He drew another deep breath, then shook himself. ‘Fair enough. We finally got an appreciative audience.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiles didn’t much like the look of these refugees. The pathetic faces, the shuffling gaits, they reminded her too much of… home. Oh, there’d been nothing in the way of hopeless flight back then, so it wasn’t that, exactly. Just the dumb animal look in these eyes. The uncomprehending children dragged along by one hand, or clinging to mother’s ratty tunic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bonehunters marched to Letheras-why weren’t these fools screaming and wailing in terror? They’re like slaves, pushed into freedom like sheep into the wilds, and all they expect ahead is more slavery. That, or dying in the tangles of empty forests. They’ve been beaten down. All their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what’s so familiar. Isn’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her head and spat onto the road. Hood take all empires. Hood take all the prod and pull. I/I get to you, dear Emperor of Lether-if 1 get to you first, I’m going to slice you into slivers. Slow, with lots of pain. For every one of these wretched citizens on this stinking road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, the sooner all these fools get out of our way, the sooner I can torture their Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We head for the palace,’ Koryk said to Tarr. ‘And let nothing get in our way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re smoke-dreaming, Koryk,’ the corporal replied. ‘We’d have to cut through a few thousand stubborn Letherii to do that. And maybe even more Edur. And if that’s not enough, what about that wall there? Plan on jumping it? We haven’t got enough munitions to-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Rubbish-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I mean, there’s no way Keneb’s going to allow the sappers to use up all their stuff, not when all we have to do is wait for the Adjunct, then do a siege all proper.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoryk snorted. ‘Proper like Y’Ghatan? Oh, I can’t wait.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no Leoman of the Flails in Letheras,’ Tarr said, tugging at his chin strap. ‘Just some Edur on the throne. Probably drunk. Insane. Drooling and singing lullabies. So, why bother with the palace? Won’t be anything of interest there. I say we loot some estates, Koryk.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Malazan soldiers don’t loot.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But we’re not any more, are we? I mean, soldiers of the Malazan Empire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoryk sneered at his corporal. ‘So that means you just sink back down to some frothing barbarian, Tarr? Why am I not surprised? I never believed all those civilized airs you’re always putting on.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-422.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
