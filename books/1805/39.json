Thank you,” Stil said, taking the roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I appreciate the trouble you are putting yourself through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s no trouble at all,” Stil said, leaning against the wall as he ate. “Although there is one last bit to the spell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you call my name, you have to use my mage name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma tilted her head. “Your mage name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil nodded. “Because I’m a craftmage, my power lies close with creation and naming, so I took up a mage name to give my spells an extra boost of power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going to laugh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil chuckled. “At least you’re honest. It’s Rumpelstiltskin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rumpelstiltskin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” Gemma said, keeping her expression bland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil’s lips quirked. “I can tell you are laughing on the inside, Gemma.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not better than laughing openly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps it is,” Stil said. “Your eyes glitter extra, which is enchanting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprised, Gemma opened and closed her mouth before furrowing her forehead as she tried to decipher what that meant. Stil finished his roll and watched her. The set of his lips said he was highly amused as Gemma tried to puzzle through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will need something to trade for the thimble,” he said after some moments when Gemma still hadn’t worked out an acceptable reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly?” Gemma blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a less valuable charm, so I don’t need much. You could give me a bit of whatever you’re making,” Stil said, nodding to the cape—which was coming along quite nicely—Gemma had folded and placed on the blankets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma pressed her lips together and wondered how she could refuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or a lock of your hair will do just as well,” Stil said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma frowned. “A lock of hair? That’s incredibly useless—although I suppose it isn’t as terrible as trading gold for more gold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil said nothing but wore a small smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well. I will have to trade with a lock of hair—for I haven’t anything else. Unless you want another roll?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your hair will be fine. It won’t take much,” Stil said, beckoning her closer with a finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma approached the mage and stood very still when he flicked a hunting knife out of his cloak. He spun Gemma around and gently pulled a lock of her wild hair. “There,” he said when Gemma felt him release her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe craftmage held up the lock—it was little more than the crazy, upward curl her hair ended with—for Gemma’s inspection. “Also, I will lend you this while I’m gone,” he said, passing over the ruby heat charm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t. You just took that back yesterday,” Gemma argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you will need it even more while I am gone. It’s only going to get colder, and you sleep with an open grate in your ceiling,” Stil said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have anything I could trade for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have to. I will lend it to you,” Stil said, taking Gemma’s hand and placing the charm on her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly warmth started to flood Gemma, who looked doubtfully down at the charm. “I don’t think—,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gemma, it’s fine,” Stil said, once again leaning back against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma shrugged and changed the subject. “Where will you be going?” she asked, moving to place the charm on top of the cape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a bit of investigating to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma tilted her head. “Is the Veneno Conclave planning something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. That’s the problem,” Stil sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil brushed his hands off before moving to stand in front of her. “It’s nothing for you to worry about. You will be safe while I’m gone,” he said, placing his hands on her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma frowned. She did not like the brush off, but Stil was a mage. A mage who had saved her life twice, now. She allowed him to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you will not hesitate to call for me,” Stil said, tapping a finger on her shoulder to get her attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Gemma agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill smiled. “Good,” he said, brushing a finger beneath her chin. “I will head out immediately, then. Enjoy your lunch,” the mage said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma turned to glance at the tray of food. “Yes, did you want—,” she cut herself off when she realized the mage was no longer in the cell with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma shrugged. “Mages. They’re worse than cats.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day, early in the morning, Gemma walked outside on the shores of Lake Sno with Foss and Rudd. There was no wind, but the temperatures were cold, and the previous night brought a hard frost, so everything from fence posts to tree leaves were white with the lacework of frost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had wandered close enough to Ostfold to hear the morning bustle as villagers went about their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Winter is nearly here,” Foss announced. “Have you got enough hay for your animals, Rudd?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We hope to sell one of the goats. If we don’t, it will be tight,” Rudd said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGemma turned her gaze from Ostfold to her guards. “You have animals?” She asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rumpelstiltskin-timeless-fairy-tales-4/page-39.html","bookId":1805,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:58 PM"}
