I figured Mary’s family is well off, but not enough to give away a house like that for free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m relieved, obviously, because clearly Aunt Bette, or Aunt Elizabeth, is getting the help she needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what about Mary?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are other papers too, stapled to this one. I set the rest of the pile of filing on top of the cabinet and take this stack back to Danner’s office. I’m about to slide them into my bag to show Lillia, when Danner comes in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. Think fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry. I was filing these papers but I thought I heard my phone ring.” I stand up. “Congrats on the Zane house. I’m glad it went through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanner eyes me suspiciously. She takes the papers out of my hands and replaces them with an envelope. “Best of luck to you, Katherine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty-Four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLILLIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMILKY MORNING’S OATMEAL CUPCAKES WITH chocolate frosting are Alex’s favorite. So I have six of those, and two chocolate chip cookies. I’m standing outside his pool house, working up the courage to knock on the door. I know he’s home. His car is right out front. Maybe I should just leave the bag and go. He’s not going to want to see me right now. It’s my fault he got punched in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the bag on the ground, and that’s when the door opens. Alex is standing there holding a bag of frozen peas to his face. “Hey, Lil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and say, “Alex, I am so sorry for what happened today. You were just trying to help me, and then you got hit for it. I swear to you I wasn’t trying to pull you into anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out the breath. “Really?” I bend over and pick up the Milky Morning bag and hand it to him. “Here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex takes it and looks inside. “Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. I really am sorry, Alex.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell happened with you guys?” He shakes his head. “Never mind. It’s none of my business. Thanks for stopping by, Lil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, and then I run back to my car. As I’m driving home, I have to force myself not to turn around and go to Reeve’s. I heard he was suspended for three days. I know he’s suffering right now too. I wish so badly that I could be the one to comfort him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp; *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get home, Kat’s waiting for me on my front steps. Crap. I was able to avoid her at school today by hiding out in the library, but now here she is. She jumps up as soon as I reach the steps. “Why haven’t you been answering your damn phone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind that. What the hell happened today, dude? I heard Tabatsky sucker-punched Alex in the freaking face!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um . . . yeah.” I sit down on the steps, and Kat joins me. What do I say? I want to tell her the truth, but I’m afraid, because of Reeve and also because if Mary’s leaving her out of it, there’s no reason to get her involved. It’s safer for her not to know. “Reeve and I were fighting, and Alex stepped in, and then Reeve punched him.” Kat’s eyes go huge and she opens her mouth to ask another question, and I speak before she can. “Reeve and I broke up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer jaw drops. “Are you serious! Why? You guys are crazy for each other!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat reason can I give that she’d believe? “He . . . he cheated on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Motherfucker!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod my head. “Yup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’d he cheat on you with?” she demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just some random girl. She . . . she doesn’t live on the island. I found some texts on his phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it. I’m gonna kick his ass.” Kat starts to stand up, and I quickly grab her arm and make her sit back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please don’t go over there, Kat,” I beg. “It’s so humiliating. I don’t ever even want to think about it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he can’t just play you like that, Lil—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! Swear to me you won’t say anything to Reeve, Kat. Swear it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.” Kat starts chewing on her thumbnail. “You’re all right, though?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I mean, I’m sad. But I just want to forget any of this ever happened.” I force a smile. “Your tan looks amazing. Did you have a good time on Tim’s boat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was killer,” she says. “But don’t change the subject. You sure you’re okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I swear! I just don’t want to talk about it anymore. It’s been such an awful year.” My eyes fill with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, okay. Don’t cry. I’ll change the subject.” Kat squeezes my knee. “I have something crazy to tell you about Mary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I stop breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s literally crazy. Mary’s aunt is in the loony bin!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude, it’s a long story, but basically I found a power of attorney form at the Preservation Society office! Mary’s mom had her committed!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my gosh,” I breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, so mystery solved. Mary’s back with her parents and away from her freaky aunt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” I repeat. “Mystery solved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Forty-Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKAT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT HOME after leaving Lillia’s, I drive to Mary’s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I get out of my car and walk up the path, I almost can’t believe the state of it. Mary’s house is rotting at warp speed. Strangely, it looks way worse than the last time Lillia and I came here to look for her, which was only three months ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grass in the yard is overgrown. There are mushy leaves everywhere, and it gives the whole front lawn that decaying smell. Every window in the house is dark. The mail slot in the front door is stuffed full, and the overflow is in a messy pile on the front step, waterlogged and brown and pulpy. The biggest tree in the yard must have fallen in a storm or something. It’s gone. Only a stump is left, but the perimeter bushes where it fell are crushed and aren’t growing back. I watch a bird fly from a telephone wire into a small hole in the attic vent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I get why Mary’s mom was cool with giving the house away. There isn’t much left to save.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looks like that old Volvo was towed away. And in its place the Preservation Society has parked two big Dumpsters, and they are full of Mary’s family’s stuff. A floral armchair, a couch, some paintings. I’m looking for a recent photograph of Mary, but they’re all of when she was younger, when I didn’t know her. I lift up an old curtain and find a huge stack of books underneath. Weird old books with cloth covers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ashes-to-ashes-burn-for-burn-3/page-47.html","bookId":2728,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM"}
