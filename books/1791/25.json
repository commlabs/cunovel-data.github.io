He continued to squint at Caine as he walked over to the hearth. Both Colin and Nathan got their feet and the stool out of his way just in the nick of time. While Jade helped resettle Colin, Harry stood in front of the hearth, his hands clasped behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t look anything like Dolphin,\" he remarked. He grinned, displaying his lovely tooth again, then added, \"You and your puny-arsed brother are both homely as sin. Only family resemblance I can see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine didn\u0027t think the man could see much of anything, but he kept that opinion to himself. He looked over at Colin to see how he was responding to that insult. Though Colin\u0027s eyes were once again closed, he was smiling. Caine concluded Harry\u0027s thunder was all for his benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his men carried a big chair over to the hearth, and when Harry was settled, Jade walked over to stand behind him. She put her hand on Harry\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wear spectacles, me boy?\" Harry asked Caine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine shook his head. \"Anyone here wear them? One of your servants perchance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Caine answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle, do you know where you lost your last pair?\" she asked:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, lovely, you know I don\u0027t remember,\" he answered. \"If I did, I wouldn\u0027t have lost them, now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry turned back to Caine then. \"There be a village close by?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin started laughing. Even Nathan broke into a grin. Caine didn\u0027t have the faintest idea why they were so amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a village close by,\" Colin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one was asking you, you twit. Go back to sleep, Dolphin. It\u0027s all you\u0027re good for,\" he added with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry turned to his cohorts and bellowed, \"Men, you know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two unsavory-looking men lounging by the terrace doors both nodded. Just as they turned to leave, Jade prodded Harry\u0027s shoulder. \"Oh, all right, girl,\" he muttered. \"No pillaging, men,\" he shouted then. \"We\u0027re too close to home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, Black Harry,\" one of the men called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they jump to do my bidding?\" Harry asked Jade in a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did,\" she answered. \"As quick as lightning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry nodded. He clasped his knees with his hands and leaned forward. \"Now then, I was hearing talk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof mutiny when I came inside. You\u0027d think this was a time for rejoicing, but I ain\u0027t hearing any cheering. You hearing any cheering, girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could it be that the Dolphin\u0027s such a bother, you ain\u0027t glad to have him back?\" he asked Caine. \"Can\u0027t say I blame you. The boy can\u0027t even play a decent game of chess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was half out of my mind when we last played,\" Colin reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry snorted. \"You only got half a mind, twit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin grinned. \"Caine? Do you know why this sorry piece of flesh is called Black Harry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be telling it,\" Harry announced. \"It\u0027s because I got me a black heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made that statement as a boast, then waited a full minute for Caine to appreciate his explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave myself that nickname. It\u0027s fitting, ain\u0027t it, girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Uncle, it\u0027s very fitting. Your heart\u0027s as black as night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good of you to say so,\" Harry replied. He reached up and patted her hand. \"As soon as me men get back from their errand, I\u0027m leaving for the Wharf. I could use a spot of supper to hold me over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall see to it at once,\" Jade said. She immediately moved toward the doors, deliberately making a wide path of Caine\u0027s chair. When she reached the entrance to the foyer, she turned back to her uncle. \"Please don\u0027t let Nathan and Caine fight while I\u0027m gone, Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be caring,\" Harry called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I would care,\" she returned. \"Please, Harry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right then, I won\u0027t let them fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the door shut behind Jade, Harry whispered, \"She\u0027s a piece of work, that one. I should have cut her face years ago. She\u0027s too pretty for her own safety. \u0027Tis the reason I had to leave her behind so many times. Couldn\u0027t trust me men when my back was turned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s so pretty,\" Nathan snapped, \"that some dishonorable men would take advantage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let it go for now, Nathan,\" Colin interjected. He opened his eyes and looked at Caine. \"My brother\u0027s an honorable man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like hell,\" Nathan growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine wasn\u0027t paying any attention to the conversation now. He\u0027d homed in on Harry\u0027s casually stated comment that he\u0027d left Jade behind. Where did he leave her? Who watched over her when he was away? There sure as hell hadn\u0027t been a woman there, or she would have known a little more about the facts of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s all this talk about?\" Harry demanded, drawing Caine\u0027s attention again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Although it isn\u0027t in your nature, I\u0027m asking you to be patient, Harry,\" Colin requested. \"There\u0027s been a little misunderstanding, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clear it up quick then,\" Harry ordered. \"Damn it, Colin, I know all I need to know,\" Nathan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother\u0027s a bastard . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were born out of wedlock, son?\" Harry interrupted. He looked absolutely thrilled by that possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine sighed. \"No, I wasn\u0027t born out of wedlock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry didn\u0027t even try to hide his disappointment, another fact that made absolutely no sense to Caine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you can\u0027t be going by that nickname,\" he instructed. \"Only those born with the stigma can boast\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof it. A man\u0027s only as good as his nickname,\" he added with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or a woman,\" Colin interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine looked incredulous. Colin tried not to laugh. \"Harry? Tell him about Bastard Bull,\" he suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colin, for God\u0027s sake,\" Caine began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In time, Caine,\" his brother whispered. \"I need a little more time to gather my thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine nodded. \"All right,\" he said. He turned to Harry then. \"Tell me about Bastard Bull.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He weren\u0027t a bastard after all,\" Harry stated with a scowl. \"He just said he was so he could sign on with us. He knew the store I put in nicknames. When we found out he\u0027d lied, we tossed him overboard with the garbage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They happened to be in the middle of the ocean at the time,\" Colin drawled out. \"Pagan wouldn\u0027t let\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim drown, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How very considerate of you,\" Caine muttered to Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now there was this other bloke, a good, strong man . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine let out a long sigh. He leaned back in the chair, closed his eyes, and decided he was going to have to wait until all this ridiculous talk about nicknames was finished. Colin seemed to be enjoying the conversation and he had asked for time. His brother looked half asleep now ... and so damned pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a good ten minutes or more Harry continued with his dissertation. When he finally finished, Nathan said, \"Jade has a special nickname, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be telling it,\" Harry stated. \"I\u0027m the one who came up with the special name, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan nodded. \"All right, Harry, you tell it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was watching Caine now. If he\u0027d bothered to open his eyes, he would have seen their smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine was having difficulty holding onto his patience. \"And what is her special nickname, Harry?\" he finally asked, his tone weary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well now, me boy,\" Harry drawled out. \"We like to call her Pagan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twelve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t take the news at all well. For the longest time, he simply refused to believe Jade could possibly be Pagan. Only a man could get away with such daring feats, only a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin, Harry, and Nathan were all watching him closely. When he shook his head in denial, they nodded in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see you\u0027re having trouble accepting this,\" Colin said. His expression was sympathetic. \"But it is true, Caine. Harry gave her that nickname years ago because . ..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be telling it,\" Harry interrupted. \"It was the color of her hair, son. As red as hell\u0027s fire it was when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was a youngster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was apparent from the look on Caine\u0027s face that he still didn\u0027t accept. Harry thought he didn\u0027t understand the reason for her special nickname. \"She was as wild as the devil back then, too,\" he explained. \"Just like a pagan baby, she was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine\u0027s expression slowly turned from disbelief to fury. Both Colin and Harry became uneasy. Only Nathan seemed to be enjoying the moment. \"Would a man be apt to leave a rose behind, Caine?\" he asked, hoping to rub salt in his wounds. \"That\u0027s the work of a woman. It\u0027s amazing to me that no one\u0027s figured it out by now. Don\u0027t you agree, Colin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Colin answered, his gaze directed on his brother. \"Amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the last remark anyone made for a long while. Harry and Nathan waited for Caine to come to terms with the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin knew his brother far better than his friends did. He patiently waited for the explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was in the dining room helping Sterns set the table. As soon as the butler took one look at her face, he knew something was wrong. She looked as pale as the linen tablecloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t tell him anything but explained that her uncle had arrived and that he and his four men would require supper before they left. She also insisted upon using the finest crystal. Sterns went into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe kitchens to order the meal, throwing both the cook and her assistant, Bernice, into a frenzy, and then returned to the dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found Jade examining a large oval silver platter. \"Uncle would like this,\" she remarked. \"The design is quite magnificent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns nodded. \"A gift from the King,\" he explained. \"When the Marquess was knighted, Colin threw quite a bash in his honor. The King showed up and gave him that platter. If you turn it over, you\u0027ll see the inscription.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade shook her head. She thrust the platter into Sterns\u0027 hands. \"Hide it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hide it, Sterns,\" she repeated. She looked around the room, then asked, \"Are there any other special things Caine would rather keep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The silver tea set on the side bar,\" he said. \"I do believe it has special meaning to mi\u0027lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did the King give him that, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, the set came from his grandmother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hide it as well, Sterns. Put the things under Caine\u0027s bed. They\u0027ll be safe there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mi\u0027lady?\" Sterns asked. \"Are you feeling ill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look ill,\" Sterns announced. \"And you\u0027re walking around as though you\u0027re in a trance. I know something\u0027s wrong. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade walked over to the door, then turned back to Sterns. \"You have been very kind to me, sir. I will always remember that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns looked startled. Jade was about to close the door behind her when Caine\u0027s command reached her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bellow made the crystal goblets rattle. Jade showed no reaction to the summons, but Sterns jumped\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe your employer has just heard some distressing news,\" she said. \"I had hoped that my uncle would wait . . . it doesn\u0027t matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns followed her into the entrance. When she started up the stairs, he called out to her. \"I believe mi\u0027lord would like you to go to him, Lady Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued up the stairs. \"I would be happy to stand by your side,\" he promised. \"I know his temper can be frightening at times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns waited until she was out of sight, then rushed inside the drawing room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler had difficulty maintaining his steely composure when he spotted Colin. \"My God, is that you, Colin?\" he stammered out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Sterns,\" Colin said. \"It\u0027s good to see you again. Are you still ordering your lord around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns was slow to recover. \"I give it my best,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this one a servant, Caine?\" Harry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a dictator, not a servant,\" Colin announced with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns turned to the older man with the obvious poor eyesight. He tried not to gape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is me supper ready yet?\" Harry bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns decided this one had to be Jade\u0027s uncle. The stranger sitting next to Colin was too young. \"It is almost ready,\" he told him before finally turning to Caine. \"I must speak to you at once in the foyer, mi\u0027lord. It is a most important matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now, Sterns,\" Caine said, his tone weary. \"Talk to me later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you didn\u0027t hear me,\" Sterns countered. \"There is a problem that must be resolved immediately. It concerns Lady Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine wasn\u0027t at all surprised. \"What\u0027s she burning now? The kitchens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mi\u0027lord, this isn\u0027t the time for jests,\" the butler snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I look like I\u0027m jesting, Sterns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler folded his arms across his chest. \"Lady Jade isn\u0027t burning anything at the moment,\" he said. \"She\u0027s leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat announcement got just the reaction Sterns was hoping for. He moved out of his lord\u0027s way when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe bounded to his feet, and nodded with satisfaction when Caine roared, \"The hell she is!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler waited until his employer had left the room, then turned back to Jade\u0027s uncle. \"Dinner will\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe served in just a moment,\" he announced, his haughty tone of voice fully restored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine took the stairs two at a time. His heart was pounding. The thought of her leaving him was untenable. For the first time in his life, he was in a panic. He didn\u0027t like the feeling at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he threw the door open to her bedroom, he saw her. The panic left in a rush. He slammed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe door shut behind him and leaned against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath to try to calm himself. She was pretending he wasn\u0027t there. She stood by the side of the bed, folding a gold-colored gown. Her satchel was open and nearly filled to the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might as well quit packing,\" he said, amazed that his voice sounded so forceful. \"You aren\u0027t going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade turned to confront him. She was determined to give him a piece of her mind before taking her leave, but when she caught his expression, her heart fell to her stomach and she couldn\u0027t remember any of the words she wanted to say to him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-25.html","bookId":1791,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM"}
