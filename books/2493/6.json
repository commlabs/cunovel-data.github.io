I instantly thought of McDonald\u0027s. I grabbed another hot dog and a fresh pop. I opened the tab with a loud snap and took a swig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there was a huge door that was all metal, never seen anything like it.

Way different.\" Randi said. \"They were wearing clothes I\u0027d never seen before, really old...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a sudden inspiration. \"Like Clyde?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandi scrunched up her face in thought, making her nose pucker in an appealing way that Alex noticed, he smiled a little, a fugue of attraction had descended on him and he was in some kind of stupor. Tiff noticed, throwing a glare his way that he completely missed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kinda. But Clyde looks... newer somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, describe the wardrobe,\" John said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandi did, in great detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh.

I also took a summer course on Medieval Customs and Diction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared and he smiled, explaining more, \"It\u0027s interesting how people lived before us... as a point of fact...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Terran, keep that creepy shit to yourself.

World-hopper?\" Tiff asked in her delicate way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandi nodded, unfazed. \"They had to come up with a name and everything.

They\u0027re not going to take off and experiment on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys let an uneasy silence roll out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied our expressions, hers becoming more somber as the silence continued. \"Are they?\" she asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll kick their asses if they touch you,\" Alex said, brushing a stray black hair behind her ear, lifted by the light breeze that had come up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled like a fool and said, \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy scoffed, \"Listen, that\u0027s romantic and all that happy crap but it\u0027s not gonna cut it if they send out the dogs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey?\" Jade asked in Randi\u0027s direction.

We grabbed our aching ribs and Jonesy fell off the bench while Gramps looked on, perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he smiled, looking at the nonplussed girls, \"What\u0027s with the guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia summed it up perfectly, \"They\u0027re apes, Mac.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oink-oink,\" Jade added, looking at me with tears streaming out of my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turnips,\" Sophie said, picking the shittiest vegetable on the planet, making us guys wail louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah... I vote for pigs,\" Tiff said in a bored voice, looking at us like ants scurrying on a hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps gave the girls a considering look, stabbing me with the end of his broom like a one hundred ninety pound dust mote and I barked out another laugh. His eyes finally settled on Tiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like you girls have a small problem with an animal fetish,\" Gramps said, coming swiftly to our side, a grin riding his face to bursting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped my eyes, just another day at Gramps\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on Gale\u0027s easy chair with my hands dangling awkwardly between my knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing was easy right now. I watched the couple across from me and saw what was on Clyde\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove and devotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim diggin\u0027 on Gale shouldn\u0027t have worked for me but it did. It made sense, she was AFTD, so was I. As long as a person didn\u0027t dwell on the specifics of the whole thing, it\u0027d roll just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, there was the small detail of them dating... and everything that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde sat back casually, his suit unbuttoned, his hand clasped loosely in Gale\u0027s, his fingers brushing against her knuckles casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntimately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed.

Move forward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde said, \"Roberta knows my intentions toward her are honorable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met his eyes, the deep green impenetrable. \"I know Clyde. But, others don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde gave a smile-turned-smirk. \"I have gathered that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can we do?\" Gale said, giving me steady eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, I was only almost seventeen, what did I know? I plowed forward anyway. \"Ah, I don\u0027t think you can legally... ah get married or anything. I mean, technically, Clyde\u0027s dead. There\u0027s like proof and everything.\" I cocked an eyebrow and Clyde nodded while Bobbi lifted her pulse-reader and thumbed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe handed it over to me and I looked where she\u0027d marked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had Clyde\u0027s birth and death certificates linked. The luminescent green characters underscored what I\u0027d just said. In glaring detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up from the reader and met her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale, such a badass cop just a few months ago had been brought low by her own emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMainly love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes filled with tears and she whispered, \"I love him, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde looked at her with such tenderness I was embarrassed to observe them together. But I was somehow responsible for it all, I had to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said simply, because it was true. They seemed so right together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood and they did as well. \"I can\u0027t help if you keep acting like you guys are normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are!\" Bobbi protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde\u0027s eyes narrowed at my words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my palms up in supplication. \"Ya are to me, but I\u0027m AFTD, death is normal for me... in all its guises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde\u0027s eyebrows rose. \"Don\u0027t say it,\" I said to Clyde but Bobbi laughed. \"Sounds like somebody is getting philosophical.\" She smiled and I frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde reached a hand out, our eyeballs level to each other, and squeezed my shoulder, a flash of death energy surged and he smiled, the connection flexing between us. \"You are becoming the man you were meant to be. I am glad to be here to see it... Caleb,\" Clyde said somewhat awkwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, it was great to be done with the Master moniker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" I met both their eyes, shifting my gaze equally between the two. \"Just cool it until my probation is over.
