{"id":67127,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"\u003cp\u003eSitting in the dark with her bare feet on the coffee table, she continued to bemoan her pathetic love life. The light over her door shone dimly, but it didn\u0027t really illuminate the room, despite the uncurtained windows. If she had any sense, she\u0027d get up and turn on the lamp, but in her present frame of mind she preferred to sit in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone knocked on her door, and through her window she could see the shadowy shape of a man. Her breath caught in her throat as she ran to answer it. There, on the other side, stood Nate with his hands shoved in his back pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first all they did was stare at each other. Then, as if magnetically drawn to him, she stepped closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening to us,\" he whispered, \"but I couldn\u0027t just leave you like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel felt the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the first time since I joined the navy, I don\u0027t want to go to sea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel didn\u0027t want him to leave, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Let\u0027s sit on the beach and watch the stars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to shriek and sob with joy. \"Are you going to kiss me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned boyishly. \"Probably. Are you going to let me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, too. \"I\u0027m thinking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw back his head and laughed. \"Don\u0027t think too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty-Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alarm buzzed and with a frustrated groan, Ian rolled over and cuddled Cecilia close. Slipping his hand over her waist, he lightly pressed his palm to the ever-so-slight bulge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" Cecilia purred softly as the radio played a Carly Simon tune. \"Don\u0027t tell me it\u0027s time to get up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed the top of her head. \"Afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laid her hand over his. \"Baby says good morning, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning, baby,\" Ian whispered. The words nearly stalled in his throat. This was the last morning he\u0027d be with Cecilia until after the baby was born. The George Washington was being deployed to the South Pacific for the next number of months. Six was what they\u0027d been told, but it could be longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia rolled onto her back and looked up at him with her dark brown eyes. \"Everything\u0027s going to be okay. Stop worrying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan wasn\u0027t sure whether she was trying to convince him or herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine. I have friends this time.\" She rested her head against his bare shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that mean you won\u0027t miss me?\" Ian attempted to make a joke out of it, but failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, honey, you know I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some husbands and wives get into big fights about now. Makes it easier to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKissing his jaw, she whispered, \"I\u0027d rather make love than argue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too.\" He never was much good at arguing with her, anyway. He loved Cecilia beyond reason. And, in spite of his fears, he\u0027d come to believe that if they continued to put off having another child until he felt \"ready,\" it would never happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much time do we have?\" Cecilia whispered as she stroked his upper arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nibbled on her ear. \"Enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was slow and sexy as she tucked one silky leg between his. Their lovemaking was hot and urgent. Afterward they held each other for a long time, neither willing to release the other. It meant they had to rush so he could make his quarters, but Ian didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia hurriedly dressed to drive him to the shipyard. While he gathered up the remainder of his things, she walked out to the parking area to start the car. Although she\u0027d tried to hide it, Ian had seen the tears in her eyes. She wasn\u0027t the only one who felt emotionally shaky; in all the years he\u0027d been with the navy, he\u0027d never dreaded going to sea the way he did now. His attitude must have shown because the minute he slipped into the car, Cecilia offered him an encouraging smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s going to be fine,\" she assured him again, but he read through her bravado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan desperately wanted to believe her. But he couldn\u0027t quite overcome his doubts. Dread almost overwhelmed him as she backed out of the parking area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It really is all right, Ian.\" She gently touched his knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know this, do you?\" He didn\u0027t mean to sound so sharp, but every fear caused by the death of their first child was staring him in the face with this second one. The knot in his stomach refused to go away and wouldn\u0027t until he knew for a fact that she\u0027d delivered a healthy baby girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll send you updates every time I go to the doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise?\" Mixed in with his fears was the suspicion that Cecilia would try to protect him from the truth. But he wanted to know every detail of her pregnancy. Needed to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise,\" she vowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rode in silence for a short while. All the time Cecilia was driving, Ian worried that when the moment came to leave, he wouldn\u0027t be able to do it. His gut told him this deployment was history repeating itself. They\u0027d known Cecilia was pregnant with a girl when he\u0027d left three years ago. She was pregnant again with a girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been at sea when Allison was born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d be at sea when their second child was born, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia\u0027s ultrasound had looked perfectly normal the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ultrasound revealed nothing abnormal, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was leaving, and the weight on his chest was almost more than he could bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty-Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen sat on the balcony outside the master bedroom and stared out over the calm waters of Puget Sound. She could see Mount Rainier clearly in the distance. It seemed close enough to touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie slept peacefully, curled up on Maryellen\u0027s lap. The little girl\u0027s hand clutched her favorite blanket, her other thumb in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing her eyes, she breathed in the briny scent of the sea and listened to the muted sounds of late afternoon. It\u0027d been nine days since she\u0027d miscarried her baby. Nine days since she\u0027d slept a whole night, and nine days since her heart was torn to shreds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon had been attentive and thoughtful, anticipating her every need. Yet they lived as polite strangers. He was worried about her, and Maryellen suspected he\u0027d talked to her mother because Grace had been by to visit nearly every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sound of her husband\u0027s footsteps behind her, Maryellen glanced over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I wake you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want something to drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe declined with another shake of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon sat down in the rocking chair beside the swing. \"We haven\u0027t talked in a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen cradled her sleeping daughter. \"There hasn\u0027t been anything to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry about the baby.\" Jon\u0027s words were hoarse with emotion. He said it so often, and each time it made her want to weep all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mind if we don\u0027t discuss the miscarriage? There is no baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon wiped a hand over his face. \"I blame myself for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did nothing, Jon. You have nothing to feel guilty about. These things happen.\" She repeated what the physician had said, but his words had been of little comfort then and were of less comfort now. However, that was all she had to offer her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was angry and stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen didn\u0027t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t even tell me you were pregnant. You couldn\u0027tâ€”because I wouldn\u0027t let you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jon, don\u0027t. Please don\u0027t.\" She was too depressed to hear him punish himself over this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s because of the pregnancy that you decided to stay with your mother, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen refused to answer. So many things had gone through her mind the day of Charlotte and Ben\u0027s wedding. Jon had been so angry with her and so unforgiving. He\u0027d refused to even talk about it. When she\u0027d left for her mother\u0027s, he\u0027d let her go without uttering a single word to stop her. The only reason she was at the house now was that he\u0027d brought her here from the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon got out of the chair and started pacing back and forth. \"Maryellen, please just say something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, puzzled by his outburst. \"What do you want me to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Anything. Just don\u0027t sit there staring off into the distance. I can\u0027t stand to see you like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m grieving...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"And for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon leaned against the support column, as if he didn\u0027t have the strength to stay upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Less than two weeks ago, you were willing to let Katie and me walk away. Remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what I did in contacting your parents was wrong,\" Maryellen whispered, \"but I never set out to hurt you. All I wanted to do was help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t want your help,\" he shouted, startling Katie who jumped and began to fuss until she found her thumb again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Maryellen\u0027s steady hand on her back, Katie quickly returned to sleep. \"Let\u0027s talk about this another time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Jon was pacing again, back and forth, like a man possessed. His mouth thinned. \"I told you before I don\u0027t need my parents, don\u0027t want them in my life. You and Katie are the only family I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf what he said was true, then he wouldn\u0027t have let her drive away that Saturday afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out his hands in silent pleading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she continued to watch him, he plowed his fingers through his hair, then straightened and seemed to come to some resolution. \"Do you want a divorce?\" he asked suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I wonder how long our marrage will last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer remark obviously shocked him, aid Maryellen felt she had to explain herself. \"You so easily cast aside people who love you. If you can cut yourself off from your father and stepmother, then you can do it with Katie and me. In time you probably will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That isn\u0027t true.\" He fell to his knees in front of her, clasping her hands and gazing up at her intently. \"Look at me, Maryellen. You and Katie are everything to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until I do something that upsets you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and put distance between them. \"That\u0027s not true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen didn\u0027t have the will to argue. She knew otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to tell you I\u0027m willing to forget what my father did? Is that what you want me to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to have peace,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peace?\" He repeated the word as if he\u0027d never heard it before. \"You want me to have peace or you want me to make peace with my parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both,\" she said, \"but until you find peace within yourself, you won\u0027t be able to deal with your parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was perfectly happy with my life until you came along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite herself, Maryellen grinned. \"You only thought you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kept their letters,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant to throw them away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t. It must\u0027ve given you some kind of emotional gratification when they wrote letter after letter, and you never answered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe narrowed his eyes. \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Perhaps not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to make peace with them and I can\u0027t. I won\u0027t. I\u0027m sorry, Maryellen, but even for you I can\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a lack of forgiveness was frightening to Maryellen. \"I don\u0027t expect you to forget what they did, but forgiving is something else,\" she said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-45.html","bookId":1944,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM"}
