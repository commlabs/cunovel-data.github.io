The Donkey Lady is likely not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa.” He squinted at me. “How do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were almost to the station now, and crowds of people were getting off trains, walking home. The woman’s stall that I’d seen disrupted this morning was replaced by another stall, as if it’d never been there at all. And the pyramid of single rolls of toilet paper was almost gone. “I’m in a rush right now—lunch tomorrow? I’ll explain, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe danced back and forth with frustration, but finally nodded. “Okay. Tomorrow. You promised. Don’t forget.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t,” I said, and dove into the exodus of people coming down the stairs so I could get up to catch the next train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a shower and a drive, I was hauling a car full of groceries out at my mom’s. I’d brought her favorite kind of frozen pizza because I wasn’t a good cook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rang on the doorbell and then tried the door and found it unlocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honey, I’m home!” I called out as I wedged myself and my groceries inside. I had to go through the living room to get to the kitchen—I began waddling along, after kicking off my shoes, only to stop at the living room. “Oh. It’s you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother sat on the couch, beside my mom. He gave a short wave. “Hey, sissy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” I said, flat. I’d been so worried about giving my mom MRSA that I’d gone home and showered first. And here was my homeless brother, with whatever germs he’d picked up on the streets, breathing her air with abandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should have called to tell you Jake was here,” my mom said. “The meds make me forgetful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn’t called because she’d known that it would be like this between us, although I’d be disappointed if she thought that knowing he was here would make me leave. A dark part of me thought there’d be plenty of time to give him a piece of my mind after my mother died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to take that part of my mind out, stomp it to death, and then throw it through a high window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I brought Hawaiian pizza over. If I’d known he was here, I’d have brought some pepperoni along.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pineapple, ugh,” my brother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least I had that to hold over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHating pineapple didn’t stop my brother from pulling it off the pizza and eating most of the slices. There wasn’t much to talk about at the table. No need to ask Jake how he was doing—the answer? Bad—or what was going on with me—same as the last time I’d seen her, when I’d first found things out. No need to tell my mom that I was hot on the vampire trail on her behalf, if me pressing things didn’t get me fired first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what’s up with your boyfriend, Edie?” Jake asked casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. “Um—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The guy from Christmas? Kevin?” he helpfully provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing. We broke up.” “Kevin” had been my shapeshifter friend Asher, pretending to be my date so he could be nosy. He’d been a little more than a friend, if I were honest about things—but after the shun went into place, I’d had to leave him behind too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom reached out to pat my hand, bringing me back to the present. “That’s okay, honey. You’ll find someone who appreciates you someday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI patted her hand back. “Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a wry smile. “You know I’d make an extra effort to live if I had grandkids on the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom!” I protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t say things like that. It’s not fair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, sorry, you’re right. I just always assumed I’d live that long. Now—” She didn’t finish her sentence, and she let the thoughts drift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared across the table at Jake. “I’m not the only one with reproductive organs here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, remember that time you walked in on me and Debbie and yelled?” Jake said. I groaned, knowing where he was going with this. “I’m just saying, if you hadn’t interrupted us, Mom might have had her chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God, don’t remind me.” I put my hand to my forehead as my mother laughed. Debbie had been my best friend in high school, until I’d found out she had the hots for my brother. “I’m permanently scarred by that, you know.” I turned toward my mother, who was still chuckling. “I thought you wanted us to be all celibate and stuff? You’re supposed to have my back on this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression melted from amused to sick, and her pallor changed from pale pink to yellow. She put a hand to her mouth, and rushed for the downstairs bathroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What—look what you did, Edie.” Jake instantly blamed me. Old habits die hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t do anything.” I slowly stood. The sounds of my mother hurling in the other room began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake glanced back toward the bathroom, fearfully. He lived a rough life now, but I’m not sure if anything could prepare him for this. “If you didn’t stress her out so much, she’d have been fine,” he lashed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me? Stress her out? The daughter with a real career? Who do you think she stays up at night crying over? Me, or you?” I stood up, ready to take it up with him once and for all. But he looked as scared as I knew I felt about Mom. The anger washed out of me. I was a nurse; when people were throwing up, I knew what to do. I turned and went into the bathroom with my mother and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere I was again, being the good kid, in a bathroom too small for two people at once. I couldn’t even kneel beside her, so I just sat on the patch of countertop by the sink and reached down to stroke the back of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing the good kid never brings any rewards. A good life is its own reward, people tell you, and you in turn try to tell yourself that, but when you’re the good kid and someone else is the black sheep, and they get all the extra attention and energy—it’s hard not to be jealous of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited until she was done, and we were both quiet. I took a washcloth from the cabinet over the toilet, got it wet with the faucet wedged beside my ass, and wrung it out to hand down to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took it and ran it across her face. “I hate being like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate it too. The cancer,” I clarified, after a second’s extra thought. “I could stay in here with you puking all night. Not that I’d look forward to it, or anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and coughed, and handed the washcloth back up to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t there anything they can do?” My voice was smaller out loud than I thought it’d be, in my mind. Now that we were alone in here, no Peter, no Jake, I wanted my mommy to tell me everything was going to be all right. Even if it wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry to do this to you, Edie.” She gave me a bittersweet smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not your fault or anything. I just want to be sure—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure.” She looked around at our bathroom’s close walls. “I’m tired of being like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The whole thing is so unfair.” She was supposed to be the one protecting a sick me. This role reversal felt wrong. “In my head, it only happens to grandparents. Not parents, you know?” She gave me a pointed look. “I’m not going to have a kid just because you have cancer, Mom. Sheesh. You’ll get one someday. You just have to survive this is all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a weak smile. “I’ll try,” she said. For the first time, I realized I was being unfair. Telling people to survive terminal illnesses was kind of a dick move. Like telling addicts to just quit their habits already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just … do what you have to do,” I said, leaving things open-ended. She would do what she had to do, and I’d keep searching for something that could heal her. Really heal her, all the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat on the bathroom floor now, her back against the wall, and reached up to put her hand on my knee. “You don’t even have to have a kid, Edie. Just promise me that you’ll be happy,” she said, and I nodded. I could do that. “And that you’ll try to look out for Jake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was easier said than done. I didn’t want to make promises I had no interest in keeping. Looking into her face, though, what else could I say? “I’ll try.” The same promise she’d made me. It was the only thing I could say that wouldn’t stick in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, honey,” my mom said. She opened the door and pulled herself upright by its handle. Leaning back in, she kissed my cheek with her sour stomach-acid breath and then walked out, leaving me alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I’d said good night, I got into my car. First thing, I checked through my purse—which I’d unwisely left in the hallway alone while I’d been taking care of my mother—to make sure all my cash and ID were still there. They were. Maybe even the great and selfish Jake had been humbled into pure living by Mom’s cancer. Or, more likely, he’d already shaken down my mom for money before I’d gotten there, and she’d leniently given in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove home and got ready for bed. Today had been too long. I’d showered earlier, so all I had to do was brush my teeth and crawl under my sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still took an Ambien. My body wasn’t used to switching to days yet, and if you could harness the power of sleep into a convenient pill form, you’d take it too, wouldn’t you? Especially if you didn’t want to lie there and think. None of the things I had to think about were good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was woken by a thump outside my door. A glance out the window proved it was still night—the middle of the night even. Full streetlight, no haziness of dawn. I closed my eyes. It was nothing, or a neighbor. Sleep had released me momentarily, but if I waited here quietly, it would retake hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thump. And then a third. They weren’t knocks—definitely thumps. I reached for my phone. It was three A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still felt bleary from the Ambien. People saw things on Ambien, and drove cars up telephone poles. Was this Ambien, or was it real? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shapeshifted-edie-spence-3/page-14.html","bookId":2620,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:26 PM"}
