Fredrickson, Keith Kahla, the Minnesota Historical Society, Alison J. Picard, the Ramsey County Historical Society, and Renée Valois.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Nash was dead. Which is why it was such a surprise when I received his letter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKenzie:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou ’re just the mug I need to help me get back my gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJelly Nash\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked the postmark. The letter had been mailed a day earlier, another surprise. Frank “Jelly” Nash might have been one of the nation’s most prolific bank robbers, pulling over a hundred successful jobs in a twenty-five-year career, but dead was dead, and since Nash had been shot in the head in 1933, he was deader than most. Also, while I like to keep an open mind when it comes to the paranormal, somehow I was confident that if Nash wanted to speak to me from the grave, he would have chosen more efficient means than the U.S. Postal Service. Still, there’s something about the word “gold” that captures the imagination, so as the letter writer requested, I did indeed think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning I received a second letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKenzie:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m planning a job worth millions. Do you want in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJelly Nash\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t actually need the money, yet I had to ask—how many millions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later, a Sunday, Nash sent an e-mail; apparently he had an account with Comcast:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKenzie:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys in St. Paul tell me you’re a mug who can\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe counted on in a tight spot. Want to join my gang?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJelly Nash\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clicked the Reply button, wrote “I would never join a gang that would have me as a member,” and hit Send.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later, the phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, McKenzie. It’s Ivy Flynn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ivy. How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m really good. How ’bout yourself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Couldn’t be better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“McKenzie? I’m sorry to call you out of the blue like this, but I need a favor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy was a graduate student in the Department of Entomology at the University of Minnesota, and about two years ago I had hired her to determine what was killing the honeybees owned by a close friend of mine. During the course of her research, someone took several shots at her with a twelve-gauge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I owe you one,” I said. “Tell me what you need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s kinda complicated. Can we meet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe worked out the details. Afterward, I asked, “Ivy, do you know anything about some messages I’ve been getting from Jelly Nash?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was my boyfriend’s idea. He thought they would pique your curiosity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did he actually use the word ‘pique’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me guess—English major.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“American literature. He’s working on his Ph.D.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will he be joining us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, tell him the mug’s curiosity is indeed piqued.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will. McKenzie? This is going to be so much fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More fun than getting shot at?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe actually thought about it for a few beats before answering. “Yes, sir. Lots more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe agreed to meet at the same place we had met years earlier, Lori’s Coffeehouse on Cleveland Avenue across from the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota. I parked on Buford next to a small, classically designed Catholic church with arched stained glass windows, blond stone recovered from a church that was torn down decades earlier, and a peaked red tile roof. It was called the Church of St. Andrew Kim and served a congregation of Koreans. Before that it was called Corpus Christi; the previous owners sold it to the Koreans when they moved to an ultramodern church with all the personality of a New Country Buffet—go figure. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jelly-s-gold-mac-mckenzie-6/page-1.html","bookId":2220,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:33 PM"}
