He craned his neck, staring in wonder at the cavern. “What a place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry had brought him there first thing in the morning, explaining the Tides’ situation along the way, holding Marron’s arm as they climbed down the bluff. Now he concentrated on breathing evenly as he followed Marron’s lead deeper inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not ideal,” Perry said, raising the torch in his hand higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ideals belong in a world only the wise man can understand,” Marron said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would be you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarron met his gaze and smiled warmly. “That would be Socrates. But you’re also wise, Perry. I had no plan for losing Delphi. I regret that very much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fell into silence. Perry knew Marron was thinking about the home and the people he’d lost. Months ago, Perry had watched Roar and Aria train with knives on the rooftop at Delphi. He’d kissed her for the first time there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry cleared his throat. His thoughts were slipping to a place he didn’t want to go. “I want to bring the tribe here before we’re forced out. We should leave the compound on our terms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes,” Marron agreed. “We’ll need to start preparing right away. We’ll need freshwater, light, and ventilation. Heat and storage for food. The access is poor, but we can improve it. I could design a pulley to lower heavier supplies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis list continued. Perry listened, finally recognizing the man he knew: gentle, meticulous, brilliant. He wondered how Marron could ever have thought himself a burden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he returned to the compound, Perry called a meeting in the cookhouse to tell the tribe about his plan to move them to the cave. As he’d expected, they reeled under the news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t see how we can survive there for any length of time,” Bear said. His face was red, and sweat beaded on his forehead. He was angrier than Perry had ever seen him. “We’ve managed the Aether during the winters,” he continued. “It’s like you’re expecting the worst. Like you’ve given up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not expecting the worst,” Perry said. “The worst is happening. If you want proof, go outside and take a look at the sky, or at the acres that have burned over the past month. And this isn’t like winter. We won’t be able to ride this out. Sooner or later we’ll face another tribe, or another storm, that will level us. We have to make the first move—before that happens. We need to act now, while we still can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said you were going to take us to the Still Blue,” said Rowan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I know where it is, I will,” Perry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan shook his head in frustration. “What if we’re forced out of the cave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I’ll figure something else out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter an hour of hearing the same complaints, Perry cut off the meeting. He ordered part of Bear’s workforce to help Marron with the cave. Then he watched Bear storm out and the rest of the cookhouse empty. In a daze, Perry crossed the clearing to his home, needing a moment alone to think about his decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went to the window, where Talon’s carvings rested, and braced himself against the sill. There were seven figurines there. Seven, lined up in the same direction. He turned the one at the center the other way, so it faced outside. As Blood Lord, was his responsibility to follow the will of the majority? Or was it to guide them toward what he knew—what he believed to be best for them? He’d chosen the latter. He prayed he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spent the rest of the afternoon helping at the cave. Marron was organized, efficient, and comfortable handling a large project. Bear didn’t show up, but the people Perry had chosen to work there warmed to Marron quickly. As Perry made the hour-long walk back to the compound, he told Marron so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ve come around to me because you did first. You’re the one who’s shown them the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, Perry thought. To a cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir conversation turned to people who’d served Marron at Delphi. Slate and Rose had been held captive. If Perry and Marron could find a way to bring them and any others to the Tides, they would. They talked until Perry spotted Reef rushing toward him on the trail near the compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” Perry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReef scratched his chin. He looked like he was trying not to smile. “Wait until you see what just showed up,” he said as they fell in step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry’s gaze went immediately across the clearing as they entered the compound. A girl with hair the color of copper stood on the eastern approach. In the last light of day, he saw a caravan of wagons stretching out behind her. Perry estimated roughly forty people either on horseback or on foot. They had the look of warriors—strong and armed with weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the second half of Sable’s payment for Liv,” Reef said at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwig jogged over and made a high-pitched sound that was close to a giggle. “Perry, that’s all food!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry’s gaze moved back to the caravan as he walked up. Stunned, he tallied eight horse-drawn carts, ten head of cattle. He heard goats. On a gust he scented herbs, chicken, grain. His mouth began to water as he suddenly felt the full brunt of the hunger he’d grown used to fighting off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Kirra,” said the red-haired girl. “I bet you’re happy to see me. Sable sent a message. He’s pleased to honor the agreement he made with Vale for Olivia’s hand in marriage, though he didn’t have to. He didn’t say the last part, but he should have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry hardly listened to her. His heart raced as he realized that everything he saw was for the Tides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarron appeared at his side, his cheeks flushed with excitement. “Oh, my goodness. Peregrine, this will help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear and Molly walked up with Willow and Old Will. Others were coming out of the cookhouse, gathering around. The air filled with their elated tempers, slashes of vibrant color shimmering at the edges of his vision. The relief was so potent—his own, the tribe’s—that Perry’s throat tightened with emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl lifted an eyebrow. Her red hair whipped in the wind, fire in the glow of sunset. “Still time to get a meal together if we unpack now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry’s gaze fell to the Marking on her arm. He blinked. Blinked again as it sank in. A Scire. She was like him. He looked at her, curious now. Apart from his sister, he’d never known a female Scire. Theirs was the rarest Sense. It was one of the reasons Liv’s marriage had needed to be arranged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was your name?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kirra. I told you that already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right … I missed it before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a full, round face that gave her an innocent look, but the curves of her body erased that impression. So did the teasing glint in her eyes. She looked a few years older than him, he guessed, and her scent was mellow and slightly cool, reminding him of autumn leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you say my sister married Sable?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure by now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry turned back to the wagons. Liv had always been his. As the oldest, Vale had been groomed by their father for Blood Lord. But he and Liv had been left to themselves. Perry couldn’t believe it. She belonged to someone else now. Liv, who was quick to laugh, quick to anger, quick to forgive. Liv, who did nothing in part and everything in full, was married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as he’d believed she should do her duty to the Tides by marrying Sable, he’d never expected that she actually would. His sister had always been unpredictable, but this was her greatest surprise of all. She’d run off, disappeared, and then ended up doing what had been asked of her all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry’s stomach clenched as he thought of Roar. How would he react when he found out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?” said Kirra, pulling him from his thoughts. “It’s getting late. Should we unpack?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry ran a hand over his jaw, and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was done. Liv was married. He couldn’t change it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, Aria and Roar were escorted to a wide dining room. Candlelight and silver glimmered on a long dinner table. A centerpiece of twisting willow branches rose out of a huge vase, casting spindly shadows across the ceiling. Along one side of the room, doors opened to a balcony. Rust-colored drapes stirred in the wind, revealing glimpses of the churning Aether sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar scanned the room. “Where’s Liv?” he asked as they stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable rose from the table. He wore his Blood Lord chain now, a fantastic, shining collar spotted with sapphires that sparkled against his deep gray shirt. The chain transformed him, enhancing the blue in his eyes and the confidence in his smile. Aria wondered how she’d ever mistaken him for ordinary. He looked comfortable with the chain. At ease with power. She realized she’d never had the same thought about Perry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Liv is running late,” Sable said. “She seems to like making me wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe she’s avoiding you,” Roar said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable’s mouth lifted in a small smile. “I’m happy you’re here. It’ll be good for Liv to have a childhood friend at our wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She told you we’re friends?” Roar asked with a smirk. He couldn’t seem to stop himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable replied smoothly, but his stare was cruel. “I know what you were. That’s what she said you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gust blew into the room and lifted a corner of the tablecloth, upsetting a pewter goblet. It clattered onto the stone floor. Neither Sable nor Roar moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stepped between them. “It looks like the storm will break soon,” she said, striding to the balcony. It was a blatant attempt at diversion, but it worked. Sable followed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind lifted her hair off her shoulders as she stepped past the drapes. She walked to the low stone wall that edged the balcony, hugging herself against the cold. The rugged exterior of the fortress dropped several stories to the Snake River directly below. Aether light shimmered across its dark surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable appeared beside her. “It’s beautiful from a distance, isn’t it?” he said, staring at the Aether. The flows were taking on a twisting, spooling shape. Soon the funnels would drop. “Very different when you’re right beneath it.” He looked at her. “You’ve been in a storm before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought so. I scent your fear, but I could be wrong. Maybe you fear something else. Are you afraid of heights, Aria? It’s a long way down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver ran through her, but her voice was even when she answered. “I’m fine with heights.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSable smiled. “That doesn’t surprise me. You said you were from the Tides?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was prodding her with questions. Scenting her tempers and seeking her weakness. “I came from there, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you didn’t know Liv before today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her again, going still, intent. She could see his thoughts turning, his curiosity honing on her. She didn’t think she could stand it any longer when Liv’s voice drew his attention back inside. Sable shifted slightly, but he didn’t go to her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-ever-night-under-the-never-sky-2/page-25.html","bookId":1658,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM"}
