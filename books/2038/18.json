Talk about tedious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly this time, I wasn\u0027t alone in bed. I knew Kiyo was with me even before I opened my eyes. I recognized his smell, the way his arms wrapped around me. They held me with delicacy now, not with the fierceness that usually seized him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t quit,\" I murmured, blinking the sleep out of my eyes. \"Even wounded, you\u0027re still trying to get me back in bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already got you here.\" He lay on his side, his eyes staring into mine. Smiling, he ran a hand over my hair, smoothing it back. \"I was so worried about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuggled against him, slowly dredging up memories from last night. \"I was worried about you too. What happened? Why wouldn\u0027t you change back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did...eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that was obvious. I waited expectantly, needing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Being a kitsune isn\u0027t just about the novelty of turning into a fox. It\u0027s more than that. It\u0027s like...I also can turn into - I don\u0027t know - a fox god. No. That\u0027s not right. I don\u0027t know how to describe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A superfox?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis soft laughter vibrated against my forehead, and he kissed the skin there. \"That\u0027s not quite right either. The foxes of the Otherworld are like the progenitors of mortal foxes in this world. They\u0027re stronger, more powerful, wilder. I can change into one of those, but to do so...I almost have to give up my humanity. They\u0027re too animal, too...I don\u0027t know, primordial. When I\u0027m a normal red fox, I\u0027m still pretty much the same as I am now unless I\u0027ve been in that form for a really long time. Then the human part starts to go. But for your \u0027superfox,\u0027 I\u0027m already gone in one transformation. I can hang on to only a few human instincts - like that I had to fight that thing and that I had to protect you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took all this in, frowning. \"But that doesn\u0027t explain why you didn\u0027t change back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It takes time to go in and out of that form. The change is more than physical. I have to give up my human nature to go in, my fox nature to come out. Both are hard. That\u0027s why it took me awhile to even help in the first place. I had to make a quick call, even though it left you undefended. I thought I\u0027d do more damage in the other form.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you did do a pretty good job. But you sure scared me there.\" I fell silent, recalling those terrible moments of uncertainty while I bled all over myself. \"When did you finally change back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not long after you passed out, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would explain why I\u0027m still alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"You lost a lot of blood. You needed ten stitches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"Did you take me to a doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"You bet I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a moment to catch on. I pulled back the covers and lifted the skirt of one of my racier and rarely used nightgowns - how\u0027d I get dressed in that anyway? - and saw black stitches standing out starkly against my skin, off to the side of my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did this?\" I exclaimed. \"You stitched me up? Without a doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a doctor. I do this all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah...to cats and dogs. Not to people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s exactly the same. We\u0027re animals too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eyed the stitches uneasily. The skin around them was red. \"Was everything sanitized?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a disparaging sound in his throat. \"Of course it was. The standards are the same. Come on, stop worrying. It was either that or let you bleed to death in the car. I had a kit in the back and used it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you have enough light out there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The overhead lamp still worked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d stitched me up in a smashed car with a vet\u0027s kit. Improvisation at its best. \"Did the car actually start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of...I got us back to the freeway before it died. I found your cell phone and called Tim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor Tim. When I first told him I was a shaman, I think he thought it was as fake as his own Indian charade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait - he\u0027s not actually Indian? I\u0027ve been trying forever to figure out what tribe he\u0027s from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s from the tribe of Tim Warkoski. It\u0027s ridiculous, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air in the room rippled, pressure building. I had to blink a few times to ensure the shimmering around us wasn\u0027t in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo propped himself up, alert and wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pressure abruptly faded. A rift from the Otherworld opened up in front of us, and suddenly Dorian stood on a small table in the corner. Not unexpectedly, it promptly broke under his weight, making a horrible crashing sound as its pieces and contents fell to the floor. To his credit, he sidestepped the disaster rather gracefully, easily landing both feet on the floor. I winced, seeing the anchor ring lying among the debris. I\u0027d set it on the table, not considering the consequences of Dorian arriving exactly where it lay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell - \" Kiyo started to climb out of bed, but I was in his way. I laid a restraining hand on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s all right. He\u0027s here for our next lesson. Jesus...I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s that time already.\" I\u0027d lost a lot of time since the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian wore his usual simple but fine clothes, covered by another elaborate robe. This one was black satin, edged in silver and small seed pearls. If the present circumstances surprised him, he didn\u0027t show it. He kept his face typically unimpressed and sardonic. His smile twisted as he regarded us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can come back later if it\u0027s more convenient. I do so hate to interrupt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" I said hastily, sitting up and swinging my legs over the bed\u0027s edge. The movement uncomfortably tugged the skin around my stitches. \"We were just, um...resting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian arched an eyebrow. \"You rest in that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down, flushing. I\u0027d worn this exactly once when Dean and I had gone to Mexico for a weekend. The nightgown was pale green, its top and bottom hems ornamented with elaborate green leaves and tiny pink flowers. The mid-thigh-length skirt was sheer chiffon. Note to self: Never let Kiyo dress me again, unconsciousness notwithstanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim chose that moment to walk in, summoned by the noise. \"Eug, what...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth dropped - and not just because of me. I looked around at us all: me in my nightgown, Kiyo bare-chested, Dorian in his extravagant robes, and Tim in his Native getup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God,\" I muttered, standing up, \"we look like the Village People.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the terry cloth robe over me, wondering how I always seemed to be half-naked lately. Tim continued to stare, wearing the shocked look of one who has just walked in on his parents having sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s fine,\" I told him. He still didn\u0027t move, and I waved a hand in front of his face. \"Hey, wake up. Think you can make some breakfast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked. \"It\u0027s three in the afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a pathetic look. The familiarity of it seemed to snap him back to normal. He could never resist it. That, or he felt he owed me food for the free rent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eggs and toast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Healthy or unhealthy toast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered. \"Healthy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are your, uh, friends eating too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the other two men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to,\" replied Dorian with a cordial half-bow. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Famished,\" said Kiyo, eyes still narrowed on Dorian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Tim, you\u0027re the best.\" I practically pushed him out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charming man,\" remarked Dorian politely. He glanced around. \"And a charming room.\" The broken table aside, the room\u0027s other contents included: a pile of laundry, the wicker chair, a case of ammunition, a dresser, and a small desk with my laptop and a half-finished puzzle of the Eiffel Tower. The room didn\u0027t have a lot of space, so everything had been jammed in. It all seemed so chintzy compared to the opulence of his bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo also got out of bed, wearing just a pair of jeans. \"You want to tell me again what\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already did.\" I opened my dresser and pulled out a pair of jeans and a shirt that said I\u0027LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO CRY ABOUT on it. \"We\u0027re doing my next lesson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can\u0027t do it today,\" Kiyo told Dorian. \"She was in a fight last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless I\u0027m mistaken, she gets in a fight every night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one was bad. She was injured. Didn\u0027t you see the stitches?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My humble eyes had better things to occupy themselves with than her stitches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, guys?\" I snapped. \"I\u0027m still here, you know. Stop talking about me in the third person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo walked over and touched my arm. \"Eugenie, this is crazy. You need to go back to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today\u0027s lesson will not require physical exertion,\" said Dorian primly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There, you see?\" I said. \"I\u0027ve got to keep going with our deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo looked darkly from me to Dorian. \"Your \u0027deal\u0027 doesn\u0027t seem to be doing a lot of good. I thought it was going to keep your would-be rapists away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had turned my back to them, opened the robe, and started pulling my jeans on. I froze, considering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fachan wasn\u0027t trying to rape me,\" I said slowly. \"He wanted to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He tried to throw me through a windshield. That\u0027s not very romantic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fachan?\" asked Dorian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shed the robe and nightgown and pulled the shirt over my head before turning back around to face them. I gave Dorian the short version of what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up from where he\u0027d been leaning against my desk and strolled over to the window, hands clasped behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fachan,\" he mused. \"Here. Curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. Not compared to anything else that\u0027s happened to me,\" I reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed out the window. \"You live in a desert. Fachans like bodies of water. You have a lot of enemies, my dear, but I doubt any fachan would hate you enough to show up here of his own volition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you saying?\" asked Kiyo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That someone went to considerable trouble to summon him here. Someone with either a lot of raw power or simply an affinity for water creatures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who could do that?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any number of people. Maiwenn could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo took a few dangerous steps toward him. \"Maiwenn didn\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian smiled, unfazed by Kiyo\u0027s intimidating presence. They were the same height, but Dorian\u0027s frame was lean and slim, Kiyo\u0027s broader and more muscled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re probably right,\" Dorian said after several tense moments of silence. \"Particularly since she\u0027s been so under the weather lately.\" Kiyo\u0027s face grew darker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back and forth uneasily, uncertain as to what I was in the middle of. \"Do you guys know each other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian extended a hand to Kiyo, cool and collected. \"I know of you, but I don\u0027t believe we\u0027ve been properly introduced. I am Dorian, king of the Oak Land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo grudgingly took his hand. \"I know who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Kiyo,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delightful to meet you. You\u0027re a...kitsune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian said the word in an odd tone. It wasn\u0027t exactly disrespectful, but it clearly implied they were not equals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed both their arms and steered them out. \"No pissing contests. Come on. It\u0027ll only take Tim about five minutes to whip up the food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever antagonism existed between Kiyo and Dorian, it took a break as the gentry king entertained himself with the rest of my house. He was like a kid, unable to keep his hands off of everything. Well, everything that wasn\u0027t made of plastic or an iron affiliate. My living room was a veritable wonderland, with everything conveniently piled up in junk heaps for him to explore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the purpose of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held a fluorescent pink Slinky, tossing it from side to side so he didn\u0027t have to touch the plastic extensively. My impression was gentry could touch the taboo substances in small doses with minor discomfort; prolonged exposure grew much more uncomfortable. Charge it up with power, and it could kill them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t really have a purpose,\" I decided. \"You just sort of...play with it when you\u0027re bored.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed it back and forth, watching it spring up in arches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see it,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held it, closing my eyes. My focus was back now with the excruciating pain vanquished. I concentrated on the Slinky, putting a small piece of my essence into it. I handed it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrap it up and take it with you. It\u0027ll be my anchor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. With so many other distractions, we eventually had to drag him to the kitchen table when the food was ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you ever been in the human world before?\" I asked, once we all sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go again, assuming we all just traipse over here for no good reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, actually, I\u0027ve vacationed here a number of times. Not in this desolate place, of course, but several other nice spots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and slapped butter on my toast. It was made of good, hearty bread, chock-full of whole wheat and about a billion other grains. You could use this stuff as sandpaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI doused my coffee with sugar and cream, gulping it to chase down some ibuprofen. I might not be dying anymore, but myriad aches and stiffness filled my body. I didn\u0027t think I could handle regularly getting into high-magnitude fights every other night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the whole prophecy thing had surfaced, I had joked that I preferred attempts on my life to sexual advances. I didn\u0027t really believe that anymore. At least when the bad guys wanted my clothes off, it bought me some time. That fachan, however, had had no intentions short of crushing me. And he\u0027d done a pretty good job of doing that. I had never fought something so massive before. Most of my fights, before this all started, had been with spirits and elementals. I could take them out with barely any effort. The fachan had been in a different league. The spirit army from the other day had also been new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian\u0027s words rang back to me. The fachan had been deliberately sent. But by whom? One of the many who had a grudge against Odile? Someone like Maiwenn who wanted the prophecy to fail? Maiwenn herself? This latter thought bothered me. She\u0027d seemed more or less trustworthy, despite her bland personality. If she turned into an enemy, it was going to create some serious friction between Kiyo and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finished breakfast, and Dorian declared we had to go outside for our lesson. I took one look at him and the scalding sunshine and saw imminent disaster for that perfect, alabaster skin. Figuring he wouldn\u0027t want my prissy, vanilla sunscreen, I dug him out a wide-brimmed cotton hat of Tim\u0027s that looked only mildly ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to be able to do this?\" I asked, leading Dorian out to my back patio. Tim had left for drumming practice, but Kiyo followed us, still watchful. \"Your magic\u0027s weaker on this side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian draped his elegant robes over a lawn chair. \"Not me who needs to do the magic. And really, I doubt you will either. Not in the way you\u0027re thinking of. Hmm...yes, this area may work better than I\u0027d hoped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe surveyed the patio area and the small grassless yard surrounded by a stucco wall. Dragging up another chair, he set it near the center of the patio, facing the house, and beckoned me to it. I sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what? More meditation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Now we need a bowl of water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiyo? Can you grab us one? There\u0027s a big ceramic bowl in the back of one of my cupboards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo silently complied, looking as though leaving us alone for even one minute would result in Dorian trying something. I found that protectiveness endearing, albeit a bit over the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Dorian did try something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are those?\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think of them as...learning aids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had produced a handful of silken cords from the deep pockets of his robe, all in different colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you - no. You are not serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had moved behind my chair and grasped my hands. I jerked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re trying to tie me up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for sinister purposes, I assure you, although if you\u0027d like to experiment with them later, I\u0027d be happy to show you their various and sundry uses. For now, simply trust me that they\u0027ll be useful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued to regard the cords warily. He shook his head, smiling. Moving behind me, he gently ran his hands down my arms. \"You still don\u0027t trust me. And yet you do. An interesting mix. You fear me but want to connect with me. Do you remember what I said the night we met?\" He knelt down, speaking softly in my ear. \"This is exactly the way it will be when you come to my bed. You\u0027ll surrender yourself, and though it\u0027ll scare you, you\u0027ll exult in it too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re imagining more to our charade than there is. And I don\u0027t really see myself feeling exultant over being tied up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever tried it?\" His fingers slowly slid back up to the sleeves of my shirt, like butterflies on my skin. It was...nice. I shrugged him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. And I don\u0027t need to. Besides, whatever your kinky intentions are, it doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027ve got something going with Kiyo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. Of course you do. From what I hear, he\u0027s always \u0027got something going.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened. \"Don\u0027t try to cause trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m attempting nothing of the sort. Just stating a fact. A man with human blood is just as appealing to our women as you are to our men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already know about Maiwenn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. What do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The truth. They used to be involved. Now they\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. And that doesn\u0027t bother you? Especially considering it\u0027s likely she\u0027ll try to kill you someday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around as much as I could and glared at him. \"I meant it: Don\u0027t try to pick a fight. I trust Kiyo, and I like Maiwenn. End of story. Now if you\u0027re going to tie me up, just get it over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose from his crouch, the sensuality gone from his voice as he began the business of binding me. \"I\u0027d never dream of picking a fight. Your pet fox in there will break my neck if I so much as look at you the wrong way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t act like you\u0027re actually afraid of him. You can supposedly bring down buildings.\" I relaxed back in the chair and let him tie my hands together behind me. He took a long time in doing it, like he was weaving or braiding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Eugenie, are you saying you\u0027d wager on me in a fight? I\u0027m touched. Very touched. Although, I do hear foxes have very sharp claws. How are those scratches on your back, by the way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo walked out just then, carrying the bowl of water. He froze when he saw Dorian tying a cord above my breasts and around my upper arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An awakening,\" said Dorian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine,\" I said. \"Set the water over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo did so and then stood next to me, arms crossed and eyes on the gentry king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Dorian took his time in tying my upper body. He used multiple cords, and able to see better this time, I realized he had indeed woven them into an intricate pattern. Aesthetic and functional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There.\" With a last tight knot, he straightened up and regarded his work. \"Not bad. It seems I haven\u0027t forgotten how to tie a decent knot after all. One more thing, and we\u0027re set.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more thing\" turned out to be a blindfold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie, my sweet, your outraged protests are adorable, but they only continue to slow us down. If you want me to help you, then let me. If you don\u0027t, then take me to one of those places where human women wear revealing clothing and quickly lose their virtue through alcohol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him blindfold me, feeling uneasy. I trusted Kiyo and sort of trusted Dorian, but the other bindings had already unsettled me. I didn\u0027t like being trapped or in someone else\u0027s control. The bright world went dark as fabric covered my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is all giving me a bad feeling,\" Kiyo said nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the contrary,\" said Dorian, \"it\u0027s giving me a very warm, very pleasant feeling. But I suppose we should return to the lesson at hand, hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this the part where you explain the bondage getup?\" I asked. \"Or where I find out you just did it for fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. As hilarious as that would be, I do have my reasons. Now. I\u0027m going to pick up this bowl of water that Kato so kindly fetched - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Kiyo,\" came the irritated response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So sorry. Anyway, I\u0027m going to set it somewhere out here in this miniature wasteland, and you will tell me where it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. I get it. I\u0027m supposed to, like, work on my non-visual senses? Listen to where you set it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t use any of your physical senses at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard him walk away, presumably with the water, but I couldn\u0027t tell where he set it. He paced and paced in circles, kicking rocks and scuffing his shoes so I was clueless by the time he returned to me. When he spoke next, his words were right by my ear again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, given freedom, even with just a blindfold, you\u0027d be inclined to move and want to use something - anything - to find the water. You\u0027d turn around, sniff the air, whatever. Now you have to accept that all of that is gone. You cannot rely on what you usually can. You are trapped and powerless - more or less. Give in to that. Open yourself up to whatever comes. Find the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By reaching out to it. Tap into a sense other than the usual five. Remember the exercises we did last time, about reaching beyond yourself - in this world, not the spirit one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought magic was inborn. Isn\u0027t that what separates humans and gentry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is inborn. And your inner magic summons and controls storms. To do that, you must summon and control the appropriate elements. And to do that, you must be able to find them. Hence, you focus outward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just concentrate. But relax too. Think about the water. How it feels, what it\u0027s like. Spread your consciousness out around you, but don\u0027t go into a trance and let your spirit slip out. That\u0027d be cheating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long does it take?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as you need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe retreated, and I sat there and waited for some revelation. Okay. Somewhere around me was a bowl of water. And something inside of me was supposed to be able to sense it. I wouldn\u0027t have believed any of it if the living room on the other side of the patio door didn\u0027t stand as proof of my supernatural powers. But I hadn\u0027t had to think to cause the storm. This was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I mostly felt at first was my own body. Dorian\u0027s binds didn\u0027t hurt me, but they were snug. The stitched-up cut stung a little. The back of my head ached. My leg muscles felt stretched and inflamed. I slowly took inventory of every part of me, assessing how each one felt. I could feel the beat of my own heart, the steadiness of my breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, I started concentrating on the stuff around me. I heard someone, Dorian maybe, slide up a chair and sit down. A plane droned overhead. One of my neighbors kept a bird feeder, and sparrows regularly chirped and squabbled around it. The harsher cries of less melodic birds sounded in the distance. My street had few houses and was removed from real traffic, but a block or so away, a car started and then drove off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about water, its appeal growing as the sun beat down. I had put on my own sunscreen and was grateful for it. Still, I could feel sweat pouring off of me. Water would be cool, refreshing. My mom\u0027s house had a pool, and suddenly I wanted nothing more than to dive into that crystal-blue surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the bowl of water, thinking of its cool temperature, the wetness on my skin. I tried to feel it, to call to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" I said at last. I don\u0027t know how much time had passed. Awhile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" asked Dorian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She means over there,\" I heard Kiyo say. Presumably he pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Dorian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was I close?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even a little?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it! Get me out of this.\" I wriggled against my constraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly.\" Dorian\u0027s voice held mild surprise. \"We must try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, dear lord. This might be even more boring than the meditation,\" I grumbled. \"Can I at least get something to drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"Actually, I think your odds will increase if you\u0027re thirsty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we go,\" said Dorian. I heard him get up and walk around again, and once more, I couldn\u0027t tell where the bowl ended up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he returned to his chair, I tried again. More time passed as I concentrated my little heart out. At one point, I heard someone get up and move toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me,\" said Dorian. \"I\u0027m bored.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You\u0027re my teacher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The kitsune will call if you need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe this,\" I said when he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, this was your idea,\" said Kiyo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard him shift in a chair, getting comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on the verge of my next guess when Dorian came outside again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There. Nine o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo must have pointed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Dorian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made me do it again, and by then, I was furious. My poor muscles, already put through enough, were locking up from lack of movement. The heat was unbearable. To make matters worse, Kiyo asked if Dorian wanted something to drink and then went inside. He returned, and I heard the sound of a two-liter of pop opening, followed by the filling of two glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, they started carrying on casual conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie will be at my Beltane ball,\" Dorian explained, \"as my special guest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your enthusiasm is palpable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just not my thing, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, pity. Because if you wanted to come, I\u0027d be happy to extend the invitation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t want you to go to any trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no trouble at all. You could come with Eugenie. I always make special arrangements for dignitaries\u0027 entourages and servants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you two shut up?\" I asked. \"I\u0027m working here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater, water. I needed that goddamned water so that Dorian would untie me and I could return to air conditioning. I\u0027d also drink a gallon of water while I was at it. Maybe two or three. In fact, when I found that stupid bowl, I\u0027d dump it over my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat pooled along the hem of my shirt and where the cords and blindfold pressed against my skin. I\u0027d probably sweated away the sunscreen and would burn. As if my body hadn\u0027t been through enough. Where the hell was that water? Why couldn\u0027t I find it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought again about my mom\u0027s pool, vowing I\u0027d pay her a visit tomorrow. God, it was so hot. I just wanted to be cooler. Water, water, water. I felt like Helen Keller. Or maybe one of those people in the Lakota sun dances where excessive heat exposure induced hallucinations. Maybe I could imagine the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, and then, somehow, I felt coolness touch me. It was a reprieve from the heat. I straightened up as much as I could. Had I done it? Was this what it felt like to touch the water? The third time was the charm. Yes. There it was again. Like cool, moist air blowing at me from the east. I could taste its dampness, hanging around me like humidity in the sauna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inclined my head in the direction I\u0027d sensed the cool air. \"I\u0027ve got it. Three o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell it isn\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Dorian get up. He sighed. \"I think we\u0027d better quit for the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I swear I had it! I could feel it! I was thinking about water so hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe undid the blindfold, and I looked up. Billowing clouds, colored like lead, inked out the sky. Wind blew at me from the east - not imagined after all - picking up in strength. Great, heavy drops fell around us, landing with loud splashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater at last. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-born-dark-swan-1/page-18.html","bookId":2038,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:34:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:34:10 PM"}
