As soon as the door to the room slammed shut, with the storm more or less outside and her own stiff and aching body inside, she headed for the bathroom without even turning on a light. Her clothes and hair and feet were all damp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fluorescent lights of the bathroom seemed too bright after the darkness of the night and the storm. Or maybe it was the beginning of her learning to circulate her Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had certainly been a surprise. Damon hadn\u0027t even been touching her, but the shock she had felt still reverberated inside her. And as for the feeling of having her Power manipulated from outside her body, well, there just weren\u0027t words. It had been a breathtaking experience, all right. Even now just thinking about it made her knees tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was more clear than ever that Damon wanted nothing to do with her. Elena confronted her own image in the mirror and winced. Yes, she looked like a drowned rat that had been dragged backward a mile through the gutter. Her hair was damp, turning its silky waves into tiny wisps of curls all around her head and face; she was as white as an invalid, and her blue eyes were staring out of the pinched and exhausted face of a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor just a moment she remembered being in even worse shape a few days - yes, it was only days - ago, and having Damon treat her with the utmost gentleness, as if her bedraggled appearance had meant nothing to him. But those memories had been taken from Damon by Shinichi, and it was too much to hope that that might have been his real state of mind. It had been...whim...like all his other whims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurious at Damon - and at herself for the prickling behind her eyes she felt - Elena turned away from the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe past was the past. She had no idea why Damon had suddenly decided to start jerking away from her touch, or to look at her with the hard cold eyes of a predator. Something had caused him to hate her, to barely be able to sit in the car with her. And whatever it was, Elena had to learn to ignore it, because if Damon left, she would have no chance of finding Stefan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan. At last her trembling heart could find rest in thinking of Stefan. He wouldn\u0027t care what she looked like: his sole concern would be for her well-being. Elena shut her eyes as she turned on the hot water in the tub and stripped off her clammy clothes, basking in her imagination of Stefan\u0027s love and approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motel had provided a small plastic bottle of bubblebath, but Elena left it alone. She\u0027d brought her own translucent-gold bag of vanilla bath crystals in her duffel bag, and this was the first chance she\u0027d had to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, she shook about a third of the beribboned bag\u0027s crystals into the rapidly filling tub and was rewarded with a steamy blast of vanilla, which she drew into her lungs gratefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, Elena was shoulder deep in hot water covered with a vanilla-scented foam. Her eyes were shut and the warmth was soaking into her body. The softly disintegrating salts were easing away all pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese weren\u0027t ordinary bath salts. They had no medicinal smell, but they\u0027d been given to her by Stefan\u0027s landlady, Mrs. Flowers, who was a genteel elderly white witch. Mrs. Flowers\u0027s herbal recipes were her specialty, and right now Elena would swear that she could feel all the tension of the last few days being actively sucked out of her body and gently soothed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, this was just what she had needed. Elena had never appreciated a bath like this before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, there\u0027s just one thing, she told herself firmly, as she inhaled breath after delicious breath of vanilla steam. You asked Mrs. Flowers for bath salts that would relax you, but you cannot fall asleep here. You\u0027ll drown, and you already know what that feels like. Been there, done that, didn\u0027t even have to buy the shroud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even now Elena\u0027s thoughts were dimmer and more fragmented, as the hot water continued to relax her muscles, and the vanilla scent swirled around her head. She was losing continuity, her mind drifting off into daydreams.... She was giving herself to the heat and the luxury of not having to do anything at all....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her dream, she was moving briskly. It was only half-light, but she could tell somehow that she was skimming downward through deep gray mist. What worried her was that she seemed to be surrounded by arguing voices, and they were arguing about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A second chance? I\u0027ve spoken to her about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She won\u0027t remember anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter whether she remembers. Everything will remain inside her, if unawakened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will germinate inside her...until the time is right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena had no idea what any of it meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then this mist was thinning, and clouds were making way for her, and she was drifting down, more and more slowly, until she was deposited gently on a ground covered with pine needles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voices were gone. She was lying on a forest floor, but she wasn\u0027t naked. She was wearing her prettiest nightgown, the one with real Valenciennes lace. She was listening to the tiny night sounds all around her when suddenly her aura reacted in a way that it never had before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt told her someone was coming. Someone who brought a sense of safety in warm earthen hues, in soft rose colors and deep, blue violets that enfolded her even before the person arrived. These were...someone\u0027s...feelings about herself. And behind the love and soothing concern she experienced, there were deep forest greens, shafts of warm gold, and a mysterious tinge of translucency, like a waterfall that sparkled as it fell and foamed like diamonds around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena, a voice whispered. Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was so familiar....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena. Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew this....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena, my angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt meant love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as Elena was sitting up and turning in her dream, she was holding out her arms. This person belonged with her. He was her magic, her solace, her best-beloved. It didn\u0027t matter how he\u0027d gotten there, or what had happened before. He was her soul\u0027s eternal mate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrong arms holding her tenderly...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA warm body close to hers...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet kisses...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany, many times...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis familiar feeling as she melted into his embrace...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so gentle, but almost fierce in his love for her. He had vowed not to kill, but he would kill to save her. She was his most precious thing in all the world.... Any sacrifice would be worth it if she were safe and free. His life meant nothing without her, so he would gladly give it, laughing and kissing his hand to her with his last breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena breathed in the wonderful autumn-leaves scent of his sweater and was comforted. Like a baby, she allowed herself to be soothed by simple familiar odors, by the feeling of her cheek against his shoulder and the wonder of the two of them breathing together in synchronicity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she tried to put a name to this miracle, it was at the front of her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena didn\u0027t even need to look up at his face to know that Stefan\u0027s leaf-green eyes would be dancing like the waters of a small pond ruffled by wind and sparkling with a thousand different points of light. She buried her head in his neck, afraid somehow to let go of him, although she couldn\u0027t remember why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know how I got here, she told him nonverbally. In fact, she didn\u0027t remember anything before this, before awakening to his call, only jumbled images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear seized her. This isn\u0027t...just a dream, is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo dream is just a dream. And I\u0027m with you always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how did we get here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShhh. You\u0027re tired. I\u0027ll hold you up. On my life, I swear it. Just rest. Let me hold you just once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust once? But...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now Elena felt worried and dazed, and she had to let her head fall backward, had to see Stefan\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her chin back and found herself meeting laughing eyes of an infinite darkness in a chiseled, pale, and proudly handsome face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost cried out in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHush. Hush, angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark eyes that met hers were full of love and joy. Who else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow dare you - how did you get here? Elena was more and more confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t belong anywhere, Damon pointed out, suddenly sounding sad. You know I\u0027ll always be with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not; I do not -\u0026nbsp; give Stefan back to me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was too late. Elena was aware of the sound of water trickling and of tepid liquid sloshing around her. She woke up just in time to keep her head from going underwater in the bathtub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dream...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt much more flexible and easy in her body, but she couldn\u0027t help feeling saddened by the dream. It hadn\u0027t been an out of body experience, either - it had been a simple, crazy, mixed-up, dream of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t belong anywhere. I\u0027ll always be with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what was gibberish like that supposed to mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something inside Elena trembled, even as she remembered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hastily changed - not into a Valenciennes lace nightgown, but into a gray and black sweat suit. When she emerged, she was feeling overtired and prickly and ready to start a fight if Damon gave any sign of having picked up on her sleeping thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Damon didn\u0027t. Elena saw a bed, managed to focus on it, stumbled toward it and collapsed, flopping down on pillows that sank unsatisfactorily beneath her head. Elena liked her pillows firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a few moments she lay, savoring her after-bath sensations, as her skin gradually cooled - and her head cooled as well. As far as she could tell, Damon was standing in exactly the same position as he had taken up when they\u0027d entered the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was still as silent as he had been since the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, to get it over with, she spoke to him. And being Elena, she went straight to the heart of the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong, Damon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\" Damon stared out the window, pretending to be engrossed in something beyond the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon shook his head. But somehow, his turned back eloquently conveyed his opinion of this motel room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena examined the room with the too-bright vision of someone who has forced their body beyond its limits. She contemplated beige walls, beige carpet, a beige armchair, a beige desk, and of course, a beige bedspread. Even Damon couldn\u0027t reject a room on the grounds that it doesn\u0027t match his basic black, she thought, and then: oh, I\u0027m tired. And bewildered. And scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd...incredibly stupid. There\u0027s only one bed in here. I\u0027m lying on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damon...\" With an effort, she sat up. \"What do you want? There\u0027s a chair. I can sleep on the chair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe half turned, and she saw in the movement that he wasn\u0027t annoyed or playing games. He was furious. It was all there in the faster-than-the-human-eye-could-follow assassin\u0027s spin and the complete muscular control that stilled it almost before it had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon with his sudden movements and his frightening stillness. He was looking out the window again, body poised as always for...something. Right now it looked poised to jump through glass to get outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires don\u0027t need sleep,\" he said in a voice icier and more controlled than she\u0027d heard since Matt had left them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gave her the energy to get off the bed. \"You know I know that\u0027s a lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the bed, Elena. Go to sleep.\" But his voice was the same. She would have expected a flat, weary command. Damon sounded more tense, more controlled than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore shaken than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyelids sank. \"Is this about Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it about Shinichi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027re afraid that Shinichi will get past all your defenses and possess you again. Aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to bed, Elena,\" Damon said tonelessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still shutting her out as completely as if she weren\u0027t there. Elena got mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it take to show you that I trust you? I\u0027m traveling all alone with you, without any idea where we\u0027re really going. I\u0027m trusting you with Stefan\u0027s life.\" Elena was behind Damon now, on the beige carpet which smelled like...nothing, like boiled water. Not even like dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words were the dust. There was something about them that sounded hollow, wrong. They were the truth - but they weren\u0027t getting through to Damon....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena sighed. Touching Damon unexpectedly was always a tricky business, with all the risks of setting off murderous instinct by accident, even when he wasn\u0027t possessed. She reached out, now, very carefully, to put her fingertips on the elbow of his leather jacket. She spoke as precisely and unemotionally as she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You also know that I have other senses now than the usual five. How many times do I have to say it, Damon? I know it wasn\u0027t you torturing me and Matt last week.\" Despite herself, Elena heard a certain pleading in her own voice. \"I know that you\u0027ve protected me on this trip when I was in danger, even killing for me. That means - a lot to me. You may say you don\u0027t believe in the human sentiment of forgiveness, but I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve forgotten it. And when you know that there is nothing to forgive in the first place - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has absolutely nothing to do with last week!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe change in his voice - the force in it - hit Elena like a whiplash. It hurt...and it frightened her. Damon was serious. He was also under some dreadful strain, not completely unlike that of fighting off Shinichi\u0027s possession, but different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damon...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave me alone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, where have I heard something like that before? Befuddled, her heart pounding, Elena groped through memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes. Stefan. Stefan when they had first been in his room together, when he was afraid to love her. When he was sure he would cause her to be damned if he showed he cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould Damon be that much like the brother he always mocked?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least turn around and talk with me face-to-face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena.\" It was a whisper, but it sounded as if Damon couldn\u0027t summon up his usual silky menace. \"Go to bed. Go to hell. Go anywhere, but stay away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so good at that, aren\u0027t you?\" Elena\u0027s own voice was cold now. Recklessly, angrily, she moved in even closer. \"At pushing people away. But I know that you haven\u0027t fed this evening. There\u0027s nothing else you want from me, and you can\u0027t do the starving-martyr bit half as well as Stefan - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena had spoken knowing that her words were guaranteed to incite a response of some kind, but Damon\u0027s usual response to this sort of thing was to lounge against something and pretend not to have heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened instead was completely outside the range of her experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon whirled, caught her precisely, held her locked in an unbreakable grip. Then, with a swoop of his head like a falcon on a mouse, he kissed her. He was more than strong enough to hold her still without hurting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kiss was hard and long and for quite a while Elena resisted out of sheer instinct. Damon\u0027s body was cool against hers, which was still warm and damp from the bath. The way he was holding her - if she put enough pressure on those particular points, it would hurt her possibly seriously. And then - she knew - he would release her. But did she really know what she knew? Was she prepared to break a bone to test it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was stroking her hair, which was so unfair, curling the ends and crushing them in his fingers...just hours after he\u0027d taught her to feel things to the tips of her hair. He knew her weak spots. Not just every woman\u0027s weak spots. He knew hers; he knew how to make her want to cry out in pleasure and how to soothe her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing to do but test her theory and maybe break a bone. She would not submit when she had not invited him. She would not!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then she remembered her curiosity about the little boy and the great stone boulder, and she deliberately opened her mind to Damon\u0027s. He fell into the trap of his own making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as their minds connected there were something like fireworks. Explosions. Rockets. Stars going nova. Elena set her mind to ignoring her body and began looking for the boulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was deep, deep inside the most locked-off part of his brain. Deep in the eternal darkness that slept there. But Elena seemed to have brought a searchlight with her. Wherever she turned, dark festoons of cobwebs fell and heavy-looking stone arches crumbled and fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Elena found herself saying. \"The light won\u0027t do that to you! You don\u0027t have to live down here. I\u0027ll show you the beauty of the light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I saying? Elena wondered even as the words left her lips. How can I promise him - and maybe he likes living here in the dark!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the next second she had come much closer to the little boy, close enough to see his pale, wondering face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came again,\" he said, as if it were a miracle. \"You said you would come, and you did!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought down all Elena\u0027s barriers at once. She knelt, and pulling the chains to their utmost length, took him on her lap. \"Are you glad that I came back?\" she asked gently. She was already stroking his hair smooth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes!\" It was a cry, and it frightened Elena almost as much as it pleased her. \"You\u0027re the nicest person I\u0027ve ever - the most beautiful thing I ever - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush,\" Elena told him, \"hush. There\u0027s got to be some way to warm you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the iron,\" the child said humbly. \"Iron keeps me weak and cold. But it has to be iron; otherwise he wouldn\u0027t be able to control me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" Elena said grimly. She was beginning to get a grasp on what kind of relationship Damon had with this little boy. For a moment, on a hunch, she took two lengths of iron in her hands and tried to tear them apart. Elena had super-light here; why not superpowers? But all that happened was that she twisted and turned the length for nothing, and finally cut the web of her finger against an iron burr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh!\" The boy\u0027s huge dark eyes fixed on the dark bead of blood. He stared as if he were fascinated - and afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want it?\" Elena held out the hand to him uncertainly. What a poor scrap of a creature to be coveting other people\u0027s blood, she thought. He nodded timidly as if he were sure she\u0027d be angry. But Elena just smiled and he reverently held her finger and took the whole globe of blood at once, closing his lips like a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he lifted his head, he seemed to have a tinge more color in his pale face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me Damon keeps you here,\" she said, holding him again and feeling heat being sucked from her into his cold body. \"Can you tell me why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child was still licking his lips, but he turned his face toward her immediately and said, \"I\u0027m the Warden of Secrets. But\" - sadly - \"the Secrets have gotten so big that even I don\u0027t know what they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena followed the motion of his head from his own small limbs to the iron chain to the huge, metallic ball. She felt a sinking inside herself and a deep pity for such a small warden. And she wondered what on earth could be inside that great stone sphere that Damon was guarding so intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t get the chance to ask. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-shadow-souls-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-8.html","bookId":2036,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:30:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:30:13 PM"}
