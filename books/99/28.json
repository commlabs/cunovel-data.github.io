\u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;And the simple people living there were uncommonly kind to us, for they made a fire for us, and took us in, because it was raining and cold.\n\u003cbr\u003e28:3\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;那 时 保 罗 拾 起 一 捆 柴 ， 放 在 火 上 ， 有 一 条 毒 蛇 ， 因 为 热 了 出 来 ， 咬 住 他 的 手 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;

and so we came to Rome.\n\u003cbr\u003e28:15\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;那 里 的 弟 兄 们 ， 一 听 见 我 们 的 信 息 ， 就 出 来 到 亚 比 乌 市 ， 和 三 馆 地 方 迎 接 我 们 。 保 罗 见 了 他 们 ， 就 感 谢 神 ， 放 心 壮 胆 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;And the brothers, when they had news of us, came out from town as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns to have a meeting with us: and Paul, seeing them, gave praise to God and took heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e28:16\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;进 了 罗 马 城 ， （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 百 夫 长 把 众 囚 犯 交 给 御 营 的 统 领 惟 有 ） 保 罗 蒙 准 ， 和 一 个 看 守 他 的 兵 ， 另 住 在 一 处 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;And when we came into Rome, they let Paul have a house for himself and the armed man who kept watch over him.\n\u003cbr\u003e28:17\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;过 了 三 天 ， 保 罗 请 犹 太 人 的 首 领 来 。 他 们 来 了 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ， 弟 兄 们 ， 我 虽 没 有 作 什 么 事 干 犯 本 国 的 百 姓 ， 和 我 们 祖 宗 的 规 条 ， 却 被 锁 绑 ， 从 耶 路 撒 冷 解 在 罗 马 人 的 手 里 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;Then after three days he sent for the chief men of the Jews: and when they had come together, he said to them, My brothers, though I had done nothing against the people or the ways of our fathers, I was given, a prisoner from Jerusalem, into the hands of the Romans.\n\u003cbr\u003e28:18\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;他 们 审 问 了 我 ， 就 愿 意 释 放 我 。 因 为 在 我 身 上 ， 并 没 有 该 死 的 罪 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;

\u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;But when the Jews made protest against it, I had to put my cause into Caesar\u0027s hands; not because I have anything to say against my nation.\n\u003cbr\u003e28:20\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;因 此 ， 我 请 你 们 来 见 面 说 话 。 我 原 为 以 色 列 人 所 指 望 的 ， 被 这 链 子 捆 锁 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;But for this reason I sent for you, to see and have talk with you: for because of the hope of Israel I am in these chains.\n\u003cbr\u003e28:21\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;他 们 说 ， 我 们 并 没 有 接 着 从 犹 太 来 论 你 的 信 ， 也 没 有 弟 兄 到 这 里 来 ， 报 给 我 们 说 ， 你 有 什 么 不 好 处 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;And they said to him, We have not had letters from Judaea about you, and no one of the brothers has come to us here to give an account or say any evil about you.\n\u003cbr\u003e28:22\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;但 我 们 愿 意 听 你 的 意 见 如 何 。 因 为 这 教 门 ， 我 们 晓 得 是 到 处 被 毁 谤 的 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;But we have a desire to give hearing to your opinion: for as to this form of religion, we have knowledge that in all places it is attacked.\n\u003cbr\u003e28:23\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;他 们 和 保 罗 约 定 了 日 子 ， 就 有 许 多 人 到 他 的 寓 处 来 ， 保 罗 从 早 到 晚 ， 对 他 们 讲 论 这 事 ， 证 明 神 国 的 道 ， 引 摩 西 的 律 法 和 先 知 的 书 ， 以 耶 稣 的 事 ， 劝 勉 他 们 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;And when a day had been fixed, they came to his house in great numbers; and he gave them teaching, giving witness to the kingdom of God, and having discussions with them about Jesus, from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.\n\u003cbr\u003e28:24\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;他 所 说 的 话 ， 有 信 的 ， 有 不 信 的 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;And some were in agreement with what he said, but some had doubts.\n\u003cbr\u003e28:25\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;他 们 彼 此 不 合 ， 就 散 了 。 未 散 以 先 ， 保 罗 说 了 一 句 话 ， 说 ， 圣 灵 借 先 知 以 赛 亚 ， 向 你 们 祖 宗 所 说 的 话 ， 是 不 错 的 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;And they went away, for there was a division among them after Paul had said this one thing: Well did the Holy Spirit say by the prophet Isaiah to your fathers,\n\u003cbr\u003e28:26\u0026nbsp;[hgb] \u0026nbsp;他 说 ， 你 去 告 诉 这 百 姓 说 ， 你 们 听 是 要 听 见 ， 却 不 明 白 。 看 是 要 看 见 ， 却 不 晓 得 。\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;

\u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;
