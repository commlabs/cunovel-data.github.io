AFTER TWENTY-SIX YEARS WORKING for the Justice Department, the past fifteen heading the Magellan Billet, she\u0027d learned that if it stood on four legs, had a trunk, and smelled like peanuts, it was an elephant. No need to hang a sign across its torso. Which meant the man in the red jacket was no purse snatcher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was something else altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that meant somebody knew her business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d watched as the thief leaped from the tower--the first time she\u0027d ever actually witnessed death. For years she\u0027d heard her agents talk about it, but a vast chasm lay between reading a report and seeing someone die. The body had slammed into the cobbles with a sickening thud. Did he jump? Or had Malone forced him over? Was there a struggle? Had he spoken before leaping?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d come to Denmark for a singular purpose and had decided, while there, to visit with Malone. Years ago he\u0027d been one of her original twelve choices for the Magellan Billet. She\u0027d known Malone\u0027s father and watched the steady rise of the son, glad to have him when he accepted her offer and moved from Navy JAG to Justice. He eventually grew to be her best agent, and she was saddened when he\u0027d decided last year that he wanted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d not seen him since, though they\u0027d talked on the phone a few times. When he\u0027d given chase to the thief, she\u0027d noticed that his tall frame remained muscular and his hair thick and wavy, carrying the same light sienna tint she remembered, similar to the olden stone in the buildings surrounding her. For the dozen years he\u0027d worked for her, he\u0027d always been forthright and independent, which had made him a good operative--one she could trust--yet there was compassion, too. He\u0027d actually been more than an employee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that didn\u0027t mean she wanted him in her business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePursuing the man in the red jacket was like Malone, but it was also a problem. Visiting with him now would mean there\u0027d be questions, ones she had no intention of answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime with an old friend would have to await another occasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE EXITED THE ROUND TOWER AND STARTED AFTER STEPHANIE. As he\u0027d left the roof, paramedics were tending to the older couple. The elderly man was shaken from a blow to the head, but would be all right. The woman remained hysterical and he\u0027d heard one of the attendants urge that she be taken to a waiting ambulance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed Jacket\u0027s body still lay on the street, beneath a pale yellow sheet, and police were busy moving people out of the way. Edging through the crowd, Malone watched as the sheet was lifted away and the police photographer went to work. The thief had clearly slit his throat. The bloodied knife lay a few feet away from one arm contorted at an unnatural angle. Blood had poured from the neck gash, settling across the cobbles in a dark pool. The skull was caved in, the torso crushed, the legs twisted as if they contained no bone. The police had told Malone not to leave--they would need a statement--but at the moment he needed to find Stephanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe emerged from the gawkers and glanced back up into the evening sky, where the late-afternoon sun shone with spendthrift glory. Not a cloud loomed in sight. Should be an excellent night to view the stars, but no one would visit the observatory atop the Round Tower. No. That was closed for the evening, as a man had just jumped to his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what of that man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone\u0027s thoughts were a tangle of curiosity and apprehension. He knew he should go back to his bookshop and forget all about Stephanie Nelle and whatever she was doing. Her business was no longer his. But he knew that wasn\u0027t going to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was unfolding, and it wasn\u0027t good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spotted Stephanie fifty yards ahead on Vestergade, another of the long lanes that spiderwebbed Copenhagen\u0027s shopping district. Her pace was brisk, undaunted, then she abruptly veered right and disappeared into one of the buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe trotted forward and saw HANSEN\u0027S ANTIKVARIAT--a bookshop, its proprietor one of the few people in town who\u0027d not offered Malone a warm welcome. Peter Hansen did not like foreigners, especially Americans, and had even tried to block Malone\u0027s induction into the Danish Antiquarian Booksellers Association. Thankfully, Hansen\u0027s distaste had not proven contagious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld instincts were taking over, feelings and senses that had lain dormant since his retirement last year. Sensations he did not like. But ones that had always driven him forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped short of the front doorway and saw Stephanie inside, talking to Hansen. The two then retreated deeper into the store, which filled the ground floor of a three-story building. He knew the interior layout, having last year studied the Copenhagen bookstores. Nearly all of them were a testament to Nordic neatness, the stacks organized by subject, books carefully shelved. Hansen, though, was more haphazard. His was an eclectic mix of old and new--mainly new, since he was not one to pay top dollar for private acquisitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone slipped into the dim space and hoped none of the employees called out his name. He\u0027d had dinner a couple of times with Hansen\u0027s manager, which was how he\u0027d learned that he was not Hansen\u0027s favorite person. Luckily, she was not around and only ten or so people perused the shelves. He quickly moved toward the back where, he knew, there were myriad cubbyholes, each one brimming with shelves. He was not comfortable being here--after all, Stephanie had merely called and said she\u0027d be in town for a few hours and wanted to say hello--but that was before Red Jacket. And he was damn curious to know what that man died wanting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouldn\u0027t be surprised by Stephanie\u0027s behavior. She\u0027d always kept everything close to her vest, too close sometimes, which had often generated clashes. One thing to be safe in an Atlanta office working a computer, quite another being out in the field. Good decisions could never be made without good information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spotted Stephanie and Hansen inside a windowless alcove that served as Hansen\u0027s office. Malone had visited there once when he\u0027d first tried to make friends with the idiot. Hansen was a heavy-chested man with a long nose that overhung a grizzly mustache. Malone positioned himself behind a row of overloaded shelves and grabbed a book, pretending to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why have you come such a long way for this?\" Hansen was saying in his tight, wheezy voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you familiar with the Roskilde auction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical Stephanie, answering a question she didn\u0027t want to answer with another question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I attend often. Lots of books for sale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone, too, was familiar with the auction. Roskilde lay thirty minutes west of Copenhagen. The town\u0027s antique-book dealers convened once a quarter for a sale that brought buyers from all over Europe. Two months after opening his shop, Malone had earned nearly two hundred thousand euros there from four books he\u0027d managed to find at an obscure estate sale in the Czech Republic. Those funds had made his transition from salaried government employee to entrepreneur a lot less stressful. But they also bred jealousy, and Peter Hansen had not hidden his envy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need the one book we spoke about. Tonight. You said there would be no problem buying it,\" Stephanie said, in the tone of someone accustomed to giving orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHansen chuckled. \"Americans. All alike. The world revolves around you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My husband said you were a man who could find the unfindable. The book I want is already found. I just need it purchased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does go to the highest bidder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone winced. Stephanie did not know the perilous territory she was navigating. The first rule of the bargain was never to reveal how badly you wanted something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an obscure book that no one cares about,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But apparently you do, which means there will be others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s make sure we\u0027re the highest bidder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is this book so important? I\u0027ve never heard of it. Its author is unknown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you question my husband\u0027s motives?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That it\u0027s none of your business. Secure the book and I\u0027ll pay your fee, as agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you buy it yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t plan to explain myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your husband was much more agreeable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the declaration carried no emotion, a moment of silence passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we to travel to Roskilde together?\" Hansen asked, apparently getting the message that he was going to learn nothing from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll meet you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can hardly wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie bounded from the office and Malone shrank farther into his alcove, his face turned away as she passed. He heard the door to Hansen\u0027s office slam shut and took the opportunity to stride back toward the front entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie exited the darkened shop and turned left. Malone waited, then crept forward and watched his former boss weave her way through afternoon shoppers back toward the Round Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped back and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head never turned. She seemed oblivious that anyone might be interested in what she was doing. Yet she should be, especially after what happened with Red Jacket. He wondered why her guard was not up. Granted, she wasn\u0027t a field agent, but she wasn\u0027t a fool either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Round Tower, instead of turning right and heading toward Hojbro Plads where Malone\u0027s bookshop stood, she kept straight. After another three blocks, she disappeared inside the Hotel d\u0027Angleterre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched as she entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was hurt that she was intent on purchasing a book in Denmark and had not asked him to assist. Clearly, she didn\u0027t want him involved. In fact, after what happened at the Round Tower, she apparently didn\u0027t even want to speak with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at his watch. A little after four thirty. The auction started at six PM, and Roskilde was half an hour\u0027s drive away. He\u0027d not planned on attending. The catalog sent out weeks ago contained nothing of interest. But that was no longer the case. Stephanie was acting strange, even for her. And a familiar voice deep inside his head, one that had kept him alive through twelve years as a government operative, said she was going to need him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1/page-3.html","bookId":2232,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM"}
