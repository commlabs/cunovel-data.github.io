A bolt of blue lightning suddenly appeared, piercing Heaven and Earth….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome distance away from the battlefield was an area that had previously been completely cloaked, but was now suddenly visible. It was as if a curtain had been pulled back to reveal… an enormous cage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the cage was a monkey, its body completely covered with magical symbols, and its eyes as red as blood. It seemed to be filled with a madness that could consume the Heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Meng Hao caught sight of the cage and the monkey, his mind reeled. Even he… had been completely unable to detect the existence of the cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat indicated that the intense power of the cage exceeded Meng Hao’s cultivation base by a huge amount!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, even a false Immortal would be incapable of completely evading Meng Hao’s detection. Thus, it indicated that the cage… was comparable to a true Immortal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the Imperial Bloodline Clan would never use anything less powerful as their ancestral statuary!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a precious treasure formed from countless years of collected qi reserves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cage slowly rose up into the air, surrounded by lightning which stretched from the ground all the way up into the sky. The Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief immediately dropped to his knees in worship, raised his hands into the air, and began to chant a bizarre spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air suddenly filled with the music of a great Dao. It sounded like the chanting of countless voices, droning dully in a way that made it impossible to hear clearly. However, the surrounding cultivators who did hear it were shaken mentally. The peak Dao Seeking Patriarchs up in midair looked on with shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao took a deep breath. The sense of deadly crisis had reached a pinnacle inside of him. He lifted the Lightning Cauldron up, and lightning spread out to cover his entire body. He suddenly switched places with a cultivator close to the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief. He flew up into the air, performing an incantation gesture that caused the Blood Demon Grand Magic to appear as he sped toward the clan chief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not allow the man to continue to perform his magic; the strange, ancient cage was something that filled Meng Hao’s heart with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis divine ability slammed into the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, who didn’t do the slightest thing to evade. He knelt there in worship just as before, the spell’s words pouring from his mouth. As Meng Hao’s divine ability reached him, it was blocked by some invisible power, and then… dissipated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s face fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that, inside the cage, the monkey’s eyes suddenly flickered. The countless magical symbols on its body began to squirm and wriggle, and then flew into motion across the surface of its body. Golden light emanated off of the monkey, along with an aura like that of an Immortal Divinity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s scalp went numb, and his sense of deadly crisis rose even higher. Seeing that he couldn’t attack the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief, he began to back up, preparing to leave this area of the battlefield and the terrifying cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, even in the moment that he began to back up…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief looked up, and his expression was one of madness. “Ancestral statuary,” he cried out in a loud voice, “please slaughter this person!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning descended to dance around the cage, making it like a sun of lightning in midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magical symbols on the monkey’s body began to move even faster than before. Then, all of the magical symbols on its right arm suddenly vanished, scattering to other parts of its body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magical symbols were like seals that kept it under constant suppression. Now… the right arm had been unsealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, one section of the cage in front of the monkey rippled and twisted into an opening!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ferocious gleam appeared in the monkey’s eyes, and it suddenly roared: “The world of Immortals is the root of all evil! Immortals… must be suppressed!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs its voice echoed out, it stretched out its right hand, passing through the gap to appear outside the cage as it reached toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s scalp was numb. The Lightning Cauldron crackled, and he vanished, reappearing some distance off, where he immediately transformed into a shooting star that sped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the instant that he took to flight, however, the arm stretching out of the cage began to expand. In the blink of an eye it was three hundred meters long. Another blink, and it was three thousand. Then thirty thousand!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn enormous hand shot after Meng Hao. It was huge, filling up the sky, blocking the light, exceeding mountains and rivers as it closed in on Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was impossible to tell exactly what type of divine ability was involved. Meng Hao was astonished, as were the peak Dao Seeking experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao spat out a mouthful of blood as he pushed himself forward at indescribable speed. However, the enormous hand seemed to have no limits. It was like a continent unto itself as it shot after him. It spread out to completely encompass him. Up ahead of him, what looked like five gigantic mountain peaks were descending from up above!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes went wide from astonishment regarding this ancestral statuary. However, a cold gleam then appeared in his eyes, and the image of a roc appeared on his forehead. He burst forward as the image of a fish appeared in the air around him, its flapping tail shattering the air around him as he propelled himself forward. [1. Don’t forget that rocs, or “kunpeng,” start out their existence as a fish.] The war chariot appeared, and he circulated the qi of Immortal Shows the Way. Rumbling filled the battlefield as he shot forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUtilizing the power of the war chariot, he was able to pass through one of the gaps between the five descending mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him on the battlefield, the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief spat up a mouthful of blood. Immediately, the magical symbols reappeared on the arm of the monkey in the cage. The chief was enraged; how could he ever have imagined that the ancestral statuary would be incapable of capturing Meng Hao?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, this is unbelievable!” The Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief bit the tip of his tongue and spat some more blood out. Then he took out a skull fragment, which he pushed down onto his forehead. His body began to tremble, and rumbling sounds could be heard. A boundless radiance shone out from him, and countless voices spoke in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ancestral statuary, please seal this person!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief’s roar echoed out, the monkey’s eyes flickered. No longer did they glow with red light; instead, they began to darken, as if the flame of its life force were burning out. It was at this point that the monkey transformed into a stone statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen that happened, the cage began to shine with brilliant light, simultaneously increasing in size. Then, it abruptly vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Meng Hao was speeding off into the distance, utilizing all the possible power of the war chariot. In the blink of an eye, he was far, far away. He turned to look behind him, and when he could see no enormous hand, he sighed with relief. Then, killing intent flickered in his eyes, and he was about to return to the battlefield, when suddenly, his mind reeled with shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything around him was flat and drab. The whole world looked peaceful and calm. In fact, there seemed to be no life present at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up, and could see a mountain range off in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Considering the power of the war chariot, and how hard I pushed it just now, I should be able to see the Milky Way Sea from here….” His mind spun, and a bad feeling welled up in his heart. Eyes flashing, he sped forward toward the mountain range he had just seen. Then, his face fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose… were no mountains! Instead, they were enormous pillars!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s scalp tingled. He turned again and, shockingly, found himself looking up at a gargantuan statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a statue of a monkey, and the expression on its face was one of derision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thunderous roar filled Meng Hao’s mind. If by this point he didn’t understand what had happened, then he wouldn’t be Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m inside that cage!” he thought with disbelief. He had just employed the top speed he could muster, and had clearly outrun the monkey’s palm. Panting, he again sped off into the distance. It only took a bit of flying around for him to determine that he was definitely not in the lands of the Southern Domain, but rather, a square-shaped world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn each of the four directions, he ran into pillars. In the center of all of them was the gigantic stone monkey. Finally, Meng Hao’s face fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that chanting sounds began to pulse toward him from all directions. The voices seem to contain some unspeakable power. As they floated about, the world began to tremble. What happened next was clearly visible to Meng Hao. The entire world… began to shrink!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, a shocking pressure weighed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more the world shrank, the more intense the pressure became. It was a suppressing force that made Meng Hao tremble; it felt as if a mountain were crushing down onto him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, in the outside world, Pill Demon, Patriarch Song, and the others hovered above the battlefield, shaken. Down below, the cultivators of the Southern Domain looked hopeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone could see that the cage up in midair, which was covered by countless lightning bolts, now contained a figure inside that was Meng Hao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he seemed to have been shrunk down to a tiny size, and was being suppressed by some power within the cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ruthless gleam appeared in the eyes of the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief. He put away the skull fragment, then spit out a mouthful of blood. His body aged visibly; manipulating the ancestral statuary in the way he just had came with a steep price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This campaign has been fraught with setbacks. However, Meng Hao has finally been suppressed. At long last, the war of the Southern Domain shall end. The Northern Reaches will now control this territory!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Immortal destiny will definitely appear within a Northern Reaches cultivator!” He lifted his head up and laughed. The heavy price he had paid was worth it considering that the result was that Meng Hao was suppressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilling intent flickered in his eyes as he shot up into the air, heading directly toward the battle with Patriarch Song and Pill Demon. After killing them, the battle would be completely in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown below, the Southern Domain cultivators were in a state of hopelessness, whereas the Northern Reaches cultivators were enlivened. Roaring, the Northern Reaches cultivators charged in attack; in the blink of an eye, the Southern Domain suffered heavy casualties, and were pushed back. The only thing they could do now was fall back behind the protection of the spell formations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spell formations were strong, but not strong enough that they could block an entire army of hundreds of thousands of maddened cultivators. The enormous golden door was once again hoisted up by tens of thousands of cultivators. The fourth spell formation was destroyed, then the third. Although some Northern Reaches cultivators died in the process, the second spell formation was also broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Mountain still hadn’t faded away. It remained there, emitting rumbling sounds, as if someone was inside trying to break out!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Southern Domain was in a huge crisis!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis chapter was sponsored by Michael Gibson, Peter Manolov, Nightrunners, and Bjorn Jeune\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-788\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-790\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-789","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
