So this means last night I took out two (Body Double and Blond, Hot, Dead) so I could rent one more, but I\u0027ve forgotten I\u0027m also part of the Gold Circle Membership Plan, which means that if I\u0027ve spent one thousand dollars (at least) in the last six months then I\u0027m allowed to rent as many videos on any given night as I want, but if I still have two out now that might mean I can\u0027t take any more out, Gold Circle Member or not, if the other ones haven\u0027t been returned, but -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien. You\u0027re Damien,\" I think I hear Sean mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\" I ask, looking up. \"I didn\u0027t hear you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice tan,\" he sighs. \"I said nice tan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I say, still confused about the video thing. I look down - at what, my lap? \"Uh, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rock\u0027n\u0027 roll.\" He stamps his cigarette out. Fumes rise from the crystal ashtray, then die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean knows I know he can probably get us into Petty\u0027s, which is the new Norman Prager club on Fifty-ninth, but I\u0027m not going to ask him and he\u0027s not going to offer. I place my platinum American Express card over the check. Sean\u0027s eyes are glued to a hardbody by the bar in a Thierry Mugler wool jersey dress and a Claude Montana scarf, sipping from a champagne tumbler. When our waitress come by to pick up the check and the card, I shake my head no. Sean\u0027s eyes finally fall on it, for a second, maybe more, and I wave the waitress back over and allow her to take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fourteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunch with Bethany\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I\u0027m meeting Bethany for lunch at Vanities, the new Evan Kiley bistro in Tribeca, and though I worked out for nearly two hours this morning and even lifted weights in my office before noon, I\u0027m still extremely nervous. The cause is hard to locate but I\u0027ve narrowed it down to one of two reasons. It\u0027s either that I\u0027m afraid of rejection (though I can\u0027t understand why: she called me, she wants to see me, she wants to have lunch with me, she wants to f**k me again) or, on the other hand, it could have something to do with this new Italian mousse I\u0027m wearing, which, though it makes my hair look fuller and smells good, feels very sticky and uncomfortable, and it\u0027s something I could easily blame my nervousness on. So we wouldn\u0027t run out of things to talk about over lunch, I tried to read a trendy new short-story collection called Wok that I bought at Barnes \u0026amp; Noble last night and whose young author was recently profiled in the Fast Track section of New York magazine, but every story started off with the line \"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie\" and I had to put this slim volume back into my bookshelf and drink a J\u0026amp;B on the rocks, followed by two Xanax, to recover from the effort. To make up for this, before I fell asleep I wrote Bethany a poem and it took a long time, which surprised me, since I used to write her poems, long dark ones, quite often when we were both at Harvard, before we broke up. God, I\u0027m thinking to myself as I walk into Vanities, only fifteen minutes late, I hope she hasn\u0027t ended up with Robert Hall, that dumb ass**le. I pass by a mirror hung over the bar as I\u0027m led to our table and check out my reflection - the mousse looks good. The topic on The Patty Winters Show this morning was Has Patrick Swayze Become Cynical or Not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to stop moving as I near the table, following the maitre d\u0027 (this is all happening in slow motion). She isn\u0027t facing me and I can only catch the back of her neck, her brown hair pinned up into a bun, and when she turns to gaze out the window I see only part of her profile, briefly; she looks just like a model. Bethany\u0027s wearing a silk gazar blouse and a sills satin start with crinoline. A Paloma Picasso hunter green suede and wrought-iron handbag sits in front of her on the table, next to a bottle of San Pellegrino water. She checks her watch. The couple next to our table is smoking and after I lean in behind Bethany, surprising her, kissing her cheek, I coolly ask the maitre d\u0027 to reseat us in the non smoking section. I\u0027m suave but loud enough for the nicotine addicts to hear me and hopefully feel a slight twinge of embarrassment about their filthy habit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" I ask, standing there, arms crossed, tapping my foot impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m afraid there is no nonsmoking section, sir,\" the maitre d\u0027 informs me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop tapping my foot and slowly scan the restaurant, the bistro, wondering how my hair really looks, and suddenly I wish I had switched mousses because since I last saw my hair, seconds ago, it feels different, as if its shape was somehow altered on the walls from bar to table. A pang of nausea that I\u0027m unable to stifle washes warmly over me, but since I\u0027m really dreaming all this I\u0027m able to ask, \"So you say there\u0027s no nonsmoking section? Is this correct?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-98.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
