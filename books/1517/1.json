It is the calling of their, of our religion, the incessant pulling of hungering heartstrings. Ambition over rides good sense and compassion is thrown away in its face, all in the name of Lloth, the Spider Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAscension to power in drow society is a simple process of assassination. The Spider Queen is a deity of chaos, and she and her high priestesses, the true rulers of the drow world, do not look with ill favor upon ambitious individuals wielding poisoned daggers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there are rules of behavior, every society must boast of these. To openly commit murder or wage war invites the pretense of justice, and penalties exacted in the name of drow justice are merciless. To stick a dagger in the back of a rival during the chaos of a larger battle or in the quiet shadows of an alley, howeveI, is quite acceptable, even applauded. Investigation is not the forte of drow justice. No one cares enough to bother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStation is the way of Lloth, the ambition she bestows to further the chaos, to keep her drow \"children\" along their appointed course of self imprisonment. Children? Pawns more likely, dancing dolls for the Spider Queen, puppets on the imperceptible but impervious strands of her web. All climb the Spider Queen\u0027s ladders; all hunt for her pleasure, and all fall to the hunters of her pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStation is the paradox of the world of my people, the limitation of our power within the hunger for power. It is gained through treachery and invites treachery against those who gain it.
