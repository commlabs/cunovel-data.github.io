There was the rip of Velcro, the crisp snick of the chunky, plastic zipper. The thud of my heart in my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned back around and pulled my arms free of the suit. It was a single, fluid movement, torquing my body, but I welcomed the pain now. Anything to stop this feeling of hyper-self-awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore, Ronan had been my teacher and only my teacher. By the time our friendship had deepened, Carden was in the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden, who loomed so large in my heart. Hell, he loomed in my bloodstream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden and any breathless thoughts of Ronan were completely mutually exclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where was Carden now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew where Ronan was. He was right here, helping me. Making my pulse hop in a way that had me woozy. A little woozy and a lot confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still didn’t get why Ronan was here. Or where Carden had gone. Or why he’d gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t wrap my mind around any of it. So I didn’t. Instead, I went through the motions, watching Ronan—and me with Ronan—as though from afar. Trying to figure out what on earth was going on. He was looking at my belly, hmming and poking. A fresh zing of pain brought me back quick enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched away. “Easy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored me…of course. “The salt water would be painful—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted away to give him a good glare. “You think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye.” As he knelt closer, he tried to hide his smirk, but I spotted it. “The salt burns, but it has antibacterial properties.” He poked and prodded a bit more, testing the edges of the gash, pushing together, pressing down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ow.” I hated the tone of my voice, but something about this blatant attention made me peevish. I didn’t care about my injury. I didn’t want to hear about it. I wanted him to explain what he was doing, like, in a fundamental way. “Do you have to do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It needs to close back up. How well did you clean this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cleaned it.” As best I could, stealing solitary moments in the girls’ room without anyone seeing. People seeing me with bruises was one thing, but I’d become very secretive about anything that might betray a weakness. I could’ve gone to the infirmary—there was such a thing—but seeking help was yet another way to mark yourself as vulnerable. We studied combat medicine for this very reason. We were trained to be tough. To endure extreme conditions. Extreme pain. We should be tending our wounds ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t need to be tending my wounds if Carden were around. I felt a flicker of resentment and snatched on to it. Anger was so much easier than loneliness or sadness. I pushed Ronan’s hand aside and felt around the wound. It was cool. Not swollen. “It’s not infected.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep direct pressure on it.” He put my hands over my belly, then took my shoulders and guided me off my seat. “Move.” He opened the bench storage and began digging through. “You need to keep it dressed.” He pulled out a first-aid kit—it looked ancient, the red plastic box faded almost pink—and fished through it till he found a yellowed roll of gauze and a sterile cotton pad. “Hands up.” His voice was devoid of emotion as he staunched the wound with the cotton and began to wind the ribbon of gauze around and around my belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA silence followed, and it became unbearable. With nothing more clever to say, I finally told him, “Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeak. Lame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should’ve just told me,” he said flatly. “You didn’t have to do this today. Why do you continually insist on putting yourself in harm’s way?” His hands stilled on my belly. “Have you ever once considered telling me the truth without hesitation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I tell you the truth all the time,” I protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up and pierced me with those green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most of the time,” I amended. “Think about it, Ronan. If I told you I wanted to get a look at that gate, you would’ve hidden the oars and made me swim out here myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been fighting it, but a reluctant smile finally quirked one corner of his mouth. “Probably true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And, anyway, you were right to challenge me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other corner of his mouth curled until it became an actual symmetrical smile. He tied off the gauze. “Indeed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes swept past him as I considered, taking in the vast sea. It was the color of a spilled inkpot. Or a bruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not the sky. The sky was so bled of color, the white band of the horizon seemed barely able to touch down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze returned to Ronan. Drawn to him, as I’d been drawn on that first day we met. He’d been an anchor for me since I’d arrived. “I needed this now more than ever,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle did he know, my words referred to so much more than swimming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed to get into that sea gate. Tom had said boats pull up to unload. Surely it wasn’t just vampires and Trainees who used it. I doubted those vampires did anything so banal as unload cargo. I had a great big picture in my head of Master Dagursson hauling crates like a dockworker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely they had cooks and maids and scullions and whomever else people employed in castles. I thought of the vampires I’d seen on the other island. They had an army of servants. I didn’t believe these vamps mopped their own floors. Someone did it for us girls; someone had to be doing it for them, too. And that vampires’ keep was way bigger than any Acari dorm—they had to employ dozens of someones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillagers. It had to be villagers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of the few I’d met. It was village men who managed the airstrip. Villagers who’d ferried us to the other island. They had to have villagers who helped in the castle, too. How did they enter? I doubted they sashayed through the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood old Tom. He’d know. Which is how I ended up poking around the Draug pens, but he was nowhere to be seen. The Draug were there, though, snarling and moaning in their cages as I neared. It must’ve been the scent of my healing wound. I pulled off my gloves, and something about winter’s bite helped me clear my head. Staved off the fear. It must’ve worked, because the Draug made no more than those basic complaints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet crunched through day-old snow as I searched all over, but there was no sign of Tom. Could he be out feeding the animals? He had goats—apparently, their blood was enough to keep the Draug sated—and he kept a paddock of them behind his cottage. I didn’t know what was involved in keeping livestock. Did he have to exercise them? Take them someplace for milking? I’d grown up in suburban Florida—how should I know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wandered to the paddock, climbing onto the fence for a bird’s-eye view, but there was no sign of anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sign, that is, until Toby appeared. I hopped down and instinctively grabbed a long-handled tool that’d been leaning against the fence. “Hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy farm boy. Toby-the-Trainee. My assignment. He looked as perplexed as I felt. “What are you doing here?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could ask the same of you.” I tightened my grip on the wooden handle, grateful I’d already removed my gloves. My hands were growing numb, but if it came to a fight, numbed fingers were a lot more nimble than gloved ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t attack, though. He just gave me a dopey smile. “You look like a witch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” I glanced at my impromptu weapon. It was an old pitchfork, with three long, thin, rusted prongs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holding that dung fork,” he said. “You look like a witch.” His tone was easy, not aggressive at all. Was this a trick? Was my dim farmhand actually a conniving supergenius who was fooling me into dropping my guard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I feel more Amish,” I said, playing along. I hefted the fork high, trying to read his expression. We were alone. How was this going to play out? But then his words registered and I gave an involuntary smile. “Wait. What did you call this? I thought it was a pitchfork.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah, that there’s a dung fork.” Then he nodded to the paddock, which upon closer inspection, did appear rather dung-y. “You know, scoop it up, spread it out. Makes good fertilizer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Ew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the guy I was supposed to kill? Mr. Dung Fork? I probably could take him down pretty easily. He had a good hundred pounds on me, but in this case, all that mattered was who had more IQ points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You never seen a dung fork?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. No, but I’ve met a boy dim as one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thoughts were churning. I had to “assassinate” him. “I still say it’s a pitchfork.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToby laughed and kicked a muddy patch into the slushy ground. The guy wasn’t acting like he was about to attack. In fact, he wasn’t acting combative in the slightest bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Alcántara’s words rang in my head. In our last class, he’d been furious with me. How serious are you, querida? And, I’m beginning to think you’ve lost heart. He’d never take me on as his assistant if I couldn’t complete the semester’s only assignment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA snow flurry hit my cheek. One landed in my eye. I wiped my face, clearing my head. I couldn’t think of him as Toby. He was homework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed past me. “Looks like weather is coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeather is coming. It was exactly what a farm boy would say. Like something Emma would’ve said. Suddenly, this felt too normal. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t deal with this chitchat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you from, anyway? Because where I’m from in Nebras—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guess what?” I snapped. “I don’t care where you’re from. I don’t care where you were born. Because guess what? This is where we’ll all die.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-keep-the-watchers-4/page-36.html","bookId":2294,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:59 PM"}
