A deep breath brought a familiar scent to his nostrils, and a smile to his lips. Daisy was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he frowned. What was she doing here in the middle of the day?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising, he hurried to the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik!\" Daisy stared up at him, her eyes wild. \"I need help!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, honey, come on in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not for me.\" She waved a frantic hand toward the car parked at the curb. \"It\u0027s Alex!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik swore softly as he glanced at the stretch of sun-dappled sidewalk between his house and the car. \"Wait a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, he grabbed a long leather coat from the rack just inside the door. Pulling it over his head and shoulders, he moved with supernatural speed toward the car. One look at Daisy\u0027s brother and he feared the man was beyond help. He was bleeding from numerous wounds; his face was deathly pale, his lips were turning blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik muttered an oath as the sun\u0027s light warmed his back. Any further examination would have to be done inside. His skin tingled uncomfortably as he pulled the unconscious man out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDraping Daisy\u0027s brother over his shoulder, he transported himself back into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouting, \"Close the damn door!\" he carried Alex up the stairs and into the bedroom adjacent to the one Daisy had used not so long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy was right behind him. She pulled back the covers, then hovered beside Erik as he lowered Alex to the bed. Blood immediately soaked into the Spider-man sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell happened?\" Erik asked. \"He looks like he\u0027s been through a meat grinder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were hunting vampires...hunting Rhys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik leaned over Alex, his nostrils flaring. \"And you found him,\" he muttered, disbelief evident in his tone. \"How the hell did you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just by chance,\" Daisy answered. They had found Rhys and lived to tell the tale. She swayed on her feet, feeling suddenly light-headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik\u0027s gaze swept over her. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, don\u0027t worry about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik shook his head. He had once warned Rhys that he needed more security for their meeting place, but Rhys had shrugged it off. He had always been arrogant to the point of carelessness. There had been times when Erik wondered if Rhys kept such an easily breached establishment because he was tired of his existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy tugged on Erik\u0027s arm, drawing his attention back to the matter at hand. \"Please, do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik studied Daisy\u0027s brother. Alex\u0027s heartbeat was slow and erratic, barely discernable. The scent of his blood teased Erik\u0027s nostrils, tempting him to take what little blood the man had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I warned you to stay away from Rhys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can lecture me later,\" she said, choking back her tears. \"Right now, Alex is dying. But you can save him! I know you can!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to save a vampire hunter?\" Erik exclaimed. \"Dammit, Daisy, if he had come here alone, he might have taken my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s my brother. Please, Erik, I\u0027ll do anything you want!\" Tears welled in her eyes and dripped down her cheeks. \"Please! You can\u0027t just let him die!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik waged a silent war with himself. It went against the grain to save the life of a hunter, yet what else could he do, with Daisy standing there, tears streaming down her face?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get him out of those clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t argue, didn\u0027t ask for help, but Erik gave it anyway. Moments later, Alex lay on the blood-soaked sheets, stripped to his briefs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might not want to watch this,\" Erik warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m staying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s pretty far gone. There\u0027s no guarantee my blood will save him. If it doesn\u0027t...?\" He left the question hanging in the air between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ask me that,\" she said, her eyes wide. \"I can\u0027t make a decision like that for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a curt nod, Erik bit into the deep blue vein in his left wrist. Dark red blood oozed from the two shallow wounds. Using his fingers, he smeared his blood over Alex\u0027s injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy watched in fascinated horror as the gashes on her brother\u0027s body began to heal, all but the one in his stomach. She looked up at Erik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lift his head a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to turn him?\" she asked, horrified by the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027ll just give him a little drink, to strengthen him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwallowing the urge to vomit, Daisy folded one of the bed pillows in half and put it under Alex\u0027s head. She looked away when Erik held his bleeding wrist to her brother\u0027s lips, only to glance back as some shred of morbid curiosity got the better of her. A small trickle of blood flowed from Erik\u0027s wrist into Alex\u0027s mouth, and then, incredibly, Alex took hold of Erik\u0027s arm, suckling as though it were mother\u0027s milk. Within moments, color returned to her brother\u0027s waxen cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the wound in Alex\u0027s stomach, her eyes widening with amazement as the ugly wound began to knit together. She had known vampire blood had miraculous qualities. Didn\u0027t it say so on her Web site? But she had never actually seen what it could do, never really believed a few drops of Undead blood could work miracles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a believer now, and even as the thought crossed her mind, the room began to spin out of focus. \"Erik...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steady, girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice curled around her like loving arms, holding the dizziness at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, he lifted his arm and licked the bloody wound in his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRevulsion swirled in the pit of Daisy\u0027s stomach, and then the world went black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik caught Daisy in his arms and carried her into the room she had occupied before. What the hell had Alex been thinking, to take his sister with him when he went to hunt the most dangerous vampire on the West Coast? And what had Daisy been thinking when she agreed to go with him? And how the devil was Rhys? Had Daisy and her brother destroyed him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDammit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe removed Daisy\u0027s shoes, then tucked her under the covers. He gazed down at her a moment, thinking how right it felt to have her under his roof again. Too right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering under his breath, he returned to her brother, who was still unconscious. Lifting the man with one hand, Erik stripped the ruined sheets from the bed, noting that the mattress was ruined, too. He dropped the bloody sheets on the bathroom floor, along with Alex\u0027s navy blue briefs, and turned on the shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFully clad, Erik stepped into the stall with Daisy\u0027s brother cradled in his arms. Erik shook his head. If anyone in the vampire community discovered what he had done, he would have no defense. In the world of the Undead, it was vampire against mortal. There was no neutral ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik glanced at Alex. Even the cold water had failed to revive him. Perhaps his efforts to save the man had come too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the blood had been rinsed away, Erik turned off the water and stepped out of the shower. After wrapping Alex in a towel, he carried him down the stairs to the guest room. He hesitated a moment before opening the door, then chuckled softly as he imagined Alex\u0027s reaction if he regained consciousness. Erik had wondered, on more than one occasion, what kind of people had owned the house previously, and if they had been color-blind. Three of the walls in this room were painted a virulent shade of orange; the fourth wall was decorated with pink, yellow, and magenta flowered wallpaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling back the matching spread on the twin bed, Erik tucked Alex under the covers, then left the room. What the hell was he doing keeping a hunter and a Blood Thief under his roof? Dammit, there was no way he was going to get any rest with the two of them in his house. And no way he could explain their presence to the Master of the City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what about Rhys?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cursed softly. Another two hours until sunset. There were times, like now, when he hated the weakness that kept him trapped inside until sundown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter changing into a dry T-shirt and jeans, Erik found his cell phone and dialed the number of the vampire who had been his best friend for the last two hundred years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe feared the worst when there was no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy woke with a start, surprised to find herself in Erik\u0027s house. What was she doing here? And then, all too vividly, she remembered going hunting with Alex, finding Rhys, although they hadn\u0027t known it was Rhys at the time. She would never forget the sight of Rhys hovering over her brother, never forget how she had doused the vampire with holy water before driving a stake into his chest. And missing his heart, she thought bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwinging her legs over the edge of the bed, Daisy hurried out of the room. Alex. She had to find Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart seemed to stop beating when she opened the door to the room where he had been. Last night, she hadn\u0027t paid any attention to the room\u0027s decor. Now she wondered how she could have missed the garish green paint and jungle wallpaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved toward the bed, only then noticing that it was empty. The sheets had been stripped from the mattress; the mattress was stained with blood. She peeked into the bathroom, but it, too, was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Alex?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where was Erik?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at the door at the end of the hall. If she opened it, would she find Alex or Erik inside?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood in the hallway, listening to the house. It sounded as dead as its owner. As dead as her brother? No! She couldn\u0027t think that. Alex had been alive when she saw him last, alive and drinking Erik\u0027s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother owes me a new mattress and a set of sheets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy whirled around, her hand at her throat, at the sound of Erik\u0027s voice. \"Where is he? Where\u0027s my brother? What have you done to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t done anything to him. He\u0027s downstairs, still unconscious. I don\u0027t imagine he\u0027ll be waking up anytime soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy stared at Erik, hurt and confused, trembling now. She hated him because he was a vampire, because one of his kind had almost killed Alex and yet, if it wasn\u0027t for Erik\u0027s vampire blood, Alex would be dead now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-23.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
