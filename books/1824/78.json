Alec, Jordan, and Noah were also watching.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam walked closer. \"What\u0027s Dan worrying about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dan\u0027s the old roommate, right?\" Noah asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam answered, \"Yes. He watched out for Allison while she lived with him and another guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison asked, \"Were all of you listening in on my phone conversation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was on the phone with my wife, so I only caught a little of it,\" Alec said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we listened,\" Jordan said. \"As soon as I heard you say hello, I decided to eavesdrop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t-,\" Allison began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course we shouldn\u0027t. It\u0027s rude,\" Jordan said. \"So, what did Dan say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he worried about?\" Noah wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, really. Dan tends to overreact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam wouldn\u0027t let her evade the question. \"Allison, what\u0027s he worried about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re starting to irritate me, Liam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer me.\" There was a sharp edge to his voice this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew he wouldn\u0027t stop. He was determined to get his way, and she wasn\u0027t in the mood to fight, especially in front of the others. She repeated the conversation she\u0027d had with Dan, and the second she finished, Liam said, \"I\u0027m going with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to come along, too,\" Noah said. \"Maybe I can move some things around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec nodded. \"I wish I could be there. I\u0027d like to watch the presentation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you wouldn\u0027t,\" Allison argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec grinned. \"I really would, but I\u0027ll be back in Chicago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to be in Dallas Monday, so I can\u0027t go,\" Jordan said. \"I wish I could be there. Since you\u0027ve been working on this program for so long, I\u0027m guessing you\u0027ve built in a way to stop someone from stealing your work. You have, haven\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison nodded. \"The software isn\u0027t complete. Brett isn\u0027t smart enough to know that. I\u0027m sure he thinks he has it all figured out, but he doesn\u0027t. It isn\u0027t possible until I add more code. It\u0027s intricate.\" She could have answered in more detail, but the only one who would have understood was Jordan, so she spared the men a long explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison appreciated their support, but she didn\u0027t want to discuss her retaliation against Brett just yet, so before they could ask anything more, she said, \"I have to move my car. I thought I was driving to Nathan\u0027s Bay, so I parked in a one-hour-only spot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your apartment is close. Drive home and I\u0027ll follow you,\" Liam offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeciding his was a sensible alternative, she acquiesced. After he transferred her overnight bag to his car, they were on their way. As usual, traffic was horrible, but Allison had figured out various side streets to take that cut her drive time in half. She parked in her slot in the underground garage, made sure the car doors were locked, and then got into Liam\u0027s car. They didn\u0027t talk much on their way out of town because Liam kept getting one call after another, all work related. His voice was tense. Something he didn\u0027t like was going on, and she wondered if he ever truly broke free from his work and his responsibilities. There was no doubt he was a workaholic. She recognized this in him because she was one herself. Both of their jobs were important, but his sent him around the world on missions that had a powerful impact on people\u0027s lives. She could sense the heavy burden it placed on his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge to Nathan\u0027s Bay was in front of them, and just as Allison was beginning to think she would make the best of the awkward situation and try to enjoy the weekend, she got a call from Not-So-Special Agent Phillips. He told her it was an emergency but promised it wouldn\u0027t take long. She translated that to mean she would be at the cyber unit until the middle of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate to ruin your evening,\" she said to Liam. \"I\u0027ll make Phillips send someone to drive me home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ll come in.\" He slowed the car to turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about fishing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer phone rang again. Assuming it was Phillips, she didn\u0027t bother to look at the caller ID. \"Yes,\" she answered, trying her best to sound pleasant, not surly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Jane was on the line. Allison cringed when she heard her caustic voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You listen to me. We need money, and after all we\u0027ve done for-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison stopped her. \"How did you get this number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know people who- Never mind. I expect you to cooperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave me the hell alone,\" she shouted. She disconnected the call, and let out a sigh of satisfaction. It felt good to shout. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-78.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
