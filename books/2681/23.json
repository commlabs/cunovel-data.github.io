delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby was no beauty, with her hooked nose and turned-up chin, but she was obviously a sex bomb, and Jim was reeling from the

bright-but she envied Ruby\u0027s lustful happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta was leaning on the piano with some pink cocktail in her hand, talking to three men who looked to be local residents rather than Finishing School types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed they had got over the shock of her German accent-no doubt she had told the story of her Liverpudlian father-and now she held them enthralled with tales about Hamburg nightclubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick could see they had no suspicions about Greta\u0027s gender: they were treating her like an exotic but attractive woman, buying her drinks and lighting her cigarettes and laughing in a pleased way when she touched them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Flick watched, one of the men sat at the piano, played some chords, and looked up at Greta expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bar went quiet, and Greta launched into \"Kitchen Man\":\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow that boy can open clams

finished, she kissed the pianist on the lips, and he looked thrilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaude left Paul and returned to Diana at the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain who had been talking to Denise now came over and said to Paul, \"She told me everything, sir.\" Flick nodded, disappointed but not surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul asked him, \"What did she say?\" \"That she\u0027s going in tomorrow night to blow up a railway tunnel at Marles, near Reims.\" It was the cover story, but Denise thought it was the truth, and she had revealed it to a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick was furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\" The captain
