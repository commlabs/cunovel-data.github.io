Under my hand, the railing turned ice-cold. I jerked away from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrenaline kicked in and I twisted, but the icy coating on the step caused me to lose my balance. I slipped, my knees cracking off the porch step. Hot pain shot down my legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold hand circled my bare ankle and yanked me back. I desperately tried to grasp the railing, but I lost my grip. I twisted onto my side and my cheek smacked against the board. Another burst of pain exploded across my face and lip. I sucked in a harsh breath, tasting blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark, thick tendrils of smoke wafted out, reaching me, slipping over my skin and chilling me to the bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… What the fuck could be happening now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had felt the presence of others seconds before I heard Serena’s shrill, panicked scream cut straight through me, triggering the part that was more monster than human. The part had been activated when I’d taken out the officers in the kitchen and it worked off the basest of instinct for my kind—the need to dominate, to kill, to feed, and to protect what was mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo protect what was mine… Rushing the door, I threw it open. My eyes scanned the night. Serena was nowhere, but her suitcase was at the bottom of the steps. But there were others—two of them in the driveway, one further down the road, but that was Dex, and another in the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow blurred across the driveway, coming to a halt at the bottom of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the shapeless mass, a form began to take shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds, a tall woman stood there. Her icy blond hair was loose over bare shoulders. The strapless halter she wore did very little to hide the swells of her breasts or her toned midsection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Jael, one of the three that had been by the gazebo the day Serena decided to take a little walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJael’s hips swayed with each step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer skirt climbed higher and higher, until I saw a thin strip of white lace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hunter,” she purred, her bloodred lips parting as she rolled her tongue around my name. “I think it’s long past the time we get to know each other on a personal level.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s your boy Raz?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a vapid smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat just leaves me and you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Colec,” I pointed out, referencing the other one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJael ran a hand down the valley of breasts and her stomach. “He likes to watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” I watched her prowl up the remaining steps. “I have something for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do?” She slinked up against me. “I like where this is heading.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped a hand around Jael’s throat. The female smiled. “I like it rough,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s great because it’s about to get really rough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJael’s eyes widened a fraction of an inch. I spun around, lifting her up in the air, tossing her over the railing. Stunned, the Arum didn’t drop the human form quick enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smacked off the hood of the Expedition below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing the railing, I propelled myself over it, landing below in a crouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head snapped up as Jael rolled off the hood and fell onto her knees, gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow launched over the SUV, heading straight for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sprung up, kicking off the grille of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinning around, I dodged the Arum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped, catching the mass of shadows, driving Colec into the ground. Gravel spewed into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have time for this,” I growled, tightening my hold on the Arum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRearing up, I slammed my hand into the center of the Arum’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColec’s eyes went wide and his mouth dropped open. A watery gurgle escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yanked my arm back and smiled. The moonlight caught and reflected off the silver handle and the deep red of the blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Obsidian.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arum shuddered and its skin rippled like a stirred-up wave. Energy pulsed and then, as I pushed off, the Arum broke apart, shattered into a thousand fragments that floated up into the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bastard!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJael shrieked. “How could you kill with one of those things? Is that how you fight? You weak piece of human-loving shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to kill you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJael slipped into her true form. I’M GOING TO RIP YOUR BALLSSS OFF AND FEED THEM TO YOUR ASSS UNTIL YOU BEG ME TO LET YOU LIVE. THEN I WILL FEED YOUR DICK TO THAT human bitch asss Raz— I threw the obsidian dagger. It spun through the air as fast as a bullet, striking true. The dagger embedded deep into Jael’s chest, cutting off her tirade. She let loose a scream that blasted my eardrums. A second later she fragmented, joining Colec in the great unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwiping the dagger off the ground, I reached around, slipping the blade into its leather holster along my back. It seared my skin when I wore it, but the pain was nothing compared to what I was going to do to Raz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tore through the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me no time to find the bastard, and when I did, rage rose from deep inside me. He was on top of her and between her legs, in his true form. Her heels were digging into the dirt as she slammed her fists into his sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLurching forward, I yanked the son of a bitch off her and tossed him aside. My gaze fastened on her wide eyes and bloodied face before sweeping down, seeing her torn shirt and the unbuttoned jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new feeling assaulted me as I realized what Raz had been trying to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to where the Arum picked himself up, I knew I was going to thoroughly enjoy killing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was right up in his face, grabbing him around his inky black throat. I threw him into the nearby tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe resounding crack sent birds shrieking into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShooting forward, I slammed my fist into Raz’s face, but the fucker recovered, pushing me back several feet. Edges began to blur as tiny wisps of black smoke inked out from his shoulders, spreading behind it like wings. He rushed me like a missile, and then I jumped, letting the change take over. Arms out to my side, I spun and my body morphed, my mass expanding and spreading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit was about to get real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBranches shook and stretched toward where I was, and Raz came straight at me. We twisted in the air, slicing through the branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hit the ground, both in our true forms, exchanging blows like we were in a cage match. This wasn’t just about killing Raz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was about obliterating him for daring to touch Serena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn animalistic, brutal fury had taken hold in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI punched Raz, snapping his head back. He fell but quickly regained his footing. Then he charged me once more. Grabbing hold of him, I took him into the air, but at the last moment, he twisted and we went flying back to Earth. Taking the brunt of the impact that was so fierce that it knocked Serena onto her ass, I was momentarily immobile as we skidded across the ground, digging up dirt and bushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoil flew everywhere, thickening the air. When we came to a stop, we had dug a ditch several feet long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaz sprang off me, heading for Serena again. I powered to my feet, but before I could reach the jackass, Dex shot out from the stand of trees, slamming straight into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDex took Raz across the clearing, impaling him into a tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Dex backed off, because he knew somehow. Maybe it was the instinct of our kind. He left Raz for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped in front of Raz and a moment passed. He lifted his head and roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struck like lightning. My fist hit Raz’s chest and then went through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanking my arm back, something long and inky came with it. I ripped his spine straight out from him and watched as Raz folded into himself like crumpled paper. No more than a second passed before the body shuddered and broke apart, pieces floating into the sky and then fading out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the silence that followed, I staggered a step back, body aching from the fight and the need that always seemed to follow something so bloody. Usually I needed a woman or my hand, but not now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed Serena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to her, lust punched me in the gut harder than any blow Raz managed to land. Getting to her and then getting inside her was all I could think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSSSLOW IT DOWN, BROTHER.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDex’s voice whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really didn’t understand him, or I didn’t care, because I took a step toward Serena. When I got to her, I was going to— Serena took a shaky step back, her hands spasming around the edges of her torn shirt. I moved closer and the color of panic swirled around her. She careened around me, her eyes darting from Dex to me, and it was in that moment that I realized I was still in my true form and was probably scaring the ever-loving crap out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lust eased off, surprisingly, as another need rose swiftly: a desire to comfort her. It seemed too little too late, because Serena took off running toward the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught sight of Dex and he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCursing myself, I tracked her easily, finding her on her knees near the edge of the woods. The lights of the cabin flickered between the thick branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped and took my human form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Serena.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her head, letting out a shaky breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I might have lost a little bit of my mind back there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt, close but not touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s understandable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting back, she eased her legs out from underneath her. “Aliens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “I think it’s finally really sinking in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAliens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I prefer the term extraterrestrial,” said Dex from behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena scrambled to her feet and stumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught her around the shoulders, steadying her before she hurt herself further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s not going to harm you.” There was an odd gentleness to my voice as my hands trailed off her shoulders. “He’s a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is Dex.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed to relax a little, but didn’t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDex slipped his hands into his jean pockets and rocked back on his heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Extraterrestrial just sounds cooler.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” she whispered, and then said louder, “you guys are like the friendly neighborhood alien watch around here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDex laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I said, completely serious. “We’re usually the opposite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at us. “That’s reassuring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s Hunter,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDex said, smiling. “A pillar of support.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed and then I turned to Serena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember how I said shit was about to get a lot crazier? Well, it did, and that’s not even what I was talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was marginally surprised when Serena seemed to pull herself together. Then again, I wasn’t giving her enough credit. The female was tough as tungsten, but given how quiet she was as the three of us walked back to the cabin, which was so unlike her, I half expected her to freak out and start running again. So I kept an eye on her, and something about the way she kept her arms wrapped around her, making her appear smaller than she was, more vulnerable and fragile, made me want to hold her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in front of the cabin, I took in what Dex had brought me. “I thought I told you something inconspicuous?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDex smirked as he ran his hand over the hood of the midnight blue Porsche. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsession/page-29.html","bookId":1666,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM"}
