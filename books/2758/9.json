I can\u0027t believe that just happened, actually. I bared myself to someone for the first time in forever and she stomped on it. I don\u0027t know who I\u0027m madder at - her for rejecting me or me for putting myself out there for her to reject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut either way, fuck her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jam my keys in the ignition and turn the volume up. Hard rock vibrates my chest as the bass rumbles and I tear out of the parking lot and toward the highway to Chicago. Since I\u0027m in a bad mood anyway, I might as well get this over with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe highway stretches in front of me and the loud music calms me as I drive. I lose myself in it, actually. I allow it to numb me, to absorb the negative thoughts. I almost reach for my vial, which is safely ensconced in my jacket, but I don\u0027t. I told myself that I wouldn\u0027t, not for a while, and I won\u0027t. I\u0027m not weak. And I\u0027m not a pussy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the miles are absorbed by my rearview mirror, the sky swallows the road in the horizon bit by bit until I\u0027m finally crossing the bridge into Chicago and onto the Skyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I arrive at my dad\u0027s downtown office, I have managed to put my agitation away, to tuck the image of Mila\u0027s face far away in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause fuck her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have the urge to punch a wall, but I don\u0027t. Instead, I make my way to the eighteenth floor and my father\u0027s receptionist lets him know that I am here. I make myself comfortable in his sitting area, taking a mint out of a bowl and popping it into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes are closed when my father finally appears twenty minutes later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pax, get your feet off of the furniture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice is tired and I open my eyes. He looks older since I saw him last quarter. His dark hair is just beginning to gray at the temples, and he has lines around his eyes. And his mouth. His navy blue suit seems to hang a bit on him, like he lost weight and hasn\u0027t taken the time to have his clothing altered. I stare at him, amazed at the idea that my father is growing old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I yank my feet off of the table in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" I mumble. My father nods and leads me to his big office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit in a chair in front of him and wait until he slides a few papers across his desk toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t even read them, I simply sign my name. I trust him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should always read anything that you sign your name on,\" he admonishes me for what seems like the hundredth time regarding this subject. And for the hundredth time, I reply in the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, when it\u0027s a stranger. But you\u0027re my father. I know you aren\u0027t going to fuck me over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad sighs again. \"Can you at least try to watch your language? It\u0027s the respectful thing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" I mutter again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Christ\u0027s sake. He acts like I\u0027m a child. But that\u0027s part of our problem. Our relationship will always be frozen in his head- back to a time when I was a child and he was the adult. He doesn\u0027t seem to understand that we\u0027re both adults now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander Holdings had an exceedingly good quarter,\" my dad remarks, taking back the papers and shuffling them. \"So your income has increased this time. You really might want to consider investing. You\u0027re twenty-four years old. It\u0027s time to grow your portfolio. And maybe take an interest in your family\u0027s company. Your grandfather has contacted me, wanting to know how to reach you. He\u0027s an old man, Pax. He won\u0027t be around much longer. He wants to know that his company is in good hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him, fighting the urge to curl my lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want anything to do with the business,\" I tell my father. \"I don\u0027t agree with anything they stand for. As far as I\u0027m concerned, I\u0027ll hire a CEO to run the place after he finally kicks it. And as far as my grandfather goes, it\u0027s his fault that he\u0027s all alone. He basically disowned me when we moved away. He\u0027s got himself to blame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father\u0027s eyes glaze over and he turns to stare out his window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pax, your grandfather wasn\u0027t the same after your mother died. None of us were. You can\u0027t hold that against him. When we moved, he felt like he was losing you too, and you were the last connection that he had with your mother. Since your grandma died so long ago, you and Susanna were all he had. When he lost her and then you, he felt like he lost everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet he didn\u0027t have to lose me,\" I spit angrily. \"His fucking temper is what caused him to lose me. He chose to be angry and cut off contact. I was just a kid. I didn\u0027t even choose to move. You did. But he took it out on me. So, as far as I\u0027m concerned, he can rot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father stares at me, his gaze thoughtful as he temples his fingers in front of him. Finally he sighs and nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I can understand your feelings. Your grandfather is a formidable man. And stubborn. He used to make your mom want to pull her hair out sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now his eyes really do glaze over as he thinks about my mom, lost in his memories. If there was ever anyone who didn\u0027t get over her death, it was most certainly my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, you look like you aren\u0027t eating right,\" I tell him, pulling him from his thoughts and back into the present with me. He doesn\u0027t look happy about it, either. He prefers to live in a world made from memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, shaking away my concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine, Pax. Just stressed about some big cases that I\u0027m handling. How are you doing? Are you pulling things together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, am I still using?\" I stare at him harshly. I mean, fuck. If you have a question, just ask it. Don\u0027t beat around the bush. Dad nods, tired again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Yes. Are you still using?\" He asks the question haltingly, as if the words taste bitter in his mouth. And he doesn\u0027t really want to know the answer, I can tell. He thinks I\u0027m a fucking addict who can\u0027t quit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s fucking annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I haven\u0027t used,\" I tell him, rolling my eyes. \"I said I wasn\u0027t going to and I\u0027m not. Not the hard shit, anyway. I\u0027m not an addict, dad. Seriously. I use it because I like it. Not because I have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father stares at me with his best hardened attorney gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That might be so,\" he tells me. \"But eventually, when a person keeps using, they become addicted. You\u0027re pushing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever, dad,\" I sigh, pushing away from his desk and standing up. \"It\u0027s been good to see you. I\u0027ll see you next quarter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stalk out, away from his disapproving stare and his doubts. What he doesn\u0027t understand is that if you constantly expect the worst from someone, that\u0027s probably what you\u0027re going to get. He should have learned that by now. I\u0027ve certainly shown him time and time again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am headed back toward the Skyway when I decide to take a quick detour, into a seedy little bar that I know of. I\u0027ve had to stop there numerous times after heated visits with the old man. The bartender knows me and calls out a greeting when I enter. I never can remember his name. Dave? Dan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make my way across the dingy room, glancing around at the split vinyl seats and dark walls. This place hasn\u0027t changed. It still has a hole in the paneling back by the pool table where somebody punched it and it still smells like piss and old grease. It\u0027s not what you would call upscale, but it\u0027s perfect for drinking away a bad mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod at the bartender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have a Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender nods back and fills a tumbler with the dark golden liquid, sliding it towards me. It sloshes a bit onto the bar, but he\u0027s not concerned. Cleanliness isn\u0027t exactly his highest priority. You can tell that by his stained shirt and greasy hair. But that doesn\u0027t bother me. The whiskey will taste the same regardless of the bartender\u0027s personal hygiene habits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he can attempt to talk with me, he\u0027s distracted by another customer, a dirty old man who is clearly far too drunk. I watch with interest as the bartender tries to cut him off, then just gives up and pours him another drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, big fella. I\u0027m Amber.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare down at the big-busted woman who has just slid up to me. She\u0027s got bar whore written all over her, from her extremely tight jeans that exhibit camel toe to her garish overly done makeup. Her tits are practically busting out of her top because it\u0027s three sizes too small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cock an eyebrow and take a gulp of whiskey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big fella? The 1940\u0027s called. They want their phrase back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmber throws her bleached blonde head back and laughs as though it is the funniest thing she\u0027s ever heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m from Iowa. I guess we still talk that way back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charming.\" I knock back the rest of my drink and motion for another. I look at Amber. \"Would you like one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figure it\u0027s the polite thing to do, even though I\u0027m not much in the mood for company. She nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love one.\" She looks up at the bartender. \"Dan, can you make it two?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan the bartender. I\u0027ve got to remember that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027m sure I won\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmber slides her hand up my thigh. \"Thanks for the drink. But if you don\u0027t want me to call you big fella, you\u0027ve got to tell me your name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eye her, at the way her eyes are already dilated because she\u0027s already had a few too many. \"Do I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe examines me for a moment, before she laughs. It\u0027s a slutty laugh. A fake one. I almost shudder, but don\u0027t. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong with me. This is an easy woman who is mine for the taking. If I wanted to take her, that is, but I find that I really don\u0027t. And I think I do know what\u0027s wrong with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila Hill is in my head, wholesome and sweet. But I\u0027ll be fucking damned if I let her invade my life when she doesn\u0027t even want me in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knock back my glass of Jack and signal for one more. I knock that one back too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA comforting sense of calm descends upon me, the familiar numbness that I love so much. When all else fails, the obscurity prevails. I almost laugh at my deep thinking, but instead, I reach over and grasp Amber\u0027s thick thigh, enjoying the fleshy feel of her leg in my fingers. If this chick wants me, she can have me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I do what I always do. I block out logical thought with drugs or women. In this case, a bar slut and Jack Daniels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with me,\" I whisper into her ear. Amber smiles knowingly and nods. She clings to my hand as we pick our way through the dirty bar, down the dingy back hall and into the women\u0027s bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom is exactly how I figured it would be - disgusting. A single light bulb hangs from the yellowed ceiling, casting a dubious light around the small room. There is evidence of puke on the sides of the toilet, the tiles are grimy and the walls look as though they haven\u0027t been washed since 1969. But it doesn\u0027t matter. I lock the door behind us and turn to Amber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reaches for me and I let her, sliding my hand up her thigh and under her tight shirt, gripping her fat tit. I squeeze it hard and she moans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeeze it harder and she moans again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to roll my eyes at this stupid game. I know what\u0027s going to happen because I\u0027ve played it a thousand times before. She\u0027s going to pretend to enjoy anything that I do, and I\u0027ll pretend not to know it\u0027s fake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut who gives a fuck? Pussy is pussy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull a condom from my wallet and rip it open with my teeth, but discover a problem. I\u0027m not hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suck me,\" I tell Amber. And then I smile charmingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles back and immediately drops to her knees on the dirty floor, her head bobbing. It\u0027s not long before I\u0027m hard enough for the condom, in spite of myself. I slide it on, help Amber to her feet and turn her away from me. And then I enter her from behind, with no preamble, no foreplay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t seem to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moans as if my dick is the best she\u0027s ever had. I close my eyes and picture all of the porn scenes I\u0027ve ever watched, all of the tits and ass and masturbation and shower scenes. But something is off. The smell in here is putrid, I\u0027m tired, I\u0027m pissed. Things aren\u0027t coming easily tonight and I know that having an orgasm isn\u0027t going to be easy, particularly with whiskey-dick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I picture Mila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd immediately, I feel a gush of warmth. I picture her small waist, her lush hips. Her full lips. Her soft tits. Her feminine smell, clean and floral. It immediately floods life into my dick and I\u0027m back in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I envision Mila, I bang Amber hard and I hear her forehead thumping against the dirty tiled walls. She allows it because, like me, she doesn\u0027t feel like she deserves anything more than this... this dirty fuck in a dirty bar bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s pathetic on both our parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picture Mila again, and then for some reason, it stops working. It\u0027s doesn\u0027t feel right. Amber isn\u0027t Mila. And even thinking of Mila while I\u0027m in this pathetic place with this pathetic chick feels wrong on a hundred different levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull out abruptly and Amber turns to look at me in confusion. Her eye makeup is smeared from sweat. In fact, I can smell the sweat from here and I fight the urge to shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not you, it\u0027s me,\" I tell her. \"Whiskey dick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a lie, but it doesn\u0027t matter. She nods knowingly, as if she encounters this problem all of the time. She pats my shoulder sympathetically, as if I give a flying fuck what she thinks about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I smile as if I\u0027m grateful for her understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI toss the condom into the trash and walk out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I do, I hand Dan the bartender a twenty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To cover her drinks the rest of the night,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan smiles. \"Sure thing. See you next time!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and make my way into the parking lot, collapsing into Danger. My car is familiar and comfortable and I feel calmer now that I\u0027m in it. I rest my head against the seat and inhale the leather smell and the fresh air. It\u0027s so much better than the stale, smoky air in the bar. And then I drive home with the windows open and my music blaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road is black and long as it flies beneath my car, but I am home before I know it. Before I am even ready, actually. I stand in my driveway and face the dark house, and for the first time, I have the feeling that I don\u0027t want to go in, simply because it is so empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiving alone is great, but sometimes it is just so fucking lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand still for a moment, my hands dangling at my sides, before I head back to my car. I\u0027ve still got agitation to burn, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know why I head to the Bear\u0027s Den, the little bar in town. I know that Jill is probably there or her other bar whore friends, and if I want to spend time with them, I\u0027ll call them. I don\u0027t want them hanging on me when I\u0027m not in the mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m definitely not in the mood for that tonight. I just want to walk in, draw up a seat at the bar and be around people, without actually having to interact with them. Is that so much to ask? I\u0027m not in the mood for bar whores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nose my car into a parking slot and slam the door, taking a deep breath of the night air as I walk inside. It\u0027s the last clean breath I\u0027ll get once I cross the smoky threshold of the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk in and glance through the smoky haze that floats through the dim room. Locals sit and chat, while others play pool or darts in the back. I know their faces, but not their names. I\u0027m not much of a socializer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue to form, Jill is here. I see her situated in the back, perched on the edge of a table, her half-naked ass shoved into some poor sap\u0027s face. So much for her promise to get help. Quite honestly, now that I know she has kids at home, all I feel is disgust for her. What a waste of oxygen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe notices me looking at her and her heavily made-up face lights up and she practically leaps from her table to come to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I shake my head, mouthing the word No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks startled, then hurt, as she stops in her tracks. I turn my back and head for the bar. As I sit down on a stool, I can see from my periphery that she sat back down at her table. I can feel her wounded gaze, but I don\u0027t look at her. I think my time with her is over. Someone else can be her supplier and contribute toward her wasted life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know the bartender\u0027s name here, because he wears it on his nametag. I guess that makes it easier for the drunks to remember. Or people who don\u0027t really give a shit. Like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Mickey,\" I greet him. \"I\u0027ll have a Jack. Double, neat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMickey nods, a wiry guy who looks like he\u0027s seen better days and more than his share of bar fights. He\u0027s got a scar running from his ear to his chin. I\u0027ve never asked him how he got it, and he\u0027s never offered to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How you doin\u0027, Tate?\" he asks as he sets the whiskey in front of me. I pick up the glass, drain it in one gulp and thump it back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better now,\" I tell him. \"I\u0027ll take another. In fact, just keep \u0027em coming tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, pouring one and then heads down to help someone else. I take a small gulp from my glass and set it down, closing my eyes. It feels good to be surrounded by people, but still lost in them. No one will approach me other than Jill and I shut her down already. I\u0027m alone here, but it\u0027s less lonely than it is at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeminine giggling invades my hearing and my eyes pop open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I know that laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn in my seat to find Mila and her sister stumbling from the hallway leading to the bathroom. It looks like they are holding each other up and I roll my eyes. You\u0027ve got to be kidding me. I run into her even here? This was the last place I would have expected to find her. She and her sister both look as out of place in this little hole as they can possibly get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila glances up and stops, her giggle dying on her lips as she recognizes me. Her eyes widen and she looks like she wants to come over to me, to possibly say something. But her sister is pulling on her arm, and even though Mila looks over her shoulder at me, she allows Madison to steer her away. I\u0027m pretty sure Madison is moving her away from me on purpose and I clench my jaw. Mila\u0027s an adult. She can make her own decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that her decisions are always wise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI come to this realization very quickly as she and Madison rejoin a couple of local guys who are playing darts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe darts aren\u0027t the problem, the guys are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes again. What the hell does Mila think she\u0027s doing? Either one of those guys would eat her for breakfast. She probably thinks she\u0027s safe because she\u0027s most likely known them her whole life. But they are both snakes. I\u0027ve seen them with a million women in this very bar, none of them twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and drain my glass, signaling for another. It\u0027s not my problem. She made that clear when she said I wasn\u0027t a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo fuck her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn away as I watch one of them wrap his meaty paw around her slender waist and pull her close, supposedly showing her how to properly throw the dart. It makes me want to hurl so I turn my back to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do everything I can to ignore them. I make small-talk with Mickey. I watch ESPN on the overhead TV. I close my eyes and listen to the conversation around me. And even though I know that it would be much easier to just get up and leave, something in me wants to stay. Something in me thinks I need to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t explain it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I realize the reason in a sudden rush of clarity. I\u0027m staying because I think she\u0027ll need me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly shit, what kind of idiot am I? I slam my glass down on the table and toss some bills on the bar. I head to the bathroom to take a leak before I go, but then I\u0027m out of here. She\u0027s made it clear what she wants. And it isn\u0027t me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I come back out, Madison is already at the door of the bar with one of the guys. She\u0027s leaning into him, laughing into his ear. She\u0027s clearly very drunk. I shake my head and fight the urge to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s one thing when a bar whore goes home with random men. Bar whores know exactly what they\u0027re doing. They\u0027re giving something for getting something, be it drugs or drinks or even just attention. It\u0027s a conscious decision. But Madison isn\u0027t a bar whore and that jackass is taking advantage of her. But it\u0027s not my place to interfere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil I see Mila grab her purse and stumble toward the door. The guy she\u0027s with tags along at her heels and she turns to grab onto him, unsteady on her feet. He laughs, his hand brushing her perfect ass as he steadies her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy blood boils. And since I\u0027m already on my way out the door, I can\u0027t do anything other than trail behind them, something that causes my blood to burn even hotter. Fuck this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stumble out and I even hold the door open as Mila\u0027s jacket gets caught on the handle. Her eyes meet mine, and hers are blurry and unfocused. She\u0027s in no condition to be choosing a bedmate. My gut clenches, but I keep my mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made her choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made her choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made her choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI repeat it in my head, as if it will make it an easier pill to swallow. It doesn\u0027t. It still pisses me off. I step outside and turn to walk to my car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear their voices behind me, fading into the distance. Mila is laughing, the guy is talking to her, low and deep. As I turn to open my car door, I glance in their direction. They are standing next to what must be the guy\u0027s car because he\u0027s opened the passenger side door, but Mila is trying to shake his hand instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause and watch. Mila is slurring her words by now, but she is definitely trying to shake this guy\u0027s hand. And say goodnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA feeling of satisfaction wells up in me before I can stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil the guy smiles like a piranha and pushes Mila against the car, where he shoves against her and sticks his tongue down her throat. His hands are all over and she is pushing at him, struggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she cries out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see an explosion of red and I close the gap between us in three strides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yank the guy off of her and slam him onto the ground. Before I can think or breathe, I stomp on his hand as he grasps for my leg. His bones crunch and he howls in pain, clutching his broken hand to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila gasps, her eyes wide, as she huddles against the car. As my attention is on her, the guy kicks at my leg, connecting with my knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck. But I don\u0027t feel it with all the adrenaline pumping through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kicks again, but this time, I see it coming and move. He only connects with air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you, man,\" he slurs. \"Fucking prick. This isn\u0027t your business. You broke my fucking hand, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is scrambling to get up now and I put my boot on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" I tell him, as he tries to grab at me. \"You\u0027re lucky that\u0027s all I broke. The next time a woman tells you no, stop whatever the fuck it is that you\u0027re doing. Now go home and sleep it off. And don\u0027t come near Mila again. If you do, I will break your dick off and feed it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drunk guy glares up at me. \"What the fuck is your problem? You don\u0027t know what she wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to Mila, my foot still firmly planted in the guy\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mila, do you want to see this guy again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you have it,\" I tell him calmly, removing my foot. \"Get the fuck out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you, man,\" he mutters as he struggles to his feet. \"I don\u0027t need this. Fuck that slut, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when I punch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHard. In the side of head. He goes down like a bag of rocks. Mila gasps and I shake my head, bending to make sure he\u0027s still breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is, so I turn to Mila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on. Let\u0027s get you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you do that?\" she whispers, her eyes frozen on the unconscious asshole on the pavement. \"Jared didn\u0027t mean to hurt me. He was just drunk. I\u0027ve known him for a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her as I walk to her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no idea what he meant to do. Trust me. It wasn\u0027t good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take her arm and lead her to my car, opening the door and tucking her into the passenger seat before I strap her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0027m getting into the driver\u0027s seat, Mila is rummaging through her purse. She looks up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-oh,\" she says quietly. \"I can\u0027t find my keys. My apartment is locked. Can you take me to Maddy\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words are seriously slurred by this point. It sounded more like she said I cent fine my keel. Miz part is lock. Cent you take me to Man\u0027s? I shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re seriously fucked up,\" I tell her. \"You\u0027re probably going to get sick soon. And I don\u0027t think your sister is going home. I\u0027ll take you to my house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widen and she shakes her head. \"Pax, no. It\u0027s not a good idea. I don\u0027t trust myself around you.\" Her words are completely garbled of course, but I can make them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI startle and stare at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t trust yourself around me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head pathetically, then leans her head on the cool window glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I can\u0027t let you break my heart. I don\u0027t have much of it left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gut clenches yet again, something that it seems to do a lot of when I\u0027m around her. I ram the key in the ignition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" I tell her. \"I won\u0027t be breaking your heart tonight. You can sleep it off in my bed. I\u0027ll take the couch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, her face planted firmly against the window and I know that she\u0027s not long for the conscious world. And I\u0027m right. By the time we reach my house a scant five minutes later, she has passed out in the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her for a minute, at her shiny dark hair, her tight jeans, her full breasts, which I can just barely see through the opening of her jacket. Her lips puff out with each little breath that she exhales in her passed out state. She\u0027s going to feel this tomorrow. If she hadn\u0027t been so stupid, I\u0027d feel sorry for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scoop her out of the car and carry her to the house, trying to ignore the soft way she melts into my body, and the way her head leans against my shoulder. She can\u0027t weigh more than a hundred pounds soaking wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set her on my bed, pull off her boots and cover her up. I drag my bathroom trashcan next to her, just in case, and then sit in a chair and watch her for a bit. I have no idea if she\u0027s going to wake up and be sick or if she\u0027s definitely passed out for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remains still and quiet, with a little snore erupting from her every once in a while. I can\u0027t help but smile just a bit over that. I\u0027m guessing she would be embarrassed to know that she\u0027s snoring, even though it\u0027s actually cute as hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m fucking tired and I could easily sleep right here in this chair, but I know that if she wakes up and finds me here, it might be startling, particularly in the dark. So I head downstairs and find that once again, I\u0027m just not ready to sleep. I\u0027m worked up now, from all of the shit at the bar and by the fact that Mila is in my bed at this very moment. Alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m downstairs. Alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd my hand hurts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFucking A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab a baggie of ice for my hand and a bottle of whiskey from my garage and make my way out to the beach behind my house. I drop onto a chair and stare up at the stars as I listen to the rhythmic crash of the waves. I take a gulp of the liquid fire. I feel the warmth all the way into my belly and I take another swig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fall asleep humming a song that I don\u0027t know the words to or even where it came from. The last conscious thought I have is that the night is so very, very black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes, or days, or years pass before something wakes me. Time has run together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pax,\" the soft voice murmurs, intruding upon my sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for a minute, just a scant minute, it seems like it might be my mother. In the blur of sleep, the voice has the same soft timbre as hers. But it can\u0027t be. Even in sleep, I know that. It\u0027s only the wishful thinking that comes from that grayish, half-awake place. It isn\u0027t my mother. I know that before I even open my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027m surprised, when I do, to find Mila standing in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seems uncertain, but she\u0027s so fucking beautiful in the morning sun. Radiant, actually. She doesn\u0027t seem hung-over at all. Her dark hair is loose and flowing and the morning breeze carries her scent to me. I inhale it and stare at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing out here?\" I ask groggily. I squint into the light, then rub my forehead. As I do, I wince because my fucking hand hurts. And then I realize that I must have fallen asleep here. The night air made my throat scratchy, so I clear it, then clear it again. \"Are you feeling alright?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance down and find that my bottle of whiskey is beside me on the beach, its contents spilled onto the sand. I think. I certainly hope I hadn\u0027t drunk the whole thing. If I did, I\u0027m going to feel it later today, just like Mila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila looks even more uncertain now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... uh.\" She shifts her weight from one foot to the other nervously. I look at her and cock an eyebrow. \"I feel fine. Mostly. My mouth is dry and I have a headache. I don\u0027t, um. I don\u0027t remember exactly what all happened last night. But I sort of remember that you punched Jared and brought me here. And I think you might have broken his hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eye her. \"Yeah, that happened. Do you make a habit of getting trashed at the Bear\u0027s Den and going home with assholes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came out a little harsher than I meant for it to and Mila flinches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she answers quickly. \"In fact, I don\u0027t usually drink much at all, unless it is wine at dinner. Maddy has been bugging me to go out with her and blow the cogs off and after yesterday, I just felt like I needed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her with interest now, my lip twitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you mean cobwebs. And what about yesterday? When you rejected me, you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColor floods her cheeks and she stares at the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that was stressful for you, then did you ever think that maybe you made a mistake? That maybe you shouldn\u0027t have rejected me? And that maybe you should give this thing a chance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her, trying to force her to meet my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I prompt. \"Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifts her chin, her green eyes bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all I\u0027ve thought about since you left my shop yesterday,\" she admits. \"All I can think of is you. Even when I was with Madison and Jared last night. And then when you were there at the bar, it was all I could do to keep from running over and jumping in your lap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cock my head. \"Why didn\u0027t you? I think I would have enjoyed that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushes again, her cheeks and neck flushing prettily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it might be considered socially inappropriate,\" she replies wryly. \"Thank you for coming to my rescue last night. I guess we\u0027re even now. I saved you, then you saved me back.\" She pauses and looks at the ground before she looks back up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I have been thinking about you. It\u0027s probably not smart or good for me, but it\u0027s all I seem to do lately. I think about you. Is your apology still on the table from yesterday? Because if it is, then I think maybe you were right. Maybe this is worth taking a risk for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fidgets with her hands nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise an eyebrow, deliberately obtuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This? Can you be more specific?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t answer. She just bends down without hesitation and kisses me square on the mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lips that I fantasized about last night are on mine, her tongue in my mouth. I know that I taste like whiskey and smokes, but I don\u0027t care and she doesn\u0027t seem to either. She tastes like heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she pulls away and I can see that she is a bit breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, was that a yes?\" she asks hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head in bewilderment and smile at her. Having her here like this is fucking amazing. And surprising. My chest is swelling with the amazing feeling so much that I can\u0027t believe my next words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a yes,\" I tell her. \"My apology is still on the table. But I think I probably owe you another one.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-9.html","bookId":2758,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:14 PM"}
