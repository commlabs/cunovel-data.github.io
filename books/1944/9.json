I recommended Cal Washburn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your trainer?\" Grace had met Cliff\u0027s trainer on a couple of occasions and liked him, although he was an intense man who seemed to see straight through her. It was unsettling. As she recalled, he spoke with a slight stutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff\u0027s mouth moved in the barest hint of a smile. \"Cal wasn\u0027t exactly keen on the idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s willing to volunteer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t say, but he\u0027s considering it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For someone who loves animals as much as you do...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile that had just begun now appeared full force. \"Are you trying to make me feel guilty so I\u0027ll agree to this, Grace Sherman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace smiled, too. \"Shamelessly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head again. \"I\u0027m too old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your name came up right away. Apparently you\u0027ve stirred up more interest than you realized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose you were the one who threw my name in the hat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff Harding was the last man she\u0027d recommend, and all because of her own self-interest. \"It wasn\u0027t me.\" She didn\u0027t like admitting it. \"Margaret White was the one who suggested you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged as if he didn\u0027t know the name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She works at the vet\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured in a way that implied he might recognize her but he wasn\u0027t sure. \"I\u0027ve probably seen her then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace couldn\u0027t imagine what was taking the hostess so long. She glanced into the dining areas, but the woman seemed to have disappeared after seating the two parties ahead of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Olivia and Jack are home,\" she said abruptly, trying to make conversation. The silence was unbearable. She couldn\u0027t stand next to this man without being reminded of the high price her Internet indiscretion had cost her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace hadn\u0027t seen Olivia so happy, not in years. At the same time, she seemed to be having a little trouble adjusting to married life. A couple of recent phone calls had left Grace feeling there was some stress between Olivia and Jack, although Olivia hadn\u0027t been complaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From what I hear, her ex has been visiting Cedar Cove quite a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace froze. When Stan found out that Olivia had decided to marry Jack, he\u0027d come to Grace, maudlin and sorry for himself. In a moment of loneliness, she\u0027d agreed to go to dinner with him. It\u0027d been another instance of bad judgment on her part. The last thing she wanted now was for Cliff to learn about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Stan knows he made a mistake,\" Grace said tentatively. If Cliff knew about her dinner with Stan, he wasn\u0027t letting on. \"People do that—make mistakes they later regret.\" Her eyes met his, pleading with him to realize how sorry she was. Silently she implored his forgiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff avoided eye contact. \"Stan learned that his regrets came too late, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff was telling Grace hers had, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terrible silence was back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlotte told me what you did for her and her friends,\" Cliff said next, as if he couldn\u0027t bear the silence either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace was furious every time she thought about Troy Davis arresting Charlotte and her group of elderly protestors. For heaven\u0027s sake, Ben Rhodes was a retired admiral! Troy should be ashamed of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlotte was trying to better our community. I felt the least we could do was support her efforts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff tried to hide his amusement by staring down at the carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s so funny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" he said, raising his eyes. That little smile quivered on his mouth. \"Remind me never to get on your bad side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was on his bad side, though, and the reminder instantly sobered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlotte was thrilled with the community support and she credits you with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t do much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You spread the word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace gave a careless shrug. \"It wasn\u0027t much,\" she said again. She hadn\u0027t phoned Cliff, couldn\u0027t bring herself to do it, but in retrospect she wished she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if reading her thoughts, he said. \"I would\u0027ve been there had I known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hostess reappeared just then. \"Sorry to keep you waiting.\" She automatically reached for two menus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff looked to Grace and she saw the indecision in his eyes. It would mean the world to her if he asked her to join him for lunch. She held his gaze as long as she dared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stiffened, and his resolve had obviously returned. \"Table for one,\" he said and walked away from Grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy McAfee hadn\u0027t been a private investigator for more than a few years, but he\u0027d been in law enforcement his entire career. He was retired from the Seattle police force; after a few months, however, he\u0027d thought he\u0027d go stir-crazy sitting around the house doing nothing. Soon after his move to Cedar Cove, he\u0027d hung out his shingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetirement wasn\u0027t for him. Some men took to it, got involved in hobbies and interests. That kind of life was too predictable for Roy. Nothing lured him faster than a good mystery, and he didn\u0027t mean one between the covers of a book, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFew mysteries had intrigued him more than what was happening right here in Cedar Cove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down at his desk and reached for Bob Beldon\u0027s file. If he reviewed the facts as they\u0027d unfolded, perhaps he\u0027d pick up on something he\u0027d overlooked before. He didn\u0027t think it was likely, but it wouldn\u0027t hurt to refresh his memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all started the night a stranger had arrived on the doorstep of the Beldons\u0027 Thyme and Tide Bed and Breakfast. By morning he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob Beldon had notified Troy Davis, and the coroner came for the body. Soon afterward, it was discovered that the man had undergone extensive plastic surgery and carried false identification. For a few weeks there\u0027d been a lot of speculation as to who he could be. Then silence—and things had died down for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the first, something about their guest had disturbed Beldon. Bob had experienced a recurring nightmare ever since his return from Vietnam. On occasion, he\u0027d been known to sleepwalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy stopped reading and leaned back in his chair, recalling his initial thoughts when Beldon had asked him for help. Davis had questioned Beldon for the second or third time and Bob had considered contacting an attorney, but hadn\u0027t. Instead he\u0027d come to Roy. Not too far into the conversation, Roy had realized that the other man was afraid he might have been responsible for the stranger\u0027s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy was quick to assure him otherwise, although he\u0027d wondered the same thing in the beginning. But Maxwell\u0027s door had been locked from the inside and there\u0027d been no sign of a struggle. The fact of the matter was that until recently, they couldn\u0027t be sure what had caused the other man\u0027s death. The autopsy had shown that his vital organs were in fine shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot long before Bob\u0027s appointment with Roy, Grace Sherman had come to him. A year earlier, her husband, Dan, had gone missing. When Dan didn\u0027t return, Grace had sought out Roy to help locate her husband. But every lead had been a dead end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnanswered questions didn\u0027t sit well with him, although he\u0027d shocked Grace with the few things he\u0027d unearthed. One of them was the matter of thirteen thousand dollars Dan had somehow managed to keep from her. Grace had no idea where Dan could\u0027ve found that kind of cash, which he\u0027d apparently used to buy a trailer. He\u0027d handed over his paycheck every Friday, regular as clockwork. Like most couples, they\u0027d apparently lived month to month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Dan\u0027s body had been discovered and with it a suicide note he\u0027d left for Grace. In his last letter to his wife, Dan had described an incident that had taken place during the Vietnam war. He and three others had been separated from their squadron, and they\u0027d stumbled into a village, which they feared was Viet-Cong controlled. Something had hap-. pened, and they\u0027d started firing and before the smoke cleared they\u0027d wiped out the entire village, according to Dan. They\u0027d massacred men, women and children. The event had forever marked him. He couldn\u0027t live with himself any longer. Or so the letter had indicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had been beside herself, not knowing what to do with the information. Roy was afraid he hadn\u0027t been much help. He couldn\u0027t really advise her; whatever became of these facts was her decision and hers alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly afterward, Beldon had repeated the story Dan had written about in his suicide note. He\u0027d mentioned Dan— they\u0027d been two of the four men wandering through that jungle. He\u0027d told Roy that afterward he and Dan hadn\u0027t seen each other for almost thirty years. When Bob had come home to Cedar Cove, they\u0027d completely avoided each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed too much of a coincidence that Roy would hear this grisly tale from two different people within such a short period of time. On a hunch, he\u0027d gone to Troy Davis and suggested the sheriff check out the other two men who\u0027d been with Dan and Beldon that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, one of the men—Maxwell Russell—had been reported missing. The unidentified body had turned out to be his. Why he\u0027d come to Cedar Cove and why he\u0027d carried false identification couldn\u0027t be explained, though, any more than his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot until later was it discovered that Max Russell had actually been murdered. Poisoned. There\u0027d been evidence in the water bottle found in Russell\u0027s rented vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Russell had been identified, his daughter had visited Cedar Cove to collect her father\u0027s ashes. Davis had set up a meeting between Hannah and the Beldons, and as a favor to Bob, Roy had been at the house when she came by with the sheriff. Roy learned then that Hannah\u0027s mother had died in a car accident, the same one that had badly burned her father. The burns were the reason for Max\u0027s plastic surgery and quite possibly why Bob hadn\u0027t recognized his old friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe circumstances surrounding the car crash led Roy to believe it hadn\u0027t been an accident. He\u0027d probably never be able to prove that. The accident report blamed Russell, but Hannah\u0027s father had insisted the steering had disconnected. There was nothing to verify his account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to Roy\u0027s office opened and his wife walked in with a tray of coffee and freshly baked cookies. Corrie seemed intent on fattening him up, not that he was making much of a fuss. He certainly wasn\u0027t turning down homemade cookies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me guess what you\u0027re reading.\" That know-it-all glint shone in her eyes. \"Could it possibly have something to do with the Beldon case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smarty pants,\" he said, grinning up at his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to solve this if it takes the rest of your life, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy was close to the answer; he could feel it. He didn\u0027t know what he\u0027d missed, if anything, but eventually his instincts would lead him where he had to go. All he needed was patience but that, unfortunately, seemed to be in short supply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorrie poured coffee into the mug, added cream and gave it to him. \"I get suspicious when you\u0027re this quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy leaned back in his chair, the mug in his hand. \"I\u0027m sifting all the facts through my brain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you still think the Beldons might be in some kind of danger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy didn\u0027t know how to answer. He shrugged. \"Two of the four men are dead. One was murdered and the other committed suicide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the fourth man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently Davis has talked to Colonel Stewart Samuels. He told me he didn\u0027t think Samuels is involved—but who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorrie looked down at the file and picked up the top sheet. \"It says here he\u0027s up for a Congressional Committee assignment. If news of what happened in Nam got out, it could be disastrous to his career, don\u0027t you think?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-9.html","bookId":1944,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM"}
