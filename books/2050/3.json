Wind was whipping the palm trees. Down by the breakwater two little girls were trying to surf waves whose faces were bumpy with wind chop and whose curls blew back over the crests like the hair of a sprinter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could calm down,\" Amy said. She was standing next to Kona, thinking, This guy\u0027s pecs are so cut you could stick business cards under them and they\u0027d stay. And my, is he tan. Where Amy came from, no one was tan, and she hadn\u0027t been in Hawaii long enough to realize that a good tan was just a function of showing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Supposed to stay like this for the next three days,\" Nate said. As disappointed as he appeared to be, he was extraordinarily relieved that they wouldn\u0027t be going out this morning. He had a rogue hangover, and his eyes were bloodred behind his sunglasses. Self-loathing had set in, and he thought, My life\u0027s work is shit, and if we went out there today and I didn\u0027t spend the morning retching over the side, I\u0027d be tempted to drown myself. He would rather have been thinking about whales, which is what he usually thought about. Then he noticed Amy sneaking glances at Kona\u0027s bare chest and felt even worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ya, mon. Kona can spark up a spliff and calm down that bumpy brine for all me new science dreadies. We can take the boat no matter what the wind be,\" Kona said. He was thinking, I have no idea what the hell I\u0027m talking about, but I really want to get out there with the whales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breakfast at Longee\u0027s, and then we\u0027ll see how it looks,\" Clay said. He was thinking, We\u0027ll have breakfast at Longee\u0027s, and then we\u0027ll see how it looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them moved. They just stood there, looking out at the blowout channel. Occasionally a whale would blow, and the mist would run over the water like a frightened ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m buying,\" Clay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they all headed up Front Street to Longee\u0027s restaurant, a two-story gray-and-white building, done in a New England architecture with shiplap siding and huge open windows that looked across Front Street, over the stone seawall, and out onto the Au\u0027 au Channel. By way of a shirt, Kona slipped on a tattered Nautica windbreaker he\u0027d had knotted around his waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do a lot of sailing?\" Amy asked, nodding to the Nautica logo. She intended the remark as dig, a return for Kona\u0027s saying, \"And who be this snowy biscuit?\" when they\u0027d first met. At the time Amy had just introduced herself, but in retrospect she realized that she should probably have taken some offense to being called both snowy and a biscuit\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;those things were objectifying, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shark bait kit, me Snowy Biscuit,\" Kona answered, meaning that the windbreaker had come from a tourist. The Paia surfing community on the North Shore, from which Kona had recently come, had an economy based entirely on petty theft, mostly smash-and-grabs from rental cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the host led them through the crowded dining room to a table by the windows, Clay leaned over Amy\u0027s shoulder and whispered, \"A biscuit is a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew that,\" Amy whispered back. \"Like a tomato, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heads up,\" Clay said, just as Amy plowed into a khaki package of balding ambition known as Jon Thomas Fuller, CEO of Hawaii Whale Inc., a nonprofit corporation with assets in the tens of millions that disguised itself as a research organization. Fuller had pushed his chair back to intercept Amy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jon Thomas!\" Clay smiled and reached around the flustered Amy to shake Fuller\u0027s hand. Fuller ignored Clay and took Amy by the waist, steadying her. \"Hey, hey, there,\" Fuller said. \"If you wanted to meet me, all you had to do was introduce yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy grabbed his wrists and guided his hands to the table in front of him, then stepped back. \"Hi, I\u0027m Amy Earhart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know who you are,\" said Fuller, standing now. He was only a little taller than Arny, very tan and very lean, with a hawk nose and a receding hairline like a knife. \"What I don\u0027t know is why you haven\u0027t come to see me about a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Nate, who had been thinking about whale song, had taken his seat, opened a menu, ordered coffee, and completely missed the fact that he was alone at the table. He looked up to see Jon Thomas Fuller holding his assistant by the waist. He dropped his menu and headed back to the site of the intercept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, partly\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Amy smiled at the three young women sitting at Fuller\u0027s table\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"partly because I have some self-respect\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;she curtsied\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"and partly because you\u0027re a louse and a jamoke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuller\u0027s dazzling grin dropped a level of magnitude. The women at his table, all dressed in khaki safari wear to approximate the Discovery Channel ideal of what a scientist should look like, made great shows of looking elsewhere, wiping their mouths, sipping water\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not noticing their boss getting verbally bitch-slapped by a vicious research pixie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nate,\" Fuller said, noticing that Nate had joined the group, \"I heard about the break-in at your place. Nothing important missing, I hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re fine. Lost some recordings,\" Nate said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, well, good. A lot of lowlifes on this island now.\" Fuller looked at Kona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surfer grinned. \"Shoots, brah, you make me blush.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuller grinned. \"How you doing, Kona?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All cool runnings, brah. Bwana Fuller got his evil on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were neck-snapping double takes all around. Fuller nodded, then looked back at Quinn. \"Anything we can do, Nate? There are a lot of our song recordings for sale in the shops, if those will help out. You guys get professional discount. We\u0027re all in this together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Nate said just as Fuller sat down, then turned his back on all of them and resumed eating his breakfast, dismissing them. The women at the table looked embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breakfast?\" Clay said. He herded his team to their table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ordered and drank coffee in silence, each looking out across the street to the ocean, avoiding eye contact until Fuller and his group had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate turned to Amy. \"A jamoke? What are you, living in a Cagney movie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is that guy?\" Amy asked. She snapped the corner off a piece of toast with more violence than was really necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s a jamoke?\" Kona asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a flavor of ice cream, right?\" Clay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate looked at Kona. \"How do you know Fuller?\" Nate held up his ringer and shot a cautionary glare, the now understood signal for no Rasta/pidgin/bullshit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I worked the Jet Ski concession for him at Kaanapali.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate looked to Clay, as if to say, You knew this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is that guy?\" Amy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the head of Hawaii Whale,\" Clay said. \"Commerce masquerading as science. They use their permit to get three sixty-five-foot tourist boats right up next to the whales.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That guy is a scientist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a Ph.D. in biology, but I wouldn\u0027t call him a scientist. Those women he was with are his naturalists. I guess today was even too windy for them to go out. He\u0027s got shops all over the island\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;sells whale crap, nonprofit. Hawaii Whale was the only research group to oppose the Jet Ski ban during whale season.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Fuller had money in the Jet Ski business,\" Nate added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made six bucks an hour,\" Kona said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nate\u0027s work was instrumental in getting the Jet Ski parasail ban done,\" Clay said. \"Fuller doesn\u0027t like us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sanctuary may take his research permit next,\" said Nate. \"What science they do is bad science.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he blames you for that?\" Amy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;we have done the most behavioral stuff as it relates to sound in these waters. The sanctuary gave us some money to find out if the high-frequency noise from Jet Skis and parasail boats affected the behavior of the whales. We concluded that it did. Fuller didn\u0027t like it. It cost him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to build a dolphin swim park, up La Perouse Bay way,\" Kona said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Nate said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" said Clay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A swim-with-the-dolphins park?\" said Amy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ya, mon. Let you come from Ohio and get in the water with them bottlenose fellahs for two hundred dollar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys didn\u0027t know about this?\" Amy was looking at Clay. He always seemed to know everything that was going on in the whale world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First I\u0027ve heard of it, but they\u0027re not going to let him do it without some studies.\" He looked to Nate. \"Are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll never happen if he loses his research permit,\" Nate said. \"There\u0027ll be a review.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ll be on the review board?\" asked Amy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nate\u0027s name would solidify it,\" Clay said. \"They\u0027ll ask him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not you?\" Kona asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just the photographer.\" Clay looked out at the whitecaps in the channel. \"Doesn\u0027t look like we\u0027ll be getting out today. Finish your breakfast, and then we\u0027ll go pay your rent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate looked at Clay quizzically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t give him money,\" Clay said. \"He\u0027ll just smoke it. I\u0027m going to go pay his rent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Truth.\" Kona nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t still work for Fuller, do you, Kona?\" Nate asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nate!\" Amy admonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he was there when I found the office ransacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave him alone,\" Amy said. \"He\u0027s too cute to be bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Truth,\" said Kona. \"Sistah Biscuit speak nothin\u0027 but the truth. I be massive cute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay set a stack of bills on the table. \"By the way, Nate, you have a lecture at the sanctuary on Tuesday. Four days. You and Amy might want to use the downtime to put something together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate felt as if he\u0027d been smacked. \"Four days? There\u0027s nothing there. It was all on those hard drives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I said, you might want to use the downtime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhale Wahine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a biologist, Nate had a tendency to draw analogies between human behavior and animal behavior\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;probably a little more often than was strictly healthy. For instance, as he considered his attraction to Amy, he wondered why it had to be so complex. Why there had to be so many subtleties to the human mating ritual. Why can\u0027t we be more like common squid? he thought. The male squid simply swims up to the female squid, hands her a neat package of sperm, she tucks it under her mantle at her leisure, and they go on their separate ways, their duty to the species done. Simple, elegant, no nuance...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate held the paper cup out to Amy. \"I poured some coffee for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all coffeed out, thanks,\" said Amy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate set the cup down on the desk next to his own. He sat in front of the computer. Amy was perched on a high stool to his left going through the hardbound field journals covering the last four years. \"Are you going to be able to put together a lecture out of this?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate rubbed his temples. Despite a handful of aspirin and six cups of coffee, his head was still throbbing. \"A lecture? About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what were you planning to do a talk on before the office was ransacked? Maybe we can reconstruct it from the field notes and memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have that good a memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes you do, you just need some mnemonics, which we have here in the field notes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression was as open and hopeful as a child\u0027s. She waited for something from him, just a word to set her searching for what he needed. The problem was, what he needed right now was not going to be found in biology field notes. He needed answers of another kind. It bothered him that Fuller had known about the break-in at the compound. It was too soon for him to have found out. It also bothered him that anyone could hold him in the sort of disdain that Fuller obviously did. Nate had been born and raised in British Columbia, and Canadians hate, above all things, to offend. It was part of the national consciousness. \"Be polite\" was an unwritten, unspoken rule, but ingrained into the psyche of an entire country. (Of course, as with any rule, there were exceptions: parts of Quebec, where people maintained the \"dismissive to the point of confrontation, with subsequent surrender\" mind-set of the French; and hockey, in which any Canadian may, with impunity, slam, pummel, elbow, smack, punch, body-check, and beat the shit out of, with sticks, any other human being, punctuated by profanities, name-calling, questioning parentage, and accusations of bestiality, usually\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;coincidentally\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;in French.) Nate was neither French-Canadian nor much of a hockey player, so the idea of having invoked enmity enough in someone to have that person ruin his research... He was mortified by it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy,\" he said, having spaced out and returned to the room in a matter of seconds, he hoped, \"is there something that I\u0027m missing about our work? Is there something in the data that I\u0027m not seeing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy assumed the pose of Rodin\u0027s The Thinker on her stool, her chin teed up on her hand, her brow furrowed into moguls of earnest contemplation. \"Well, Dr. Quinn, I would be able to answer that if you had shared the data with me, but since I only know what I\u0027ve collected or what I\u0027ve analyzed personally, I\u0027d have to say, scientifically speaking, beats me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Nate said. He smiled in spite of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said there was something there that you were close to finding. In the song, I mean. What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if I knew that, it would be found, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must suspect. You have to have a theory. Tell me, and let\u0027s apply the data to the theory. I\u0027m willing to do the work, reconstruct the data, but you\u0027ve got to trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No theory ever benefited by the application of data, Amy. Data kills theories. A theory has no better time than when it\u0027s lying there naked, pure, unsullied by facts. Let\u0027s just keep it that way for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you don\u0027t really have a theory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clueless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lying bag of fish heads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can fire you, you know.

Then, after he\u0027d watched her walk out, a wave of melancholy swept over him and for the thirtieth time that day he regretted that he hadn\u0027t just become a pharmacist, or a charter captain, or something that made you feel more alive, like a pirate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old broad lived on a volcano and believed that the whales talked to her.

He knew, because she always called when it was too windy to go out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan, why aren\u0027t you out in the channel?\" the Old Broad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Elizabeth, how are you today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t change the subject. They told me that they want to talk to you. Today. Why aren\u0027t you out there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know why I\u0027m not out there, Elizabeth. It\u0027s too windy. You can see the whitecaps as well as I can.\" From the slope of Haleakala, the Old Broad watched the activity in the channel with a two-hundred-power celestial telescope and a pair of \"big eyes\" binoculars that looked like stereo bazookas on precision mounts that were anchored into a ton of concrete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they\u0027re upset that you\u0027re not out there. That\u0027s why I called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I appreciate your calling, Elizabeth, but I\u0027m in the middle of something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate hoped he didn\u0027t sound too rude. The Old Broad meant well. And they, in a way, were all at the mercy of her generosity, for although she had \u0026amp;laquo;donated\u0026amp;raquo; the Papa Lani compound, she hadn\u0027t exactly signed it over to them. They were in a sort of permanent lease situation. Elizabeth Robinson was, however, very generous and very kindhearted indeed, even if she was a total loon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan, I am not a total loon,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yes you are, he thought. \"I know you\u0027re not,\" he said. \"But I really have to get some work done today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you working on?\" Elizabeth asked. Nate could hear her tapping a pencil on her desk. She took notes during their conversations. He didn\u0027t know what she did with the notes, but it bothered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a lecture at the sanctuary in four days.\" Why, why had he told her? Why? Now she\u0027d rattle down the mountain in her ancient Mercedes that looked like a Nazi staff car, sit in the audience, and ask all the questions that she knew in advance he couldn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That shouldn\u0027t be hard. You\u0027ve done that before, what, twenty times?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but someone broke in to the compound yesterday, Elizabeth. All my notes, the tapes, the analysis\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it\u0027s all destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence on the line for a moment. Nate could hear the Old Broad breathing. Finally, \"I\u0027m really sorry, Nathan. Is everyone all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it happened while we were out working.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything I can do? I mean, I can\u0027t send much, but if\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we\u0027re all right. It\u0027s just a lot of work that I have to start over.\" The Old Broad might have been loaded at one time, and she certainly would be again if she sold the land where Papa Lani stood, but Nate didn\u0027t think that she had a lot of money to spare after the last bear market. Even if she did, this wasn\u0027t a problem that could be solved with cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, you get back to work, but try to get out tomorrow. There\u0027s a big male out there who told me he wants you to bring him a hot pastrami on rye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate grinned and almost snorted into the phone. \"Elizabeth, you know they don\u0027t eat while they\u0027re in these waters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just relaying the message, Nathan. Don\u0027t you snicker at me. He\u0027s a big male, broad, like he just came down from Alaska\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;frankly, I don\u0027t know why he\u0027d be hungry, he\u0027s as big as a house. But anyway, Swiss and hot English mustard, he was very clear about that. He has very unusual markings on his flukes. I couldn\u0027t see them from here, but he says you\u0027ll know him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate felt his face go numb with something approximating shock. \"Elizabeth\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call if you need anything, Nathan. My love to Clay. Aloha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Quinn let the phone slip from his fingers, then zombie-stumbled out of the office and back to his own cabin, where he decided he was going to nap and keep napping until he woke up to a world that wasn\u0027t so irritatingly weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight on the edge of a dream where he was gleefully steering a sixty-foot cabin cruiser up Second Street in downtown Seattle, plowing aside slow-moving vehicles while Amy, clad in a silver bikini and looking uncharacteristically tan, stood in the bow and waved to people who had come to the windows of their second-story offices to marvel at the freedom and power of the Mighty Quinn\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;right on the edge of a perfect dream, Clay burst into the room. Talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kona\u0027s moving into cabin six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get some lines in the water, Amy,\" Nate said from the drears of morpheum opus. \"We\u0027re coming up on Pike\u0027s Place Market, and there\u0027s fish to be had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay waited, not quite smiling, not quite not, while Nate sat up and rubbed sleep from his eyes. \"Driving a boat on the street?\" Clay said, nodding. All skippers had that dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seattle,\" said Nate. \"The Zodiac lives in cabin six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t used the Zodiac in ten years, it won\u0027t hold air.\" Clay went to the closet that acted as a divider between the living/sleeping area and the kitchen. He pulled down a stack of sheets, then towels. \"You wouldn\u0027t believe how they had this kid living, Nate. It was a tin industrial building, out by the airport. Twenty, thirty of them, in little stalls with cots and not enough room to swing a dead cat. The wiring was extension cords draped over the tops of the stalls. Six hundred a month for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate shrugged. \"So? We lived that way the first couple of years. It\u0027s what you do. We might need cabin six for something. Storage or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope,\" said Clay. \"That place was a sweat box and a fire hazard. He\u0027s not living there. He\u0027s our guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Clay, he\u0027s only been with us for a day. He\u0027s probably a criminal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s our guy,\" said Clay, and that was that. Clay had very strong views on loyalty. If Clay had decided that Kona was their guy, he was their guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" said Nate, feeling as if he had just invited the Medusa in for a sandwich. \"The Old Broad called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027re you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting there.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fluke-or-i-know-why-the-winged-whale-sings/page-3.html","bookId":2050,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:48 PM"}
