And her boyfriend, Doug, is best friends with Colin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know I won\u0027t blab?\" Isabel asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t. But you didn\u0027t tell me stuff about Alex when I asked, so I figure you\u0027re good at keeping secrets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. So shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how to say this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t got all day, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kissed Alex,\" I blurt out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex? !Bendita! Was that before or after the Colin breakup?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince. \"I didn\u0027t plan it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsabel laughs so hard and loud, I have to take the phone away from my ear. \"You sure he didn\u0027t plan it?\" she asks once she can get words out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just happened. We were at his house and then we were interrupted when his mom came home and saw us--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? His ma saw you guys? In his house? !Bendita!\" She goes off in Spanish, and I have no clue what the hell she\u0027s saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t speak Spanish, Isabel. Help me out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sorry. Carmen is gonna shit a brick when she finds out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t tell her,\" Isabel is quick to say. \"But Alex\u0027s mom is one tough woman. When Alex dated Carmen, he kept her far away from his mama. Don\u0027t get me wrong, she loves her sons. But she\u0027s overprotective, just like most Mexican mothers. Did she kick you out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but she pretty much called me a whore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore laughing from the other end of the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\" More laughing. \"I would have loved to be a fly on the wall when she walked in on you two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for your compassion,\" I say dryly. \"I\u0027m hanging up now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! I\u0027m sorry for laughing. It\u0027s just that the more we talk, the more I see you as a totally different person than I thought you were. I guess I can understand why Alex likes you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, I think. Remember when I told you I wouldn\u0027t let anything happen between me and Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Just so I get my timetable straight, that was before you kissed him. Right?\" She chuckles, then says, \"I\u0027m just kidding, Brittany. If you like him, girl, go for it. But be careful, because even if I think he likes you more than he\u0027ll admit, you should keep your guard up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t stop it if something happens between me and Alex, but don\u0027t worry. I always have my guard up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too. Well, except for the night you slept at my house. I kinda fooled around with Paco. I can\u0027t tell my friends \u0027cause they\u0027d give me shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I never thought about him that way before, but being with him was kinda nice. How was the kiss with Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice,\" I say, thinking about how sensual it was. \"Actually, Isabel, it was more than nice. It was fucking incredible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsabel starts laughing, and I laugh right along with her this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 34 Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany flew out of school today, following Burro Face. Before I left I saw them together in an intimate conversation by the back field. She picked him over me, which really shouldn\u0027t surprise me. When she asked me in chemistry what she should do, I should have told her to dump that pendejo. Then I\u0027d be happy instead of pissed off. ;Es un carbon de mierda!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t deserve her. Okay, so I don\u0027t, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school, I hung out at the warehouse to see if I could get information about my dad. It was no use, though. The guys who knew mi papa back then didn\u0027t have much to say except he never stopped talking about his sons. All conversation stopped when the Satin Hood sprayed the warehouse with gunfire, a sign they\u0027re out for revenge and won\u0027t stop until they get it. I don\u0027t know if I should be thankful or worried that the warehouse is in a secluded back lot behind the old railroad station. Nobody knows we\u0027re here, not even the cops. Especially not the cops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m resistant to the Pop! Pop! Pop! of gunfire. In the warehouse, at the park ... I expect it. Some streets are safer than others, but here, in the warehouse, rivals know it\u0027s our sacred turf. And they expect retaliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s the culture. You disrespect our turf, we disrespect yours. Nobody was hurt this time, so it\u0027s not retaliation against a killing. But there will be retaliation. They expect us to come. And we won\u0027t disappoint them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my side of town the circle of life is dependent on the circle of violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking the long way home after it\u0027s all clear, I find myself driving past Brittany\u0027s house. I can\u0027t help it. As soon as I cross the tracks, a cop car stops me and two uniformed guys step out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of informing me why I\u0027m being pulled over, one of the cops orders me off my motorcycle and asks me for my license.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hand it to him. \"Why am I bein\u0027 pulled over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy who has my license examines it, then says, \"You can ask questions after I ask mine. You have any drugs in your possession, Alejandro?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any weapons?\" the other officer asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a slight hesitation before I tell the truth. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne cop takes the gun out of his holster and points it at my chest. The other one tells me to keep my hands up, then orders me to lie on the ground while he calls for backup. Fuck. I\u0027m busted, big time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of weapon? Be specific.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince before saying, \"A Glock nine millimeter.\" Thankfully I gave Wil the Beretta back or I\u0027d be caught double-strapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy answer makes the cop a little nervous and his trigger finger shakes a bit. \"Where is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On my left leg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t move. I\u0027m going to disarm you. If you stay still, you won\u0027t get hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he removes my gun the second cop puts on rubber gloves and says to me in an authoritative voice Mrs. P. would be proud of, \"You have any needles on you, Alejandro?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knees my back and handcuffs me. \"Get up,\" he orders, hauling me to my feet, and makes me lean over the hood of the car. I feel humiliated as the guy pats me down. Shit, as much as I knew getting arrested was inevitable, I\u0027m not ready for it. He shows me my gun. \"You can assume this is why we pulled you over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alejandro Fuentes, you have the right to remain silent,\" one of the officers recites. \"Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe holding cell smells like piss and smoke. Or maybe the guys who are unlucky enough to be locked in this cage with me are the ones who smell like piss and smoke. Either way, I can\u0027t wait to get the hell out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho am I gonna call to bail me out? Paco doesn\u0027t have any money. Enrique put all his money into the auto shop. My mother will kill me if she finds out I was arrested. I lean my back against the iron bars of the cell, thinking, even though it\u0027s close to impossible in this stinkin\u0027 place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police call it a holding cell, but it\u0027s just a glorified way of saying \"cage.\" Thank Dios it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve been here. And, damn it, I pray it\u0027s my last. ;Lojuro!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat thought is disturbing because I\u0027ve always known I\u0027ve sacrificed my life for my brothers. Why would it matter if I\u0027m locked up for the rest of my life? Because deep down I don\u0027t want this life. I want my mother to be proud of me for being something other than a gang member. I want a future to be proud of. And I desperately want Brittany to think I\u0027m one of the good guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bang the back of my head against the steel bars, but the thoughts won\u0027t go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen you around Fairfield High. I go there,\" says a short white guy, about my age. The dork is wearing a coral-colored golf shirt and white pants, as if he came from a golf tournament with a bunch of senior citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite Guy tries to look cool, but with that coral shirt. . . man, looking cool is the least of his problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy might as well have \"another rich kid from the north side\" tattooed on his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027cha in for?\" White Guy asks as if it\u0027s an ordinary question between two ordinary people on an ordinary day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carryin\u0027 a concealed weapon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knife or gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoot him a glare. \"Does it fuckin\u0027 matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just trying to make conversation,\" White Guy says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre all white people like this--talking to hear what their voice sounds like? \"What are you in for?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite Guy sighs. \"My dad called the cops and told them I stole his car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes. \"Your old man put you in this hellhole? On purpose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thought it would teach me a lesson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I say. \"The lesson is that your old man\u0027s an asshole.\" The dad should have taught his son how to dress better instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom\u0027ll bail me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite Guy straightens. \"She\u0027s a lawyer, and my dad\u0027s done this before. A few times. I think to piss off my mom and get her attention. They\u0027re divorced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. White people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" White Guy says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuentes, you can make your call now,\" the cop on the other side of the bars barks out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMierda, with all of White Guy\u0027s blabberin\u0027 I still haven\u0027t decided who to call to bail me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hits me like that big, fat red F on my chemistry exam. There\u0027s only one person with the money and means to get me out of this mess--Hector. The head of the Blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never called in a favor from Hector. Because you never knew when Hector would call in a favor of his own. And if I owe Hector, I owe more than money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes in life there are no desirable choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hours later, after a judge lectures me until my ears almost bleed then sets my bail, Hector picks me up from the courthouse. He\u0027s a powerful man, with slicked-back hair darker than my own and a look about him that says he takes no shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a lot of respect for Hector because he\u0027s the guy who initiated me into the Latino Blood. He grew up in the same town as my dad, had known him since they were kids. Hector kept an eye out for me and my family after my dad died. He taught me new phrases like \"second generation\" and sprouted words like \"legacy.\" I\u0027ll never forget it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector thumps me on the back as we walk to the parking lot. \"You got Judge Garrett. He\u0027s a tough son of a bitch. You\u0027re lucky the bail wasn\u0027t higher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, wanting nothing more than to go home. When we\u0027re driving away from the courthouse, I say, \"I\u0027ll pay you back, Hector.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it, man,\" Hector says. \"Brothers help each other out. To tell you the truth, I was surprised it was your first time getting arrested. You stay cleaner than anyone in the Blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare out the window of Hector\u0027s car, the streets as calm and dark as Lake Michigan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a smart kid, smart enough to move up in the Blood,\" Hector says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would die for some of the guys in Latino Blood, but to move up? Selling drugs and guns are a few of the illegal dealings going on at the top. I like it where I am, riding the dangerous wave without actually plunging headfirst into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be happy Hector is contemplating giving me more responsibility in the LB. Brittany and all she stands for is a fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about it,\" Hector says as he pulls up to my house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. Thanks for bailin\u0027 me out, man,\" I say. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-27.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
