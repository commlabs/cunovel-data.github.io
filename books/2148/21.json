As the moon would appear full for two more evenings, he\u0027d be absent from school for several days, likely spending his nights in the woods. All day long police and animal control cars patrolled the suburbs and school in case the wolves showed up again. The people of Legend\u0027s Run were up in arms about the strange animal behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was desperate to be with Brandon, but Ivy and Abby had wrangled me into watching Abby\u0027s volleyball game after school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby\u0027s game was delayed and didn\u0027t end until just after dusk. Ivy and Abby were going to join the other girls for a celebratory dinner, but I planned to head to Brandon\u0027s. As I left the gymnasium, I heard faint howling coming from a tree-filled lot near the back of the school. I ignored it and continued on to my car until I saw Brandon\u0027s Jeep parked by the school fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo patrol cars were stationed in the middle of the student lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandon?\" I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuck into the edge of the woods without venturing in too far. I\u0027d learned my lesson when I\u0027d gotten lost in the blizzard. I wasn\u0027t about to put my life or anyone else\u0027s in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLights from the parking lot and gymnasium streamed in through the trees, illuminating a small portion of the woods. A fingerless-gloved hand reached out from the darkness. Brandon, in werewolf form, was leaning against a tree, smiling at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappily, I took his hand and he drew me into him. He grazed his fangs against me. I touched his stubbly face. I ran my fingers through his locks, as he did the same to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed you today,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hunger for you all day and night,\" he said as he kissed the nape of my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed at me. His lips were only inches from my own. I was longing inside to finally have them touch in the moonlight. You must never kiss a werewolf. I heard Dr. Meadows\u0027s warning in my head, but I wasn\u0027t sure if I could wait any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled my hair off my neck and leaned in. He breathed in as if he was inhaling me. I had dotted myself with perfume and sugary vanilla body lotion. The scent of my hair and body seemed to be intoxicating to Brandon. He tugged at my henley with his fangs and nibbled my shoulder. I was so entranced, enamored by his seductive power. I was only moments from kissing the most romantic werewolf in the world. I remembered Dr. Meadows\u0027s words but I didn\u0027t want to heed her warning. But my skepticism toward Dr. Meadows was what got Brandon into this state in the first place. What was I supposed to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I should - \" I said, breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\" Brandon must have sensed my distress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t want to - \" I vowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know someone who can help you\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or at least wants to try,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" he asked, excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Meadows. She\u0027s the one who gave me the reading and warned me about the full moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she have experience with werewolves?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;she\u0027s a psychic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know... but has she dealt with werewolves before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" I said, \"she\u0027s never seen one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t hide his disappointment. Brandon turned away from me. \"There isn\u0027t anyone to help me - \" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to be some stranger\u0027s experiment,\" he continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard enough making excuses to my grandparents why they don\u0027t see me for a few nights,\" he said. \"If word gets out in town about me, then I\u0027ll have to remain in the woods during the daylight, too. I won\u0027t be able to show myself to anyone. But I\u0027ve got to find a way to stop this from happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste?\" I heard my name called from outside the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go,\" I whispered, but Brandon had already retreated into the darkness. I heard his heavy breathing but couldn\u0027t see him to even hug him good-bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste! Where are you?\" a girl\u0027s voice called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped out of the woods to Ivy and Abby\u0027s shock and horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing in there?\" Ivy asked. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I am,\" I said. My hair was damp from the snow and my coat soiled from brushing against the tree bark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you doing in there?\" Ivy asked. \"We saw your car and freaked!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I saw someone,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone in the woods?\" Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There could have been wolves in there!\" Ivy warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or worse!\" Abby said. \"Are you crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I was. Crazy in love, that is. But I wasn\u0027t about to tell them that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been acting so strangely lately,\" Ivy said, \"ever since you and Nash broke up. You\u0027re hard to get hold of and always seem distracted. But we\u0027ll fix that, won\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy took one arm and Abby linked the other. Both girls escorted me back to my car and followed me as I drove out of the school parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was lucky I had friends who watched out for me. It was one of the many reasons I didn\u0027t want anything to jeopardize my relationship with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day I stopped in Penny for Your Thoughts again. It was the third glowing of the full moon and I wanted to see if I could finally get help for Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for a client to leave and another one to pay for some amethyst geode bookends. I was getting so agitated I was almost pleading for her herbal tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t want anyone to see him,\" I told Dr. Meadows when the store was finally empty of customers. \"Can you still help him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid not,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" I begged. \"Don\u0027t you have a crystal charm or some of those teas you make? Surely you have something I can just give to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see him to properly diagnose him,\" she said emphatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to believe me. When it\u0027s a full moon he turns into a werewolf. I didn\u0027t believe it myself at first, but there really isn\u0027t any other explanation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A doctor can\u0027t give a prescription to someone they\u0027ve never met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the patient had to be willing to be seen. And in this case, I\u0027d have to do more convincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I must see him, tonight,\" Dr Meadows pressed. \"Tell me where he will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"The woods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which ones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then bring him to me before sunset,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll meet you here at my shop. Then I can help him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows was pushing me in one direction while Brandon was pushing me in another. With all my research for my own essay and helping Brandon, the only cure I\u0027d found was a silver bullet. And that definitely wasn\u0027t an option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Brandon didn\u0027t want anyone to see him after the sun set. I would do my best to delicately broach the subject again with him, but if I pushed him too hard, he wouldn\u0027t want to be around me, either. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-21.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
