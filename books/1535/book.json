Then someone put him on ice -- for about twenty-five years. Returning to the world (and trying to catch up with a quarter century\u0027s worth of current events), Tanner is about to embark on a new covert assignment that will take him to the exotic Far East, where mystery and menace are a way of life ....Now, whether he\u0027s dodging double crosses or disguising himself as a monk, Tanner is learning that when it comes to power games, pretty women, and political wrangling, some things never change. And he\u0027s making up for lost time -- with a vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tanner-on-ice-evan-tanner-8.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Adventure","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tanner-on-ice-evan-tanner-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:47:39 PM"}
