He picked up the telephone. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, darling.\" There was no mistaking the husky, distinctive voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t be calling me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"You never used to worry about things like that. Don\u0027t tell me that Elizabeth has tamed you already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" Rhys asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to see you this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make me cross, Rhys. Shall I come to Zurich or - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I can\u0027t see you here.\" He hesitated. I\u0027ll come there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s better. Our usual place, cheri.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Helene Roffe-Martel hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys replaced the receiver slowly and sat thinking. As far as he was concerned, he had had a brief physical affair with an exciting woman, and it had been finished for some time. But Helene was not a woman who let go easily. She was bored with Charles, and she wanted Rhys. \"You and I would make a perfeet team,\" she had said, and Helene Roffe-Martel could be very determined. And very dangerous. Rhys decided the trip to Paris was necessary. He had to make her understand once and for all that there could be nothing further between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few moments later he walked into Elizabeth\u0027s office, and her eyes brightened. She put her arms around him and whispered, \"I\u0027ve been thinking about you. Let\u0027s go home and play hooky this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"You\u0027re becoming a sex maniac.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held him closer. \"I know. Isn\u0027t it lovely?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I have to fly to Paris this afternoon, Liz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to conceal her disappointment. \"Shall I come with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No point. It\u0027s just a minor business problem. I\u0027ll be back tonight. We\u0027ll have a late supper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Rhys walked into the familiar small hotel on the Left Bank, Helene was already there, seated in the dining room, waiting for him. Rhys had never known her to be late. She was organized and efficient, extraordinarily beautiful, intelligent, a wonderful lover; and yet something was missing. Helene was a woman without compassion. There was a ruthlessness about her, a killer\u0027s instinct. Rhys had seen others hurt by it. He had no intention of becoming one of her victims. He sat down at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"You\u0027re looking well, darling. Marriage agrees with you. Is Elizabeth taking good care of you in bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled to take the sting out of his words. \"That\u0027s none of your business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelene leaned forward and took one of his hands, \"Ah, but it is, chert. It is our business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began stroking his hand, and he thought of her in bed. A tiger, wild, skilled and insatiable. He withdrew his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelene\u0027s eyes chilled. She said, \"Tell me, Rhys. How does it feel to be president of Roffe and Sons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had almost forgotten how ambitious she was, how greedy. He remembered the long conversations they had once had. She was obsessed by the idea of taking control of the company. You and I, Rhys. If Sam were out of the way, we could run it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in the midst of their lovemaking: It\u0027s my company, darling. Samuel Roffe\u0027s blood is in me. It\u0027s mine. I want it. Fuck me, Rhys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower was Helene\u0027s aphrodisiac. And danger. \"What did you want to see me about?\" Rhys asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s time you and I made some plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said maliciously, \"I know you too well, darling. You\u0027re as ambitious as I am. Why did you serve as Sam\u0027s shadow all those years when you had dozens of offers to run other companies? Because you knew that one day you would be running Roffe and Sons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I stayed because I liked Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. \"Of course, cheri. And now you\u0027ve married his charming little daughter.\" She took a thin black cigar from her purse and lit it with a platinum lighter. \"Charles tells me that Elizabeth has arranged to keep control of the stock and that she refuses to sell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, Helene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s occurred to you, of course, that if she had an accident, you would inherit her estate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys stared at her for a long time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline/page-48.html","bookId":2356,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:13 AM"}
