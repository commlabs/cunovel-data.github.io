I touched his face, tracing his brow and his jaw with my fingertips. “I love your control. It turns me on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught my fingers in his teeth, then released them. “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But when you lose it … ” I sighed, remembering. “It drives me crazy to know I can do that to you, that you want me that much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head dropped, his forehead touching mine. He tugged me closer, making me feel how hard he was again. “More than anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you trust me.” In my arms, he let every guard down. The ferocity of his need didn’t hide his vulnerability; it revealed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More than anyone.” He slid over me, covering my body from ankle to shoulder, effortlessly supporting his weight so he didn’t crush me. The sensual pressure made me hot for him all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilting his head, Gideon brushed his lips over mine. “Crossfire,” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossfire was my safeword, what I said to him when I was overwhelmed and needed him to stop whatever he was doing. When he said the word to me, he was overwhelmed, too, but he didn’t want me to stop. For Gideon, Crossfire conveyed a connection deeper than love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth curved. “I love you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapping myself around a pillow, I looked toward the closet and listened to the sound of Gideon singing. I smiled ruefully. He was showered and dressing, and obviously feeling energetic despite beginning the morning by screwing me into an orgasm that left me seeing stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a moment to recognize the song. When I did, I felt butterflies. “At Last.” Whether it was the Etta James or Beyoncé version he was hearing in his mind didn’t matter. What I heard was his voice, rich and nuanced, singing about seeing blue skies and smiles that cast a spell on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped out knotting a charcoal tie, his vest unbuttoned and his jacket slug over his arm. Lucky scurried out after him, never far behind. After being freed from the playpen that morning, the puppy had become his shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon’s gaze landed on me. He flashed me a heartbreaker of a smile. “And here we are,” he crooned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here I am, anyway. Leveled by hours of sex. I don’t think I can stand and you’re”—I gestured at him—“you. It’s not fair. I’m not doing something right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon sat on the edge of the rumpled bed, looking impeccable. Bending over, he kissed me. “Remind me … How many times did I come last night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a look. “Not enough, apparently, since you were ready to go again when the sun came up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which proves the point that you’re doing something very right.” He brushed the hair off my cheek. “I’m tempted to stay home, but I’ve got to clear the decks so we can disappear for a month. As you can see, I’m extremely motivated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were serious about that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You thought I wasn’t?” Brushing the sheet aside, he cupped my breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught his hand before he aroused me again. “A monthlong honeymoon. I’ll wear you out at least once. I’m determined.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will you?” His eyes sparkled with laughter. “Only once?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re asking for it, ace. By the time I’m done, you’ll beg me to leave you alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That will never happen, angel. Not in a million years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis confidence challenged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tugged the sheet back up again. “We’ll just see about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Angus walked into my office, I looked up from the e-mail I was reading. He held his hat in his hands and came to a stop in front of my desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I went through Terrence Lucas’s office last night,” he said. “I didnae find anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t expected him to, so wasn’t surprised. “It’s possible Hugh told Anne what he knows and there are no records to be found.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded grimly. “While I was at it, I deleted all traces of Eva’s appointment on both their onsite hard drives and backups. I also wiped the video footage of you and Eva being there. I checked and he never asked security for a copy, so you should be fine if he takes his wife’s cue and files any complaints of his own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was Angus, always taking all possibilities into consideration. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-65.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
