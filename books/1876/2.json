Cole isn\u0027t next to me on the floor when I sit up. His blankets are folded on a chair. He let me sleep and is enduring my parents alone. Quickly, I pull on my jeans and tank top, and run a brush through my hair. As I approach the stairs, I hear my mother\u0027s voice. She\u0027s laughing, along with my dad and Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get to the top of the stairs, I hesitate. Cole is sitting with my parents and it appears that they are having a somewhat normal conversation. I stand still, listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa says to Cole, \"So what about this one? Was this airbrushed?\" She pushes the paper toward him. Cole reaches out and slides it closer while sipping his coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"Yes, the models in the ads are Photoshopped - that\u0027s like airbrushing, but it\u0027s more than that. All of these are manipulated to some extent. Real thighs don\u0027t look like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa tugs the paper away and looks at it closer, \"How do you know? I can\u0027t see it. And this girl is so skinny. Her thighs could really look like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole shakes his head and pulls the paper back. \"It\u0027s my job. We do this all day long. So does Anna, and she\u0027s very good at it. But, sometimes on the cheaper product lines you can see artifacts, like - \" he\u0027s turning pages. After flipping three times, he stops and smooths the newsprint, \"here. See this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa tugs the paper back, and her jaw drops. She thrusts the pages at Dad, who is smiling like he already knows all this stuff. \"Frankie, did you see this? Did you know they could do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. They\u0027ve been doing that for years. I told you real women don\u0027t look like that. You\u0027re beautiful and always have been. Those twigs got nothing on you, baby,\" he takes her hand while he\u0027s talking. He\u0027s always adored her. They gaze at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole smiles and looks up, seeing me in the doorway. He stands and crosses the room, \"Good morning, lover. Can I get you some breakfast?\" He kisses me on the cheek and I nearly fall over. A voice inside my head giggles hysterically and instructs me to never wash my face again. I stare at Cole as he takes a plate and fills it with pancakes and sausages. He hands it to me and grabs me a cup of coffee. \"Come on. Sit. Eat. We have time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make my way to the table. We sit together and eat. The conversation doesn\u0027t drift to loins or babies. A smile spreads across my face and I can\u0027t hide it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s Saturday. By the time I get back to the apartment, Emma is gone. I get in the shower, and crank up the hot water. I stand there letting it wash over me until my skin is numb. There are so many things that I want to do, but I don\u0027t know where to start. Cole left my parent\u0027s house right after breakfast. His driver picked him up in a shiny black car. He offered to take me home, but I didn\u0027t want to leave my bike behind. I thanked him and told him I\u0027d be in later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis week has been so strange. If someone told me that the man who shattered my dreams last weekend would be spending the night with me and starring in my naughty fantasies, I wouldn\u0027t have believed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I leave for work, I call Edward and tell him that I want to meet up with him later. Breaking up is going to suck, but it\u0027s inevitable. There\u0027s no future for us. This is more humane, even if he does love me. I just hope that he\u0027ll understand. I can\u0027t change for him, and he shouldn\u0027t have to change for me. Somewhere out there, there\u0027s a girl that\u0027s perfect for him, and I know that it\u0027s not me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tug on a pair of shorts and a cami. I\u0027m not really dressed for work, but there are no clients today and it\u0027s insanely hot. I leave my motorcycle in the garage across the street and make my way to Le Femme via the subway, then trek the last stretch on foot. By the time I arrive, my cute outfit is soaked in sweat and my hair is deflated. I look horrible. After I push through the door, I walk to the mirror, trying to salvage my appearance, at least a little bit. Snatching a tissue, I blot the sweat off my face. Most of my make-up floated away a few blocks back. Sun-freckles and rosy cheeks peek back at me. The sheen on my face refuses to be tamed. I stand there for a second and look at the tissue, wondering if I should even bother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Cole walks up behind me. His voice sounds soft at first, almost timid. \"You\u0027re here. And... um, wow... You look...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI huff, \"Like a mess. Tell me there are no clients today. Please. I can\u0027t fix this.\" I gesture to my face which is glowing again in an I-just-worked-out kind of way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole leans back on Miss Todd\u0027s empty desk. The muscles in his arms bulge. His shirt clings to his body and I realize that I haven\u0027t seen him dressed like this before. He looks like he\u0027s headed for the beach, wearing shorts and a tee shirt. The office is a warmer than usual. There\u0027s a sheen of sweat on his skin. He grins, \"There are no clients. We\u0027re editing all day. And you look great, so don\u0027t worry about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"Yeah. Nice try, but I saw the way I rendered you silent a few seconds ago.\" The way he looks at me makes my stomach flip. It\u0027s like seeing me in a disheveled mess makes him like me more. I stop fussing in front of the mirror and toss the tissue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slides off the desks and walks toward me, \"The air conditioner is having issues. We\u0027ll be lucky if it doesn\u0027t totally die. The repair guys will be here later to work on it. Come on. Let\u0027s get to editing.\" He tilts his head and turns. Cole shoves his hands in his pockets and I follow him back to the studio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few hours later, sweat is pouring off of me. The air conditioner totally died and the repair guy hasn\u0027t shown up. Cole calls them and is assured that we are next on the list, so we sit and wait. I stop editing and lay down on the cool concrete floor. Sweat was dripping into my computer keyboard; it\u0027s so insanely hot up here. The cement feels nice on the back of my neck and legs. I sigh and fold my hands behind my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Cole notices, he walks over and stands above me, his hands on his hips, \"Get up, Lamore. There\u0027s more work to be done, and we\u0027ll be here until tomorrow at this rate.\" He holds out a hand to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t take it. \"It\u0027s got to be 20 degrees cooler down here. We should move the computer to the floor. This is way better.\" When I don\u0027t take his hand, Cole cocks his head and places his hands on his hips. I laugh. He looks ridiculous, \"What? Are you gonna yell at me? It\u0027s like a hundred degrees in here. Besides, you\u0027d be sitting on the floor if you could get up again. Ya know, without using that button around your neck.\" I change my voice to mimic the old lady on the TV, \"Help! I\u0027ve fallen and I can\u0027t get up!\" My laughter obscures my words by the time I finish teasing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole moves fast. He falls to his knees and lands by my side before starting a tickle fight that brings tears to my eyes. His fingers move over my slick skin. I\u0027m laughing so hard that I can\u0027t breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I could get up again,\" he mutters with a smile on his face. \"I\u0027m not that much older than you, Lamore. In fact, you\u0027re going to be the one who begs for help getting up.\" He tickles me more. My legs kick as I try to roll out of reach. I manage to flop onto my stomach, but he grabs my ankle and pulls me back. I squeal as my cami hikes up. Frantically, my hands shift from the tickle fight, trying to keep my shirt from revealing too much skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole is laughing, \"Surrender, Lamore. Beg me for help.\" He bats his eyes and says in a girlie voice, \"I\u0027ve fallen and I can\u0027t get up.\" His fingers wiggle against the bare skin at my waist, as I laugh hysterically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKicking at him, my foot connects with the side of his face by accident. The impact is audible. I didn\u0027t mean to do that. Startled, we both pause for a moment. His jaw drops, so does mine. No one laughs. No one breathes until he grins, saying, \"You\u0027re gonna pay for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he grabs for me, I try to crab crawl away, but Cole yanks my leg and I fall on my back. Suddenly he\u0027s over me, his hands trying to still my wrists. We roll around on the floor for a minute, both of us much hotter than a few minutes ago. Sweat trickles down my face. The little beads roll down my neck and into my cleavage. Cole\u0027s eyes trace the movement. I try to knock him off his knees, but when he goes down, he pins my body to the floor, clutching my wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re both breathing hard when he yanks my hands and slams them down over my head, stretching me. As he does it, our gazes lock, and now my shirt has crawled up, revealing more than I\u0027d normally show. I feel the bare skin on my stomach against his shirt. It makes me feel like I\u0027m falling. I don\u0027t want it to stop. There\u0027s no laughter, just ragged breathing as we stare at each other. He remains on top of me and I can\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel lost. My head is swimming, stuck in the haze that comes with being high from laughter. The way he looks at me sends a shiver through my body. He feels it move through me, but he doesn\u0027t release me. I don\u0027t want him to. I want to know what this passionate man will do, how he treats his lovers. I can\u0027t ignore the dream I had last night at my parents\u0027 house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes slowly, and look back into his beautiful face, \"Do I really have to beg, Cole?\" My voice is too deep, too sensual. I meant to be playful, but can\u0027t manage it. My voice betrays me and my innocent question sounds anything but innocent. Heat rushes to my cheeks, and it feels like every bit of my dream is painted across my face. I don\u0027t breathe as I watch him, waiting for him to react, but he doesn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole\u0027s expression doesn\u0027t change - his intense gaze darkens, his lips part. There is no smile on his face. Not anymore. Something changed, a moment of flirtation that crossed a line. We both know it. Cole\u0027s grip on my wrists tightens; his eyes are still locked on mine. His taller frame allows him to pull me slightly, stretching my body. My breasts push into his chest harder. I gasp, wishing, wanting something that I can\u0027t quiet comprehend. Every inch of my skin feels cold and hot at the same time. Cole\u0027s lips are just above mine. I want him to pull us together, and nip me, taste my kiss, and then do it all again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole\u0027s body is tense, every muscle perfectly formed. His ribs expand as he tries to steady his breath. I can feel his heart pounding when he tugs me. The movement makes him lay flat against my chest. His eyes are so dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whispers, \"Hell, yes. Beg for it, Anna. Beg me...\" His lips are so close to mine, but he won\u0027t kiss me. I wriggle beneath him, trying to close the distance, but he won\u0027t let me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore either of us can say another word the chime from the front door sounds. We split apart. Cole springs to his feet, rubbing his hands through his hair. His back is to me as he leaves the room to let the repair guy in. I can\u0027t read the expression on his face, but the way he moves, the way his broad shoulders slant as he walks away - it looks like regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach falls. I wonder if he regrets not kissing me, or regrets being in that position with me at all. I\u0027ll never ask him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/secrets-vol-2-ella-steele-secrets-2/page-2.html","bookId":1876,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:12 PM"}
