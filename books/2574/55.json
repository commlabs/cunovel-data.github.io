The hedge dog, which had been approaching Danny and his mother, recoiled away from it, its green and shadowmarbled ears flattening, its tail coming down between its legs as its haunches flattened abjectly. In his head, Hallorann heard it whine fearfully, and mixed with that sound was the fearful, confused yowling of the big cats. He struggled to his feet to go to the other two and help them, and as he did so he saw something more nightmarish than all the rest: the hedge rabbit, still coated with snow, was battering itself crazily at the chainlink fence at the far end of the playground, and the steel mesh was jingling with a kind of nightmare music, like a spectral zither. Even from here he could hear the sounds of the close-set twigs and branches which made up its body cracking and crunching like breaking bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dick! Dick!\" Danny cried out. He was trying to support his mother, help her over to the snowmobile. The clothes he had carried out for the two of them were scattered between where they had fallen and where they now stood. Hallorann was suddenly aware that the woman was in her nightclothes, Danny jacketless, and it was no more than ten above zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(my gad she\u0027s in her bare feet)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struggled back through the snow, picking up her coat, her boots, Danny\u0027s coat, odd gloves. Then he ran back to them, plunging hip-deep in the snow from time to time, having to flounder his way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWendy was horribly pale, the side of her neck coated with blood, blood that was now freezing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" she muttered. She was no more than semiconscious. \"No, I... can\u0027t. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny looked up at Hallorann pleadingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gonna be okay,\" Hallorann said, and gripped her again. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of them made it to where the snowmobile had slewed around and stalled out. Hallorann sat the woman down on the passenger seat and put her coat on. He lifted her feet up-they were very cold but not frozen yet-and rubbed them briskly with Danny\u0027s jacket before putting on her boots. Wendy\u0027s face was alabaster pale, her eyes halflidded and dazed, but she had begun to shiver. Hallorann thought that was a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, a series of three explosions rocked the hotel. Orange flashes lit the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny put his mouth close to Hallorann\u0027s ear and screamed something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said do you need that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was pointing at the red gascan that leaned at an angle in the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked it up and sloshed it. Still gas in there, he couldn\u0027t tell how much. He attached the can to the back of the snowmobile, fumbling the job several times before getting it right because his fingers were going numb. For the first time he became aware that he\u0027d lost Howard Cottrell\u0027s mittens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(i get out of this i gonna have my sister knit you a dozen pair, howie)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get on!\" Hallorann shouted at the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny shrank back. \"We\u0027ll freeze!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to go around to the equipment shed! There\u0027s stuff in there... blankets... stuff like that. Get on behind your mother!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny got on, and Hallorann twisted his head so he could shout into Wendy\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Missus Torrance! Hold onto me! You understand? Hold on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her arms around him and rested her cheek against his back. Hallorann started the snowmobile and turned the throttle delicately so they would start up without a jerk. The woman had the weakest sort of grip on him, and if she shifted backward, her weight would tumble both her and the boy off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey began to move. He brought the snowmobile around in a circle and then they were traveling west parallel to the hotel. Hallorann cut in more to circle around behind it to the equipment shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had a momentarily clear view into the Overlook\u0027s lobby. The gasflame coming up through the shattered floor was like a giant birthday candle, fierce yellow at its heart and blue around its flickering edges. In that moment it seemed only to be lighting, not destroying. They could see the registration desk with its silver bell, the credit card decals, the old-fashioned, scrolled cash register, the small figured throw rugs, the highbacked chairs, horsehair hassocks. Danny could see the small sofa by the fireplace where the three nuns had sat on the day they had come up-closing day. But this was the real closing day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the drift on the porch blotted the view out. A moment later they were skirting the west side of the hotel. It was still light enough to see without the snowmobile\u0027s headlight. Both upper stories were flaming now, and pennants of flame shot out the windows. The gleaming white paint had begun to blacken and peel. The shutters which had covered the Presidential Suite\u0027s picture windowshutters Jack had carefully fastened as per instructions in mid-October-now hung in flaming brands, exposing the wide and shattered darkness behind them, like a toothless mouth yawing in a final, silent deathrattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWendy had pressed her face against Hallorann\u0027s back to cut out the wind, and Danny had likewise pressed his face against his mother\u0027s back, and so it was only Hallorann who saw the final thing, and he never spoke of it. From the window of the Presidential Suite he thought he saw a huge dark shape issue, blotting out the snowfield behind it. For a moment it assumed the shape of a huge, obscene manta, and then the wind seemed to catch it, to tear it and shred it like old dark paper. It fragmented, was caught in a whirling eddy of smoke, and a moment later it was gone as if it had never been. But in those few seconds as it whirled blackly, dancing like negative motes of light, he remembered something from his childhood... fifty years ago, or snore. He and his brother had come upon a huge nest of ground wasps just north of their farm. It had been tucked into a hollow between the earth and an old lightning-blasted tree. His brother had had a big old niggerchaser in the band of his hat, saved all the way from the Fourth of July. He had lighted it and tossed it at the nest. It had exploded with a loud bang, and an angry, rising hum-almost a low shriek-had risen from the blasted nest. They had run away as if demons had been at their beels. In a way, Hallorann supposed that demons had been. And looking back over his shoulder, as he was now, he had on that day seen a large dark cloud of hornets rising in the hot air, swirling together, breaking apart, looking for whatever enemy had done this to their home so that they-the single group intelligence-could sting it to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the thing in the sky was gone and it might only have been smoke or a great flapping swatch of wallpaper after all, and there was only the Overlook, a flaming pyre in the roaring throat of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a key to the equipment shed\u0027s padlock on his key ring, but Hallorann saw there would be no need to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was ajar, the padlock hanging open on its hasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t go in there,\" Danny whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay. You stay with your mom. There used to be a pile of old horseblankets. Probably all moth-eaten by now, but better than freezin to death. Missus Torrance, you still with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" the wan voice answered. \"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ll be just a second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come back as quick as you can,\" Danny whispered. \"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann nodded. He had trained the headlamp on the door and now he floundered through the snow, casting a long shadow in front of himself. He pushed the equipment shed door open and stepped in. The horseblankets were still in the corner, by the rogue set. He picked up four of themthey smelled musty and old and the moths certainly had been having a free lunch-and then he paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the rogue mallets was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Was that what he hit me with?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it didn\u0027t matter what he\u0027d been hit with, did it? Still, his fingers went to the side of his face and began to explore the huge lump there. Six hundred dollars\u0027 worth of dental work undone at a single blow. And after all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(maybe he didn\u0027t hit me with one of those. Maybe one got lost. Or stolen. Or took for a souvenir. After all)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit didn\u0027t really matter. No one was going to be playing rogue here next summer. Or any summer in the foreseeable future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it didn\u0027t really matter, except that looking at the racked mallets with the single missing member had a kind of fascination. He found himself thinking of the hard wooden whack! of the mallet head striking the round wooden ball. A nice summery sound. Watching it skitter across the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egravel. It conjured up images of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eiced tea, porch swings, ladies in white straw hats, the hum of mosquitoes, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(bad little boys who don\u0027t play by the rules.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall that stuff. Sure. Nice game. Out of style now, but... nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dick?\" The voice was thin, frantic, and, he thought, rather unpleasant. \"Are you all right, Dick? Come out now. Please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(\"Come on out now nigguh de massa callin youall.\")\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand closed tightly around one of the mallet handles, liking its feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(pare the rod, spoil the child.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes went blank in the flickering, fire-shot darkness. Really, it would be doing them both a favor. She was messed up... in pain... and most of it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(all of it)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas that damn boy\u0027s fault. Sure. He had left his own daddy in there to burn. When you thought of it, it was damn close to murder. Patricide was what they called it. Pretty goddam low:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Hallorann?\" Her voice was low, weak, querulous. He didn\u0027t much like the sound of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dick!\" The boy was sobbing now, in terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann drew the mallet from the rack and turned toward the flood of white light from the snowmobile headlamp. His feet scratched unevenly over the boards of the equipment shed, like the feet of a clockwork toy that has been wound up and set in motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he stopped, looked wonderingly at the mallet in his hands, and asked himself with rising horror what it was he had been thinking of doing. Murder? Had he been thinking of murder?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment his entire mind seemed filled with an angry, weakly hectoring voice:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Do it! Do it, you weak-kneed no-balls nigger! Kill them! KILL THEM BOTH!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he flung the mallet behind him with a whispered, terrified cry. It clattered into the corner where the horseblankets had been, one of the two heads pointed toward him in an unspeakable invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny was sitting on the snowmobile seat and Wendy was holding him weakly. His face was shiny with tears, and he was shaking as if with ague. Between his clicking teeth he said: \"Where were you? We were scared!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a good place to be scared of,\" Hallorann said slowly. \"Even if that place burns flat to the foundation, you\u0027ll never get me within a hundred miles of here again. Here, Missus Torrance, wrap these around you. I\u0027ll help. You too, Danny. Get yourself looking like an Arab.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swirled two of the blankets around Wendy, fashioning one of them into a hood to cover her head, and helped Danny tie his so they wouldn\u0027t fall off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now hold on for dear life,\" he said. \"We got a long way to go, but the worst is behind us now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe circled the equipment shed and then pointed the snowmobile back along their trail. The Overlook was a torch now, flaming at the sky. Great holes had been eaten into its sides, and there was a red hell inside, waxing and waning. Snowmelt ran down the charred gutters in steaming waterfalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey purred down the front lawns their way well lit. The snowdunes glowed scarlet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look!\" Danny shouted as Hallorann slowed for the front gate. He was pointing toward the playground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hedge creatures were all in their original positions, but they were denuded, blackened, seared. Their dead branches were a stark interlacing network in the fireglow, their small leaves scattered around their feet like fallen petals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re dead!\" Danny screamed in hysterical triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead! They\u0027re dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh,\" Wendy said. \"All right, honey. It\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, doc,\" Hallorann said. \"Let\u0027s get to someplace warm. You ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Danny whispered. \"I\u0027ve been ready for so long-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann edged through the gap between gate and post. A moment later they were on the road, pointed back toward Sidewinder. The sound of the snowmobile\u0027s engine dwindled until it was lost in the ceaseless roar of the wind. It rattled through the denuded branches of the hedge animals with a low, beating, desolate sound. The fire waxed and waned. Sometime after the sound of the snowmobile\u0027s engine had disappeared, the Overlooks roof caved in-first the west wing, then the east, and seconds later the central roof. A huge spiraling gout of sparks and flaming debris rushed up into the howling winter night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bundle of flaming shingles and a wad of hot flashing were wafted is through the open equipment shed door by the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while the shed began to burn, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were still twenty miles from Sidewinder when Hallorann stopped to pour the rest of the gas into the snowmobile\u0027s tank. He was getting very worried about Wendy Torrance, who seemed to be drifting away from them. It was still so far to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dick!\" Danny cried. He was standing up on the seat, pointing. \"Dick, look! Look there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snow had stopped and a silver-dollar moon had peeked out through the raftering clouds. Far down the road but coming toward them, coming upward through a series of S-shaped switchbacks, was a pearly chain of lights. The wind dropped for a moment and Hallorann heard the faraway buzzing snarl of snowmobile engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann and Danny and Wendy reached them fifteen minutes later. They had brought extra clothes and brandy and Dr. Edmunds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the long darkness was over. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shining-the-shining-1/page-55.html","bookId":2574,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:45 PM"}
