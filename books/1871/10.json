I hated having an intimate party and not inviting my best friend. However, I had to remind myself of the motivation for the partyto get Sebastians mind off Becky and onto a vampire girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and I sat at a side entrance to the school, she intently eating her lunch on a step while I was perched on a half wall, doodling a macabre party in my notebook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure stood next to me. Whats that? Trevor said, snatching my notebook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWouldnt you like to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looks like a sketch for a funeral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if youre luckyor rather, I amyou could be the guest of honor. I tried swiping it back, but he held it out of reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou and your friends are having some gathering where you try to bring back the dead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe call it a party, I said back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA party? And when should I be there? he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA party? Whos having a party? Becky asked, placing her trash into her brown lunch bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh, no one. Trevors just mouthing off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, your sketch looked exactly like a party to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere isnt a partynot now, not ever! Cmon, Becky, lets go. This location is suddenly very unappetizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor remained at the half wall, puzzled, as Becky and I escaped into school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian and Alexander were hanging out in the gazebo when I arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere going to have a party, I said to Sebastian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, Alexander told me all about it. I do appreciate the lengths you guys are going to to repair my broken heart, he said dramatically, his hand over his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou never know where you might meet the perfect person, I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListen, Ive been traveling all my life and I havent found her yet. Well, I thought I had, but Ive resigned myself to my fate. Becky will marry Matt and Ill be alone for eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander and I were chuckling at his histrionics when we heard the sound of a car coming up the Mansions long driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre the guests arriving already? Sebastian asked sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one drove up to the haunted-looking Mansion at night, and I didnt recognize the car. The three of us headed back inside through the kitchen and waited in the dining room as Jameson answered the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm Giles Lunken with the Gazette, we heard a voice say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiles Lunken? He was a well-known writer throughout Dullsville who had a column showcasing local and international talent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wondering if I could speak with Alexander Sterling, he continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay I ask what this is regarding? Jameson asked like a strict butler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he the artist that painted the canvases sold in last months auction? We were thinking of doing an article about him for the Gazette. Hes so youngits amazing hes so talented. Also, Id love to come back with my photographer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm afraid thats impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? His voice was accusatory. Hes not the artist?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUhYou will have to come back at another time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was another artist? Mr. Lunken prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm not saying that, Jameson answered firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen what are you saying? Did he paint those paintings?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he did\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen does he have a personal phone or cell number? Mr. Lunken pulled out a PDA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm afraid he doesnt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn e-mail? Mr. Lunken questioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesnt have e-mail?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson shook his bald head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes he have a Web site? I couldnt find any information on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can leave your card with me, Jameson suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUhI dont have one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou dont have a card? Jameson asked. Interesting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldnt help but snicker. Alexander put his hand gently over my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIll come back in a few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson passed us, and Alexander gave him the thumbs-up sign. The Creepy Man headed for the kitchen as we settled in the living room. Sebastian plopped down on the antique sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDude! Sebastian said with an impressed tone. You are famous. Soon well have to invest in a security system to weed out the paparazzi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny, Alexander said. Shouldnt we have heard his car take off by now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian leaned back and peeked out the worn velvet curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didnt leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander and I jumped onto the sofa and the three of us peered out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiless car was still in the driveway, but he was nowhere to be found. He soon emerged from the side of the Mansion with a notepad. He continued walking, staring up at the attic window. Finally, he examined the Mustang, jotting down a few notes. Several minutes later, there was a knock at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian fingered his dreadlocks, straightened his shirt, and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander? we heard Mr. Lunken say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Im Mr. Sterlings assistant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was just here a moment agospeaking with an older gentleman. And I noticed a light in the upstairs window and this carI just thought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has a very busy schedule, Sebastian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can do the story without your help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian paused. Fine. I think we can work you in. Hell meet you at Javalicious\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eId like to meet here, the reporter insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian turned to Alexander, who shook his head adamantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease come back in two days after sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter sunset? Giles asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean early evening. Hell be waiting. Sebastian closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing? Alexander asked. We already discussed that I need to remain private. It would be dire to have a reporter see the real Mansion and discover the real me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he wont meet the real youor the real Mansion. But we cant put him off. He could write anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what is your big plan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was snooping around anywaywho knows what he might say on his own. We have to show him youre just like everyone else. Mortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut youve invited him here. And why in two days? We might as well get it over with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesnt need to see the whole house. Just the first floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you seen the first floor? I said. It would make a ghost scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian thought for a moment. Not when it gets a Sebastian Camden makeover. It will look like everyone elses home. And you wont be bothered again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexanders stern mood quickly lightened up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheres a reason hes my best friend, he said, slapping his arm around Sebastians shoulder. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-bites-vampire-kisses-7/page-10.html","bookId":1871,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:54 PM"}
