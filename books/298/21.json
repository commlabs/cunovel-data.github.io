This was Jack Morgan, with whom Julius lived. The other, a man named Marlowe, got off. As he suspected Julius beforehand of betraying them, and is a man of revengeful disposition, Julius is afraid of staying in the city while he is at large. We both think he had better go West. There he may have a chance of doing well.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No doubt. Why, some of our boys who have gone out there have grown rich.

You\u0027ve had a rough time of it so far, and circumstances have been against you; but I\u0027ll try to find a good place for you, where you\u0027ll have a chance to learn something and to improve.

He had lived among social outlaws all his life, and he realized the disadvantages of such a career. He shuddered at the idea of following in the steps of Jack Morgan or Marlowe—a considerable portion of whose time was spent in confinement. He wanted to be like Paul, for whom he felt both respect and attachment, and the superintendent\u0027s words encouraged and made him ambitious.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3003/82881.html","bookId":298,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:46:38 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:46:38 AM"}
