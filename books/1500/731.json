Abilities from any domain can be exchanged for, and up to eight levels can be exchanged for. From the list I saw last time, there were a total of 1,536 types of abilities, eighth level abilities much fewer, only 16 types.” This man who looked rough and direct from the outside possessed unexpected sharpness towards numbers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Ability formulations are divided by grades?” Su asked another question.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Correct, they seemed to have divided the medicine’s qualities into many grades, below five levels three grades, above five levels five grades, and when the eighth level is reached, there’s eight motherfucking grades!

The lower grade formulations, if it doesn’t successfully produce an ability, there is a chance that it might bring the body long lasting damage, things only those lunatics who want to take a gamble would play with. However, even the highest grade formulation only has a 50% probability of success. Those damned blood-sucking vermin!

Kebile answered them all one by one. As the amount of information he obtained increased, the speed at which Su spoke also clearly slowed. His analysis of Sun Empire already occupied most of his thought centers, the amount of thinking ability now substantially decreased. However, as the analysis were carried out, conclusions emerged one by one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe classification of ability domains was the same as the Blood Parliament.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTypes of abilities, elementary and advanced levels of abilities’ degree of similarity exceeding 70%, holy rank ability similarity 25%.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNumber of abilities exceeded the Blood Parliament, the variety of high level abilities much greater.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe system of classification exceeded the Blood Parliament, the likelihood of ninth level ability formulations exceeding 65%.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe degree of ability system completion exceeded the Blood Parliament.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShape of society, divided between lords and slaves, the differentiating factor between status: ability.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Alright, that’s pretty much everything.

His charming voice, even though pleasant to listen to, possessed an ice-cold and mechanical tone. Kebile felt as if he was listening to a machine speak. “Then, we will look for that viceroy.

Thousands of slaves were woken up from their dreams by armed soldiers and hurried off to the various plantations. The order they received today was extremely strange, but these slaves who had obedience in their blood wouldn’t question their superiors’ orders. Their insensitive minds and thoughts wouldn’t develop any doubt towards the orders.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eUnderripe bananas, coconut fruits that had just been filled with pulp, and large amounts of fruits that hadn’t reached maturity were chopped by the slaves, stored into baskets, and then delivered to the suzerain manor one vehicle after another. There were already several dozen slaves who used relay transport methods to deliver the filled vine baskets to the top floor, delivering it into the boardroom. In the suzerain mansion’s surroundings, a ring of armed soldiers looked at the baskets with strange expressions, their faces full of regret. Tropical crops that hadn’t ripened yet were mostly sour and astringent, impossible to eat. The slaves didn’t feel much when cutting down these underripe foods, because these weren’t things that they could eat. However, the soldiers were different. Many of them understood some rough economic principles, understanding that the more abundant the harvest, the more they could purchase with their meager salaries. However now, it was evident that the main plantations’ harvests had all been destroyed. Then, how were they going to make it through this winter? Where would their salaries come from?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThere were a few smart fellas who thought of this problem, but they definitely wouldn’t be so foolish as to speak it out loud.

As Kebile’s assistant, as well as Vibimore’s second strongest ability user, he had a rough idea what happened last night. Only, he didn’t know who it was exactly that entered this official residence. However, from the abnormal action Kebile carried out this morning, he could already guess the victor of last night’s battle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-8-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-8-4\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-8-3","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM"}
