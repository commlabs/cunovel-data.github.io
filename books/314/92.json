{"id":21066,"no":92,"title":"Chapter 92","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe nam-shub of Enki is a tablet wrapped up in a clay envelope covered with the cuneiform equivalent of a warning sticker. The entire assembly has shattered into dozens of pieces. Most of them have stayed wrapped up inside the plastic, but some have gone spinning across the flight deck. Hiro gathers them up from the helipad and returns them to the center.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he\u0027s got the plastic wrapper cut away, Juanita is waving to him from the windows on top of the control tower.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe takes all the pieces that look to be part of the envelope and puts them into a separate pile. Then he assembles the remains of the tablet itself into a coherent group. It\u0027s not obvious, yet, how to piece them together, and he doesn\u0027t have time for jigsaw puzzles. So he goggles into his office, uses the computer to take an electronic snapshot of the fragments, and calls the Librarian.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"This hypercard contains a picture of a shattered clay tablet. Do you know of some software that would be good at piecing it back together?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"One moment, sir,\" the Librarian says. Then a hypercard appears in his hand. He gives it to Hiro. It contains a picture of an assembled tablet. \"That\u0027s how it looks, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you read Sumerian?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you read this tablet out loud?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Get ready to do it. And hold on a second.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro walks over to the base of the control tower. There\u0027s a door there that gives him access to a stairwell. He climbs up to the control room, a strange mixture of Iron Age and high-tech. Juanita\u0027s waiting there, surrounded by peacefully slumbering wireheads. She taps a microphone that is projecting from a communications panel at the end of a flexible gooseneck -- the same mike that the en was speaking into.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Live to the Raft,\" she says. \"Go for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro puts his computer into speakerphone mode and stands up next to the microphone. \"Librarian, read it back,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd a string of syllables pours out of the speaker.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of it, Hiro glances up at Juanita. She\u0027s standing in the far corner of the room with her fingers stuck in her ears.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDown at the base of the stairs, a wirehead begins to talk. Deep down inside the Enterprise, there\u0027s more talking going on. And none of it makes any sense. It\u0027s just a lot of babbling.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s an external catwalk on the control tower. Hiro goes out there and listens to the Raft. From all around them comes a dim roar, not of waves or wind, but of a million unchained human voices speaking in a confusion of tongues.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJuanita comes out to listen, too. Hiro sees a trickle of red under her ear.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re bleeding,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. A little bit of primitive surgery,\" she says. Her voice is strained and uncomfortable. \"I\u0027ve been carrying around a scalpel blade for cases like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Slid it up under the base of the antenna and cut the wire that goes into my skull,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"While you were down on the flight deck.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think?\" she says. \"So I wouldn\u0027t be exposed to the nam-shub of Enki. I\u0027m a neurolinguistic hacker now, Hiro. I went through hell to obtain this knowledge. It\u0027s a part of me. Don\u0027t expect me to submit to a lobotomy.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"If we get out of this, will you be my girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally,\" she says. \"Now let\u0027s get out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/341/757.html","bookId":314,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 12:12:43 PM"}
