The Chancellor’s reports to Rhulad had been anything but simple in their exhortations to raise the stakes. A formal declaration of war, the marching of massed troops over the borders in a pre-emptive campaign of conquest. Far better to spill blood on their lands than on Letherii soil, after all. ‘If the Bolhmdo-led alliance wants war, we should give it to them.’’ The Chancellor’s glittering eyes belied the cool, almost toneless enunciation of those words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhulad had fidgeted on his throne, muttering his unease the Edur were too spread out, the K’risnan were overworked. Why did the Bolkandans so dislike him? There had been no list of grievances. He had done nothing to spark this fire to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriban Gnol had pointed out, quietly, that four agents of the conspiracy had been captured entering Letheras only the other day. Disguised as merchants seeking ivory. Karos Invictad had sent by courier their confessions and would the Emperor like to see them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head in denial, Rhulad had said nothing, his pain-racked eyes fixed on the tiles of the dais beyond his slippered feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo lost, this terrible Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she turned onto the corridor leading to her private chambers, she saw a tall figure standing near her door. A Tiste Edur, one of the few who were resident in the palace. She vaguely recalled the warrior’s having something to do with security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tilted his head in greeting as she approached. ‘First Concubine Nisall.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Has the Emperor sent you?’ she asked, stepping past and waving him behind her into the chambers. Few men could intimidate her-she knew too well their minds. She was less at ease in the company of women, and the virtually neutered men such as Triban Gnol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Alas,’ the warrior said, ‘I am not permitted to speak to my Emperor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused and glanced back at him. ‘Are you out of favour?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have no idea.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntrigued now, Nisall regarded the Edur for a moment, then asked, ‘Would you like some wine?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, thank you. Were you aware that a directive has been issued by Invigilator Karos Invictad to compile evidence leading to your arrest for sedition?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grew very still. Sudden heat flashed through her, then she felt cold, beads of sweat like ice against her skin. ‘Are you here,’ she whispered, ‘to arrest me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows rose. ‘No, nothing of the sort. The very opposite, in fact.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You wish, then, to join in my treason?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘First Concubine, I do not believe you are engaged in any seditious acts. And if you are, I doubt they are directed against Emperor Rhulad.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. ‘If not the Emperor, then whom? And how could it be considered treasonous if they are not aimed at Rhulad? Do you think I resent the Tiste Edur hegemony? Precisely whom am I conspiring against?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If I was forced to hazard a guess… Chancellor Triban Gnol.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing for a moment, then, ‘What do you want?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Forgive me. My name is Bruthen Trana. I was appointed to oversee the operations of the Patriotists, although it is likely that the Emperor has since forgotten that detail.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘l am not surprised. You’ve yet to report to him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grimaced. ‘True. The Chancellor has made certain of that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He insists you report to him instead, yes? I’m beginning to understand, Bruthen Trana.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Presumably, Triban Gnol’s assurances that he has conveyed said reports to Rhulad are false.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The only reports the Emperor receives regarding the Patriotists are those from the Invigilator, as vetted through the Chancellor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. ‘As I suspected. First Concubine, it is said your relationship with the Emperor has gone somewhat beyond that of ruler and chosen whore-forgive me for the use of that term. Rhulad is being isolated-from his own people. Daily he receives petitions, but they are all from Letherii, and those are carefully selected by Triban Gnol and his staff. This situation had worsened since the fleets sailed, for with them went Tomad Sengar and Uruth, and many other Hiroth, including Rhulad’s brother, Binadas. All who might have effectively opposed the Chancellor’s machinations were removed from the scene. Even Hanradi Khalag…’ His words fell away and he stared at her, then shrugged. ‘I must speak to the Emperor, Nisall. Privately.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I may not be able to help you, if I am to be arrested,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Only Rhulad himself can prevent that from occurring,’ Bruthen Trana said. ‘In the meantime, I can afford you some protection.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-66.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
