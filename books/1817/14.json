She wanted me to ask you myself. My appointment is for three o’clock. You and Mom can meet us at the doctor’s office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent. I’ll have Ralph swing by the penthouse to pick up your mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started laughing again and Julia couldn’t help but laugh as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You two kids are terrible people. I hope you know that,” my dad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up from my chair and kissed Julia’s cheek. “I’m out of here. I have a meeting to attend and some files to go over before I start my weekend. You better call me and tell me if I’m getting a niece or nephew.” I pointed at her as I walked out of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I was finishing up the last of the paperwork that needed to be reviewed, my phone rang. It was Julia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?” I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are going to have a nephew!” Julia said with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, that’s great news, Julia. Congratulations. Mom and Dad must be thrilled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are. Dad got all teary-eyed and Mom burst into tears.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I bet they did. That’s awesome. I can’t wait to meet him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to dinner now. Do you want to meet us?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah. I’ve got plans for tonight. I’ll see you tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. Stay out of trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t promise that.” I chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut down my computer, grabbed my briefcase, and headed out of the building to start my weekend. I was heading to the beach house and Aiden and I were going to check out a new club that had just opened up close by. I didn’t have to worry about my parents showing up this weekend because they were heading to Chicago tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I pulled into the driveway, Aiden was sitting in his car, waiting for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s about time, man,” he said as he got out and high-fived me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, I had to finish up some work at the office before I headed out and then I got stuck in a shitload of traffic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inserted the key into the lock and opened the door. I took my bags straight up to my room while Aiden planted himself on the couch and waited for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude, I have to shower first. Order us a pizza. I’m starving,” I yelled down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I showered and put on some clothes, I walked downstairs. “Did you order it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. It should be here in a few minutes,” Aiden replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few moments later, there was a knock on the door. I grabbed my wallet and was caught off guard by a beautiful girl when I opened the door. A big smile splayed across her face when she looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here’s your pizza. That’ll be twenty dollars, please,” she said shyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out thirty and handed it to her. “Here, keep the extra ten for your tip.” I winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit down on her bottom lip as she thanked me. She began to walk away and then stopped and turned around. “I normally don’t do things like this, but would you like to go out later?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn! I hadn’t been here an hour yet and already I had a date! “Sure. My friend Aiden and I are going to that new club that just opened up over on Northpoint. We’ll be there around nine if you want to meet us there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds like fun. I’ll ask my friends if they want to go. Can I have your number and I’ll text you when we get there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure, hand me your phone.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI punched my number under her contacts and hit save. “By the way, what’s your name?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alexis. And you are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Collin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See you later, Collin.” She smiled as she walked her fine body back to her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut the door and took the pizza in the kitchen. “Smooth. Very smooth, bro. I didn’t see her. Was she hot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, yeah, she was hot!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You better be careful, man. Tina told me the other day that a few of her friends said that you’re a douchebag.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why the fuck would they say that?” I asked as I grabbed the paper plates and set them on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two of her friends you slept with are upset with you because you never called them back.” He chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And? They shouldn’t be surprised. They know me and how I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just saying, bro.” He smiled. “Love them and leave them. The Collin Black way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave them, yes. Love them, no,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we ate our pizza, we sat on the couch, watched some of the hockey game, drank a few beers, and then headed to the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, I thought we’d never find you in here. This place is packed,” Alexis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey. Thanks for coming.” I smiled as I lightly hugged her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked smoking hot in her short, tight, white skirt, black tank top, and black high heels. I introduced her to Aiden and she introduced me to two of her friends. We hung out, drank a lot, and danced. Alexis could move. I wondered how she would look dancing on a pole. I was getting hard just thinking about it. Her firm legs wrapped tightly around the pole as she slid around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come with me,” I said as I grabbed her hand and led her to the back of the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long hallway where the restrooms were and, at the end, there was a door on the left with a sign that said “storage.” I turned the knob and, surprisingly, the door opened. I led her inside and shut the door. There was a dim light that hung overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are we doing in here?” she asked with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to get you alone. I’ve been watching your hot body all night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me. My hands traveled to her enormous breasts, and, as I squeezed them firmly, her hand made its way down the front of my pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” I moaned as I broke our kiss and my tongue traveled down her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted her shirt over her head and unclasped her bra, feeling her bare tits in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“OMG. I’m going to come already,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she moaned as I kneaded her tits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took one hand and cupped her pussy from underneath her skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! Don’t touch me down there. I only want you to touch my tits.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved my hand back up to her breasts as she stroked my hard cock up and down firmly. I really needed to fuck her and she wasn’t going to allow me yet. I took down my pants as she continued stroking me. My lips wrapped themselves around her hardened nipple and, as I lightly sucked them, she let out a loud moan and tightened her body. She came. I couldn’t believe she came like that. I looked up at her and she smiled at me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-14.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
