Everything looked the same, and yet...she had a feeling something was different. Had her things been moved? It\u0027s Chicken Little time, Dana thought wryly. She picked up the telephone and called home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Daley answered the phone. \"The Evans residence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God she was still there. \"Mrs. Daley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Evans!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening. How is Kemal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he can be a bit of a devil, but I can handle him. My boys were like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then everything is...all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana\u0027s sigh was of pure relief. \"Could I speak to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly.\" Dana heard her call, \"Kemal, it\u0027s your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later Kemal was on the phone. \"Hi, Dana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Kemal. How are you doing, pal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And are you getting along all right with Mrs. Daley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she\u0027s rad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s more than rad, Dana thought. She\u0027s a miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you coming home, Dana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be home tomorrow. Have you had your dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It wasn\u0027t too bad, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana was almost tempted to say, Is that you, Kemal? She was thrilled at the change in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, darling. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow. Good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Dana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Dana was getting ready for bed, her cell phone rang. She picked it up. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a surge of joy. \"Jeff! Oh, Jeff!\" She blessed the day she had purchased the international cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to call you to tell you I miss you like bloody hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I miss you, too. Are you in Florida?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are things there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not good.\" She heard the hesitation in his voice. \"In fact, it\u0027s pretty bad. Tomorrow Rachel is scheduled to have a mastectomy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not handling it well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. It\u0027s rotten luck. Darling, I can\u0027t wait to get back to you. Did I ever tell you I\u0027m mad about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m mad about you, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything you need, Dana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Kemal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s getting along fine. I have a new housekeeper he likes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good news. I can\u0027t wait until we\u0027re all together again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither can I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You take care of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. And I can\u0027t tell you how sorry I am about Rachel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell her. Good night, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana opened her suitcase and took out a shirt of Jeff\u0027s that she had taken from the apartment. She put it on under her nightgown and hugged it to her. Good night, darling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly the following morning Dana flew back to Washington. She stopped at the apartment before going to the office and was greeted by a cheerful Mrs. Daley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s grand to see you back, Miss Evans. That boy of yours is wearing me out.\" But it was said with a twinkle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope he isn\u0027t giving you too much trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trouble? Not one bit. I\u0027m pleased at how well he\u0027s doing with his new arm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana looked at her in surprise. \"He\u0027swearing it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. He wears it to school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful. I\u0027m very pleased.\" She looked at her watch. \"I have to get to the studio. I\u0027ll be back this afternoon to see Kemal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be so glad to see you. He misses you, you know. You go on ahead. I\u0027ll unpack your bags for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mrs. Daley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana was in Matt\u0027s office telling him what she had learned in Aspen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was looking at her incredulously. \"The day after the fire, the electrician just goddamndisappeared ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Without collecting his paycheck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he was at the Winthrop house the day before the fire happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt shook his head. \"It\u0027s likeAlice in Wonderland. This gets curiouser and curiouser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt, Paul Winthrop was the next one in the family to die. He was killed in France not long after the fire. I\u0027d like to go there. I want to see if there were any witnesses to his automobile accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" Then Matt added, \"Elliot Cromwell has been asking about you. He wants you to take care of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s two of us,\" Dana replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kemal arrived home from school, Dana was waiting for him. Kemal was wearing his new arm, and it seemed to Dana that he appeared to be much calmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re back.\" He gave her a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, darling. I\u0027ve missed you. How was school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bad. How was your trip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was fine. I brought something back for you.\" She handed Kemal a Native American handwoven satchel and a pair of leather moccasins she had picked up in Aspen. The next part was difficult. \"Kemal, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to have to go away again for a few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana braced herself for his reaction, but all Kemal said was \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sign of an outburst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bring you back a nice present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One for every day you\u0027re away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana smiled. \"You\u0027re supposed to be in seventh grade, not law school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was comfortably settled in an armchair, with the television set on and a scotch in his hand. On the screen, Dana and Kemal were at the dinner table and Mrs. Daley was serving what looked like an Irish stew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is delicious,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. I\u0027m glad you like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you she was a good cook,\" Kemal said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like being in the same room with them, he thought, instead of watching them from the apartment next door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about school,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like my new teachers. My math teacher is tight...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boys are a lot nicer at this school. They think my new arm is rad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet they do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the girls in my class is really pretty. I think she likes me. Her name is Lizzy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like her, darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. She\u0027s phat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s growing up, Dana thought with an unexpected pang. When it was time, Kemal went to bed and Dana walked into the kitchen to see Mrs. Daley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kemal seems so...so peaceful. I can\u0027t tell you how appreciative I am,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re doingme a favor.\" Mrs. Daley smiled. \"It\u0027s like having one of my own children back. They\u0027re all grown now, you know. Kemal and I are having a grand time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana waited up until midnight, and when Jeff still had not called, she went to bed. She lay there wondering what Jeff was doing, whether he was making love to Rachel, and she was ashamed of herself for her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in the next apartment reported in. \"All quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeff, darling. Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m at Doctors Hospital in Florida. The mastectomy is over. The oncologist is still running tests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jeff! I hope it hasn\u0027t spread.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so, too. Rachel wants me to stay with her for a few days. I wanted to ask you if - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. You must.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will only be for a little while. I\u0027ll call Matt and tell him. Anything exciting going on there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant Dana was tempted to tell Jeff about Aspen and that she was going ahead with the investigation. He has enough on his mind. \"No,\" Dana said. \"All quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give my love to Kemal. The rest is for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff replaced the receiver. A nurse came up to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Connors? Dr. Young would like to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The operation went well,\" Dr. Young told Jeff, \"but she will need a lot of emotional support. She is going to feel less of a woman. When she wakes up, she\u0027ll be panicky. You have to let her know that it\u0027s all right to be afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Jeff said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And her fear and depression are going to start all over again when we begin radiation treatments to try to stop the spread of the cancer. That can be very traumatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff sat there, thinking about what lay ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she have someone to take care of her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me.\" And as Jeff said it, he realized he was the only one Rachel had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Air France flight to Nice was uneventful. Dana turned on her laptop computer to reexamine the information she had collected so far. Provocative, but certainly not conclusive. Proof, Dana thought. There is no story without proof. If I can\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice flight, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana turned to the man seated next to her. He was tall and attractive and had a French accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been to France before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dana said. \"This is my first time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Ah, you are in for a treat. It is a magical country.\" He smiled soulfully and leaned close to her. \"Do you have friends to show you around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m meeting my husband and three children,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dommage.\"He nodded, turned away, and picked up his copy ofFrance-Soir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana went back to her computer. An article caught her eye. Paul Winthrop, who had died in an automobile accident, had had a hobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRacing cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Air France plane landed at the Nice airport, Dana went into the busy terminal to the car-rental office. \"My name is Dana Evans. I have a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk looked up. \"Ah! Miss Evans. Your car is ready.\" He handed her a form. \"Just sign this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that\u0027s real service, Dana thought. \"I\u0027ll need a map of the south of France. Would you happen to - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, mademoiselle. \" He reached behind the counter and selected a map. \"Voila.\" He stood there watching Dana leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the executive tower of WTN, Elliot Cromwell was saying, \"Where is Dana now, Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s in France.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she making any progress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I worry about her. I think maybe she\u0027s traveling too much. Today travel can be dangerous.\" He hesitated. \"Very dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air in Nice was cold and crisp, and Dana wondered what the weather had been like on the day Paul Winthrop was killed. She got into the Citroen waiting for her and started driving up the Grande Corniche, passing picturesque little villages along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe accident had happened just north of Beau-soleil, on the highway at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, a resort that overlooked the Mediterranean Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Dana approached the village, she slowed down, observing the sharp, precipitous curves, wondering which one Paul Winthrop had gone over. What had Paul Winthrop been doing here? Was he meeting someone? Was he taking part in a race? Was he on vacation? Business?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoquebrune-Cap-Martin is a medieval village with an ancient castle, church, historic caves, and luxurious villas that dot the landscape. Dana drove to the center, parked the car, and went to look for the police station. She stopped a man coming out of a shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me, can you tell me where the police station is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Je ne parle pas anglais, j\u0027ai peur de ne pouvoir vous aider, mais - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Police. Police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, oui.\"He pointed. \"La deuxi��me rue a gauche.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merci.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"De rien.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police station was in an old, crumbling, white-walled building. Inside a middle-aged, uniformed policeman sat behind a desk. He looked up as Dana walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonjour, madame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonjour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Comment puis-je vous aider?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you speak English?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about it. \"Yes,\" he said reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like to speak to whoever is in charge here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her a moment, a puzzled expression on his face. Then he suddenly smiled. \"Ah, Commandant Frasier. Oui. One moment.\" He picked up a telephone and spoke into it. He nodded and turned to Dana. He pointed down the corridor. \"La premi��re porte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Dana walked down the corridor until she reached the first door. Commandant Frasier\u0027s office was small and neat. The commandant was a dapper man with a little mustache and inquisitive brown eyes. He stood up as Dana entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon, Commandant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonjour, mademoiselle. In what manner can I be of assistance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Dana Evans. I\u0027m doing a story for station WTN in Washington, D. C., about the Winthrop family. I understand that Paul Winthrop was killed in an accident around here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oui. Terrible! Terrible. One must be so careful driving the Grande Corniche. It can betres dangereux. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard that Paul Winthrop was killed during a race and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Non. There was no race that day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There wasn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Non, mademoiselle.

According to his statement, he was driving behind Paul Winthrop when he saw achien\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- a dog - run in front of Winthrop\u0027s car.
