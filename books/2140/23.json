By the time Ivan\u0027s snores had turned to the roaring yawns of morning, his green-bearded brother had fashioned a fair-sized raft of notched, interlocking logs, tied together by vines and rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan\u0027s first reaction, of course, had been one of doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye fool, ye\u0027ll get us both drowned to death!\" he said, hands on hips, feet wide-spaced, as if expecting Pikel to take the insult with typical grace and leap upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel only laughed and launched the raft. It bobbed in a shallow ebb pool at the river\u0027s edge in perfect balance and hardly dipped at all when Pikel hopped aboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a lot of coaxing and many reminders of sore feet, Ivan finally joined his brother on the craft, \"just to give it a test!\" Before Ivan announced his final intent, Pikel paddled the raft out into the main currents, where it drifted easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan\u0027s protests were lost in the sheer comfort of the journey, an easy glide. Pikel had fashioned the raft beautifully, creating a couple of amazingly comfortable seats, and even stringing a small hammock at one end of the craft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan didn\u0027t have to ask where his brother had learned to make such things. He knew that Pikel\u0027s weird druidic magic had been involved - obviously so! Some of the wood, like the chair he had taken as his own, seemed shaped, not carved, and the oar Pikel was using was covered in designs of leaves and trees so intricate that it would have taken a skilled woodcarver a tenday to fashion it. Pikel had done it in a single night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made great time that first day on the Surbrin, and on Pikel\u0027s suggestion, they continued right through the night. What a pleasant experience it was, particularly for Pikel, to be gliding on the easy currents under the canopy of twinkling stars. Even Ivan, so much the true dwarf, gained a bit more respect for elves under that amazing summer sky, or at least, he admitted some understanding (to himself!) of the elves\u0027 love of stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second day, the river edged closer to the towering mountains, running the line along the eastern edge of the Spine of the World. Shining walls of gray stone, spattered with green foliage and streaks of white, marked the right bank, and sometimes both sides, as the river wove in and out of the rocky terrain. It didn\u0027t seem to bother Pikel in the least, but it made Ivan fall more on his guard. They had recently battled orcs, after all, and wouldn\u0027t this landscape make for a wonderful ambush?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Ivan\u0027s insistence, they put up on the riverbank that second night, and in truth, the river was becoming a bit too unpredictable and rushed for travel in the dark anyway. Besides, the dwarves needed to resupply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain found them the next day, but it was a gentle one mostly, though it soaked them and made them miserable. At least the mountains retreated somewhat, the riverbank to the east falling away, and the mountain slopes on the west becoming more rounded and gently up-sloping. \"Think we\u0027ll find \u0027em today?\" Ivan asked early on. \"Yup yup,\" Pikel replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth dwarves retreated into thoughts of the real reason for their journey out of the Spirit Soaring cathedral. They had come to see Mithral Hall, to see King Bruenor\u0027s coronation. The prospect of viewing great dwarven halls, something neither of the brothers had done since their youngest years, far more than a century before, incited great joy in Ivan. His mind thought back to the most distant of his memories, to the sound of hammers ringing on metal, the smell of coal and sulfur and most of all mead. He could see again the strong, tall columns that supported the greatest chambers of his own home and believed that those of legendary Mithral Hall would probably exceed even those magnificent works by far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, to Ivan\u0027s thinking, as much as he loved Cadderly, Danica, and the kids, it would be grand to be among his own kind again, and in a place fashioned to the tastes of dwarves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at Pikel as he considered his anticipation and wondered, hoped, that perhaps being in a place like Mithral Hall might go a long way into guiding the \"doo-dad\" back to his true heritage. If Pikel could fashion such work as this raft out of wood, Ivan had to wonder how magnificent his art might be when working with the true dwarven materials of stone and metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Ivan\u0027s budding fantasy would have been more convincing to him if, in the middle of his contemplations, Pikel hadn\u0027t summoned down a large and incredibly ugly bird to his upheld forearm, then engaged in a long and seemingly detailed conversation with the creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talkin\u0027 to yer own level?\" Ivan asked dryly when the vulture flew away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel turned to his brother with a surprisingly serious expression, then pointed to the western bank and began steering the raft that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan knew better than to argue. His often silly brother had proven too many times that the information he could garner from animals could prove vital. Besides, the river was getting a bit more vigorous and Ivan longed to put his feet on solid ground once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they had the boat beached, Pikel grabbed his large sack of supplies, plopped his cooking pot over his head, and leaped away, rushing for the higher ground away from the riverbank. Ivan caught up to him a short time later, on a rocky mound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel pointed to the southwest, to a cluster of activity against the backdrop of the gray mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwarfs,\" Ivan remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe narrowed his eyes and shielded them from the glare with his hand. He nodded, affirming his own observation. They were indeed dwarves, and had to be from Mithral Hall, all rushing around, apparently working on defensive fortifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back to his brother but found Pikel already moving, cutting a straight line for the construction. Side-by-side they ran along the gently sloping ground, first down then up a steep trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short time later came a roaring command, \"Halt and be known! Be liked or be skewered!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brothers, understanding the seriousness of that tone, skidded to a stop before the closed iron gates set at the front of a stone wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burly red-bearded dwarf in full battle-mail rushed out through those gates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, ye don\u0027t look like orcs and ye don\u0027t smell like orcs,\" he said. \"Though I\u0027m not for certain what yerself looks and smells like,\" he added, scrutinizing Pikel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doo-dad,\" Pikel remarked,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ivan Bouldershoulder at yer service, and I\u0027m thinking ye must be in service to King Bruenor. This is me brother Pikel. We\u0027re coming outta Carradoon and the Snowflake Mountains, sent by High Priest Cadderly Bonaduce to serve as witnesses to the new king\u0027s coronation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier nodded, his expression showing that while he might not have understood all that Ivan had just said, he seemed to get the gist of it and seemed to think it a perfectly reasonable explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cadderly\u0027s a friend of that drow elf that runs about with yer soon-to-be king,\" Ivan explained, drawing a knowing nod from the soldier. \"He\u0027s still soon-to-be, ain\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier\u0027s expression turned sour for just a moment, his crusty features lightening, then widened in understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We ain\u0027t crowned him yet, as he ain\u0027t been in from Icewind Dale.\" \"We feared we\u0027d miss him,\" Ivan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye would\u0027ve if he\u0027d\u0027ve come right in,\" the soldier explained, \"but him and his found orcs on the road and\u0027re chasin\u0027 them down and putting them back in their filthy holes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan nodded with sincere admiration. \"Good king,\" he said, and the soldier beamed. \"Small band and nothin\u0027 more, so it won\u0027t be long,\" the soldier explained. He turned to the side and motioned for the brothers to come along. \"We\u0027re a bit short o\u0027 the ale out here,\" he explained. \"Come out fast from the halls to set the camp, while our brothers are up there on the west, setting another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a small band?\" Ivan asked skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not for taking any chances, Ivan Bouldershoulder,\" the soldier explained. \"We been fighting much o\u0027 late, and not too far from our memories arc them damned drow coming up from their deep holes. I\u0027m not knowing this Carradoon or them Snowflake Mountains ye\u0027re mentioning, but up here\u0027s a wild land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just got done fighting a few orcs ourselfs,\" Ivan replied. He turned to the river and nodded his bearded chin to the east. \"Out in the Moonwood. Me brother put us a bit outta the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oo,\" said Pikel, hardly taking the blame in stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah yeah, ye got us up here quick, even if ye did land us in a nest o\u0027 elves!\" Ivan admitted, and turned back to the soldier. \u0027\u0027Ores crawling everywhere, are they? Well, then I guess we come to the right place!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was spoken like a true dwarf, and the soldier appreciated the sentiment enough to slap Ivan on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see what ye\u0027re buildin\u0027,\" Ivan offered. \"Might know a trick or two from the south that ye ain\u0027t neared of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye heading out?\" came a soft voice, one that Drizzt Do\u0027Urden surely welcomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up from the small pouch he was preparing for the road to see Catti-brie\u0027s approach. The two had said little over the past few days. Catti-brie had retreated within herself, for private contemplations that Drizzt wasn\u0027t sure he understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just ensuring that the orcs were indeed chased away,\" the drow answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Withegroo\u0027s got patrols out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt offered a doubting smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. They\u0027re knowing the ground, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I soon will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me get me bow, and I\u0027ll take yer flank,\" the woman offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt looked up. \"It is a dark night,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking as if she had just been slapped, Catti-brie also let her gaze move about before settling it enough to stare back at Drizzt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got me a little headpiece here for just such an occasion,\" she remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom her belt pouch she brought forth the cat\u0027s-eye circlet that she often wore, one that magically conveyed heightened vision in very low light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as keen as a drow\u0027s eyes,\" Drizzt remarked. \"The ground is rocky and likely treacherous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie started to argue, to remind him that the circlet had served her even in the Underdark, and that this had never been an issue between them before, but Drizzt interrupted her before she could even get started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember the rocky climb outside of Deudermont\u0027s house?\" he asked. \"You hardly managed it. After the rain, the rocks here arc no doubt equally slick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Catti-brie looked as if he had just slapped her. His words were true enough. She could not pace him in the daylight, let alone in the dark of night, but was he saying that she would slow him down? Was he, for the first time since his foolish decision to go to Menzoberranzan alone, forsaking the help of his friends?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, offered the thin veil of a smile, slung his pack over his shoulder, and rose, turning away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie caught him by the arm, forcing him to turn and face her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye know I can do this,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt looked at her hard and long. His stern expression melted away into a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no better partner in all the world,\" he admitted. \"But ye want to go out alone this night,\" Catti-brie stated more than asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the drow nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie pulled him close into a hug, and it was one of warmth and love, with just a bit of sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt went out from Shallows soon after. Guenhwyvar was not with him, but he had the figurine close and knew that the cat would be available to his call should he need her. Barely fifty feet from the torchlit gate, the drow melted into the shadows, becoming one with the dark of night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the patrols from Shallows several times in the night and heard them long before they came into view. Drizzt avoided them easily every time. He did not want company, but his inner turmoil did little to dull his focus. Out there, in the dark, he was hunting as only a skilled drow might do, roaming the trails and the woods as silently as a shadow. He expected to find nothing, but he was seasoned enough to understand that those honest expectations would lean him toward the precipice of disaster if he embraced them too deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus he was not surprised when he found orc-sign. Prints showed themselves to Drizzt\u0027s keen drow eyes amidst a circle of sitting stones. They were fresh, very recent, yet there was no sign of any campfire or of any residue from a torch. Night had been on for some time, and all of the patrols from Shallows were human in make-up, and all of them were carrying torches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut someone had been there, someone human-sized or close to it, and someone traveling in the dark of night without any apparent light source. Given all the recent events, the fact that these were orcs-from the tracks, the drow figured there were two of them-was not hard to determine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither was the trail. The creatures were moving quickly and without much regard to their tracks. Within half an hour\u0027s time, Drizzt knew that he had closed considerably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not for a moment wish that Catti-brie or any of the others were at his side. He did not for a moment turn his thoughts away from the task at hand, from the dangers and needs of that very second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the cover of a low tree branch, the drow spotted them. A pair of orcs, crouched on a nearby ridgeline, peered around some lilac bushes toward the distant and well-lit town of Shallows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStep-by-step, each foot meticulously placed before the other, the drow closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut came his scimitars, and the orcs nearly jumped out of their boots, turning to see curving blade tips in close to their throats. One threw up its hands, but the other, stupidly, went for its weapon, a short, thick sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt got the blade out, even managed a quick thrust, but Drizzt\u0027s left hand worked a circle around the weapon, turning it down and out wide, while his right hand held his other scimitar poised for a kill on the other orc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could easily have killed the attacking orc at that moment-after the turning parry, he had an open strike to the creature\u0027s chest-but he was more interested in prisoners than corpses, so he brought his scimitar in against the creature\u0027s ribs, hoping the threat alone would end the fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the orc, stubborn to the end, leaped back-right over the north side of the ridge, which was, in fact, a thirty foot cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding his scimitar in tight against the second creature, Drizzt skittered up to the cliff edge. He saw the orc bounce once off a rocky protrusion, go into a short somersault, and smash hard onto the stone below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other orc bolted away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Drizzt could have killed it, but he stayed his hand and took up a swift pursuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orc went for the trees, rushing around strewn rocks, falling down one descent and scrambling up the backside. It glanced back many times during its wild flight, thinking and hoping that it had left the dark elf far behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Drizzt was merely oft\" to the side, easily pacing the creature. As it veered around one tree-the same tree from which Drizzt had been watching the pair a few moments earlier-the drow took a more direct route. Leaping onto a low branch, Drizzt ran with perfect balance and the lightest of steps along the limb. He hopped around the trunk to a branch heading out the other way, similarly traversed it, and fell into a roll at its end that landed him on the ground. The dark elf crouched down on one knee, with both blades pointed back at the rushing orc that was now heading straight for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orc shrieked and swerved, and Drizzt feigned a double thrust that sent the creature turning off balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt retracted the blades immediately and spun around, kicking out his trailing foot into the orc\u0027s trailing foot as it skittered, forcing its legs crossed and sending it sprawling face down to the rocky ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot really hurt, the orc flattened its hands on the ground and started to push back up, but a pair of scimitar blades touching against the base of its skull convinced it that it might be better to lie still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorchlight and noises in the distance told Drizzt that the commotion had roused one of the patrols. He called out to them, bringing them to his side, then bade them to take the prisoner to King Bruenor and Withegroo while he scouted out the rest of the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on Bruenor\u0027s face when Drizzt returned to Shallows some hours later puzzled the drow. Drizzt had expected either frustration from the dwarf because the orc wouldn\u0027t talk, or more likely, simple anger, the continuation of the feelings about the tragedy at Clicking Heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he saw on his red-bearded friend\u0027s face, though, was neither. Bruenor\u0027s look was more tentative in quality, his skin ashen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know?\" the drow asked his friend, sliding into a seat beside Bruenor, in front of a blazing hearth in the house the folk of Shallows had given them to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says there\u0027s a thousand out there,\" Bruenor explained somberly. \"Says that the orcs \u0027n giants are all about and ready to squish us flat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A ruse to force a lenient hand from his captors,\" Drizzt reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor didn\u0027t seem convinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How far\u0027d ye go out, elf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not very,\" Drizzt admitted. \"I merely ran the town\u0027s perimeter, looking for any small bands that might bring havoc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ore says the lands south o\u0027 here\u0027re crawling with its dirty kinfolk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again, it is a cunning lie, if it is a lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah,\" said Bruenor. \"The orc would of said the north then. That\u0027d be more believable and harder to make sure of. Putting them in the flatlands to the south makes the truth a patrol away. Besides, the squealing pig wasn\u0027t in any flavor to be thinking beyond them words that were coming outta its mouth, if ye get me meaning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shudder coursed Drizzt\u0027s spine as he did, indeed, get the dwarf\u0027s meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spoke pretty quick, he did,\" said Bruenor. The dwarf reached over the low arm of his chair and brought up a flagon of ale, moving it to his waiting lips. \"Looks like we might be gettin\u0027 a bit more fighting afore we find our way back to Mithral Hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That displeases you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Course not!\" Bruenor was quick to retort. \"But a thousand\u0027s a lot o\u0027 orcs!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt gave a comforting laugh, reached over and patted Bruenor\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear dwarf,\" he said, \"you and I both know that orcs can\u0027t count!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow sat back in his chair, pondering the potentially devastating news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps I should be out again at once,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rumblebelly, Wulfgar, and Catti-brie are already on their way,\" Bruenor explained. \"The town\u0027s sent scouts o\u0027 their own, and old Withegroo\u0027s promising to use some magic eyes. We\u0027ll know afore the turn o\u0027 dark if the orc was squealin\u0027 the truth or telling lies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true enough, Drizzt realized, and so he rested back again. He let his lavender eyes close, glad to be among such capable friends, particularly if there was any truth at all to the orc\u0027s dire tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I got Dagnabbit working hard on plans for getting us all outta here if there\u0027s too many or for holding off whatever might come if there\u0027s not,\" Bruenor rambled on, oblivious to his friend\u0027s descent into deep, deep rest. \"Might be that we\u0027ll find ourselfs a bit o\u0027 fun!
