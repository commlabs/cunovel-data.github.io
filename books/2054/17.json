Sensing my consciousness, she moved closer and licked the part of my cheek near my earlobe, her whiskers gently rubbing against my skin. It tickled. Squirming slightly, I opened my eyes. To my astonishment, light, color, and shapes came through to me - albeit in a blurred, distorted manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see,\" I muttered to Aubrey, trying to sit up. Immediately, myriad aches and pains screamed all over my body, making the motion difficult. I lay stretched out on my couch, an old afghan tossed over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you can see,\" Jerome\u0027s cold voice informed me. Aubrey fled. \"Though it\u0027d serve you right if you couldn\u0027t. What were you thinking, looking at an angel in full form?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t,\" I told him, squinting at his dark-clad shape pacing in front of me. \"Thinking, that was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lay off,\" came Carter\u0027s laconic voice from somewhere behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStraightening up and peering around, I made out his fuzzy form leaning against a wall. Peter, Cody, and Hugh also stood nearby in the room. It was a regular, dysfunctional family reunion. I couldn\u0027t help but laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you were there, and you were there...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody sat down beside me, his features materializing into sharp focus as he leaned in to study my face closer. Gently, he ran a finger along one of my cheekbones, frowning. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sobered up. \"Is it that bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he lied. \"Hugh was worse.\" The imp made a nondistinct noise across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already know what happened,\" snapped Jerome. I didn\u0027t need to see the demon\u0027s face in detail to know he was glaring at me. \"What I don\u0027t understand is why it happened. Did you actually try to come up with the most dangerous situation possible? \u0027Hmm, let\u0027s see... dark alley, no one around... \u0027 That sort of thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I shot back. \"I wasn\u0027t thinking of that. I wasn\u0027t thinking of anything except getting home.\" I related the evening\u0027s events to the best of my ability, beginning with the footsteps, ending with Carter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027d finished, Hugh sat down in an armchair across from me, pensive. \"Pauses, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way you tell what happened... you got hit, pause, then another one, pause, then another one. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, so? I don\u0027t know. Isn\u0027t that how fights work? Punch, draw back, get ready for another? Besides, we\u0027re talking about breaks of, like, a second or so. Not real breathing time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was nothing like that for me. I had slashing too. It was an onslaught. A stream of blows, continuously. It defied understanding or ability. Definitely supernatural.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, so was this,\" I countered. \"Believe me, I couldn\u0027t fight against it. It wasn\u0027t some mortal mugging, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re suggesting.\" Hugh simply shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence fell, and I gave the imp a sidelong glance to the best of my limited vision\u0027s ability. \"They\u0027re looking meaningfully at each other, aren\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carter and Jerome. I can feel it.\" I turned to Carter, suddenly wondering if my trip last night had been for naught. \"I don\u0027t suppose you salvaged the shopping bag I had on me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking over to my kitchen counter, the angel produced a bag and tossed it to me. My depth perception still off, I missed, and the bag bounced off the couch onto the floor. The book slipped out. Jerome snatched it up in an instant and read the title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck me, Georgie. Is this why you were out skulking in dark corners? This is what you nearly got killed for? I told you to lay off the vampire hunter investigating - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh come on,\" cried Cody, jumping up in my defense. \"None of us believe that anymore. We know there\u0027s an angel doing this - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An angel?\" I heard heavy amusement and even a scoff in the demon\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No mortal did that to me,\" I agreed hotly. \"Or to Hugh. Or to Lucinda. Or to Duane. It was a nephilim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nephi -what?\" asked Hugh, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that a character on Sesame Street?\" Peter spoke up for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerome stared silently at me for a moment, then finally demanded, \"Who told you about that?\" Not waiting for an answer, he turned toward the angel. \"You know you\u0027re not supposed to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t me,\" retorted Carter mildly. \"I\u0027m guessing she figured it out on her own. You don\u0027t put enough faith in your own people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did find out on my own, though I had help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI briefly detailed my string of leads, how one had led to another, from Erik to the book at Krystal Starz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" muttered Jerome, after listening to my spiel. \"Fucking Nancy Drew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" said Peter, \"compelling chase or no, you still haven\u0027t told us what a nephilopogus is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Nephilim,\" I corrected. Hesitantly, I looked at Jerome. \"Can I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re asking me for permission? How quaint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking that as acquiescence, I began uncertainly, \" Nephilimare the offspring of angels and humans. Like in that passage in Genesis. Where the angels fell and took human wives? Nephilim are the result. They have certain abilities... I don\u0027t know all of them... strength and power... like Greek heroes...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or like major nuisances,\" added Jerome bitterly. \"Don\u0027t forget that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How so?\" Hugh asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued when Jerome didn\u0027t. \"Well... what I read said they used to cause strife and slaughter among humans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but this one\u0027s not going after humans,\" pointed out Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter shrugged. \"They\u0027re unpredictable. They don\u0027t play by anyone\u0027s rules, and honestly, we\u0027re not really sure what this one\u0027s intentions are. It\u0027s playing a game, that\u0027s for sure, what with its attacks on random immortals and that note it sent Georgina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two notes,\" I corrected. \"I got another one just before Lucinda died, but I was with Seth all night and didn\u0027t read it until the next day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh and the vampires turned to stare at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were with Seth all night?\" asked Cody, astonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one\u0027s he again?\" Hugh asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The writer,\" provided Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe imp regarded me with new interest. \"What\u0027d you do \u0027all night\u0027 then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we not discuss Georgina\u0027s love life right now, fascinating though it may be?\" Jerome gave me a speculative look.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Unless, of course, this Seth person is someone of strong moral character and principle whose life energy you plan on stealing soon in support of the greater cause of evil and its goals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right on the first, not on the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it. I need a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerome wandered over to my liquor cabinet and sifted through its contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how can we spot this nephilim ?\" asked Cody, getting us back on track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced uncertainly at Carter and Jerome. I didn\u0027t know any of the technicalities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t,\" the angel announced cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can hide their signature too, then. Like higher immortals. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded back at me. \"Yes, they have the worst characteristics of both their parents. Ample power and pseudo-angelic abilities, mixed with rebelliousness, a love of the physical world, and poor impulse control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much power?\" I wanted to know. \"They\u0027re half-human, right? So half the power?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the clincher.\" Jerome looked much more cheerful with a glass of gin in hand. \"It varies wildly, just as each angel has a different level of power. One thing is clear: Nephilim inherit a lot more than half their parent\u0027s power, though they can never exceed it. It\u0027s still plenty - which is why I\u0027ve been trying to knock sense into all of you to stay clear. A nephilim could easily blow one of you out of the water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not one of you.\" Peter spoke the words more as a statement than a question, despite the uncertain note lacing his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither angel nor demon responded, and another piece clicked into place for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why you guys are going around with your signatures masked. You\u0027re hiding from it too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re merely taking appropriate precautions,\" Jerome protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It ran from you,\" I reminded Carter. \"You must have been stronger than it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably,\" he agreed. \"I was more concerned with you, so I didn\u0027t get a good sense. An angel in full form will freak most beings out - it\u0027ll kill a mortal - so I could have been stronger than it or not. Hard to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t like that answer, not at all. \"What were you doing there anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe angel\u0027s trademark sarcastic smile appeared. \"What do you think? I was following you around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started. \"What? Then I was right... that day at Erik\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God,\" said Peter, amazed. \"You really were on to something, Georgina. At least about him stalking you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt semivindicated, even if Carter obviously didn\u0027t seem to be the culprit anymore. Hugh had been right in accusing me of bias. I had really wanted Carter to be the responsible party for all these attacks, as a sort of payback for all the times he\u0027d mocked me. His timely intervention in the alley only muddled my opinion of him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter explained, \"After realizing that first note was probably from this nephilim, I thought it\u0027d be prudent to pop in once in a while since our friend here seems to have an especial interest in you. My intention was to catch him or her off-guard, not to help you, though I\u0027m happy to have been able to. Plus, that day at Erik\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at Jerome. The demon threw his arms in the air. \"Sure? Why not? Tell them. Tell them everything. They already know too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik?\" I prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This thing, this nephilim...\" Carter paused thoughtfully. \"This being knows a surprising amount about us and about the immortal community.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... it\u0027s like you said, right?\" asked Peter. \"This nephilim would find one of us and follow him or her around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I mean, yes, that\u0027s possible, but evidence indicates this one knows much more than simple surveillance might give it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Chrissake,\" Jerome snapped, \"if you\u0027re going to tell them, tell them. Stop speaking in riddles.\" The demon turned to us. \"He\u0027s saying this nephilim is working with a leak. Someone\u0027s feeding it information about the immortal community here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody caught the insinuation just as I did. \"You think Erik\u0027s doing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the strongest suspect,\" admitted Carter apologetically. \"He\u0027s been here for decades, and he has the talent to sense immortals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And to think, he spoke so well of you,\" I murmured, feeling aghast. \"Well, you\u0027re wrong. It\u0027s not him. Not Erik.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get huffy about it now, Georgie. He\u0027s not our only lead, just the most likely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I don\u0027t like it any more than you,\" the angel added. \"But we can\u0027t dismiss any possibilities. We need to neutralize this nephilim threat soon. It\u0027s out of hand; we\u0027ll get outside involvement before long, and that\u0027s always a pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why aren\u0027t you letting us help you?\" I cried. \"Why all the secrecy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you deaf? It\u0027s for your own protection. This thing could blast you to Armageddon!\" Jerome downed the rest of his gin in a flurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t buy it. There was more than just our safety at stake here. Jerome still hadn\u0027t come clean. \"Yes, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The committee meeting is over,\" he interrupted me icily. \"Would the rest of you excuse Georgina and me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit. I looked desperately at my friends, hoping they might stay and defend me, but they all scurried out. Cowards, I thought. None of them would cross Jerome when he spoke like that. Okay, I wouldn\u0027t have either in their shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter, I noticed, did not leave. The directive apparently did not apply to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Georgie,\" began Jerome carefully, once the others were gone, \"you and I seem to be facing off more often than not lately. I don\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not exactly facing off,\" I noted, squirming uneasily, recalling his display of power at the hospital and threat to \"stash\" me somewhere. \"We\u0027re just having differences of opinion lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Differences that can get you killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerome, this can\u0027t possibly just be about - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wall of power slammed into me, throwing me back against the couch. It was like one of those carnival rides where people stand along the sides of a round room that spins faster and faster until inertia pins everyone\u0027s limbs to the walls. Moving became agony. Even breathing was a struggle. I felt like Atlas, bearing the brunt of the world\u0027s weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerome\u0027s voice boomed inside my head, and some brave part of me cursed his parlor tricks, even as the rest of me recoiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need you to listen to me for once without constantly interrupting. You cannot keep poking around here. Doing so calls attention to yourself, and you already have a lot more of it on you from this nephilim than I would like. I neither need nor want a new succubus. I\u0027ve grown accustomed to you, Georgina. I do not want to lose you. I am more lenient with you than I should be, however. You get away with things no other archdemon would allow. I haven\u0027t minded indulging you thus far, but things can change -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;especially if you continue to be insubordinate. I can have you transferred somewhere else, away from this cozy delusion of a human life you\u0027ve established. Or I can call Lilithin and report your behavior to her directly. I\u0027m sure she\u0027d he happy to do a little retraining with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart stopped at the mention of the Succubus Queen. I had met her only once, when I first joined the ranks. That encounter, rather like seeing Carter in all his angelic glory, was not an experience I wanted to repeat anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you understand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Y-yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you sure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pressure increased, and it was all I could do to manage a weak nod. The psychic cage abruptly dropped, and I slumped forward, taking in deep breaths. I could still feel where his power had touched me, rather like a tactile version of the afterimage one sees with a camera flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you understand, and I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll also understand if I don\u0027t entirely believe you. It\u0027s part of the nature of our side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this... is this the part where you stash me somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled softly. Menacingly. \"No. Not yet at least. Frankly, I think you just need a little supervision to stay out of trouble. I\u0027m also not entirely convinced you and the nephilim merely have a passing relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA retort was on my lips, but I bit it off, my skin still burning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d have one of your friends do it, but I don\u0027t doubt you could wrap any of them around your smallest finger. No, you need babysitting by someone who won\u0027t bend, who won\u0027t fall for your tricks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tricks? Who then?\" For a minute, I half thought he referred to himself until I noticed Carter\u0027s smug smile. Oh man. \"You can\u0027t be serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll ensure you toe the line, Georgie. What\u0027s more, it will keep you alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re practically our best lead at the moment,\" Carter explained. \"This nephilim has some interest in you, even though that interest seems to have shifted a bit from note-passing to assault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carter will be ready if it tries to finish what he interrupted. He can also shield your apartment from prying eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027ll sense him when we go out - \" I tried weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more than you can now,\" Carter reminded me. \"And I\u0027ll be invisible. A ghost at your side. An angel on your shoulder, if you will. You won\u0027t even know I\u0027m around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerome, please, you can\u0027t do this - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can, and I will. Unless, like I said, you want me to have a chat with Lilith ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn him. The threat of Lilith was stronger than any potential stashing, and he knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. If there\u0027s no further discussion then, I\u0027ll take my leave and let you two get situated.\" Jerome glanced between us, dark eyes resting on me a moment. \"Oh, by the way. Do check yourself out in a mirror at some point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, thinking of Cody\u0027s scrutiny of my injuries. \"Thanks for reminding me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I\u0027m reminding you of is that you\u0027re a succubus. Those bruises are a manifestation of believing you\u0027re human. You are not. You have to feel them, but you don\u0027t have to wear them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, the demon vanished in an eye blink, leaving a faint smell of brimstone in his wake that I suspected was pure showmanship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, do I get the couch?\" Carter asked me cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to hell.\" I left the room to go check out my reflection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly a nice way to treat your new roommate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t ask for your - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped halfway down the hallway. I\u0027d spent the last couple of weeks suspecting Carter of murder and other terrible things; I\u0027d spent the last half-century hating him as a person. Yet he\u0027d just saved my life, and I hadn\u0027t uttered one word of thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned toward him, dreading what I now had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore a look similar to the one Jerome had had when I asked his permission earlier. \"Really? For just now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For not thanking you earlier. For saving me out there. I mean, I\u0027m not happy about you shacking up here, but I am grateful for what you did then. And I\u0027m sorry, too, if I haven\u0027t exactly been... nice to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe angel\u0027s expression was unreadable. \"Glad to have helped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot knowing what else to say, I turned and kept walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do now?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused again. \"Look at the damage and then go to bed. I\u0027m tired. And I hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, no slumber party games or popcorn? No makeovers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t take this personally, but you could use a makeover. You look like a refugee. Why...\" I swallowed and rephrased my words as I studied him. \"When I saw you out there, on the street, you were... you were so beautiful. The most beautiful thing I\u0027ve ever seen.\" My voice came out as a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter\u0027s face turned grave. \"Jerome\u0027s the same way, you know. In his true form. Just as beautiful. Angels and demons come from the same stock. He chooses that John Cusack wannabe shape by choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Why does he do that? And why do you choose to look like a junkie or a bum?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe edges of the angel\u0027s lips turned slightly upward. \"Why does a woman who claims she wants to avoid the attention of nice men choose a form that makes everyone around her do a double take and stare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed again, lost in the far reaches of his eyes, but not in the same way I had been lost in Roman\u0027s or Seth\u0027s eyes. It was more like the angel could see all the way through me, through all of my facades, down to my soul or what remained of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith great effort, I broke that scrutiny, turning back toward my bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one is punished forever,\" he told me gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? That\u0027s not what I hear. Good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went into my bedroom, closing my door behind me. Just before it clicked, I heard Carter call, \"So, who\u0027s making breakfast?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-blues-georgina-kincaid-1/page-17.html","bookId":2054,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:16 PM"}
