{"id":57845,"no":124,"title":"Vol 6 Chapter 7-3","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"If you must fight, then you have to promise not to attack the monk and werewolf, you can\u0027t go look for team India intentionally, and you can only sneak attack them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These three conditions aren\u0027t hard to understand. Based on my information, those two people aren\u0027t afraid of firearms. Perhaps your bow can reach a gun\u0027s power in close distance but they won\u0027t care about just a normal arrow. The only time you are allowed to attack them is when the situation is desperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As to the second condition. Our mission isn\u0027t to kill them but rather to stay alive. Even though our team may not take the victory but if the two of us died before the end, then the victory will be meaningless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The third condition isn\u0027t really a condition. But if you do encounter the other two members of team India then you better hide in the shadows and sneak attack them. Wait for your prey like a hunter and do not drown yourself in a difficult fight. This is my advice. Your technique is amazing. Being able to change the direction of an arrow can catch your enemy off guard. This point is better than some firearms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me also analyze your enemies. The monk and werewolf aside, there\u0027s the skinny man who used two curved blades. He isn\u0027t weak in close combat but you should be able to kill him with one shot. He\u0027s not that strong. The man who attacks with a needle seems to be able to control the needle with his mind and attack even when he can\u0027t see with his eyes. But simple deduction lets you know that he\u0027s not as strong as he had shown. In fact, his strength is dependent upon the Indian woman who can lock onto targets with her mind. His attacks are confined to where he can see without the aiming assistance. Which is actually weaker than a gun because he can\u0027t throw the needle into darkness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last woman can use a defensive skill, or magnetic field, or something else. This skill can block gunshots and in some sense, she counters you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng asked with curiosity. \"You left out one. What about the mind control woman? She should be able to find my location when I hide in the darkness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonglu laughed. \"Didn\u0027t Zero made a shot before he died? Perhaps that shot didn\u0027t kill anyone, since we didn\u0027t receive any points. But it definitely hit someone. Maybe it was that woman. And it was an injury that can\u0027t be healed. So she was killed by her own team in order to not give us the point! Otherwise we should be under her mind control or she had found our location by now. We can\u0027t escape the fate of being wipe as long as she\u0027s there. However we are still alive and this is evident enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them were retracing their steps back to the entrance. Heng walked in front as he carried Jie. This tomb was complex and dark. They would have been lost already if it wasn\u0027t for the torches on the walls. Honglu was also invaluable as he memorized the path they walked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng said. \"Does it mean that anyone who entered this world hated the real world, or was in despair? Are you also such?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonglu laughed. \"That\u0027s what Lan told me but I had indeed lost all hope in the real world or maybe I was tired of staying in that cage. Instead of staying in that cage, I might as well escape no matter how slim this chance is. This world doesn\u0027t disappoint me at least for now, just a bit annoying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng laughed along with him. \"It\u0027s surprising, sometimes I just forgot about your age as we talked. Like you were the same age as me and had lost hope with the real world. That time, I actually ran away because I recognized the person in front of me was a wanted criminal. When he looked at me I can\u0027t help myself but ran, and left her behind alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hoho, know why I must fight? Because I want to prove that I am not scared of dying. I have always been scared of blood since I was a kid. No, not just blood but rather scared of fighting and anything that can cause injuries or bleeding. I can\u0027t help but tremble and run whenever I think of such situations. Even when my heart doesn\u0027t want to but my body will still run away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng\u0027s body began trembling but he continued. \"I\u0027ve been to psychiatrists. And the cause after diagnosis was due to physical abuse by my step father as a kid. He would beat me for every little thing. Ever since I was six, it became an instinct for me to avoid any possible harm. But! I ran away that time! Even though I forced myself to go back after one minute but those gangsters and that criminal took Ming Yanwei on a car and left! I can\u0027t forgive myself for abandoning her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then she disappeared. She had probably given up on life with her personality. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to see her again. I was afraid to see those apathetic eyes of hers. Afraid she wouldn\u0027t even say a word of blame. I was a coward! I was really afraid!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I killed them, using the composite bow I used for training. I killed those gangsters one by one. I had to close my eyes halfway every time I shot. Then I would vomit and experience pain afterward. When I finally killed that criminal at last, I was also shot in the stomach. I thought I should just die like this. So I went back home, turned on the computer and took one last look at photo. Then...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he entered this world. Honglu understood that unfinished sentence. Even though he was just over ten years old but he knew these adult emotions. So he didn\u0027t say anything and just walked behind Heng quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! Listen carefully.\" Honglu suddenly stopped and said in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng paused for a moment then listened carefully. There were very faint sounds of footsteps coming toward them. Heng and Honglu looked at each other then knocked the torches on the sides to the ground. Heng handed Jie over to Honglu and said. \"Go stand in that corner. Don\u0027t move. Not even one bit. So even if I fail, they won\u0027t be able to find you. Don\u0027t worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonglu suddenly said. \"Stand on the opposite side of me! Listen to my order. When the light comes up, if I shout \u0027Go\u0027 then act as if you are going to shoot the woman but shoot the man instead. If I shout \u0027Come\u0027 then vice versa. If I don\u0027t say anything then shoot either one of them and run away deeper into the tomb to attract their attention and protect Jie and me. Can you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng nodded then stood on a corner in the opposite side. The fire on the torches had went out. Then two of them and Jie also hid in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t long before two sets of footsteps and the voice of a man and woman came through the darkness. The man said. \"She\u0027s almost dead. Even though we have hemostasis sprays but we kept dragging her on the ground when we move. Her blood is almost bled dry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman said. \"Then let me kill her. I don\u0027t know how many points we are going to get deducted in this movie. You can\u0027t let me just get erased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man said with dissatisfaction. \"Who knows how many points you are hiding from us. She\u0027s going to... Wait, somethings not right in front of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman opened her arms immediately and a translucent defensive field appeared around her. The man immediately said. \"The leader\u0027s order is for you to protect me! Not just yourself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman said. \"I will when we fight in a bit. I can only cast a defensive field enough to cover one person right now. It\u0027s so dark in front. Why don\u0027t we go back and find another path?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked at it cautiously. \"I won\u0027t go back. The fight between leader and team China\u0027s leader may have ended already. I just hope we can find Imhotep as soon as possible. Would it be that the scarabs knocked the torches off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman took a torch from the wall and handed it to the man. \"Go take a look and yell if there\u0027s danger. Don\u0027t worry, I will put the defensive field on you in a bit. Ok?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gritted his teeth then looked at the bag on his hand. He thought about handing the bag to the woman but he was worried. So the only way was to carry the bag along under his arm and held onto the torch with his hand. His greed wouldn\u0027t let him give up the points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man said as he walked cautiously. \"Nothing. How can there be enemies here.

The two arrows left the bow and shot at the man. The woman immediately cast the defensive field on him. Then they stared as the arrows close in on him. Before the arrows hit the defensive field, one of them hit the tail of the other and changed its direction. The arrow flew past the man. When he turned his head around, the arrow had hit the woman on her forehead, with its arrowhead penetrated deep into her brain!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both\"\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-6-chapter-7-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-6-chapter-8-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-6-chapter-7-3","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
