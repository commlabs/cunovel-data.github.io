{"id":66740,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Eddie. I\u0027m working on it.\" Thorne climbed out of the car again. He ran quickly through the rain toward the trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the side door, and went inside. The interior was inky black. He could see nothing at all. Everything was overturned. His feet crunched on glass. All the windows were shattered. He held the radio in his hand. \"Eddie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need rope.\" He knew that Eddie had all sorts of supplies squirreled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s in the other trailer. Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne crashed against a table in the darkness, \"Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There might be some nylon line in the utility locker,\" Eddie said. \"But I don\u0027t know how much.\" He didn\u0027t sound hopeful. Thorne pushed his way down the trailer, came to the wall cabinets. They were jammed shut. He tugged at them in the darkness, then turned away. The utility locker was just beyond. Maybe there would be rope there. And right now, he needed rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrailer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Harding, still hanging by her arms from the top of the trailer, stared up at the twisted accordion connector, leading to the second trailer. The pounding from the dinosaurs had stopped, and the other trailer was no longer moving. But now she felt water, dripping cold onto her face. And she knew what that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe accordion connector was beginning to leak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, and saw a tear had begun to open in the mesh fabric, revealing the twisted coils of steel that formed the connector. The tear was small now, but it would rapidly widen. And as the mesh broke, the steel would begin to uncoil, to lengthen, and finally snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had only minutes before the hanging trailer broke free and fell to the ground below,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe climbed back down to Malcolm, bracing herself to stand beside him. \"Ian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian, we have to get out of here.\" She grabbed him under his armpits, and pulled him upright. \"And you\u0027re coming with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, defeated. She had seen that gesture before in her life, that futile shake, giving up. She hated to see it. Harding never gave up. Not ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm grunted. \"I can\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to hear it, Ian. There\u0027s nothing to talk about. Now let\u0027s go.\" She was pulling him, and he groaned, but he straightened his body. She pulled hard, and got him up off the table. Lightning flashed, and he seemed to find some energy. He managed to stand on the edge of the seat, facing the table. He was unsteady, but standing. \"What do we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but we\u0027re going to get out of here....Is there any rope?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed straight down, toward the nose of the trailer, now hanging in space. \"Down there. Under the dash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned out into space, and spread her legs so she was braced against the floor opposite her. She was standing like a rock climber in a chimney. Twenty feet below her to the dashboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Ian. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm said, \"I can\u0027t do it, Sarah. Seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then lean on me. I\u0027ll carry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, damn it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm hoisted himself up, grasped a wall fitting, his arm trembling. He was dragging his right leg. Then she felt his weight on her, sudden and heavy, almost knocking her free. His arms locked around her neck, choking her. She gasped, reached back with both arms, grabbed his thighs, and lifted him while he adjusted his arms better around her neck. Finally she could breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" she said. \"Here we go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to make her way down the vertical passageway, grabbing at whatever she could, In places there were handholds, and when there were no handholds, she clutched at drawer handles, table legs, window latches, even the carpeting on the floor, her fingers tearing the cloth. At one point, the carpet came away in a big strip, and she slipped before her legs tightened wider, and she halted her downward slide. Hanging behind her, Malcolm wheezed; his arms around her neck were trembling. He said, \"You\u0027re very strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But still feminine,\" she said, grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was only ten feet from the dashboard. Then five. She found a wall grip, hung, dangling her legs. Her feet touched the steering wheel. She lowered herself down, easing Malcolm onto the dashboard. He lay back, gasping-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trailer creaked and swayed. She fumbled under the dashboard, found a utility box, popped it open. Metal tools spilled out, clattering. And she found a rope. Half-inch nylon, easily fifty feet of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up, staring down through the windshield at the bottom of the valley hundreds of feet below. Directly to her side, she saw the driver\u0027s door to the trailer. She twisted the handle, pushed it open. It clanged against the outer surface of the trailer, and she felt rain on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned out and looked up the side of the trailer. She saw smooth metal paneling, with no hand grips. But underneath the trailer, there must be axles and boxes and other things to stand on. Gripping the wet metal of the doorjamb, she bent over, trying to look at the underside of the trailer. She heard a metallic clanking, and she heard someone say, \"Finally!\" And a bulky shape suddenly loomed in front of her. It was Thorne, hanging on the undercarriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Christ\u0027s sake,\" Thorne said. \"What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation? Let\u0027s go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Ian,\" she said. \"He\u0027s hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical, Kelly thought, looking at Arby in the high hide. When things got tough, he just couldn\u0027t handle it. Too much emotion, too much tension, and he got all trembly and weird. Arby had long since turned away from the cliff, and now was looking out the other side of the shelter, toward the river. Almost as if nothing was going on. Typical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly turned back to Levine. \"What\u0027s happening now?\" she said. \"Thorne just went in,\" Levine said, peering through the goggles. \"He went in? You mean, in the trailer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And now...someone\u0027s coming out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Sarah. She\u0027s getting everybody out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly strained in the night, trying to see. The rain had almost stopped; there was only a light drizzle now. Across the valley, the trailer still swung free in space. She thought she could make out a figure, clinging to the undercarriage. But she couldn\u0027t be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s she doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Climbing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Levine said. \"Alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Harding came out through the door, twisting her body in the rain. She did not look down. She knew the valley was five hundred feet below her. She could feel the trailer swinging. She had the rope slung around her shoulder. She edged around, lowered her leg, and stood on a gearbox. She felt with her hand, gripped a cable. Swung around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne was inside the trailer, talking to her. \"We\u0027ll never get Malcolm up without a rope,\" he said. \"Can you climb it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning flashed. She stared straight up at the underside of the trailer, glistening wet with rain. She saw the slick learn of grease. Then blackness again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah: can you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. She reached up, and started to climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the high hide, Kelly was saying, \"Where is she? What\u0027s happening? Is she all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine watched through the glasses. \"She\u0027s climbing,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArby listened to their voices distantly. He was turned away, staring off at the river in the darkened plain. He waited impatiently for the next lightning flash. Waited to see if it was true, what he had seen earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not know how, but slipping and sliding, she somehow got to the top of the cliff, and flung herself over the side. There was no time to waste; she uncoiled the rope, and crawled beneath the second trailer. She looped the rope through a metal bracket, quickly knotted it. Then she went back to the edge of the cliff, and threw the rope down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc!\" she shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding at the trailer door, Thorne caught the rope, and tied it around Malcolm. Malcolm groaned. \"Let\u0027s go,\" Thorne said. He put his arm around Malcolm and swung them both out, until they were standing on the gearbox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ,\" Malcolm said, looking upward. But Sarah was already pulling him, the rope tightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just use your arms,\" Thorne said. Malcolm started to rise; in a few moments, he was ten feet above Thorne. Sarah was up on the cliff, but Thorne couldn\u0027t see her; Ian\u0027s body blocked his view. Thorne began to climb, his legs struggling for purchase. The underside of the trailer was slippery. He thought: I should have made it nonskid. But who would ever make the undercarriage of a vehicle nonskid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his mind\u0027s eye, he saw the accordion connector, tearing...slowly tearing...opening wider....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed upward. Hand over hand. Foot by foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning flashed, and he realized that they were close to the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah was standing on the edge of the cliff, reaching down for Malcolm. Malcolm was pulling himself up with his arms; his legs swung limp, free. But he was still going. Another few feet...Sarah grabbed Malcolm by the shirt collar, and hauled him up the rest of the way. Malcolm flopped over, out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne continued up. His feet slipped. His arms ached. He climbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah was reaching down to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Doc,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand was extended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingers reaching toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a metallic whang! the mesh ripped on the connector, and the trailer dropped down ten feet, the coils widening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne climbed faster. Looking up toward Sarah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand still reached down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do it, Doc....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed, closing his eyes, just climbing, holding the rope, gripping it tightly. His arms ached, his shoulders ached, and the rope seemed to become smaller in his hands. He twisted it around his fist, trying to hold on. But at the last moment he began to slip, and then he felt a sudden burning pain in his scalp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about that,\" Sarah said, and she pulled him up by his hair. The pain was intense but he didn\u0027t care, he hardly noticed, because now he was alongside the accordion connector, watching the coils pop free like a bursting corset, and the trailer dropped lower but she still pulled him, she was immensely strong, and then his fingers touched wet grass, and he was over the side. Safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath them, there was a sharp series of metallic sounds - whang whang! whang! -as the coiled metal rods snapped one after another and then, with a final groan, the trailer broke all connection, and fell free down the cliff face, growing smaller and smaller, until it smashed on the rocks far below. In the glare of lightning, it looked like a crumpled paper bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne turned, and looked up at Sarah. \"Thanks,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah sat heavily on the ground beside him. Blood dripped from her bandaged head. She opened her fingers, and released a handful of his gray hair, which fell in a wet clump onto the grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell of a night,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Hide\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching through the night-vision glasses, Levine said, \"They made it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly said, \"All of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! They made it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly began to jump and cheer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArby turned, and grabbed the glasses out of Levine\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Levine said. \"Just a minute - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need them,\" Arby said. He spun back around and looked out at the dark plain. For a moment, he couldn\u0027t see anything, just a green blur. His fingers found the focus knob, he twisted it quickly, and the image came into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell is so important?\" Levine said irritably. \"That\u0027s an expensive piece of equipment - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they all heard the snarling. It was coming closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn pale shades of luminous green, Arby saw the raptors clearly. There were twelve of them, moving in a loose cluster through the grass, heading in the direction of the high hide. One animal was a few yards ahead and seemed to be the leader; but it was hard to discern any organization in the pack. The raptors were all snarling and licking the blood off their snouts, wiping their faces with their clawed forearms, a gesture oddly intelligent, almost human. In the night-vision glasses, their eyes glowed bright green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did not seem to have noticed the high hide. They never looked up toward it. But they were certainly headed in that direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, the glasses were yanked out of Arby\u0027s hands. \"Excuse me,\" Levine said. \"I think I\u0027d better handle this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArby said, \"You wouldn\u0027t even know about it, if it wasn\u0027t for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be quiet,\" Levine said. He brought the glasses to his eyes, focused them, and sighed at what he saw. Twelve animals, about twenty yards away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie said quietly, \"Do they see us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. And we\u0027re downwind of them, so they won\u0027t smell us. My guess is they\u0027re following the game trail that runs past the hide. If we\u0027re quiet, they\u0027ll go right past us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie\u0027s radio crackled. He hastily reached to turn it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all stared out at the plain. The night was now calm and still. The rain had stopped, and the moon was breaking through thinning clouds. Faintly, they saw the approaching animals, dark against the silver grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie whispered, \"Can they get up here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see how,\" Levine whispered. \"We\u0027re almost twenty feet above the ground. I think we\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said they can climb trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ssssh. This isn\u0027t a tree. Now, everybody down, and quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm winced in pain as Thorne stretched him out on a table in the second trailer. \"I don\u0027t seem to have much luck on these expeditions, do I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t,\" Sarah said. \"Just take it easy, Ian.\" Thorne held a flashlight while she cut away Malcolm\u0027s trouser. He had a deep gash on his right leg, and he had lost a lot of blood. She said, \"We have a medical kit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne said, \"I think there\u0027s one outside, where we store the bike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne went outside to get it. Malcolm and Harding were alone in the trailer. She shone the light into the wound, peering closely. Malcolm said, \"How bad is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be worse,\" she said lightly. \"You\u0027ll survive.\" In fact, the wound cut deep, almost to the bone. Somehow it had missed the artery; that was lucky. But the gash was filthy - she saw grease and bits of leaves mashed into the ragged red muscle. She\u0027d have to clean it out, but she\u0027d wait for the morphine to take effect first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah,\" Malcolm said, \"I owe you my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind, Ian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian,\" she said, looking at him. \"This sincerity is not like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll pass,\" he said, and smiled a little. She knew he must be in pain. Thorne returned with the medical kit, and she filled the syringe, tapped out the bubbles, and injected it into Malcolm\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted. \"Ow. How much did you give me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I have to clean the wound out, Ian. And you\u0027re not going to like it when I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm sighed. He turned to Thorne. \"It\u0027s always something, isn\u0027 t it? Go on, Sarah, do your damnedest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine watched the approaching raptors through the night glasses. They moved in a loose group, with their characteristic hopping gait. He watched, hoping to see some organization in the pack, some structure, some sign of a dominance hierarchy. Velociraptors were intelligent and it made sense that they would organize themselves hierarchically, and that this would appear in their spatial configuration. But he could see nothing. They were like a band of marauders, shapeless, hissing and snapping at one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNear Levine in the high hide, Eddie and the kids were crouched down. Eddie had his arms around the kids, comforting them. The boy especially was panicky. The girl seemed to be okay. She was calmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine didn\u0027t understand why anyone was afraid. They were perfectly secure, high up here. He watched the approaching pack with academic detachment, trying to discern a pattern in their rapid movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no doubt they were following the game trail. Their path exactly matched the paras earlier in the day: up from the river, then over the slight rise, and along the back of the high hide. The raptors paid no attention to the hide itself. They seemed mostly to interact with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe animals came around the side of the structure, and were about to continue on, when the nearest animal paused. It fell behind the rest of the pack, sniffing the air. Then it bent over, and began to poke its snout through the grass around the bottom of the hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it doing? Levine wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe solitary raptor growled. It continued to root in the grass. And then it came up with something in its hand, something it held in its clawed fingers. Levine squinted, trying to see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a piece of wrapping paper from a candy bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor looked up at the high hide, its eyes glowing. It stared right at Levine. And it snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel okay?\" Thorne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better all the time,\" Malcolm said. He sighed. His body relaxed. \"You know, there\u0027s a reason why people like morphine,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Harding adjusted the inflatable plastic splint around Malcolm\u0027s leg. She said to Thorne, \"How long until the helicopter comes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne glanced at his watch. \"Less than five hours. Dawn tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarding nodded. \"Okay. He\u0027ll be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" Malcolm said, in a dreamy voice. \"I\u0027m just sad that the experiment is over. And \u0027it was such a good experiment, too. So elegant. So unique. Darwin never knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarding said to Thorne, \"I\u0027m going to clean this out now. Hold his leg for me.\" More loudly, she said, \"What didn\u0027t Darwin know, Ian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That life is a complex system,\" he said, \"and everything that goes along with that. Fitness landscapes. Adaptive walks. Boolean nets. Self-organizing behavior. Poor man. Ouch! What are you doing there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tell us,\" Harding said, bent over the wound. \"Darwin had no idea...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That life is so unbelievably complex,\" Malcolm said. \"Nobody realizes it. I mean, a single fertilized egg has a hundred thousand genes, which act in a coordinated way, switching on and off at specific times, to transform that single cell into a complete living creature. That one cell starts to divide, but the subsequent cells are different. They specialize. Some are nerve. Some are gut. Some are limb. Each set of cells begins to follow its own program, developing, interacting. Eventually there are two hundred and fifty different kinds of cells, all developing together, at exactly the right time. Just when the organism needs a circulatory system, the heart starts pumping. Just when hormones are needed, the adrenals start to make them. Week after week, this unimaginably complex development proceeds perfectly - perfectly. It\u0027s incredible. No human activity comes close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, you ever build a house? A house is simple in comparison. But even so, workmen build the stairs wrong, they put the sink in backward, the tile man doesn\u0027t show up when he\u0027s supposed to. All kinds of things go wrong. And yet the fly that lands on the workman\u0027s lunch is perfect. Ow! Take it easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" she said, continuing to clean his wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the point,\" Malcolm said, \"is that this intricate developmental process in the cell is something we can barely describe, let alone understand. Do you realize the limits of our understanding? Mathematically, we can describe two things interacting, like two planets in space. Three things interacting - three planets in space - well, that becomes a problem. Four or five things interacting, we can\u0027t really do it. And inside the cell, there\u0027s one hundred thousand things interacting. You have to throw up your hands. It\u0027s so complex - how is it even possible that life ever happens at all? Some people think the answer is that living forms organize themselves. Life creates its own order, the way crystallization creates order. Some people think life crystallizes into being, and that\u0027s how the complexity is managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, if you didn\u0027t know any physical chemistry, you could look at a crystal and ask all the same questions. You\u0027d see those beautiful spars, those perfect geometric facets, and you could ask, What\u0027s controlling this process? How does the crystal end up so perfectly formed - and looking so much like other crystals? But it turns out a crystal is just the way molecular forces arrange themselves in solid form. No one controls it. It happens on its own. To ask a lot of questions about a crystal means you don\u0027t understand the fundamental nature of the processes that led to its creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So maybe living forms are a kind of crystallization. Maybe life just happens. And maybe, like crystals, there\u0027s a characteristic order to living things that is generated by their interacting elements. Okay. Well, one of the things that crystals teach us is that order can arise very fast. One minute you have a liquid, with all the molecules moving randomly. The next minute, a crystal forms, and all the molecules are locked in order. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Now. Think of the interaction of life forms on the planet to make an ecosystem. That\u0027s even more complex than a single animal. All the arrangements are very complicated. Like the yucca plant. You know about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The yucca plant depends on a particular moth which gathers pollen into a ball, and carries the ball to a different plant - not a different flower on the same plant - where it rubs the ball on the plant, fertilizing it. Only then does the moth lay its eggs. The yucca plant can\u0027t survive without the moth. The moth can\u0027t survive without the plant. Complex interactions like that make you think maybe behavior is a kind of crystallization, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re speaking metaphorically?\" Harding said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m talking about all the order in the natural world,\" Malcolm said. \"And how perhaps it can emerge fast, through crystallization. Because complex animals can evolve their behavior rapidly. Changes can occur very quickly. Human beings are transforming the planet, and nobody knows whether it\u0027s a dangerous development or not. So these behavioral processes can happen faster than we usually think evolution occurs. In ten thousand years human beings have gone from hunting to farming to cities to cyberspace. Behavior is screaming forward, and it might be nonadaptive. Nobody knows. Although personally, I think cyberspace means the end of our species.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes? Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it means the end of innovation,\" Malcolm said. \"This idea that the whole world is wired together is mass death. Every biologist knows that small groups in isolation evolve fastest. You put a thousand birds on an ocean island and they\u0027ll evolve very fast. You put ten thousand on a big continent, and their evolution slows down. Now, for our own species, evolution occurs mostly through our behavior. We innovavate new behavior to adapt. And everybody on earth knows that innovation only occurs in small groups. Put three people on a committee and they may get something done. Ten people, and it gets harder. Thirty people, and nothing happens. Thirty million, it becomes impossible. That\u0027s the effect of mass media - it keeps anything from happening. Mass media swamps diversity. It makes every place the same. Bangkok or Tokyo or London: there\u0027s a McDonald\u0027s on one corner, a Benneton on another, a Gap across the street. Regional differences vanish. All differences vanish. In a mass-media world, there\u0027s less of everything except the top ten books, records, movies, ideas. People worry about losing species diversity in the rain forest. But what about intellectual diversity - our most necessary resource? That\u0027s disappearing faster than trees. But we haven\u0027t figured that out, so now we\u0027re planning to put five billion people together in cyberspace. And it\u0027ll freeze the entire species. Everything will stop dead in its tracks. Everyone will think the same thing at the same time. Global uniformity. Oh, that hurts. Are you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost,\" Harding said. \"Hang on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And believe me, it\u0027ll be fast. If you map complex systems on a fitness landscape, you find the behavior can move so fast that fitness can drop precipitously. It doesn\u0027t require asteroids or diseases or anything else. It\u0027s just behavior that suddenly emerges, and turns out to be fatal to the creatures that do it. My idea was that dinosaurs - being complex creatures - might have undergone some of these behavioral changes. And that led to their extinction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, all of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just takes a few,\" Malcolm said. \"Some dinosaur roots in the swamps around the inland sea, changes the water circulation, and destroys the plant ecology that twenty other species depend on. Bang! They\u0027re gone. That causes still more dislocations. A predator dies off, and its prey grow unchecked. The ecosystem becomes unbalanced. More things go wrong. More species die. And suddenly it\u0027s over. It could have happened that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just behavior...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Malcolm said. \"Anyway, that was the idea. And I had this nice thought that we might prove it....But now it\u0027s finished. We have to get out of here. You better tell the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne clicked on the radio. \"Eddie? It\u0027s Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eddie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio crackled. And then they heard a noise that at first sounded like static. It was a moment before they realized it was a high-pitched human scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Hide\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of the raptors hissed as it began jumping up, clattering against the high hide shaking the structure. Its claws raked against the metal, and it fell down again. Eddie was astonished at how high it jumped - the animal could leap eight feet straight up, again and again, without apparent effort. Its jumps attracted the other animals, which slowly came back to circle the hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon the hide was surrounded by leaping, snarling raptors. It swayed back and forth as the animals slammed into it, clawed for purchase, and fell back again. But more ominously, Levine saw, they were learning. Already, some of them had begun to use their clawed forearms to grip the structure, holding on while their legs got footing. One of the raptors came within a few feet of their little shelter before finally falling back. The falls never seemed to hurt the animals. They immediately leapt up, and jumped again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie and the kids scrambled to their feet. Levine said, \"Get back! Don\u0027t look out,\" and he pushed the kids into the center of the shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie was bent over his knapsack, and held up an incandescent flare. He poppcd it and flung it over the side; two of the raptors fell away. The flare sputtered an the wet ground, casting harsh red shadows. But the raptors kept coming. Eddie pulled up one of the aluminum bars from the floor, leaned over the side railing brandishing the bar like a club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the raptors had already climbed high enough to dart forward, jaws gaping, at Eddie\u0027s neck. Surprised, Eddie shouted and jerked his head back; the raptor narrowly missed him, but its jaws closed on his shirt. Then the raptor fell back, jaws clenched tight, and its weight pulled Eddie forward over the failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yelled \"Help me! Help!\" as he started to topple over the side; Levine threw his arms around him, dragging him back. Levine looked past Eddie\u0027s shoulder at the raptor, which was now dangling in space, hissing furiously, still gripping the shirt. Eddie pounded the raptor on the snout with his bar. But the raptor held on like a bulldog. Eddie was bent precariously over the railing; he might fall at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jabbed the bar into the animal\u0027s eye, and abruptly the raptor released its grip. The two men fell back into the shelter. When they got to their feet, they saw raptors climbing up the sides of the hide. As they appeared at the rail, Eddie swung at them with the strut, knocking them back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quick!\" he shouted to the kids. \"Up on the roof! Quick!\" Kelly started climbing one of the struts, then pushed herself easily up onto the roof. Arby stood there, his expression blank. She looked back down and said, \"Come on, Arb!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was frozen, his eyes wide with fear. Levine ran to help him, lifted him up. Eddie was swinging the strut in wide arcs, the metal smacking against the raptors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the raptors caught the strut in its jaws and jerked it hard. Eddie lost his balance, twisted, and fell backward, toppling over the side. He cried \"Nooo!\" as he fell. Immediately all the animals dropped down to the ground. They heard Eddie screaming in the night. The raptors snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine was terrified. He was still holding Arby in his arms, Pushing him up to the roof \"Go on,\" he kept saying. \"Go on. Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the roof, Kelly was saying, \"You can do it, Arb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy gripped the roof, pulling himself up, his legs churning in panic. He kicked Levine hard in the mouth and Levine dropped him. He saw the boy slide away, and drop backward to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Christ,\" Levine said. \"Oh Christ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne was underneath the trailer, unhooking the cable. He released it, crawled out, and sprinted for the Jeep. He heard the whirr of a motor and saw that Sarah had gotten onto the motorbike, and was already racing off, a Lindstradt rifle slung across her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got behind the wheel, turned on the engine, and waited impatiently while the cable winched in, the hook sliding across the grass. It seemed to take forever. Now the cable was snaking around the tree. He waited. He looked over and saw the light from Sarah\u0027s bike moving off through the foliage, heading down toward the high hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last the winch motor stopped. Thorne threw the car in gear, and roared away from the clearing. The radio clicked. \"Ian,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Don\u0027t worry about me,\" Malcolm said, in a dreamy voice. \"I\u0027m just fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly was lying flat on the angled roof of the shed, looking down over the side. She saw Arby hit the ground, on the other side of the structure from Eddie. He seemed to hit hard. But she didn\u0027t know what happened to him, because she had turned away to grip the wet roof, and when she looked back down again, Arby was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Harding drove fast on the muddy jungle road. She wasn\u0027t sure where she was, but she thought by following the terrain downward she would eventually come out onto the plain. At least that was her hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe accelerated, came around a curve, and suddenly saw a big tree blocking the road. She braked to a stop, spun the bike around, and headed back again. Farther up the road, she saw Thorne\u0027s twin headlights, turning off to the right. She followed his Jeep, racing her engine in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine stood in the center of the high hide, frozen with terror. The raptors were no longer jumping, no longer trying to climb the structure. He heard them down on the ground, snarling. He heard the sharp crunch of bones. The boy had never made a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold sweat broke out all over his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he heard Arby shout, \"Back! Get back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp on the roof, Kelly twisted around, trying to see down on the other side. In the dying light of the flare, she saw that Arby was inside the cage. He had managed to close the door, and was reaching his hand back through the bars, to turn the key in the lock. There were three raptors near him; they leapt forward when they saw his hand, and he pulled it back quickly. He shouted, \"Get back!\" The raptors began to bite the cage, turning their heads sideways to gnaw the bars. One of the animals got its lower jaw tangled up in the looped elastic band that hung from the key. The raptor pulled its head away, stretching the elastic, and suddenly the key snapped out of the lock, smacking against its neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor squealed in surprise and stepped backward. The elastic was now looped tight around the lower jaw, the key glinting in the light. The raptor scratched at it with its forearms, trying to pull the elastic loop off, but it was caught around the curved back teeth, and the animal\u0027s efforts just made the elastic snap on the skin. Soon it gave up, and began rubbing its snout in the dirt, trying to get the key off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile the other raptors managed to pull the cage free from the superstructure, and knock it over onto the ground. They ducked their heads, slashing Arby behind the bars. When they realized that wouldn\u0027t work, they kicked and stomped the cage repeatedly. More animals joined them. Soon seven raptors were clustered over the cage. They kicked it and it rolled away from the hide. Their bodies blocked her view of Arby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a faint sound, and looked up to see two headlights in the distance. It was a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArb was in hell. Inside the cage, he was surrounded by black snarling shapes. The raptors couldn\u0027t get their jaws through the spaces in the bars, but their hot saliva dripped down on him, and when they kicked their claws came through, slashing his arms and shoulders as he rolled. His body was bruised. His head hurt from banging against the bars. His world was swirling, terrifying pandemonium. He knew only one thing with certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptors were rolling him away from the hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the car came closer, Levine went to the railing and looked down. In the light of the red flare, he saw three raptors dragging what remained of Eddie\u0027s body toward the jungle. They paused frequently to fight over it, snapping at each other, but they still managed to haul it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw that another group of raptors were kicking and pushing the cage. They rolled it down the game trail, and into the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he could hear the rumble of the jeep engine, as the car came closer. He saw Thorne\u0027s silhouette behind the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped he had a gun. Levine wanted to kill every one of these damned animals. He wanted to kill them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp on the roof, Kelly watched the raptors kicking the cage, rolling it away. One raptor remained behind, turning around and around in circles, like a frustrated dog. Then she saw it was the raptor that had caught its jaw in the elastic loop. The key still dangled along its check, glinting in the red light. The raptor jerked its head up and down, trying to get free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jeep came roaring forward, and the raptor seemed confused by the sudden bright lights. Thorne accelerated, trying to hit it with his car. The raptor turned and ran off, out into the plain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly scrambled off the roof, and headed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne threw open the door as Levine jumped into the car. \"They got the kid,\" Levine said, pointing along the trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly was still coming down, shouting, \"Wait!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne said, \"Get back up there. Sarah\u0027s coming! We\u0027ll get Arby!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t lose them!\" Thorne grinned the engine, and started to drive down the game trail, chasing the raptors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the trailer, Ian Malcolm listened to the voices shouting over the radio. He heard the panic, the confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack noise, he thought. Everything going to hell at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hundred thousand things interacting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, and closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne drove fast. The jungle was dense around them. The trail ahead began to narrow, the big palms edging closer, slapping the car. He said, \"Can we make it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s wide enough,\" Levine said. \"I walked it earlier today. Paras use this trail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could this happen?\" Thorne said. \"The cage was attached to the scaffolding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Levine said. \"It broke off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see. A lot happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Eddie?\" Thorne said grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was fast,\" Levine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jeep plunged through the jungle, bouncing hard as it followed the game trail; they banged their heads on the cloth roof. Thorne drove recklessly. Up ahead, the raptors were moving fast; he could hardly see the last of the animals, sprinting in the darkness up ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wouldn\u0027t listen to me!\" Kelly shouted, as Sarah pulled up on the motorcycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The raptor took the key! Arby\u0027s locked in the cage and the raptor took the key!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There!\" she said, pointing across the plain. In the moonlight they could just see the dark shape of the fleeing raptor. \"We need the key!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet on,\" Sarah said, unshouldering her rifle. Kelly climbed behind her on the bike. Sarah thrust the gun into her hands. \"Can you shoot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I mean, I never - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you drive a bike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you have to shoot,\" Sarah said. \"Now, look: trigger\u0027s here. Okay? Safety\u0027s here. Twist it like this. Okay? It\u0027ll be a rough ride, so don\u0027t release it until we get close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close to what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sarah didn\u0027t hear her. She grinned the engine, and the bike accelerated, heading out into the plain, chasing the fleeing raptor. Kelly put one arm around Sarah, and tried to hold on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jeep bounced along the jungle trail, splashing through muddy pools. \"I don\u0027t remember it this rough,\" Levine said, clutching the armhold. \"Maybe you should slow down - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell no,\" Thorne said. \"If we lose sight of him, it\u0027s over. We don\u0027t know where the raptor nest is. And in this jungle, at night...Ah, hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp ahead, the raptors were leaving the trail, running off into the underbrush. The cage was gone. Thorne could not see the terrain very well, but it looked like a sheer hill, going almost straight down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" You can\u0027t do it,\" Levine said. \"It\u0027s too steep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to do it, \" Thorne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be crazy,\" Levine said. \"Face facts. We\u0027ve lost the kid, Doe. It\u0027s too bad, but we\u0027ve lost him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne glared at Levine. \"He didn\u0027t give up on you,\" he said. \"And we\u0027re not giving up on him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne spun the wheel and drove the Jeep over the edge. The car nosed down sickeningly, gained speed, and began a steep descent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" Levine yelled. \"You\u0027ll kill us all\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBouncing, they plunged downward into darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSIXTH CONFIGURATION\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Order collapses in simultaneous regions. Survival is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow unlikely for individuals and groups.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIAN MALCOLM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motorcycle raced forward across the grassy plain. Kelly clutched Sarah with one hand, and held the rifle with the other; the rifle was heavy; her arm was getting tired. The motorcycle jolted over the terrain. The wind blew her hair around her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on!\" Sarah shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon broke through the clouds, and the grass before them w as silver in the moonlight. The raptor was forty yards ahead of them, the animal just within range of their headlamp. They were gaining steadily. Kelly saw no other animals on the plain, except for the apatosaur herd in the far distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came closer to the raptor. The animal ran swiftly, its tall stiff, barely visible above the grass. Sarah angled the bike to the right, as they came alongside the raptor. They moved steadily closer. She leaned back, her month close to Kelly\u0027s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get ready!\" she shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were running parallel to the raptor, back by its tail. Sarah accelerated, passing the legs, moving toward the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The neck!\" she shouted. \"Shoot it in the neck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anywhere! The neck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly fumbled with the gun. \"Now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Wait! Wait!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor panicked as the motorcycle approached. It increased its speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly was trying to find the safety. The gun was bouncing. Everything was bouncing. Her fingers touched the safety, slid off. She reached again. She was going to have to use two hands, and that meant letting go of Sarah -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get ready!\" Sarah shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now! Do it! Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah swerved the bike, coming alongside the raptor. They were now just three feet away. Kelly could smell the animal. It turned its head and snapped at them. Kelly fired. The gun bricked in her hands; she grabbed Sarah again. The raptor kept running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You missed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly shook her head. \"Never mind!\" Sarah shouted. \"You can do it! I\u0027ll get closer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe angled the bike toward the raptor again, moving closer. But this time was different: as they came alongside, the raptor abruptly charged them, butting at them with its head. Sarah howled and twisted the bike away, widening the gap. \"Smart bastards, aren\u0027t they!\" she shouted. \"No second chances!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor chased them for a moment, then suddenly turned, changing direction, racing away across the plains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going for the river!\" Kelly shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah gunned the engine. The bike shot forward. \"How deep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How deep!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know!\" Kelly shouted. She was trying to remember how the raptors looked when they crossed the river. She seemed to remember they were swimming. That meant it must be at least -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than three feet?\" Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No good!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were now ten yards behind the raptor, and losing ground. The animal had entered an area marked with thick Benettitalean cycads. The rough trunks scratched at them. The terrain was uneven; the bike botinced and jolted over the bumps. \"Can\u0027t see!\" Sarah shouted. \"Hold on!\" She angled left, moving away from the raptor, heading for the river. The animal was disappearing in the grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you doing?\" Kelly shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to cut him off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrieking, a flock of startled birds rose up in front of them. Sarah drove through flapping wings, and Kelly ducked her head. The rifle thunked in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful!\" Sarah shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It went off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many shots do I have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two more! Make \u0027em good!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe river was up ahead, shimmering in the moonlight. They burst out of the grass and came onto the muddy bank. Sarah turned, the motorcycle swerved, slipped, and the bike shot away. Kelly fell, hitting the cold mud, Sarah landing hard on top of her. Immediately Sarah jumped up, running for the bike, shouting, \"Come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDazed, Kelly followed her. The rifle in her hands was thick with mud. She wondered if it would still work. Sarah was already on the bike, gunning the engine, waving her forward. Kelly jumped on, and Sarah headed up the riverbank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor was twenty yards ahead of them. Approaching the water. \"It\u0027s getting away!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne\u0027s Jeep crashed down the hillside, out of control. Palms slapped against the windshield; they could see nothing at all, but they felt the steepness of the incline. The Jeep fished sideways. Levine yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne gripped the steering wheel, tried to turn the car back. He touched the brake; the Jeep straightened and continued down the hill. There was a gap in the palms - he saw a field of black boulders looming directly ahead. The raptors were scrambling over the boulders. But maybe if he went left -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Levine shouted. \"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on!\" Thorne yelled, and he twisted the wheel. The car lost traction and slid downward. They hit the first of the boulders, shattering a headlight. The car swung up at an angle, crashed down again. Thorne thought that had finished the transmission but somehow the car was still going, angling down the hillside, moving off to the left. The second headlight smashed on a tree branch. They continued down in darkness, through another layer of palms, and then abruptly they banged down on level ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jeep tires rolled across soft earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne brought the car to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey peered out the windows, trying to see where they were. But it was so dark, it was hard to see anything. They seemed to be at the bottom of a deep gully, a canopy of trees overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alluvial contours,\" Levine said. \"We must be in a streambed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his eyes adjusted, Thorne saw he was right. The raptors were running down the center of the streambed, which was lined with big boulders on both sides, But the bed itself was sandy, and it was wide enough for the car to pass through. He followed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have any idea where we are?\" Levine said, staring at the raptors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Thorne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car drove forward. The streambed widened, opening out into a flat basin. The boulders disappeared; there were trees on both sides of the river. Patches of moonlight appeared here and there. It was easier to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the raptors were gone. He stopped the car, rolled down the window, and listened. He could hear them hissing and growling. The sound seemed to be coming from off to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne put the car in gear, and left the streambed, in moving off among ferns and occasional pine trees. Levine said, \"Do you suppose the boy survived that hill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Thorne said. \"I can\u0027t imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove forward slowly. They came to a break in the trees, and saw a clearing where the ferns had been tram led flat. Beyond the clearing, they saw the banks of the river, moonlight glinting on the water. Somehow they had returned to the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was the clearing itself that held their attention. Within the broad open space, they saw the huge pale skeletons of several apatosaurs. The giant rib cages, arcs of pale bone, shone in the silver light. The dark hulk of a partially eaten carcass lay on its side in the center, clouds of flies buzzing above it in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this place?\" Thorne said. \"It looks like graveyard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Levine said. \"But it\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptors were all clustered to one side, fighting over the remains of Eddie\u0027s carcass. At the opposite side of the clearing they saw three low mud mounds; the walls were broken in many places. Within the nests they saw crushed fragments of eggshells. There was the strong stench of decay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine leaned forward, staring. \"This is the raptor nest,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the darkness of the trailer, Malcolm sat up, wincing. He grabbed the radio. \"You found it? The nest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio crackled. Levine said, \"Yes. I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Describe it,\" Malcolm said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine spoke quietly, reporting features, estimating dimensions, to Levine, the velociraptor nest appeared slovenly, uncared for, ill-made. He was surprised, because dinosaur nests usually conveyed an unmistakable sense of order. Levine had seen it time and again, in fossil sites from Montana to Mongolia. The eggs in the nest were arranged in neat concentric circles. Often there were more than thirty eggs in a single nest, suggesting that many females cooperated to share a single mud mound. Numerous adult fossils would be found nearby, indicating that the dinosaurs cared communally for the eggs. At a few excavations, it was even possible to get a sense of the spatial arrangement, with the nests in the center, the adults moving carefully around the outside, so as not to disturb the incubating eggs. In this rigid structure, the dinosaurs were reminiscent of their descendants the birds, which also displayed precise courtship, mating, and nest-building patterns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the velociraptors behaved differently. There was a disorderly chaotic feeling to the scene before him: ill-formed nests; quarreling adults; very few young and juvenile animals; the eggshells crushed; the broken mounds stepped on. Around the mounds, Levine now saw scattered small bones which he presumed were the remains of newborns. He saw no living infants anywhere in the clearing. There were three juveniles, but these younger animals were forced to fend for themselves, and they already showed many scars on their bodies. The youngsters looked thin, undernourished. Poking around the periphery of the carcass, they were cautious, backing away whenever one of the adults snapped at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about the apatosaurs?\" Malcolm asked. \"What about the carcasses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine counted four, all together. In various stages of decomposition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to tell Sarah,\" Malcolm said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Levine was wondering about something else: he was wondering how these big carcasses had gotten here in the first place. They hadn\u0027t died here by accident, surely all animals would have avoided this nest. They couldn\u0027t have been lured here, and they were too large to carry. So how did they get here? Something was tickling the back of his mind, some obvious thought that he wasn\u0027t -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They brought Arby,\" Malcolm said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Levine said. \"They did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the nest, trying to figure it out. Then Thorne nudged him. \"There\u0027s the cage,\" he said, pointing. At the far side of the clearing lying on the ground, partially hidden behind fronds, Levine saw the glint of aluminum struts. But he couldn\u0027t see Arby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Way over there,\" Levine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptors were ignoring the cage, still fighting over Eddie\u0027s carcass. Thorne brought out a Lindstradt rifle, snapped open the cartridge pack. He saw six darts. \"Not enough,\" he said, and snapped it shut. There were at least ten raptors in the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine rummaged in the back seat, found his knapsack, which had fallen to the floor. He unzipped it, came out with a small silver cylinder the size of a large soft-drink bottle. It had a skull and crossbones stenciled on it, Beneath, lettering read: CAUTION TOXIC METACHOLINE (MIVACURIAM).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" Thorne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something they cooked up in Los Alamos,\" Levine said. \"It\u0027s a nonlethal area neutralizer. Releases a short-acting cholinesterase aerosol. Paralyzes all life forms for up to three minutes. It\u0027ll knock all the raptors out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about the boy?\" Thorne said. \"You can\u0027t use that. You\u0027ll paralyze him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine pointed. \"If we throw the canister to the right of the cage, the gas\u0027ll blow away from him, toward the raptors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or it may not,\" Thorne said, \"And he may be badly injured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine nodded. He put the cylinder back in the knapsack, then sat, facing forward, staring at the raptors. \"So,\" Levine said. \"What do we do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne looked over at the aluminum cage, partially blocked by ferns. Then he saw something that made him sit up: the cage moved slightly, the bars shifting in the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see that?\" Levine said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lost-world-jurassic-park-2/page-14.html","bookId":1710,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:13 AM"}
