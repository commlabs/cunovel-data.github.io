Some refer to it as \"epileptiform\" behavior. Others say that epilepsy per se is not the issue; they argue that any kind of brain damage - whether it produces epilepsy or not - may lead to episodic loss of inhibitions governing violent behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether or not one finds these explanations satisfactory, it seems unarguable that most neurologists who treat psychomotor epileptics as patients have found their patients to be very different from Harry Benson in THE TERMINAL MAN. The overwhelming majority of psychomotor epileptics are not violent or sexually disturbed; their seizures are under good control, and they lead rich and rewarding lives, holding good jobs and raising families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the face of considerable controversy among clinical neuroscientists, I am persuaded that the understanding of the relationship between organic brain damage and violent behavior is not so clear as I thought at the time I wrote the book. I believe that this is a research area that will prove enormously fruitful in the coming years. But in the meantime, I am concerned that I may have inadvertently hampered the attempts of well-controlled epileptics to function in a society that still retains a lingering prejudice against epilepsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Crichton\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLos Angeles\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecember 1972 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-terminal-man/page-25.html","bookId":1705,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
