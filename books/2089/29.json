I was unimpressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands shook. My heart raced. My eyes blurred. I\u0027d done it again. Fucked a monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the matter with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leigh - \" he began, and took a step in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fired, the bullet kicking up dirt at his feet. He hesitated but only for an instant. His long bare legs ate up the distance until he was standing far too close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy didn\u0027t I shoot him? He was the enemy. He could be anyone. He could be the one.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;My finger tightened on the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien grabbed the barrel and put it against his chest, exactly where his heart would be, if he had one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I care? Shoot me. You\u0027d be doing me a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, remembering the behavior of the brown werewolf the first night I\u0027d seen him. I\u0027d thought then that the wolf had wanted me to shoot him. Guess I\u0027d been right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you hate me, then kill me, Leigh. The only thing I\u0027ve ever found worth living for is you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared into his eyes and saw the love again. It terrified me. Was it real or just another lie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll my silly dreams rose up and choked me. I\u0027d envisioned a life with this man. Family. Children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gagged. He hadn\u0027t used a condom last time. What did that mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I was running - through the trees, back the way I\u0027d come. Away from him and all the confusing, heartbreaking things he made me feel. I reached my car. The thing was trashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had nowhere to go, except to my room. So I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo messages on my phone, no E-mail to answer. I drifted around the place trying to find something to occupy my mind. But I couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I could think about was Damien. The werewolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for the hate and loathing that usually filled me whenever I thought of the beasts. They didn\u0027t come. Instead, I remembered touching him, holding him, kissing him. I\u0027d loved him. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperate, I pulled out the picture of Jimmy, then the ones of my parents, my brother, my sister. I touched then-faces with a fingertip. I said their names out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emily, Greg, Carol, and Dan Tyler. James Renquist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGone because of me. Because of the monsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d sworn to kill them all. But I hadn\u0027t. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tugged a chair even with the door, took a seat, placed my rifle over my legs, and waited. I didn\u0027t have to wait very long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lock clicked; the door swung open. Damien\u0027s silhouette filled the opening. At least he\u0027d found his clothes. Would his body have distracted me even now? I didn\u0027t want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped inside and shut the door. \"Too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words reminded me of the nature of werewolves. They were damned, cursed, inhabited by a demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what was wrong with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" I asked. \" What are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve told you who I am. You saw what I can become.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lied to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. You knew I had secrets. Now I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. \"Splitting hairs, Damien.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Making jokes, Leigh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you Hector Menendez?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his eyebrows. \"Do I look like a Hector to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was lying, he did it very well. But then so had Hector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a shape-shifter,\" I accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never said I wasn\u0027t. What\u0027s your excuse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The DNR? Rabies? Please. You\u0027re a Jager-Sucher\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, so much for our secret society of monster hunters. Not that the werewolves didn\u0027t know someone was after them; they just didn\u0027t know who. By the time they saw a face, they were seconds away from being dead. Of course there were always a few that escaped - and after the debacle in Miniwa, who was to say how many of them knew more about us than we\u0027d like?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone here knows what I am?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. They\u0027d have killed you. I told them you were who you said you were. Besides, who\u0027d believe a Jager-Sucher would sleep with the enemy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me,\" I muttered. \"How long have you known?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first day you showed up. Jessie\u0027s one, too.\" He tilted his head. \"I\u0027m not sure about Cadotte. He doesn\u0027t smell like guns and death. But he\u0027s up to something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why haven\u0027t you tried to kill me if you know I\u0027m here to kill you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned against the wall, crossed his arms over his chest. His shirt was unbuttoned again. There was a cigarette sticking out of his pocket. I guess he didn\u0027t have to worry about cancer. Lucky him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured if you were nearby,\" he continued, \"I could keep an eye on you. Better the enemy you see than the one you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnemy? For some reason that hurt, even though it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" he continued, \"why would I kill someone who\u0027s doing the same thing I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Killing them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words fell between us like a boulder through a sheet of glass. My hands tightened on the rifle in my lap. \"You say that like you\u0027re different from the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze went to his ring finger. Maybe he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many did you have to kill before you became powerful enough to wear silver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien frowned. \"Silver? Oh!\" He lifted his hand. \"This? Platinum. My mother\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlatinum? I\u0027d heard of it, of course, just never considered one metal could so resemble another. I never thought being jewelry-challenged would be a problem in my line of work. Wrong again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give it to me,\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d just see what it was. At J-S headquarters. If the thing was made of silver... I didn\u0027t want to think about what that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled off the ring and crossed the short distance to drop it into my palm. I kept the gun ready. I still didn\u0027t trust him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the barrel, lifted his gaze to my face. \"I meant it when I said that I loved you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Save it,\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t think of that now. There were too many other problems to solve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand what you meant about becoming more powerful,\" he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m asking the questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI motioned with the rifle for him to back up. He was too close. I could smell his skin, feel the heat from his body. It made me want to touch him, made me wonder, again, if he had bewitched me somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe retreated to the door, closed it, and sat on the floor with his back against the wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you killing them?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadn\u0027t I just said I was asking the questions? He didn\u0027t take orders very well. Big surprise. I decided to answer anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m killing them because they\u0027re evil. Possessed. Murdering, demonic, soulless entities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ditto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"What the hell is that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree. That\u0027s why I\u0027m killing them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... so are you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was. Now I\u0027m different. You were right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept the gun pointed at his chest. But he didn\u0027t move from his position in front of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Start talking,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in the war - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What war?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" The war. World War Two. What other war is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien had been in World War Two? I looked him up and down. I\u0027d been told that werewolves lived forever appearing exactly the same age they had been when they were bitten. Of course I never had much of a chance to chat with them and discover if what I\u0027d heard was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027ve been quite a few wars since then,\" I pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None like that one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. Since the last war to end all wars, combat had changed. No more whole-scale invasions onto beaches. We had fighter jets, aircraft carriers, smart bombs. The face of modern warfare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmericans didn\u0027t see their enemy up close and personal anymore. Except for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI motioned with the gun. \"Get on with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was a part of the D-day invasion. Seen any film of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saving Private Ryan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a face. \"From what I heard, the movie was close, but the reality was much, much worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien was a werewolf, had done unimaginable things, but he couldn\u0027t bear to see a movie reenacting a battle. I wondered if the sadness in his eyes reflected more than werewolf guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made it past Omaha Beach and started through the French countryside. We were in a race to Berlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmericans on one side, Russians on the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the drill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Anyway, there were Germans all over the place. Snipers. Panzers. Damn circus. More so than I realized. We had just moved into Germany when they attacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted, looping his arms around his knees and hunching his shoulders. Staring at his hands, he continued. \"Hundreds of werewolves came out of the trees and swept over us like... like - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A werewolf army,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d heard the story of Hitler\u0027s monster legion, but I\u0027d never met anyone who\u0027d seen it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t have silver bullets. No matter how many times we shot them, they kept coming. They killed everything in their path. It was a slaughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you? How did you manage to survive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis light eyes flicked to mine, then away. \"I was young. Foolish. I wanted to live. I didn\u0027t realize what that meant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien took a deep breath as if bracing himself. \"When I saw what was happening, I ran and hid. The guns didn\u0027t work. Our tanks were too far behind to help. I\u0027m not sure if they could. No silver ammo in them, either.\" He emitted a short bark of laughter. \"One of the werewolves found me. I... I... begged for my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe refused to look at me. I waited for him to continue. What could I say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d seen so many of my friends die. On the beach, the march, in that forest. I was twenty-three, and I didn\u0027t want to die. So I begged. A mistake I\u0027ve paid for over and over again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wolf wasn\u0027t hungry anymore. He granted my wish and made me like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence settled over the room as Damien remembered what that meant and I considered it, too. If he had been a werewolf since 1944, how many had he killed? The possibilities boggled the mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I became possessed. The bloodlust is like nothing you can imagine, especially when you first become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re out of control. Being in Germany, during that time, I had no problem feeding the hunger. With my entire company wiped out, and pretty much strewn in pieces all over the countryside, disappearing wasn\u0027t a big deal. I was listed as killed in action. I never saw my family again.\" He took a deep breath, let it out slowly. \"How could I when I was like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSympathy sparked in my chest and I squashed it ruthlessly. \"I\u0027m not hearing anything that makes you different from all the other murdering scum I\u0027ve put a silver bullet into over the years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not. I killed - first in Germany, then all over Europe and Russia. Back then it was easy. So many people, nobody noticed. It wasn\u0027t that much different from when I\u0027d been a soldier. Except now the enemy was any human. It didn\u0027t matter what uniform they wore or which flag they waved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At first I liked being a werewolf. I\u0027d been afraid for so long. I was a kid when I went into the army. I\u0027d worked on the docks in New York.\" He glanced down at his hands - calloused, scraped, rough. \"It was hard work, but the war was worse. I was terrified of dying, but I had to go. Back then we had little choice. The world was being decimated. We had to save it or kiss everything and everyone we\u0027d ever loved good-bye. I did anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wah, wah, wan,\" I sniped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips lifted into his usual ghost of a smile. \"When you\u0027re bitten, you change. And I don\u0027t mean just the transformation. The virus - or whatever it is that does this - makes you selfish. All you care about is your next meal, how to survive, how to thrive. Me, me, me pounds in your head like an anthem. That\u0027s the demon, Leigh. Complete and total self-absorption.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sociopath,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a note to mention this to Edward. Although I doubted very many werewolves went in for psychiatric advice on their psychosis, it couldn\u0027t hurt to check out anyone with sociopathic tendencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I stayed in Europe until the last of my family was gone. I didn\u0027t want to run into anyone who knew me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow would I explain being alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t your mother have loved you no matter what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. But I no longer cared about my mother, about love, family, or anything that\u0027s truly important; I only cared about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. This didn\u0027t sound like the Damien I\u0027d come to know and lo - I mean hate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When everyone who\u0027d known me then was dead, I came back to America. I missed the place. As much as I could miss or care for anything. Besides, Europe was getting dangerous. All the monsters that had been released by the Nazis - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jolted. \"You know about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. We have our fairy tales, our legends, our history, too. The beings Mengele had fashioned in his lab were causing problems. You see, Europeans believe in things Americans don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People who\u0027ve lived next to the Black Forest for centuries have watched some unbelievable creatures come out of those trees. They buy silver ammo as easily as we buy a cheeseburger. But in America, a country that\u0027s only a few hundred years old, the citizens are modern. They only believe what they see, hear, and touch. Do they sell silver bullets at Wal-Mart yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw his point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came back in 1968 to a world gone crazy. People hitchhiking all over the place. Free love. Drugs everywhere. It was the perfect time for monsters. With all the drifting around the country, folks disappeared without a trace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now it\u0027s tougher. But people still disappear. You know that as well as I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. Despite the computers, the technology, the numbers and requirements necessary for daily living, people still disappeared. Both Damien and I knew why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t told me one damn thing that makes me want to put a slug of silver between your eyes any less.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t kill people any more. I kill werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure I believed him, but I\u0027d give him the benefit of the doubt. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because something happened that made me understand what I was doing.
