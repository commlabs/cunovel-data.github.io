Other men usually left something behind, because they wanted a reason to come back. Teddy never did. All trace of his presence was gone. There was only the unfinished beer on the kitchen table. She threw it in the trash, wiped away the ring of moisture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been telling herself for months to end it (End what? End what? a voice said), but she somehow never got around to saying the words. She was so busy at work, it was such an effort to meet people. Six months earlier she had gone with Eileen, Marder\u0027s assistant, to a country-and-western bar in Studio City. The place was frequented by young movie people, Disney animators - a fun crowd, Eileen said. Casey found it agonizing. She wasn\u0027t beautiful, and she wasn\u0027t young; she didn\u0027t have the effortless glamour of the girls that glided through the room in tight jeans and crop tops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men were all too young for her, their smooth faces unformed. And she couldn\u0027t make small talk with them. She felt herself too serious for this setting. She had a job, a child, she was looking at forty. She never went out with Eileen again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t that she had no interest in meeting someone. But it was just so difficult. There was never enough time, never enough energy. In the end, she didn\u0027t bother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when Teddy would call, say he was in the neighborhood, she\u0027d go unlock the door for him, and get in the shower.

She\u0027d call Rob Wong in the morning, and see how he was coming with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey yawned, settled lower on the pillows, and continued to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWEDNESDAY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGLENDALE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:12 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone was ringing. She awoke, groggy, and rolled over, hearing the crunch of paper beneath her elbow. She looked down and saw the data sheets scattered all over the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone continued to ring. She picked it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom.\" Solemn, close to tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Allie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom. Dad is making me wear the red dress, and I want to wear the blue one with the flowers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"What did you wear yesterday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blue one. But it\u0027s not dirty or anything!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was an ongoing battle. Allison liked to wear the clothes she had worn the day before. Some innate, seven-year-old conservatism at work. \"Honey, you know I want you to wear clean clothes to school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it is clean, Mom. And I hate the red dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast month, the red dress had been her favorite. Allison had fought to wear it every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey sat up in bed, yawned, stared at the papers, the dense columns of data. She heard her daughter\u0027s complaining voice on the phone and thought, Do I need this? She wondered why Jim didn\u0027t handle it. Everything was so difficult, over the phone. Jim didn\u0027t hold up his end - he wasn\u0027t firm with her -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and the kid\u0027s natural tendency to play one parent against the other led to an interminable string of long-distance encounters like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrivial problems, childish power plays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allison,\" she said, interrupting her daughter. \"If your father says to wear the red dress, you do what he says,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Mom - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in charge now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Mom - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it, Allison. No more discussion. The red dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Mom...\" She started to cry. \"I hate you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey considered calling her daughter back, decided not to. She yawned, got out of bed, walked into the kitchen and turned on the coffeemaker. Her fax machine was buzzing in the comer of the living room. She went over to look at the paper coming out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a copy of a press release issued by a public relations firm in Washington. Although the firm had a neutral name -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the Institute for Aviation Research - she knew it was a PR firm representing the European consortium that made Airbus. The release was formatted to look like a breaking wire-service story, complete with headline at the top. It said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJAA DELAYS CERTIFICATION OF N-22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWIDEBODY JET CITING CONTINUED\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAIRWORTHINESS CONCERNS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was going to be a hell of a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWAR ROOM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7:00 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey climbed the metal stairs to the War Room. When she reached the catwalk John Marder was there, pacing back and forth, waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Casey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning, John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve seen this JAA thing?\" He held up the fax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nonsense, of course, but Edgarton drilled a hole. He\u0027s very upset. First, two N-22 incidents in two days, and now this. He\u0027s worried we\u0027re going to get creamed in the press. And he has no confidence that Benson\u0027s Media Relations people will handle this right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill Benson was one of the old Norton hands; he had handled media relations since the days when the company lived on military contracts and didn\u0027t tell the press a damned thing. Testy and blunt, Benson had never adjusted to the post-Watergate world, where journalists were celebrities who brought down governments. He was famous for feuding with reporters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This fax may generate press interest, Casey. Especially among reporters who don\u0027t know how screwed up the JAA is. And let\u0027s face it, they won\u0027t want to talk to press flacks. They\u0027ll want an executive in the company. So Hal wants all the inquiries on the JAA routed to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027To me,\" she said. She was thinking, Forget it. She already had a job. \"Benson won\u0027t be very happy if you do that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hal\u0027s talked to him personally. Benson\u0027s on board.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also think,\" Marder said, \"we ought to prepare a decent press package on the N-22. Something besides the usual PR crap. Hal suggested you compile a comprehensive package to refute the JAA stuff - you know, service hours, safety record, dispatch reliability data, SDRs, all of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay ...\" That was going to be a lot of work, and -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told Hal you were busy, and that this was an added burden,\" Marder said. \"He\u0027s approved a two-grade bump in your IC.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncentive compensation, the company\u0027s bonus package, was a large part of every executive\u0027s income. A two-grade increase would mean a substantial amount of money for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The point is,\" Marder said, \"we\u0027ve got a good response to this fax - a substantive response. And Hal wants to make sure we get it out. Can I count on you to help us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Casey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Marder said. And he walked up the stairs, into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichman was already in the room, looking preppy in a sport coat and tie. Casey slipped into a chair. Marder shifted into high gear, waving the JAA fax in the air, berating the engineers. \"You\u0027ve probably already seen that the JAA is playing games with us. Perfectly timed to jeopardize the China sale. But if you read the memo, you know that it\u0027s all about the engine in Miami and nothing about Transpacific. At least not yet...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey tried to pay attention, but she was distracted, calculating what the change in 1C would mean. A two-grade bump was ... she did the figures in her head ... something like a twenty-percent raise. Jesus, she thought. Twenty percent! She could send Allison to private school. And they could vacation someplace nice, Hawaii or someplace like that. They\u0027d stay in a nice hotel. And next year, move to a bigger house, with a big yard so Allison could run around, and -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone at the table was staring at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarder said, \"Casey? The DFDR? When can we expect the data?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" she said. \"I talked to Rob this morning. The calibration\u0027s going slowly. He\u0027ll know more tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Structure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoherty began in his unhappy monotone. \"John it\u0027s very difficult very difficult indeed. We found a bad locking pin on the number-two inboard slat. It\u0027s a counterfeit part and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll verify it at Flight Test,\" Marder said, interrupting him. \"Hydraulics?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airframe/page-10.html","bookId":2409,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM"}
