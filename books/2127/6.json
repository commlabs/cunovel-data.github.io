The drow were in a Ismail chapel Jarlaxle had secured for Vierna\u0027s use in one of the minor houses of Menzoberranzan. Dinin remained faithful to the dark deity Lloth and willingly had agreed to accompany Vierna to her prayers this day, but, in truth, the male drow thought the whole thing a senseless facade, thought his sister a ridiculous mockery of her former self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should not be so doubting,\" Vierna remarked to him, still going about her ritual and not bothering to look over her shoulder to regard Dinin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sound of Dinin\u0027s disgusted sigh, though, Vierna did spin about, an angry red glower in her narrow-set eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is the purpose?\" Dinin demanded, facing her wrath bravely. Even if she was out of Lloth\u0027s favor, as Dinin stubbornly believed, Vierna was larger and stronger than he and armed with some clerical magic. He gritted his teeth, firmed his resolve, and did not back down, fearful that Vierna\u0027s mounting obsession again would lead those around him down a path to destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer, Vierna produced a curious whip from under the folds of her clerical robes. While its handle was unremarkable black adamantite, the instrument\u0027s five tendrils were writhing, living snakes. Dinin\u0027s eyes widened; he understood the weapon\u0027s significance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lloth does not allow any but her high priestesses to wield these,\" Vierna reminded him, affectionately petting the heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we lost favor ...\" Dinin started to protest, but it was a lame argument in the face of Vierna\u0027s demonstration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna eyed him and laughed evilly, almost purred, as she bent to kiss one of the heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why go after Drizzt?\" Dinin asked her. \"You have regained the favor of Lloth. Why risk everything chasing our traitorous brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is how I regained the favor!\" Vierna screamed at him. She advanced a step, and Dinin wisely backed away. He remembered his younger days at House Do\u0027Urden, when Briza, his oldest and most vicious sister, often tortured him with one of those dreaded, snake-headed whips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna calmed immediately, though, and looked back to her dark, (both live and sculpted) spider-covered altar. \"Our family fell because of Matron Malice\u0027s weakness,\" she explained. \"Malice failed in the most important task Lloth ever gave her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To kill Drizzt,\" Dinin reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Vierna said simply, looking back over her shoulder to regard her brother. \"To kill Drizzt, wretched, traitorous Drizzt. I have promised his heart to Lloth, have promised to right the family\u0027s wrong, so that we - you and I - might regain the favor of our goddess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To what end?\" Dinin had to ask, looking around the unremarkable chapel with obvious scorn. \"Our house is no more. The name of Do\u0027Urden cannot be spoken anywhere in the city. What will be the gain if we again find Lloth\u0027s favor? You will be a high priestess, and for that I am glad, but you will have no house over which to preside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I will!\" Vierna retorted, her eyes flashing. \"I am a surviving noble of a destroyed house, as are you, my brother. We have all the Rights of Accusation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinin\u0027s eyes went wide. Vierna was technically correct; the Rights of Accusation was a privilege reserved for surviving noble children of destroyed houses, wherein the children named their attackers and thus brought the weight of drow justice upon the guilty party. In the continuing back-room intrigue of chaotic Menzoberranzan, though, justice was selectively meted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accusation?\" Dinin stammered, barely able to get the word out of his suddenly dry mouth. \"Have you forgotten which house it was that destroyed our own?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is all the sweeter,\" purred his stubborn sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baenre!\" Dinin cried. \"House Baenre, First House of Menzoberranzan! You cannot speak against Baenre. No house, alone or in alliance, will move against them, and Matron Baenre controls the Academy. Where will your force of justice be garnered?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what of Bregan D\u0027aerthe?\" Dinin reminded her. \"The very band of mercenaries that took us in helped defeat our house.\" Dinin stopped abruptly, considering his own words, ever amazed by the paradox, the cruel irony, of drow society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a male and cannot understand the beauty of Lloth,\" Vierna replied. \"Our goddess feeds from this chaos, considers this situation all the sweeter simply because of the many furious ironies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The city will not wage war against House Baenre,\" Dinin said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will never come to that!\" Vierna snapped back, and again came that wild flash in her red-glowing orbs. \"Matron Baenre is old, my brother. Her time has long past. When Drizzt is dead, as the Spider Queen demands, I will be granted an audience in House Baenre, wherein I... we will make our accusation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we will be fed to Baenre\u0027s goblin slaves,\" Dinin replied dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matron Baenre\u0027s own daughters will force her out so that the house might regain the Spider Queen\u0027s favor,\" the excited Vierna went on, ignoring her doubting brother. \"To that end, they will place me in control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinin could hardly find the words to rebut Vierna\u0027s preposterous claims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think of it, my brother,\" Vierna went on. \"Envision yourself standing beside me as I preside over the First House of Menzoberranzan!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lloth has promised this to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Through Triel,\" Vierna replied, \"Matron Baenre\u0027s oldest daughter, herself Matron Mistress of the Academy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinin was beginning to catch on. If Triel, much more powerful than Vierna, meant to replace her admittedly ancient mother, she certainly would claim the throne of House Baenre for herself, or at least allow one of her many worthy sisters to take the seat. Dinin\u0027s doubts were obvious as he half-sat on one bench, crossing his arms in front of him and shaking his head slowly, back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no room for disbelievers in my entourage,\" Vierna warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your entourage?\" Dinin replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bregan D\u0027aerthe is but a tool, provided to me so that I might please the goddess,\" Vierna explained without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are insane,\" Dinin said before he could find the wisdom to keep the thought to himself. To his relief, though, Vierna did not advance toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shall regret those sacrilegious words when our traitorous Drizzt is given to Lloth,\" the priestess promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never get near our brother,\" Dinin replied sharply, his memories of his previous disastrous encounter with Drizzt still painfully clear. \"And I\u0027ll not go along with you to the surface - not against that demon. He is powerful, Vierna, mightier than you can imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silence!\" The word carried magical weight, and Dinin found his next planned protests stuck in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mightier?\" Vierna scoffed a moment later. \"What do you know of power, impotent male?\" A wry smile crossed her face, an expression that made Dinin squirm in his seat. \"Come with me, doubting Dinin,\" Vierna bade. She started for a side door in the small chapel, but Dinin made no move to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come!\" Vierna commanded, and Dinin found his legs moving under him, found himself leaving the single stalagmite mound of the lesser house, then leaving Menzoberranzan altogether, faithfully following his insane sister\u0027s every step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the two Do\u0027Urdens walked from view, Jarlaxle lowered the curtain in front of his scrying mirror, dispelling the image of the small chapel. He thought he should speak with Dinin soon, to warn the obstinate fighter of the consequences he might face. Jarlaxle honestly liked Dinin and knew that the drow was heading for disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have baited her well,\" the mercenary remarked to the priestess standing beside him, giving her a devious wink with his left eye - the uncovered one this day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female, shorter than Jarlaxle but carrying herself with an undeniable strength, snarled at the mercenary, her contempt obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear Triel,\" Jarlaxle cooed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold your tongue,\" Triel Baenre warned, \"or I will tear it out and give it to you, that you might hold it in your hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle shrugged and wisely shifted the conversation back to the business at hand. \"Vierna believes your claim,\" he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vierna is desperate,\" Triel Baenre replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She would have gone after Drizzt on the simple promise that you would take her into your family,\" the mercenary reasoned, \"but to bait her with delusions of replacing Matron Baenre...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The greater the prize, the greater Vierna\u0027s motivation,\" Triel replied calmly. \"It is important to my mother that Drizzt Do\u0027Urden be given to Lloth. Let the fool Do\u0027Urden priestess think what she will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed,\" Jarlaxle said with a nod. \"Has House Baenre prepared the escort?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A score and a half will slip out beside the fighters of Bregan D\u0027aerthe,\" Triel replied. \"They are only males,\" she added derisively, \"and expendable.\" The first daughter of House Baenre cocked her head curiously as she continued to regard the wily mercenary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will accompany Vierna personally with your chosen soldiers?\" Triel asked. \"To coordinate the two groups?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle clapped his slender hands together. \"I am a part of this,\" he answered firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To my displeasure,\" the Baenre daughter snarled. She uttered a single word and, with a flash, disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother loves me, dear Triel,\" Jarlaxle said to the emptiness, as if the Matron Mistress of the Academy were still beside him. \"I would not miss this,\" the mercenary continued, thinking out loud. By Jarlaxle\u0027s estimation, the hunt for Drizzt could be only a good thing. He might lose a few soldiers, but they were replaceable. If Drizzt was indeed brought to sacrifice, Lloth would be pleased, Matron Baenre would be pleased, and Jarlaxle would find a way to be rewarded for his efforts. After all, on a simpler level, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, as a traitorous renegade, carried a high bounty on his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle chuckled wickedly, reveling in the beauty of it all. If Drizzt managed somehow to elude them, then Vierna would take the fall, and the mercenary would continue on, untouched by it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another possibility that Jarlaxle, removed from the immediate situation and wise in the ways of the drow, recognized, and if, by some remote chance, it came to pass, he again would be in a position to profit greatly, simply from his favorable relationship with Vierna. Triel had promised Vierna an unbelievable prize because Lloth had instructed her, and her mother, to do so. What would happen if Vierna fulfilled her part of the agreement? the mercenary wondered. What ironies did conniving Lloth have in store for House Baenre?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely Vierna Do\u0027Urden seemed insane for believing Triel\u0027s empty promises, but Jarlaxle knew well that many of Menzoberranzan\u0027s most powerful drow, Matron Baenre included, had seemed, at one time in their lives, equally crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna pressed through the opaque doorway to Jarlaxle\u0027s private chambers later that day, her crazed expression revealing the anxiety for the coming events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle heard a commotion in the outer corridor, but Vierna merely continued to smile knowingly. The mercenary rocked back in his comfortable chair, tapping his fingers together in front of him and trying to discern what surprise the Do\u0027Urden priestess had prepared for him this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will need an extra soldier to complement our party,\" Vierna ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can be arranged/\u0027 Jarlaxle replied, beginning to catch on. \"But why? Will Dinin not be accompanying us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna\u0027s eyes flashed. \"He will,\" she said, \"but my brother\u0027s role in the hunt has changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle didn\u0027t flinch, just continued to sit back and tap his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dinin did not believe in Lloth\u0027s destiny,\" Vierna explained, casually taking a seat on the edge of Jarlaxle\u0027s desk. \"He did not wish to accompany me in this critical mission. The Spider Queen has demanded this of us!\" She hopped back to the floor, suddenly ferocious, and stepped back toward the opaque door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle made no move, except to flex the fingers on his dagger-throwing hand, as Vierna\u0027s tirade continued. The priestess swept about the small room, praying to Lloth, cursing those who would not fall to their knees before the goddess, and cursing her brothers, Drizzt and Dinin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Vierna calmed again suddenly, and smiled wickedly. \"Lloth demands fealty,\" she said accusingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" replied the unshakable mercenary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Justice is for a priestess to deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna\u0027s eyes flashed - Jarlaxle quietly tensed, fearing that the unsteady female would lash out at him for some unknown reason. She instead went back to the door and called loudly for her brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle saw the unremarkable, veiled silhouette beyond the portal, saw the opaque material bend and stretch as Dinin started in from the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge spider leg slipped into the room, then another, then a third. The mutated torso came through next, Dinin\u0027s unclothed and bloated body transmuted from the waist down into the lower torso of a giant black spider. His once fair face now seemed a dead thing, swollen and expressionless, his eyes showing no luster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mercenary fought hard to keep his breathing steady. He removed his great hat and ran a hand over his bald, sweating head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disfigured creature moved into the room fully and stood obediently behind Vierna, the priestess smiling at the mercenary\u0027s obvious discomfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The quest is critical,\" Vierna explained. \"Lloth will not tolerate dissent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Jarlaxle had held any doubts about the Spider Queen\u0027s involvement with Vierna\u0027s quest, they were gone now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVierna had exacted the ultimate punishment of drow society on troublesome Dinin, something only a high priestess in the highest favor of Lloth could ever accomplish. She had replaced Dinin\u0027s graceful drow body with this grotesque and mutated arachnid form, had replaced Dinin\u0027s fierce independence with a malevolent demeanor that she could bend to her every whim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had turned him into a drider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerceptions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no word in the draw language for love. The closest word I can think of is ssinssrigg, but that is a term better equated with physical lust or selfish greed. The concept of love exists in the hearts of some draw, of course, but true love, a selfless desire often requiring personal sacrifice, has no place in a world of such bitter and dangerous rivalries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only sacrifices in draw culture are gifts to Lloth, and those are surely not selfless, since the giver hopes, prays, for something greater in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the concept of love was not new to me when I left the Underdark. I loved Zaknafein. I loved both Belwar and Clacker. Indeed, it was the capacity, the need, for love that ultimately drove me from Menzoberranzan. Is there in all the wide world a concept more fleeting, more elusive? Many people of all the races seem simply not to understand love, burden its beauteous simplicity with preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations. How ironic that I, walking from the darkness of loveless Menzoberranzan, can better grasp the concept than many of those who have lived with it, or at least with the very real possibility of it, for all of their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome things a renegade draw will not take for granted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy few journeys to Silverymoon in these past weeks have invited good-hearted jests from my friends. \"Suren the elf has his eyes fixed on another wedding!\" Bruenor has often crooned, regarding my relationship with Alustriel, the Lady of Silvery-moon. I accept the taunts in light of the sincere warmth and hopes behind them, and have not dashed those hopes by explaining to my dear friends that their notions are misguided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI appreciate Alustriel and the goodness she has shown me. I appreciate that she, a ruler in a too-often unforgiving world, has taken such a chance as to allow a dark elf to walk freely down her city\u0027s wondrous avenues. Alustriel\u0027s acceptance of me as a friend has allowed me to draw my desires from my true wishes, not from expected limitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut do I love her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more than she loves me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will admit, though, I do love the notion that I could love Alustriel, and she could love me, and that, if the attraction were present, the color of my skin and the reputation of my heritage would not deter the noble Lady of Silverymoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know now, though, that love has become the most prominent part of my existence, that my bond of friendship with Bruenor and Wulfgar and Regis is of utmost importance to any happiness that this draw will ever know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy bond with Catti-brie runs deeper still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonest love is a selfless concept, that I have already said, and my own selflessness has been put to a severe test this spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fear now for the future, for Catti-brie and Wulfgar and the barriers they must, together, overcome. Wulfgar loves her, I do not doubt, but he burdens his love with a possessiveness that borders on disrespect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should understand the spirit that is Catti-brie, should see clearly the fuel that stokes the fires in her marvelous blue eyes. It is that very spirit that Wulfgar loves, and yet he will undoubtedly smother it under the notions of a woman\u0027s place as her husband\u0027s possession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy barbarian friend has come far from his youthful days roaming the tundra. Farther still must he come to hold the heart of Bruenor\u0027s fiery daughter, to hold Catti-brie\u0027s love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there in all the world a concept more fleeting, more elusive? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-6.html","bookId":2127,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:18 PM"}
