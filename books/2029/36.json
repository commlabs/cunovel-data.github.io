My stomach rolled nauseatingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finally,\" someone murmured in relief. Ian. Of course. \"Hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that and then made an involuntary gagging sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Never mind. Sorry. Again. We had to do it. People got all... paranoid when we took you outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027S okay,\" I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want some water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes, trying to focus in the darkness. I could see two stars through the cracks overhead. Still night. Or night again, who knew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where am I?\" I asked. The shapes of the cracks were unfamiliar. I would swear I\u0027d never stared at this ceiling before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your room,\" Ian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI searched for his face in the darkness but could only make out the black shape that was his head. With my fingers, I examined the surface I lay on; it was a real mattress. There was a pillow under my head. My searching hand touched his, and he caught my fingers before I could withdraw them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose room is it really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It used to be ours-Kyle\u0027s and mine. Kyle\u0027s being... held in the hospital wing until things can be decided. I can move in with Wes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not taking your room. And what do you mean, until things can be decided?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you there would be a tribunal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because if you\u0027re going through with that, then I have to be there. To explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\" I asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First light. I won\u0027t take you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll take myself. I know I\u0027ll be able to walk as soon as my head stops spinning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s not fair if you don\u0027t let me speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan sighed. He dropped my hand and straightened slowly to his feet. I could hear his joints pop as he stood. How long had he been sitting in the dark, waiting for me to wake? \"I\u0027ll be back soon. You might not be hungry, but I\u0027m starving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had a long night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it gets light, I won\u0027t sit here waiting for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled without humor. \"I\u0027m sure that\u0027s true. So I\u0027ll be back before that, and I will help you get where you\u0027re going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned one of the doors away from the entrance to his cave, stepped around it, and then let it fall back into place. I frowned. That might be hard to do on one leg. I hoped Ian truly was coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I waited for him, I stared up at the two stars I could see and let my head slowly become stationary. I really didn\u0027t like human drugs. Ugh. My body hurt, but the lurching in my head was worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime passed slowly, but I didn\u0027t fall asleep. I\u0027d been sleeping most of the last twenty-four hours. I probably was hungry, too. I would have to wait for my stomach to calm before I was sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan came back before the light, just as he\u0027d promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feeling any better?\" he asked as he stepped around the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so. I haven\u0027t moved my head yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it\u0027s you reacting to the morphine, or Melanie\u0027s body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Mel. She reacts badly to most painkillers. She found that out when she broke her wrist ten years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about that for a moment. \"It\u0027s... odd. Dealing with two people at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Odd,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hungry yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"I thought I smelled bread. Yes, I think my stomach is past the worst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping you\u0027d say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shadow sprawled out beside me. He felt for my hand, then pulled my fingers open and placed a familiar round shape in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me up?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his arm carefully around my shoulders and folded me up in one stiff piece, minimizing the ache in my side. I could feel something foreign on the skin there, tight and rigid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said, a little breathless. My head spun slowly. I touched my side with my free hand. Something adhered to my skin, under my shirt. \"Are my ribs broken, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc\u0027s not sure. He\u0027s doing as much as he can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He tries so hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel bad... that I used to not like him,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan laughed. \"Of course you didn\u0027t. I\u0027m amazed you can like any of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got that turned around,\" I mumbled, and dug my teeth into the hard roll. I chewed mechanically and then swallowed, setting the bread down as I waited to see how it hit my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not very appetizing, I know,\" Ian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"Just testing-to see if the nausea\u0027s really passed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe something more appealing...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him, curious, but I couldn\u0027t see his face. I listened to a sharp crackle and a ripping sound... and then I could smell, and I understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cheetos!\" I cried. \"Really? For me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething touched my lip, and I crunched into the delicacy he offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been dreaming about this.\" I sighed as I chewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made him laugh. He put the bag in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI downed the contents of the small bag quickly, and then finished my roll, seasoned by the cheese flavor still in my mouth. He handed me a bottle of water before I could ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. For more than the Cheetos, you know. For so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re more than welcome, Wanda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared into his dark blue eyes, trying to decipher everything he was saying with that sentence-there seemed to be something more than just courtesy in the words. And then I realized that I could see the color of Ian\u0027s eyes; I glanced quickly up at the cracks above. The stars were gone, and the sky was turning pale gray. Dawn was coming. First light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you have to do this?\" Ian asked, his hands already half-extended as if to pick me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"You don\u0027t have to carry me. My leg feels better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped me to my feet, leaving his arm around my waist and pulling my arm around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful, now. How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hobbled forward a step. It hurt, but I could do it. \"Great. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Ian likes you too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo much? I was surprised to hear from Melanie, and so distinctly. Lately, she only spoke up like this when Jared was around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m here, too. Does he even care about that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he does. He believes us more than anyone besides Jamie and Jeb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t mean that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took us a long time. I was surprised by how far we had to go. I\u0027d been thinking we were going to the big plaza or the kitchen-the usual places for congregating. But we went through the eastern field and kept going until we finally reached the big, deep black cave that Jeb had called the game room. I hadn\u0027t been here since my first tour. The biting scent of the sulfurous spring greeted me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike most of the caverns here, the game room was much wider than it was tall. I could see that now because the dim blue lights hung from the ceiling rather than resting on the floor. The ceiling was only a few feet over my head, the height of a normal ceiling in a house. But I couldn\u0027t even see the walls, they were so distant from the lights. I couldn\u0027t see the smelly spring, tucked away in some far corner, but I could hear it dribble and gush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle sat in the brightest spot of light. He had his long arms wrapped around his legs. His face was set in a stiff mask. He didn\u0027t look up when Ian helped me limp in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn either side of him were Jared and Doc, on their feet, both with their arms hanging loose and ready at their sides. As though they were... guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb stood beside Jared, his gun slung over one shoulder. He appeared relaxed, but I knew how quickly that could change. Jamie held his free hand... no, Jeb had his hand around Jamie\u0027s wrist, and Jamie didn\u0027t seem happy about it. When he saw me come in, though, he smiled and waved. He took a deep breath and looked pointedly at Jeb. Jeb dropped Jamie\u0027s wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharon stood beside Doc, with Aunt Maggie at her other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan pulled me toward the edge of the darkness surrounding the tableau. We weren\u0027t alone there. I could see the shapes of many others, but not their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was strange; through the caves, Ian had supported most of my weight with ease. Now, though, he seemed to have tired. His arm around my waist was slack. I lurched and hopped forward as best I could until he picked the spot he wanted. He settled me to the floor, and then sat beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch,\" I heard someone whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and could just make out Trudy. She scooted closer to us, Geoffrey and then Heath copying her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look rotten,\" she told me. \"How bad are you hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"I\u0027m fine.\" I started to wonder if Ian had let me struggle just to make a show of my injuries-to make me testify against Kyle without words. I frowned at his innocent expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWes and Lily arrived then and came to sit with my little group of allies. Brandt entered a few seconds later, and then Heidi, and then Andy and Paige. Aaron was last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s everybody,\" he said. \"Lucina\u0027s staying with her kids. She doesn\u0027t want them here-she said to go on without her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAaron sat beside Andy, and there was a short moment of silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then,\" Jeb said in a loud voice meant to be heard by all. \"Here\u0027s how it\u0027s gonna work. Straight-up majority vote. As usual, I\u0027ll make my own decision if I have a problem with the majority, \u0027cause this -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is my house,\" several voices interjected in chorus. Someone chuckled but stopped quickly. This wasn\u0027t funny. A human was on trial for trying to kill an alien. This had to be a horrible day for all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s speaking against Kyle?\" Jeb asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan started to stand beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I whispered, tugging on his elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged me off and rose to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is simple enough,\" Ian said. I wanted to jump up and clap my hand over his mouth, but I didn\u0027t think I could get to my feet without help. \"My brother was warned. He was not in any doubt about Jeb\u0027s ruling on this. Wanda is one of our community-the same rules and protections apply to her as to any of us. Jeb told Kyle point-blank that if he couldn\u0027t live with her here, he should move on. Kyle decided to stay. He knew then and he knows now the penalty for murder in this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still alive,\" Kyle grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is why I\u0027m not asking for your death,\" Ian snapped back. \"But you can\u0027t live here anymore. Not if you\u0027re a murderer at heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan stared at his brother for a moment, then sat on the ground beside me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he could get caught, and we\u0027d have no idea,\" Brandt protested, rising to his feet. \"He\u0027ll lead them back here, and we\u0027d have no warning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a murmur through the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle glared at Brandt. \"They\u0027ll never get me alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it\u0027s a death sentence after all,\" someone muttered at the same time that Andy said, \"You can\u0027t guarantee that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One at a time,\" Jeb warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve survived on the outside before,\" Kyle said angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother voice came from the darkness. \"It\u0027s a risk.\" I couldn\u0027t make out the owners of the voices-they were just hissing whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd another. \"What did Kyle do wrong? Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb took a step toward the voice, glowering. \"My rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not one of us,\" someone else protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan started to rise again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Jared exploded. His voice was so loud that everyone jumped. \"Wanda\u0027s not on trial here! Does someone have a concrete complaint against her-against Wanda herself? Then ask for another tribunal. But we all know she hasn\u0027t harmed anyone here. In fact, she saved his life.\" He stabbed one finger toward Kyle\u0027s back. Kyle\u0027s shoulders hunched, like he\u0027d felt the jab. \"Just seconds after he tried to throw her into the river, she risked her life to keep him from the same painful death. She had to know that if she let him fall she would be safer here. She saved him anyway. Would any of you have done the same-rescue your enemy? He tried to kill her, and yet will she even speak against him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt all the eyes in the dark room on my face as Jared now held his hand out, palm up, toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you speak against him, Wanda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him wide-eyed, stunned that he was speaking for me, that he was speaking to me, that he was using my name. Melanie was in shock, too, torn in half. She was overjoyed at the kindness in his face as he looked at us, the softness in his eyes that had been absent so long. But it was my name he\u0027d said...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a few seconds before I could find my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is all a misunderstanding,\" I whispered. \"We both fell when the floor caved in. Nothing else happened.\" I hoped the whisper would make it harder to hear the lie in my voice, but as soon as I was done, Ian chuckled. I nudged him with my elbow, but that didn\u0027t stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared actually smiled at me. \"You see. She even tries to lie in his defense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tries being the operative word,\" Ian added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who says it\u0027s lying? Who can prove that?\" Maggie asked harshly, stepping forward into the empty space beside Kyle. \"Who can prove that it\u0027s not the truth that sounds so false on its lips?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mag -\" Jeb started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Jebediah-I\u0027m speaking. There is no reason for us to be here. No human was attacked. The insidious trespasser offers no complaint. This is a waste of all our time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I second that,\" Sharon added in a clear, loud voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc shot her a pained look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrudy jumped to her feet. \"We can\u0027t house a murderer-and just wait around for him to be successful!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Murder is a subjective term,\" Maggie hissed. \"I only consider it murder when something human is killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Ian\u0027s arm wrap around my shoulder. I didn\u0027t realize that I was trembling until his motionless body was against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Human is a subjective term as well, Magnolia,\" Jared said, glowering at her. \"I thought the definition embraced some compassion, some little bit of mercy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s vote,\" Sharon said before her mother could answer him. \"Raise your hand if you think Kyle should be allowed to stay here, with no penalty for the... misunderstanding.\" She shot a glance not at me, but at Ian beside me when she used the word I\u0027d used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands began to rise. I watched Jared\u0027s face as his features settled into a scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled to raise my hand, but Ian tightened his hold around my arms and made an irritated noise through his nose. I held my palm as high as I could get it. In the end, though, my vote wasn\u0027t necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeb counted out loud. \"Ten... fifteen... twenty... twenty-three. Okay, that\u0027s a clear majority.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t look around to see who had voted how. It was enough that in my little corner all arms were crossed tightly over chests and all eyes stared at Jeb with expectant expressions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie walked away from Jeb to come squeeze in between Trudy and me.
