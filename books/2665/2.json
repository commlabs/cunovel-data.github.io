Her brow lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is he daft?” Bond queried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His brain is so advanced, it stumbles over mediocrity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or perhaps it’s tangled by your reasoning in this endeavor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoulders went back. “My reasoning is sound. And sarcasm is unproductive, Mr. Bond. Please refrain from it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” His tone took on a dangerous quality. “And what is it you hope to produce by procuring a suitor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not in want of stud service, sir. Only a depraved mind would leap to that conclusion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stud service…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that not what you are thinking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wicked smile came to his lips. Eliza was certain her heart skipped a beat at the sight of it. “It wasn’t, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanting to conclude this meeting as swiftly as possible, she rushed forward. “Do you have someone who can assist me or not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond snorted softly, but the derisive sound seemed to be directed inward and not at her. “From the beginning, if you would please, Miss Martin. Why do you need protection?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have recently found myself to be a repeated victim of various unfortunate—and suspicious—events.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEliza expected him to laugh or perhaps give her a doubtful look. He did neither. Instead, she watched a transformation sweep over him. As fiercely focused as he’d been since his arrival, he became more so when presented with the problem. She found herself appreciating him for more than his good looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned slightly forward. “What manner of events?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was pushed into the Serpentine. My saddle was tampered with. A snake was loosed in my bedroom—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand it was a Runner who referred you to Mr. Lynd, who in turn referred you to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I hired a Runner for a month, but Mr. Bell discovered nothing. No attacks occurred while he was engaged.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who would want to injure you, and why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe offered him a slight smile, a small show of gratitude for the gravity he was displaying. Anthony Bell had come highly recommended, but he’d never taken her seriously. In fact, he had been amused by her tales and she’d never felt he was dedicated to the task of discovery. “Truthfully, I am not certain whether they intend bodily harm, or if they simply want to goad me into marriage as a way to establish some permanent security. I see no reason to any of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you wealthy, Miss Martin? Or certain to be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Which is why I doubt they sincerely aim to cause me grievous injury—I am worth more alive. But there are some who believe it isn’t safe for me in my uncle’s household. They claim he is an insufficient guardian, that he is touched and ready for Bedlam. As if any individual capable of compassion would put a stray dog in such a place, let alone a beloved relative.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poppycock,” the earl scoffed. “I am fit as a fiddle, in mind and body.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are, my lord,” Eliza agreed, smiling fondly at him. “I have made it clear to all and sundry that Lord Melville will likely live to be one hundred years of age.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you hope that adding me to your stable of suitors will accomplish what, precisely?” Bond asked. “Deter the culprit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope that by adding one of your associates,” she corrected, “I can avoid further incidents over the next six weeks of the Season. In addition, if my new suitor is perceived to be a threat, perhaps the scoundrel will turn his malicious attentions toward him. Then, perhaps, we can catch the fiend. Truly, I should like to know by what methods of deduction he formulated this plan and what he hoped to gain by it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBond settled back into his seat and appeared deep in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would never suggest such a hazardous role for someone untrained,” she said quickly. “But a thief-taker, a man accustomed to associating with criminals and other unfortunates…I should think those who engage in your profession would be more than a match for a nefarious fortune hunter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her, her uncle murmured to himself, working out puzzles and equations in his mind. Like herself, he was most comfortable with events and reactions that could be quantified or predicted with some surety. Dealing with issues defying reason was too taxing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What type of individual would you consider ideal to play this role of suitor, protector, and investigator?” Bond asked finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He should be quiet, even-tempered, and a proficient dancer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScowling, he queried, “How do dullness and the ability to dance signify in catching a possible murderer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did not say ‘dull,’ Mr. Bond. Kindly do not attribute words to me that I have not spoken. In order to be acknowledged as a true rival for my attentions, he should be someone whom everyone will believe I would be attracted to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are not attracted to handsome men?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Bond, I dislike being rude. However, you leave me no recourse. The fact is, you clearly are not the sort of man whose temperament is compatible with matrimony.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am quite relieved to hear a female recognize that,” he drawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could anyone doubt it?” She made a sweeping gesture with her hand. “I can more easily picture you in a swordfight or fisticuffs than I can see you enjoying an afternoon of croquet, after-dinner chess, or a quiet evening at home with family and friends. I am an intellectual, sir. And while I don’t mean to imply a lack of mental acuity, you are obviously built for more physically strenuous pursuits.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why, one has only to look at you to ascertain you aren’t like the others at all! It would be evident straightaway that I would never consider a man such as you with even remote seriousness. It is quite obvious you and I do not suit in the most fundamental of ways, and everyone knows I am too observant to fail to see that. Quite frankly, sir, you are not my type of male.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look he gave her was wry but without the smugness that would have made it irritating. He conveyed solid self-confidence free of conceit. She was dismayed to find herself strongly attracted to the quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would be troublesome. Eliza did not like trouble overmuch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the earl. “Please forgive me, my lord, but I must speak bluntly in regard to this subject. Most especially because this is a matter concerning Miss Martin’s physical well-being.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quite right,” Melville agreed. “Straight to the point, I always say. Time is too precious to waste on inanities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agreed.” Bond’s gaze returned to Eliza and he smiled. “Miss Martin, forgive me, but I must point out that your inexperience is limiting your understanding of the situation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Inexperience with what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Men. More precisely, fortune-hunting men.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would have you know,” she retorted, “that over the course of six Seasons I have had more than enough experience with gentlemen in want of funds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why,” he drawled, “are you unaware that they are successful for reasons far removed from social suitability?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEliza blinked. “I beg your pardon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Women do not marry fortune hunters because they can dance and sit quietly. They marry them for their appearance and physical prowess—two attributes you have already established I have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not see—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Evidently, you do not, so I shall explain.” His smile continued to grow. “Fortune hunters who flourish do not strive to satisfy a woman’s intellectual needs. Those can be met through friends and acquaintances. They do not seek to provide the type of companionship one enjoys in social settings or with a game table between them. Again, there are others who can do so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Bond—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, they strive to satisfy in the only position that is theirs alone, a position some men make no effort to excel in. So rare is this particular skill that many a woman will disregard other considerations in favor of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, say no—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fornication,” his lordship muttered, before returning to his conversation with himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEliza shot to her feet. “My lord!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs courtesy dictated, both her uncle and Mr. Bond rose along with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I prefer to call it ’seduction,’” Bond said, his eyes laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I call it ridiculous,” she rejoined, hands on her hips. “In the grand scheme of life, do you collect how little time a person spends abed when compared to other activities?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze dropped to her hips. The smile became a fullblown grin. “That truly depends on who else is occupying said bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dear heavens.” Eliza shivered at the look Jasper Bond was giving her. It was…expectant. By some unknown, godforsaken means she had managed to prod the man’s damnable masculine pride into action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me a sennight,” he suggested. “One week to prove both my point and my competency. If, at the end, you are not swayed by one or the other, I will accept no payment for services rendered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent proposition,” his lordship said. “No possibility of loss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not true,” Eliza contended. “How will I explain Mr. Bond’s speedy departure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let us make it a fortnight, then,” Bond amended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You fail to understand the problem. I am not an actor, sir. It will be evident to one and all that I am far from ’seduced.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tone of his grin changed, aided by a hot flicker in his dark eyes. “Leave that aspect of the plan to me. After all, that’s what I am being paid for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if you fail? Once you resign, not only will I be forced to make excuses for you, I will have to bring in another thief-taker to act in your stead. The whole affair will be entirely too suspicious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you had the same pool of suitors for six years, Miss Martin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That isn’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you not just state the many reasons why you feel I am not an appropriate suitor for you? Can you not simply reiterate those points in response to any inquiries regarding my departure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are overly persistent, Mr. Bond.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quite,” he nodded, “which is why I will discover who is responsible for the unfortunate events besetting you and what they’d hoped to gain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed her arms. “I am not convinced.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trust me. It is fortuitous, indeed, that Mr. Lynd brought us together. If I do not apprehend the culprit, I daresay he cannot be caught.” His hand fisted around the top of his cane. “Client satisfaction is a point of pride, Miss Martin. By the time I am done, I guarantee you will be eminently gratified by my performance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are times when I impress myself with my own brilliance,” Thomas Lynd crowed when entering Jasper’s study with hat in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne could always trust Lynd to eschew the services of a formal butler. He preferred lackeys over servants whose training in deportment exceeded his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper settled back in his chair with a smile of welcome. “You’ve outdone yourself this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs usual, Lynd’s garments were overdone in style and underwhelming in fit. The result of a poor tailor provided with expensive material yet lacking the knowledge of how best to utilize it. Regardless, Lynd presented a decidedly more refined appearance than others of their profession. He walked a fine line, one that enabled him to remain respected and welcomed by the lower classes, while presenting himself in a way the peerage found nonthreatening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynd dropped into one of the two seats set in front of the desk. “The moment she mentioned Montague, I had no doubt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he visited Jasper’s home with regularity, he surveyed the room as if seeing it for the first time. His gaze lingered on the mahogany bookshelves lining the far wall and the sapphire-hued velvet drapes framing the windows opposite. “Besides, she wanted a bloody lapdog, and none of our acquaintances can boast your pedigree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bastardy is no advantage in any situation.” Jasper straddled the line Lynd traversed so well, which worked—sur-prisingly—to Jasper’s benefit. He was often hired by those who wanted his services to go unnoticed and were capable of paying the added expense such stealth required. That proclivity enabled him to work with Eliza Martin, because his face was not well known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is in this one.” Lynd ran a hand through brown hair as yet unaffected by the graying of age. “It takes breeding to tolerate the sorts of pompous asses Melville’s niece expects you to rub along with, and you will be far less noticeable in the venues she will expect you to attend than anyone else I could think of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, Jasper moved to the console table by the window where decanters of liquors and crystal tumblers waited. Lynd was one of very few individuals who were aware of Jasper’s lineage. He had Jasper’s confidence because he’d once shown Jasper’s mother a kindness when she desperately needed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Jasper poured two rations of Armagnac, his gaze took in the two disreputable-looking lackeys who waited out on the street. Lynd’s men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had taken Jasper some time to locate a respectable neighborhood that would accommodate his activities without undue strain. His neighbors tolerated the endless comings and goings of his crew because they found his presence useful in minimizing footpad crimes in the immediate vicinity. He considered his services to the community a small price to pay to avoid residing in the areas surrounding Fleet Street and the Strand, where Lynd and many other thief-takers lived. It was nigh impossible to abide the stench from the sewer ditch, which was an inescapable odor embedded into the very walls of the surrounding buildings. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pride-and-pleasure-historical-3/page-2.html","bookId":2665,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:46 AM"}
