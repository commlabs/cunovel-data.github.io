Mankind is silently infected by a millennia-old bacteria unknowingly exhumed by a scientific expedition in Antarctica. Now, in some rare cases, a person\u0027s so-called \"junk DNA\" becomes activated, and depending on their racial and ethnic heritage they begin to manifest one of the many diverse forms of the \"others\" that are the true basis for the legends of supernatural creatures. These aren\u0027t your usual vampires and werewolves - it goes much deeper than that. Conceived by Jonathan Maberry, V Wars features stories from various \"frontlines\" as reported by such contributors as Nancy Holder, Yvonne Navarro, James A. Moore, Gregory Frost, John Everson, Keith R.A. DeCandido, and Scott Nicholson (as well as Maberry himself, of course). The result is a compelling series of tales that create a unique chronicle of mankind\u0027s response to this sudden, hidden threat to humanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/v-wars.jpg","author":"Jonathan Maberry","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/v-wars.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:15 PM"}
