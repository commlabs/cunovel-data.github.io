I hate this!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lying again. Not going to help you onebit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan tried to hump back against him and got another slap on the ass for his trouble.“I’ll move when you show the proper respect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan bit the mattress below him, and Blayde chuckled, waiting him out. Damn, it felt incredible, he could feel Ryan’s ass trembling, shivering with the need for him to move, but he was so stubborn he was trying to hold out. He screamed in frustration.“Move, damn you! Do something!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what to do…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. Will you fuck me? Please!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope. Not good enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out and Ryan rolled over on his back and stared up at him.“What are you doing? You can’t leave me like this!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde gave him a positively evil smile.“Oh, I could. But I have other plans. Get up to the head of the bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan crawled warily up to the head of the bed and lay down. Immediately, Blayde crawled up beside him to fasten his wrists in the cuffs hanging from the back of the headboard. Ryan seemed both surprised and not too pleased by this turn of events. He kicked out at his tormentor. “Let me out of this shit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, temper, temper. I was going to let you come, but I might change my mind now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! I mean, I’m sorry, please.I’ll be good, I promise.” Right about then, Blayde thought Ryan would have promised him anything to get to come. He looked like he hurt so damned bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde rubbed his hands over Ryan’s balls. He knew they must be aching by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do they hurt, sweetheart? I can kiss’em and make’em better. All you have to do is beg me a little.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You asshole!” Ryan spit back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde smiled again. He leaned down to kiss Ryan as he crawled on top to straddle him. “There’s that temper again.Are you going to be very good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, damn it. Please!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Say it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan hit his head on the back of the bedframe.“I promiseI’ll be good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s my name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“B-Blayde. No, Alpha.” Biting his lip, Ryan thrashed his head back and forth on the headboard.“Please, Alpha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do like the way you beg.” He sat back on his heels and looked at him.“So pretty in bondage. I knew you would be, my sweet little mate.” He bent down and began to torture him with his tongue, drawing it down his body and circling around and around his cock, but not actually landing on it. He kept it up until Ryan had real tears in his eyes and then, finally, he smiled and engulfed it in the wet, hot heat of his mouth, making Ryan buck his hips off the bed and make a sound he’d never heard him make up to this point. He wanted to hear it again. Blayde began to deep throat him, moving up and down his shaft hard and fast, but just as Ryan was about to climax, he pulled back his head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan was beyond speech at this point, merely grunting low in disbelief and pain. He simply stared at Blayde, panting like a dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should I let you come?” Blayde reached down to lick up the shaft of his cock, eliciting a squeal of pleasure, or was it pain?“If I do, what will you do for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything…please, Alpha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll hold you to that later, baby.” Smiling, he hooked one of Ryan’s legs over his shoulder and plunged deep inside him, while at the same time grabbing his cock in one strong hand. He began stroking once, twice in the same rhythm over both his cock and his prostate at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come for me, sweetheart. Give it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a deep, guttural moan, Ryan began to come hard, actually screaming out his relief. Blayde reached his orgasm too, and Ryan arched up and into Blayde’s arms, holding on tightly and burying his face in Blayde’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, Blayde unsnapped the cuffs and held him in his arms until Ryan caught his breath, then stretched out beside him on the bed and held him as he slept. Blayde let him sleep in his arms for a few minutes before shaking him gently awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother deep breath and he asked,“Do you agree to become my mate, baby? Make no mistake, I’ll never release you from your vow should you say yes. But if you say no, I’ll have to get you out of here and over to my brother’s house. I can’t play with you anymore and not make you my mate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan turned to face him. He flipped himself over on the bed and wrapped his legs around Blayde’s waist, putting his sweet ass right on top of Blayde’s cock, which swelled up to welcome it. Blayde took a huge gasp of air. He was holding on by a thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan leaned down and whispered in his ear.“I don’t know.It’s so quick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It does seem pretty quick, I guess.It’s fast for me too, but I want you. I’ll never want anybody else but you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan still hesitated, unsure of what to do. This man excited him, even as he bossed him around.He’d never been so controlled and dominated before, but he had to admit a part of him loved it.He’d had the most intense orgasm of his life just now and he knew it was because of the way he talked to him, the way he told him what to do and dominated him. The thing was, it touched some part of him deep inside he never really knew existed. He wanted to submit to this man. He wanted Blaydeto drive him crazy and make him do things he’d never done before. And he most definitely did not want to leave him tonight. Or maybe ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I agree to do it and then if I want out in a few months, you’ll let me go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, damn. Could he agree to that? In a few months, it would kill him to let Ryan go. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to live without him after that much time had passed. But there was little chance of that. Once he gave Ryan the mating bite, it would change Ryan forever, and Blayde’s venom would ensure Ryan would probably never want to leave him. Still, if that was the only way Ryan would agree to be his mate, he had to agree to it. He wouldn’t force him. Then if Ryan became unhappy, in a few months he would let him leave if he wanted to. If he could, that is, even though it would mean Blayde’s own death. Once mated, Lycans found it impossible to live long without their mates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the solid bricks of the wallhe’d carefully built up over the cycles against settling down with just one mate for life were suddenly collapsing around his head and burying him under the rubble. The feel of his mate’s sweet arms around his neck, and his sweet ass against his cock had already brought out all the raging lust in his body. There was no way he could deny him anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you, Ryan. I want you for my mate. If this is the only way I can have you, then I agree. If you want to leave me after a while, then I’ll let you go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan leaned over to kiss him softly on his ear. His tongue darted out and licked it gently, making Blayde almost lose his mind.“Then yes, I accept you as my mate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde put back his head and howled so loudly the whole settlement probably heard him. He laid Ryan back down on his back and reached for the lube. Ryan looked at him with huge eyes, startled by what he’d done, but he couldn’t help it. A surge of pure adrenaline was coursing through him. Laying Ryan back on the bed and pulling his legs up over his forearms, Blayde leaned down to whisper in his ear, knowing his voice would come out rough and animal-like and not wanting to frighten him.“I’m going to fuck you again, sweetheart. I’ll try to be gentle, but I can’t promise anything. My wolfis very strong, and I’m holding him at bay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands trembling with need, he prepared his darling as best he could, lubing him well and stretching him with his fingers. Then before he could stop himself, his beast took over and he plunged into him, burying himself to the balls in his ass. Ryan looked up at him questioningly, his eyes wide and scared, and Blayde tried to smile at him.“Are you okay, baby?I didn’t hurt you, did I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it feels good. I…oh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlayde had just raked across his prostate, giving it a good internal rubdown with his cock, enjoying seeing his mate squirm and cry out.“Oh, Blayde!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come for me, baby. Come hard for me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few more thrusts and both of them were breathing hard and gripping the mattress. Blayde reached for Ryan’s cock and gave it a hard pump and Ryan lost it totally, arching his back and screaming out his release. After he recovered, Ryan took a deep breath and then relaxed his body completely, looking nervously up at the Lycan, because he hadn’t come yet. Blayde caught the look from Ryan and smiled at him gently.“It’s all right. I wanted you to come first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t want to frighten his sweet mate by telling him what was coming. Besides, the more relaxed he was the better off he would be, and that was why he’d let him come first. Blayde’s hand rubbed Ryan’s balls, and at the same time caressed his cock, trying to pleasure him everywhere at once. Ryan whimpered and moaned as Blayde began to move again inside Ryan’s velvet heat, checking carefully for his response. Ryan was still relaxed and open, his eyes closed in bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just try to relax. Push back against me.That’s it, sweetheart.” Blayde began to move deeper inside, and then drove into him, hard and fast and deep, so that Ryan tensed a little and cried out in surprise. As Blayde buried himself balls deep inside Ryan, he leaned over and whispered to him.“Hang on, baby. This might hurt a little.” Unable to wait, Blayde bit down hard on the side ofRyan’s neck, breaking the skin and sucking in the blood as it seeped out. At the same time, his knot swelled up inside Ryan’s passage, tying them together. His orgasm came moments later, rocking him to his core. Ryan screamed and tried to get away, but Blayde held his body tight, sinking his fangs deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly after he had emptied himself into Ryan did he lick at the wound, which started to heal as soon as he put his tongue down to it. It would heal over but leave a scar, marking Ryan as his mate. He had made the bite mark high on his neck so it would always show that he was owned. Between the mark and the fact that he would make damn sure Ryan would always have his scent all over him, no one would ever be foolish enough to touch his mate again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/most-wanted-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-1/page-10.html","bookId":1591,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:24:07 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:24:07 AM"}
