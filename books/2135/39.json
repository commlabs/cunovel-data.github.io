Tinged with so much color that one\u0027s soul sang. Even souls trapped in immortal bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I drove north along the Pacific Coast Highway toward Malibu, I realized that today was the first day that Kingsley had not tried to call me or text me. I had always kept Kingsley at arm\u0027s length. I had done so for a number of reasons, and one of them was because I suspected he would do something like this. The man was an infamous womanizer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I had been too cautious with him. Maybe I had shut him out of my heart for too long. Maybe I had made it easy for him to be with another woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo fuck another woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pressing hard on the gas again, too hard. I was whipping past other cars at an alarming rate. I eased up and unclenched my grip on the steering wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Kingsley, he had been ready for a relationship. He had been ready to settle down, to explore something serious. I hadn\u0027t been. I was dealing with a lot of hurt and had no business starting anything new with Kingsley. But he had been persistent, and sexy as hell...and unlike anything I had seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a tiger didn\u0027t change his stripes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranted, this tiger - or wolf - had a little help from above. Namely from my guardian angel who had set Kingsley up. And Kingsley, being the dog that he was, fell for it hook, line and sinker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I should thank Ishmael for showing me Kingsley\u0027s true colors. Then again, maybe I should tell Ishmael to go to hell, since he\u0027d caused this mess in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut didn\u0027t he give you immortality? a voice inside me asked. And the gift of flight? And great strength?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad that been me asking those questions, or the thing inside me? I didn\u0027t know. Still, they were valid questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I thought about them as I drove on. Ishmael had acted out of love and selfishness. Tainted love. Ishmael had put me in unparalleled danger. He had risked my life...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had risked his own salvation for love. His love for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had risked everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that...and I continued thinking about that even as I pulled up to Andre Fine\u0027s Malibu beach home. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-39.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
