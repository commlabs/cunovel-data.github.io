One even bent down to move her bag of threads for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna walked to the other side of the hearth and sat down in the Maclaurin chair. She adjusted her skirts, tucked in a loose pleat, and then picked up her tapestry again and went back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head was bent to her task. She pretended intense concentration, for the Maclaurins were still watching her. When she heard several grunts that she assumed were rude noises of approval, she had to bite her lower lip so she wouldn’t start laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather MacKechnie stayed by Gabriel’s side throughout the rest of the evening. He was catching his laird up on all the latest happenings with the other clans. Johanna found the discussion fascinating. The topic was feuding, and it seemed to her that every clan in the Highlands was currently involved in some sort of an argument. The reasons the priest gave for the warring were even more astonishing to her. Why, the slightest breach or insult set tempers boiling. Sneezing seemed to be enough of a reason to go into battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Highlanders like to fight, don’t they, Father?” Johanna didn’t look up from her tapestry when she called out her question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather MacKechnie waited until the Maclaurin soldiers had filed out of the hall before answering her. Johanna was pleased to see the men leave. They were so loud and rambunctious, and it was difficult to discuss anything without shouting every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was blissfully quiet once the men had taken their leave. None of them had bothered to bow to their mistress. She tried not to take offense, for at least they had given her husband that bit of respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe repeated her question to the priest. “Aye, they do like to fight,” Father MacKechnie agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is that, do you suppose?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s considered honorable,” the priest explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna missed a stitch, frowned, and set about righting the damage. She kept her gaze on her task when she asked her husband if he agreed with the priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, it is honorable,” Gabriel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found their opinions daft. “Banging heads together is considered honorable? I can’t imagine why, m’lord.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel smiled. Johanna’s choice of words, added to her exasperated tone of voice, amused him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fighting lets the Highlanders show off those qualities they most admire, lass,” the priest explained. “Courage, loyalty to their leader, and endurance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No warrior wishes to die in his bed,” Gabriel interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They consider it a sin,” the priest advised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped her needle and looked up at the men. She was certain they were jesting with her. They both looked sincere, however. She still wasn’t convinced. “Which sin would that be?” she asked, her suspicion apparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sloth,” Gabriel told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost snorted. She caught herself in time. “You must think me naive to believe that tall tale,” she scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, you are naive, Johanna, but we aren’t jesting with you. We do consider it a sin to die in our beds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head so he’d know she wasn’t believing any of his nonsense, then went back to sewing. The priest continued with his news. Gabriel was having difficulty paying attention. His gaze kept returning to his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe enchanted him. Contentment such as he’d never known before swelled inside his chest. When he was very young and foolish and all alone, he would fall asleep each night thinking about his future. He made up dreams about the family he would have. His wife and his children would belong only to him, and they would, of course, live in his castle. Gabriel often pictured his wife sitting by the fire doing some feminine task . . . such as sewing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe images he’d conjured up in his mind as a little boy kept the harsh reality of his stark life from overwhelming him. The fantasies helped him survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, he’d been terribly young and tender back then. Time and training had toughened him, however, and he’d outgrown the need for such foolish dreams. He no longer felt the need to belong. He’d learned to depend solely upon himself. Dreams were for the weak. Aye, he thought to himself, he was strong now and his dreams were all but forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil now. The memories came flooding back as he stared at his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReality was a hell of a lot better than fantasies, Gabriel decided. He’d never imagined having a wife as beautiful as Johanna. He hadn’t known what contentment was or how he would feel or how fierce his need would become to protect her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna happened to look up and caught her husband staring at her. His expression puzzled her. He seemed to be staring through her as though he was lost in some important thought. Aye, he must be thinking about something troublesome, she guessed, because his frown had become ferocious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could use a spot of uisgebreatha,” Father MacKechnie announced. “Then I’ll be looking for my bed. Lord, I’m weary tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna immediately got up to serve the priest. A jug filled with Highland brew was kept on the chest against the wall behind Gabriel. She carried the jug over to the table and filled the priest’s goblet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to serve her husband next. Gabriel declined the drink with a shake of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather MacKechnie took a long swallow and promptly grimaced. “I’d wager this hasn’t aged more than a week at most,” he complained. “It tastes like sour swill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel smiled. “You’ll have to complain to Auggie. The drink came from his kettles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna’s curiosity was captured by the priest’s remark about aging. “Is it important how long the drink waits?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It ages, lass,” the priest corrected. “It doesn’t wait. And yes, it’s important. The longer, the better, some experts say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long?” she wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why, as long as ten or twelve years in the oak barrels,” Father MacKechnie speculated. “It takes a patient man to wait that long for a taste, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is the drink more valuable then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna put the jug down on the table. She stood next to her husband’s side while she waited for the priest to finish his drink and answer her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hand on Gabriel’s shoulder. Her gaze was intent upon the priest, and Gabriel doubted she was even aware she was touching him. The unconscious show of affection pleased him considerably, for it was proof to him that she’d completely conquered her fear of him. And that, he decided, was an important first step. He was out to gain her trust. Oh, he remembered demanding she give him her trust, but he’d realized right after giving her that high-handed order that trust would have to be earned. Gabriel believed he was a patient man. He would wait. In time she would realize her good fortune and value his protection. She would learn to trust him, and with that trust came loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man couldn’t ask for anything more from his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest pulled him away from his thoughts when he said, “The drink is very valuable once it’s been allowed to age. Men would kill for pure uisgebreatha. The Highlanders, you see, take their drinking seriously. ’Tis the reason they call it the water of life, lass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would they barter for goods if aged brew was offered in trade?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Johanna, why does this topic interest you?” Gabriel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. She didn’t want to tell him about the barrels of liquid gold Auggie had mentioned to her. She would have to gain permission from her friend first. She also wanted to see for herself that the barrels were still inside the cave. Besides, it would be a nice surprise for Gabriel; and if the value was as high as Johanna guessed, her husband would have something to barter with for supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Father, would you honor us by taking over the vacant chamber upstairs tonight?” Johanna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest turned his gaze to his laird. He waited for him to extend his invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a comfortable bed, Father,” Gabriel remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather MacKechnie smiled. “I’ll be happy to take it,” he said. “It’s most hospitable of you to open your home to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather MacKechnie stood up, bowed to his laird, and then went to collect his things. Johanna walked back over to her chair, gathered her tapestry and needle and put them back inside her bag. Gabriel waited for her near the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You may leave your sewing on the chair, wife. No one will bother it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDumfries came back into the hall, passed Johanna on her way to the stairs, and growled at her. She patted the hound before continuing on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel followed Johanna up the stairs. She seemed preoccupied with her thoughts while she prepared for bed. He added a log to the fire, then stood up, leaned against the mantel, and watched her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you thinking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This and that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That isn’t a proper answer, Johanna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was thinking about my life here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve made the transition without much difficulty,” he remarked. “You should be happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna tied the belt to her robe and turned to her husband. “I haven’t made any transition, Gabriel. ’Tis the truth I’ve been living in limbo. I’ve been caught between two worlds,” she added with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband sat down on the side of the bed and pulled his boots off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I meant to talk to you about this topic earlier today,” she said. “But there didn’t seem to be enough time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly what is it you’re trying to tell me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and all the others have been treating me like a visitor, Gabriel. Worse, I’ve been acting like one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Johanna, you aren’t making any sense. I don’t take strangers to my bed. You’re my wife, not a visitor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her gaze to the fire. She was thoroughly disgusted with herself. “Do you know what I’ve realized? In my bid to protect myself, I’ve become completely self-consumed. I’ll have to go to confession tomorrow and beg God’s forgiveness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no need to worry about protecting yourself. It’s my duty to take care of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled in spite of her irritation. Gabriel sounded insulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it is my duty to take care of myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t like hearing her opinion. His scowl was as hot as the fire. “Do you deliberately try to rile me by suggesting I can’t take care of you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried to soothe him. “Of course not,” she answered. “I’m pleased to have your protection.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You contradict yourself, woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not trying to confuse you, Gabriel. I’m just trying to sort things out in my mind. When someone’s hungry and there isn’t any food, well then that someone is consumed day and night with the worry of finding something to eat. Isn’t that true, husband?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel shrugged. “I would imagine so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For a long time I’ve been consumed with fear. I lived with it for so long, it seemed to take control of me, but now that I’m safe, I’ve had time to think about other matters. Do you understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t understand. He didn’t like seeing her frown either. “I’ve told you, you please me. You needn’t be worried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was exasperated. Since she was turned away from her husband, she felt it safe to smile. “Gabriel, as surprising as this may be for you to hear, I’m not overly concerned about pleasing you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was surprised all right as well as irritated. “You’re my wife,” he reminded her. “It is therefore your duty to want to please me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna let out a sigh. She knew her husband didn’t understand what she was trying to explain. She couldn’t fault him. She barely understood herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I meant no insult, m’lord.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded sincere. Gabriel was appeased. He came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. Then he leaned down to kiss the side of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come to bed now. I want you, Johanna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you, too, Gabriel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned around and smiled at her husband. He lifted her into his arms and carried her to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made slow, sweet love to each other, and when they each had found their fulfillment, they held each other close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do please me, woman.” His voice was gruff with affection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember your praise, m’lord, for I’m certain there will be times in future when I don’t please you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this a worry or a prophecy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned up on her elbow and gently stroked the side of his neck. “Nay, I give you only the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned his attention with her question about his intentions for tomorrow. He wasn’t accustomed to discussing his plans with anyone, but he was in the mood to make her happy and so he went into detail about the hunt he planned and the items he and his men planned to steal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe vowed not to lecture him. She couldn’t keep silent more than a few minutes, though, and hurled herself into a speech about the merits of probity. She mentioned the wrath of God on Judgment Day. Gabriel wasn’t impressed with her speech about fire and brimstone. He yawned in the middle of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Husband, it’s my duty to help you lead a good, honest life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’ll get to heaven, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. She gave up. She fell asleep worrying about her husband’s soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing Johanna noticed when she came downstairs the following morning was her tapestry. The half-completed wall hanging had been ripped to shreds. Her bag wasn’t intact either. The culprit was busy chewing on one of the burlap straps. He’d already devoured the other one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDumfries knew he’d gotten into mischief. He tried to crawl under one of the chairs when she shouted his name and started toward him. The chair went crashing to the ground; Dumfries started howling, and Megan came running from the buttery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog sounded like a demon let out of hell. The frightening sound he made was loud enough to shake the rafters. The noise terrified Megan. Even though the hound wasn’t paying her any attention, she was still extremely cautious when she bent to pick up the tapestry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeith and Calum both heard the commotion and came running inside. They came to a dead stop on the top step. Gabriel was right behind them. He shoved the soldiers out of the way and started down the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna was involved in a tug of war with Dumfries. The dog was winning. She was trying to get her bag out of his mouth. She was concerned the hound would choke on the strap he was trying to swallow. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/saving-grace/page-24.html","bookId":1839,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:03 AM"}
