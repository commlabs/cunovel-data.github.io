Leylin had not done much in preparation, and instead left everything to Offa and the others, at most just showing his face when greeting guests and accepting gifts. He also displayed his Breaking Dawn abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis whole process meant that the time that Leylin had showed himself was meagre, causing many high-ranked Magi to grit their teeth in frustration. However, Offa and the rest were very experienced and made sure the ceremony was very lively, and even held several auctions and private trade meetings amongst many others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be said that due to the vastness of the central continent, it was inconvenient for Magi from various regions to make connections. They could interact and exchange services through this ceremony, which was definitely a nice surprise for them. Even centuries later, there were still Magi who still constantly recalled this ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the higher-ups in large organisations were focused on something else. While Leylin had not shown himself often, the rank 6 Breaking Dawn strength that he showed, the soldified soul flames, were definitely not fake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis meant that the prophecy that had been circulating for a long time regarding the most powerful bloodline Monarch amongst Warlocks had been realised! Many Magi had complicated feelings towards the rise of Warlock organisations, and there were plenty who were dissatisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before they could join forces or plot something, Leylin did something unthinkable, Under the fervent stares of the audience, Leylin requested a battle with the Breaking Dawn Monarchs!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn’t just a one-on-one match. He was going to go up against all the Monarchs by himself!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Leylin first suggested this, practically everyone thought that he had gone insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as a Warlock with a boost from his bloodline, how could a rank 6 Warlock who had recently advanced be a match for the many Breaking Dawn Monarchs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were even many Magi who believed that the Monarchs wouldn’t accept Leylin’s proposal and felt that this was an insult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the way things progressed shocked them. For some reason, the Breaking Dawn Magi actually agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the site and the destructive force, they did not choose to have the battle in the main world but in a spatial crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis prevented many low-ranked Magi from looking in, and the bare minimum to enter was raised to rank 4, Morning Star Magi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battle ended quickly, and practically the moment the rank 2 and 3 Magi began to get anxious in their wait, numerous high-ranked Magi returned from the spatial crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, they all looked extremely pale, and some even began to mutter under their breaths, as if they were under shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe few Radiant Moon and even Monarchs had the same expression, followed by Leylin, who looked carefree. The results were obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shock this gave to all the Magi was terrifying beyond relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin had confronted all of the Monarchs alone and actually achieved victory, and in such a short time at that, and with such ease! Numerous Magi exchanged gazes, having a feeling that there would soon be a drastic change to the central continent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter this, while many Morning Star Magi did not dare breathe even a word of this, there were quite a number who had watched the battle and had close friends or family they shared this with. The details of the battle gradually leaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom what they had said, Lord Leylin had displayed extraordinary strength from the very beginning. Whether Morning Star, Radiant Moon or even Breaking Dawn Monarchs could only quiver before his energy undulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment they fought, the Monarchs all lost at one go and even received injuries of varying degrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Perhaps before they had even fought, they had already been defeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch an unimaginable and outrageous matter immediately caused much suspicion, but when rumours spread but nobody going against the rumours, the central continent descended into a deathly silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only change was that even in private discussions, those Magi did not dare even mention Leylin’s name and instead replaced it with the ‘Bloodline Monarch’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s fame thus spread at a startling speed, and the Bloodline Warlock Union took advantage of this, thus developing largely. Of course, that is what happened in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Leylin, the ceremony was extremely boring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe precious gifts the organisations offered to him to show their goodwill were nothing to him. For the battle against the Monarchs, he had merely emitted less than 1% of the aura of his main body, but these Monarchs could not even withstand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this caused Leylin’s interest to wane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the hasty ending, he surprisingly got enough time to do as he pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the extravagant palace, Leylin was now making some coffee. Whether it was the grinding of the coffee beans or the later procedures, everything happened smoothly and there was a certain beauty to his actions. There was even a unique charm and order to everything that lingered in one’s memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hehe… Weyers seems to be rather shocked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelinda was clad in a fox-skin coat, a fox tail around her neck while she sized Leylin up and down with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That little guy?” Leylin chuckled, and then shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, any talents or the like were nothing to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelinda sipped at the coffee and then put the cup down, looking serious. Though she had already overestimated Leylin, the terrifying strength he exhibited still exceeded her expectations. Even what he had shown could very well be the tip of the iceberg!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelinda straightened her back slightly, looking glum, “Lord Leylin, you… have you already touched upon the realm of laws?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes!” Leylin nodded, hearing Melinda’s sharp intake shortly after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an old freak that had lived for a long time, Melinda was definitely aware of the terror of laws. Leylin was definitely not one of those who liked to brag, yet were inexperienced and narrow-minded. Instead, he had probably entered a deeper realm, which had resulted in such a terrifying change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No wonder…” Melinda forced out a laugh, “No wonder it was effortless for you to deal with us…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin glanced at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his opinion, Melinda was also a crafty person with origins even more mysterious than the other Monarchs, and seemed to know many ancient secrets. She had not expended much effort this time either, and even any backlashes or injuries might be all for show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well then, what are you future plans? Are you going to unify the central continent?” She asked nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had already made her mind up anyway. If Leylin had a wish, she would be the first to show her sincerity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terror that were the existences of laws were impossible to be stopped by a rank 6 Magus like her who had only made slight progress on the flame law. With his will, the whole central continent could only tremble in fear and obey. Melinda was sure of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’ve never considered that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin first stared at Melinda, and only when she began to squirm in unease that he chuckled in answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve no interest in the central continent. Just as you’ve seen, the Ouroboros Clan is now moving to the south coast. Only one branch of the clan will be left as a link to the central continent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter hearing Leylin’s guarantee, Melinda heaved a sigh of relief inside. She knew that there was no need for him to fool her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I’ll thank you on behalf of the Magi of the central continent! Thank you for exempting them from the fate of a bloodbath!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelinda spoke and bowed to Leylin solemnly, and Leylin accepted this all apathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I’ve also prepared a small present for you. I hope you like it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelinda smirked like a little fox and clapped her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord Leylin!” A female Magus dressed in black walked out from the corner, kneeling to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Tanasha!” Leylin nodded. He no longer paid any mind to a rank 3 like her. After she had accepted his present, she had walked the path of revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This girl relied on the power you gifted her, and had already gotten her revenge against Harper. Somehow, she managed to mysteriously offend a few organisations and became stranded in my territory…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelinda giggled, “Of course, I’ve already helped to take care of those tiny issues!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm,” Leylin answered, “Tanasha, you’re right in time. We’re planning to move. Look for Mistress Freya. She’ll settle you in…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, Leylin felt nothing as he watched Tanasha leave deferentially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith just a thought, there were large numbers of rank 4, 5 or even 6 who would hastily come over to run errands for him. This rank 3 subordinate was now hardly enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, she was one of his people, and he would naturally give her a way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for the matter with Tanasha. I’m rather interested in the soul splitting technique you mentioned before, and I’ve had some other thoughts regarding it. I hope to discuss it with you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter chatting for a while longer, Leylin shifted the conversation to more proper matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the real reason he was meeting Melinda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Methods to split the soul into two? If my lord is interested in such a dangerous technique, I will naturally present everything I know!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Melinda was astonished, she still agreed easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-770\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-772\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-771","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
