(1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beginner’s competition fights continued. There were countless of fights here everyday, and though Zhou Weiqing’s fight against Green Wolf was indeed exciting, it was not enough to draw everybody’s attention for a long time. The cacophony of fighting sounds and cheers continued all around the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er was standing beside Zhou Weiqing, and she gave him a pinch around the waist, saying softly: “Why must you act like that? Why don’t you just reveal your power? Haven’t you been emphasizing your lack of time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing felt the sudden pain and had a bitter look on his face as he said: “We have just reached and are very unfamiliar with this place and its situation. It’s better to take things a step at a time, to learn more before I can advance my plan. Sometimes, if you are standing at too high a position, you’re unable to learn many things. For example, that Ruffian Battalion that Green Wolf is from… what kind of place or formation is that? Is that even something that should exist in the army?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er said: “How would I know? Anyway, I’m itching to fight. Since you didn’t let me fight here, tonight you are mine.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow, if any ordinary man heard Shangguan Fei’er tell him those latter words, it would definitely set his heart aflame. Alas, when poor Zhou Weiqing heard those words, his first reaction was to take an involuntary step back, pleading sorrowfully: “Heroine, please let me off.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er said smugly: “I’ll leave it up to you, in any case, if I’m not satisfied here, tonight I will be teaching you personally more about close combat.” \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing gave a humph and said: “If you dare, let’s not use Consolidated Equipment, only Elemental Jewels.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShangguan Fei’er’s greatest strength was her terrifying close combat skills along with her four unique Legendary Set Consolidated Equipment, while Zhou Weiqing’s greatest strength was his many powerful skills and unending changes and variety he could use them in. If Shangguan Fei’er did not use her Consolidated Equipment, he might actually stand a chance against her. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlas, it was not so easy to trick her, and she just lifted her head and ignored his words. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe fights continued, and the atmosphere in the Duelling Center remained as lifely as before. After some time, Zhou Weiqing finally spotted someone walking up to the empty middle platform. It was one of the Company Leaders from earlier. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“All brothers of the Sixteenth Regiment, listen up! When this round of fights ends, the beginner competition fights will stop for a while.” His voice had clearly been enhanced by his Heavenly Energy, and it travelled out far and wide to all corners, suppressing the loud noise in the building, allowing even the furthest audience to hear him. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe original lively building quietened down instantly, and everyone turned to look at the Company Leader in the middle platform curiously. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Company Leader smiled faintly and said: “Very soon, there will be an unbelievably exciting fight here in the Intermediate Challenge stage. Our challenger is a fresh recruit, a young brother who has just joined our Sixteenth Regiment. His name is Zhou Little Fatty. His opponent has been chosen via drawing of lots, and is our very own Tyrannical Bear. All of you should know Tyrannical Bear; like me, he is a Company Leader, and I’ve heard rumours that this fellow once tore a Polar Bear apart with his bare hands, thus earning this nickname. Furthermore, Tyrannical Bear is a Six-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master with the Strength and Speed boosts. Amongst our Sixteenth Regiment twenty Intermediate ringmasters, he is considered one of the top five. Let us await this exciting spectacle and enjoy ourselves!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis words had barely ended when a massive uproar of cheers shook the entire building. An intermediate challenge was definitely far more exciting than any beginner’s competition, especially since Tyrannical Bear was extremely popular in the Sixteenth Regiment; in the war against the WanShou Empire, he had killed more than fifty enemy powerhouses, and he was one of the few who had slowly raised through the ranks through his own military exploits. If not for the fact that his leadership skills were not up to speed, with his military exploits and rank in the Duelling Corner, he could perhaps be at the Battalion Commander level. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter the proclamation of the upcoming match, the other Company Leader who had left at the same time returned back to Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Little Bro, your luck isn’t very good! There were seven Intermediate ringmasters here today, but you actually got Tyrannical Bear. That fellow isn’t any kind soul, and he’s renowned for his Physical Strength as well. According to him, he has some bear bloodlines within him. Later on, you better be careful. If you feel like you cannot take it anymore, just surrender, do not force yourself.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Thank you Company Leader Big Bro for your advice.” Zhou Weiqing gave him a heartfelt thanks before saying: “So, does this mean the fight is starting?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Company Leader looked hard at Zhou Weiqing, but could only see that innocent, honest face. Finally, he nodded and said: “When all the current beginner competition fights end, then your Intermediate fight with Tyrannical Bear will begin. For the Intermediate Fights, every victory has a reward of a gold coin. If you are able to defeat Tyrannical Bear, and challenge successfully another few more times consecutively, you can even become a Company Leader.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePerhaps because of the upcoming Intermediate fight, the remaining beginner’s competition fights all ended quickly. Led by the Company Leader beside him, Zhou Weiqing quickly ascended the central stage. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs compared to the Heavenly Jewel Tournament’s stage, this place was much smaller and simpler, rougher. However, as soon as he entered the stage, that feeling of being watched by thousands of audiences, of being the center of attention returned. Hearing the cheers from all directions, the excitement was sparked within Zhou Weiqing. Stretching his body, he felt as if he was imbued with an endless supply of energy. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Company Leader which had ascended the central stage earlier to give out the proclamation was now taking on the role of the judge, and he shouted out loud: “Alright everyone, the Intermediate Competition Fight is now beginning. Let me first do a quick introduction. This young man here is the one I spoke about earlier, our new recruit Zhou Little Fatty. Do not underestimate him just because he is a fresh recruit; earlier he has just fought three in three beginner competition fights, and defeated all his opponents in an instant. One of those three opponents was even Green Wolf from the Ruffian Battalion. It was because of those victories that he was given the opportunity to fight in the intermediate ring. Zhou Little Fatty’s strength is also his speciality, so it is time for us to see whose strength is ultimately greater, him or Tyrannical Bear! Alright, next is our honoured Intermediate Ringmaster, Tyrannical Bear!” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e*Swoosh* Before his words had ended, a huge figure jumped onto the stage, landing with a loud clash. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTyrannical Bear’s figure was actually not as huge and overstated as Green Wolf earlier, standing around 1.8metres tall, even slightly shorter than Zhou Weiqing. However, his shoulders were extremely broad and muscled. The thing that attracted the most attention were actually his arms; his army uniform was sleeveless, revealing his two powerful arms that were as thick as most thighs, covered with black hair. His yellow eyes stared fixedly at Zhou Weiqing, filled with a bloodthirsty aura as he licked his lips. “Zhou Little Fatty right? Be careful, or Your Father, I, will break your nuts. Heh heh heh.” Tyrannical Bear said to Zhou Weiqing as he brandished his powerful arms. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeeing Tyrannical Bear, Zhou Weiqing immediately remembered back to the time when he had just joined the Heavenly Bow Empire army, and they had ran across a Kalise Empire ambush on Shangguan Bing’er. At that time, the Kalise Empire’s Jewel Masters had been the attackers, and amongst them was a five-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master who had been using two warhammers, and his figure was extremely similar to this Tyrannical Bear. Of course, it was without doubt that this Tyrannical Bear was much more powerful, at the six-Jeweled level. However, at this point, Zhou Weiqing was no longer that weak, one-Jeweled Zhou Little Fatty. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFacing his opponent’s mocking provocation, Zhou Weiqing only smiled faintly and said: “Big Bro, those big arms of yours look really good, if we pull out all the fur and skin it, and barbeque it with salt and spices, I’m sure it’ll taste very good. I wonder how it compares to Bear Paws \u003ca id\u003d\"footnoteref-1\" href\u003d\"#footnote-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e?” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eStanding at the side, the Company Leader who was the judge was totally stunned by those words. In his eyes, Zhou Little Fatty was an innocent, honest young man, but his current words were nothing like that at all; not only arrogant but extremely provoking. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Tyrannical Bear had heard that Zhou Weiqing had defeated Green Wolf so easily, he had been extremely wary. Despite his looks, he was not a careless or brash person. He had to admit to himself that he would not be able to defeat Green Wolf without using any Heavenly Energy, and before he ascended the stage, he had still been hoping that the little fellow on top was not a Jewel Master. The provoking words he had spoken were actually to sound out Zhou Weiqing, but who knows that he had not successfully angered Zhou Weiqing, and was instead the one angered. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith an enraged howl, Tyrannical Bear charged forward towards Zhou Weiqing. However, despite his anger, he did not lose his reason, releasing his Physical Jewels at first chance. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFrom a single glance, Zhou Weiqing was able to tell that this Tyrannical Bear’s Physical Jewel was considered quite a good boost in the ordinary Jewel Master world, with seventy percent boost in strength and thirty percent on speed. His six Physical Jewels glowed brilliantly, and in a flash, he was right in front of Zhou Weiqing, his large arms hammering down onto Zhou Weiqing’s head. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Weiqing’s own physical strength was extremely terrifying, one of the many strongest benefits that the \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDark Demon God Tiger Bloodline had granted him. Furthermore, he had gone through two evolving, causing his already considerable strength to grow even further. Along with that Demonic Right Leg of his, he could take on ordinary Jewel Masters without problem even without unleashing his Heavenly Jewels. Even so, he did not dare to face a six-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master of Tyrannical Bear’s calibre with just his own physique alone. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA Jewel Master’s power grew exponentially every Jewel he had, and just facing the Four-Jeweled Green Wolf earlier with his physique alone, Zhou Weiqing had already felt it was extremely difficult. If he underestimated Tyrannical Bear and attempted to use only his physique, he would undoubtedly have no chance. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a midst of swirling mist, four pure Icy Jade Physical Jewels appeared around Zhou Weiqing’s right wrist, and around his left wrist, four red Emperor Tourmaline Jewels showed, showing the Strength and Wind Attributes of a Heavenly Jewel Master respectively. Without question, that was the effect of Zhou Weiqing’s Ring of Concealment. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter some consideration, Zhou Weiqing had decided to reveal his Elemental Jewel as the Wind Attribute. Amongst all his six Attributes, the Wind Attribute was probably the most ‘normal’ of them all. Furthermore, his four Wind Attribute Skills were very good, and more importantly, the most all-encompassing. It could be said that no matter Support, Control, Offense, his Wind Attribute Skills had them all, and with those, he could handle most situations. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith his Heavenly Jewels unleashed, Zhou Weiqing’s strength multiplied. However, when Tyrannical Bear saw the four pure Icy Jade Physical Jewels around his wrist, his heart sank. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n \u003cem\u003eZen\u0027s note: I couldn\u0027t help but laugh when I read that last bit.
