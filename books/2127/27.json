Memories of Wulfgar dominated his thoughts, but they were not dark images, were not flashes of the alcove wherein Wulfgar had been buried. Drizzt remembered the many adventures, always exciting, often reckless, he had shared beside the towering man. Trusting in his faith, Drizzt placed Wulfgar in that same corner of his heart where he had tucked the memories of Zaknafein, his father. He could not deny his sadness at Wulfgar\u0027s loss, didn\u0027t want to deny it, but the many good memories of the straight-backed young barbarian could counter that sadness, bring a bittersweet smile to Drizzt Do\u0027Urden\u0027s calm face. He knew that Catti-brie, too, would come to a similar, accepting mind-set. She was young and strong and filled with a lust for adventure, however dangerous, as great as that of Drizzt and of Wulfgar. Catti-brie would learn to smile along with the tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt\u0027s only fear was for Bruenor. The dwarf king was not so young, not so ready to look ahead to what was yet to come in his remaining years. But Bruenor had suffered many tragedies in his long and hardy life, and, generally speaking, it was the way of the stoic dwarves to accept death as a natural passing. Drizzt had to trust that Bruenor was strong enough to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until Drizzt focused on Regis that he considered the many other things that had occurred. Entreri, the evil man who had done grievous wrongs to so many, was gone. How many in the four corners of Faerun would rejoice at that news?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd House Do\u0027Urden, Drizzt\u0027s tie to the dark world of his kin, was no more. Had Drizzt finally slipped beyond the grasp of Menzoberranzan? Could he, and Bruenor and Catti-brie and all the others of Mithril Hall, rest easier now that the drow threat had been eliminated?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt wished he could be sure. By all accounts of the battle in which Wulfgar was killed, a yochlol, a handmaiden of Lloth, had appeared. If the raid to capture him had been inspired simply by Vierna\u0027s desperation, then what had brought so powerful a minion into their midst?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought did not sit well with Drizzt, and as he sat there in his room, he had to wonder if the drow threat was ended, if he might, at long last, finally know his peace with that city he had left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The emissaries from Settlestone are here,\" Catti-brie said to Bruenor, entering the dwarf\u0027s private chambers without even the courtesy of a knock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not for caring,\" the dwarf king answered her gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie moved over to him, grabbed him by his broad shoulder, and forced him to turn and look her in the eye. What passed between them was silent, a shared moment of grief and understanding that if they did not go on with their lives, did not forge ahead, then Wulfgar\u0027s death was all the more pointless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat loss is death if life is not to be lived?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor grabbed his daughter around her slender waist and pulled her close in as crushing a hug as the dwarf had ever given. Catti-brie squeezed him back, tears rolling from her deep blue eyes. So, too, did a smile widen on the vital young woman\u0027s face, and, though Bruenor\u0027s shoulders bobbed with unabashed sobs, she felt sure he soon would come to peace as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all he had gone through, Bruenor remained the Eighth King of Mithril Hall, and, for all the adventures, joys, and sorrows Catti-brie had known, she had just passed her twentieth year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere still was much to be done. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-27.html","bookId":2127,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:18 PM"}
