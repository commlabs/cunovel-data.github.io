Through the windows he could look out over the downtown area of the city.

We face great problems, and we face great challenges. We must act now to -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe set abruptly clicked off. Graves turned and saw that Phelps had done it. `I hope you understand now,\u0027 Phelps said. \u0027Wright has half a ton of that gas. In the San Diego area there are a million people. Plus some very distinguished visitors. We can\u0027t afford cat-andmouse games any longer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I agree,\u0027 Graves said, staring out at the street below. There were no trees. He wondered why they hadn\u0027t put any trees in downtown San Diego. Trees made a difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him Phelps picked up the telephone and dialled a number. He said, `Phelps here. I want 702.\u0027 There was a pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNordmann came over to stand by Graves and look down at the street. `You know,\u0027 he said, `I told the Army four years ago if they kept transporting this crap all around, it was only a matter of time before somebody -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You have?\u0027 Phelps said into the phone. His voice was excited. `Where?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves turned.

We\u0027ll be there in five minutes.\u0027 He hung up and turned to Graves. `702 followed the limousine back to Wright\u0027s old apartment house.

But he still had a nagging sense of defeat, as if he had cheated at the game - or had quit too early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Come on,\u0027 Phelps said. `You can introduce him to me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the apartment house two men were standing up facing the wall, guarded by the men from car 702. Phelps and Graves hurried over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men was George, the chauffeur. He was muttering something under his breath. Wright was beside him, neatly dressed in his English-cut suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves said, `You can let them turn around now.\u0027 He glanced at Phelps, who had a look of total triumph on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge turned and looked at Graves uncomprehendingly.

What are you talking about?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves raced down Third, weaving among the traffic. He ran the light at Laurel. Phelps made a gurgling noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wright has been ahead of us all along,\u0027 Graves said. `He must have switched clothes in the airfield hangar and sent somebody else back to San Diego in the limousine. He himself went with the furniture van.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well, if you know where he is now -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I know where he is,\u0027 Graves said. `But it may be too late to stop him.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`How can it be too late?\u0027 Phelps said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves didn\u0027t answer. With a squeal of tyres he continued uptown, then turned down the wrong way on Alameda Street. Cars honked at him; he pulled over to the kerb on the wrong side, facing the wrong way, in front of afire hydrant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhelps didn\u0027t complain. He didn\u0027t have time. Graves was already out of the car and running for the building opposite Wright\u0027s new apartment house. In front of Wright\u0027s building was the furniture van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the men in the room were clustered around the cameras and binoculars at the window. Graves burst in and said, `Is Wright there?F\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 one of the men said. `We heard he was arrested, but somebody in there sure looks like -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Let me see.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves bent over a pair of binoculars. It took only a moment to confirm his worst fears. Wright was there, donning another rubber wet suit. He was pulling rubber loops onto his ankles, his wrists, his waist, and his neck. Of course! Those strips - six strips - protected the seams of his suit from gas. As he watched, Wright put on a full face mask and twisted the valve on the small yellow air tank. The other men in the room cleared out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What\u0027s he doing?\u0027 Phelps said, watching through another pair of binoculars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves looked around Wright\u0027s room. The four sawhorses were still in position. Across them lay two cylinders, each about eight feet long. One was painted black, the other yellow. There were stencilled letters on their sides. As he watched, Wright began connecting hoses from each of the tanks to a central T valve, which joined the hoses into a common outlet. Then he turned his attention to other equipment in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well, that\u0027s it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhelps said, `Let\u0027s go get him.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You\u0027re joking,\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Not at all,\u0027 Phelps said. `We know he\u0027s there, we\u0027ve seen him connect up the hoses so that he can -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhelps broke off and stared at Graves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Exactly,\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`But this is terrible!V\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s not terrible, it\u0027s just a fact,\u0027 Graves said. `There\u0027s no way we can break into that room fast enough to get control before he turns on the valves and releases the gas.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`If we go in shooting -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You risk puncturing the tanks.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well we can\u0027t just sit here and watch.\u0027 Phelps said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves lit a cigarette. `At the moment there isn\u0027t much else we can do.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhelps set down his binoculars. His face was twisted; the earlier look of triumph was completely gone. `Do you have another cigarette?\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves gave him one and then went to the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Morrison here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`This is Graves.

Tell him it\u0027s about Binary 75 slash 76. Here\u0027s my number.\u0027 He gave it to the secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he hung up, one of the men at the window said, `Look what he\u0027s doing now.\u0027 Graves peered through the binoculars. He saw that Wright had removed his rubber suit and was now attaching wires to the floor of the room, to the ceiling, to the walls. He plugged the wires into a central metal box the size of a shoe box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What the hell is that box?\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a corner of the room, Phelps was saying, `Yes, that\u0027s right... That\u0027s what I\u0027m telling you, yes... a half-ton of nerve gas... Of course it\u0027s not a joke...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves saw Wright attach two small mechanical devices to the valves of the two tanks. Then he ran more wires back to the box. Finally he stacked a second metal unit on top of the original box and connected still more wires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Wright looked at his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well, somebody better get through to him,\u0027 Phelps was saying. `Yes, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s hard...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What time is it?\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Two forty.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`The gas is called ZV,\u0027 Phelps was saying. `An Army shipment was stolen in Utah during the early hours this morning.

Yes, it\u0027s here...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men at the window said, `He must be insane.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Of course,\u0027 Graves said. `You\u0027d have to be insane to wipe out a million people and one whole political party.

They\u0027re sitting ducks. Anybody with a little money, a little intelligence, and a screw loose somewhere could arrange for a steal. Look: Richard Speck knocked off eight nurses, but he was an incompetent. Charles Whitman was an expert rifleman, and cu that basis could knock off seventeen people. John Wright is highly intelligent and very wealthy. He\u0027s going to go for a million people and one American President. And thanks to the US Army, he has a chance of succeeding.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I don\u0027t see how you can blame the Army.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You don\u0027t?\u0027 Graves asked. He watched the other apartment through the binoculars. His eyes felt the strain; his vision blurred intermittently, and he swore. Wright appeared to be fooling with the two metal boxes in the centre of the floor. He had been adjusting them for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves wasn\u0027t sure what it all meant. It was a control or alarm system of some kind, though - that much was clear. And if it was a control system, it required power. Power. As Graves watched, he had an idea -one possible way to beat the system that Wright was so carefully setting up. A chance, a slim chance...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Do it,\u0027 he whispered, watching Wright. `Do it, do\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Do what?\u0027 Phelps asked. He was off the telephone now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves did not answer. Wright had finished with the boxes. He turned some dials, made some final adjustments. Then he took the main plug in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`He\u0027s going to do it,\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he plugged it into the wall socket. Very plainly, very clearly, he plugged it into the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`He\u0027s done it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Done what?\u0027 Phelps said, angry now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`He\u0027s connected his device to the apartment electricity.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`So?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`That\u0027s a mistake,\u0027 Graves said. `He should have used a battery unit.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Because we can turn off the electricity in that apartment,\u0027 Graves said. `Remotely.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Oh,\u0027 Phelps said. And then he smiled. `That\u0027s good thinking.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves said nothing. His mind raced forward in exhilarating high gear. For the first time all day, he felt that he was not only keeping abreast of Wright but actually moving a few steps ahead. It was a marvellous feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Time?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Two fifty-one.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as he watched, Wright did something very peculiar. He placed a small white box alongside the two other metal boxes. And he closed the windows to the apartment. Then he taped the joints and seams of the windows shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What the hell does all that mean?\u0027 somebody asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Graves said. `But I know how we can find out.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHOUR 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSAN DIEGO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3 PM PTD\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWright emerged from the apartment house lobby wearing a grey suit.

He had already noticed the raincoat. Nobody carried a raincoat in San Diego in August. It was as out of place as a Bible in a whorehouse. `But I want to know what time it leaves.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`There\u0027s only one possible flight today,\u0027 Wright said. `Connexions in Miami.

The ticket was inside: San Diego to Los Angeles to Miami to Montego Bay, Jamaica. The ticket was made out to Mr A. Johnson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`May I turn around now?\u0027 Wright asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Shut up,\u0027 the marshal said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Let him turn around,\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWright turned, rubbing the grit of the wall from his hands. He smiled at Graves. `Your move.\u0027 In the smile and the slight nod of the head, Graves got a chilling sense of the profound insanity of the man. The eyes gave it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWright\u0027s eyes were genuinely amused: a clever chess player teasing an inferior opponent. But this wasn\u0027t chess, not really. Not with stakes like these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath in 1.7 minutes, Graves thought, and he had a mental image of the prisoner twisting and writhing on the floor, liquid running from his nose in a continuous stream, vomit spewing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves realized then that he had mistaken his opponent for too long. Wright was insane. He was capable of anything. It produced a churning sensation in Graves\u0027 stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Tape him inside,\u0027 Graves said to the marshal. `I want to talk to him.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of them sat in the lobby of the apartment building. It was the kind of lobby that aspired to look like the grossest Miami Beach hotels; there were plastic palms in plastic pots and fake Louis XIV furniture which, apparently out of fear that someone would want to steal it, was bolted to the imitation marble floor. Under other circumstances the artificiality of the surroundings would have annoyed Graves, but now it somehow seemed appropriate. By implication the room suggested that falsehoods were acceptable, even preferable, to the truth. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/binary/page-11.html","bookId":2408,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:58 AM"}
