The spear strike from a moment ago had been blocked by his high-grade human-step treasure armor. However, the true essence from that attack had managed to penetrate the flexible armor and sink into his body; the true essence within his entire body had an unbearable feeling!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith Chi Guda’s cultivation, he could have stopped a surprise attack, but he hadn’t thought that one of the prisoners in the group was a master that had actually managed to conceal their cultivation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNormally, only a Xiantian master, or occasionally a peak Houtian master would be able to reach the realm of returning to one’s true origin and restraining all of the true essence within their body to hide their cultivation. But this sort of powerhouse would have no reason to make a sneak attack in order to kill him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis youth who had made a sneak attack on him hadn’t even broken through to the Pulse Condensation Period, how had he managed to hide his murderous intent and cultivation?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe situation had already progressed beyond Chi Guda’s imagination, the enemy’s long spear pressing down toward his throat. In the end, Chi Guda was still a half-step Houtian realm martial artist. Even in a sneak attack, he had the ability to quickly react. He instantly pulled out a treasure sword from his spatial ring and cut towards the spearpoint!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eClang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe sword and spear struck each other.

However, that black-clothed youth was simply like a god of death. His hand shook the dark gray spear and vibrating true essence manifested into a raging tsunami that rushed outwards. Immediately, 7 or 8 soldiers were like seaweed as they were sent flying out in all directions, vomiting blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe black-clothed youth was Lin Ming, and the spear in his hand was the Heavy Profound Soft Spear. He had spread a special matte grey paint on it in order to cover up the too-recognizable silver color. Not only that, but he had snuck in with a black mask wrapping around his face and hiding his appearance. Only his eyes were visible from the outside.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis unexpected change in events caught everyone by surprise. Even the chief’s children who were preparing to commit suicide were dumbfounded by the black-clothed man who had suddenly rush out. Who was this? With such strong skills, he shouldn’t be someone that belonged to the Blackmarsh Tribe’s chief’s quarters.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, Chi Guda was becoming more and more startled; he wasn’t able to suppress that small amount of true essence within his body. It was as if that true essence had an infinite vitality within it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What kind of true essence is this?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eChi Guda’s expression continued to sink. If people were like flames, then the more profound and deep a martial artist’s cultivation was, and the more pure and vibrant their true essence became, it would be like a flame that was becoming more and more vigorous. However, the nature of it wouldn’t change. Yet this true essence actually had a core qualitative difference. It was just like a Flame Essence, it was far too difficult to suppress!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eChi Guda had already seen through Lin Ming’s cultivation, he was without a doubt at the peak of Bone Forging.

Lin Ming’s eyes narrowed, and the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’ began to rapidly revolve within him, and a crimson lotus flame bloomed upon his long spear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTotal Annihilation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hah!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Heavy Profound Soft Spear drew a wide crescent moon and the flames formed a massive arc.

He instantly arrived in front of Chi Guda!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe long spear shot out – Flow like Silk!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e5000 vibrating true essence filaments manifested from the spear at an astonishing rate. They weaved together in the air, forming a tight true essence net that fell down on Chi Guda.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming’s strength increased, his use of Flow like Silk had already reached a degree of near perfection – he was close to reaching a breakthrough.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eChi Guda saw this shimmering net filled with deep killing intent fall on him, and gave a loud shout. The high-grade human-step treasure sword in his hand began to glow with a yellow light. He brandished his sword and chopped out at the bright net of true essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Earth Splitter!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eChi Guda was forced to resort to his most infamous martial skill. His sword was filled with a vibrant energy as it cut out at the shining net. With a loud bang, the net was torn apart!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eChi Guda fiendishly sneered. After all, this enemy was only at the peak of Bone Forging; how could he possibly compare to his cultivation of a half-step into the Houtian realm? Although he didn’t know why this young fellow was so strong, since he actually dared to attempt an assassination within a group of soldiers, he was simply seeking his own death!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever at this time, Chi Guda’s smile froze. Although that shining net had been torn apart by his sword, it hadn’t faded away. Instead, it turned into filaments formed of true essence and pierced towards him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBefore fusing with the reverse scale blood, Lin Ming’s vibrating true essence had many weaknesses. One was that, although it was extremely formidable, its tenacity wasn’t enough and it was easily destroyed. Even after entering the enemy’s body, it would gradually weaken. In the life and death smelting trial he had encountered the Witch Slave, which had massively overwhelming defensive capabilities; it had simply been too difficult to injure the enemy\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, after having integrated with the reverse scale blood, Lin Ming’s 5000 vibrating true essence threads had taken on a qualitative change. Not only could they not be broken, but they were extremely tough and very difficult to destroy. Although they weren’t like the Flame Essence that was inextinguishable, but if one wished to destroy them, they needed to use several times more true essence to wear them down.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis endlessly living true essence was scattered apart by Chi Guda’s sword.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis gorgeous and charming true essence fell from the sky like drops of rain. But, this rain contained a horrifying killing intent!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe martial artists that were too close to these filaments were shredded to pieces; even the personal bodyguards near Chi Guda were unable to escape, and blood flowed on the ground. With their strength, the role they could play in this fight was miniscule. Even the aftermath of the blows could kill them off.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eChi Guda turned somber. His palms oozed with sweat as the countless true essence filaments reflected in his eyes.

This was the moment he had been waiting for. He hadn’t expected his Flow like Silk to harm Chi Guda; he had only wanted to trap him first, before the real killing would begin!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hah!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA dark red lotus flame bloomed on the Heavy Profound Soft Spear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eChi!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA purple electric snake emerged from the Heretical God Seed and twined around the cold tip of the spear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Heretical God Force – Open!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming shouted, and a massive swell of true essence rose within his body!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis powerful aura erupted like a volcano, and his spear thrust out, mincing the atmosphere.

Since he didn’t excel in speed, he could only use his true essence to withstand Lin Ming’s offensive barrage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe would outlast the enemy!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eChi Guda’s idea was right.
