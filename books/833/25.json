{"id":17019,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV.","content":"As I drew near the shipping-office, I saw the light was still burning bright, and the window-blinds, though drawn, allowed it to stream through the space between them and the sash. Few business houses in this section have lights burning at night. I stopped a moment to consider what to do. Of course it was none of my business what took place between Brown and Anderson, but, as the young man had served with me as an officer and had acquitted himself thoroughly, I felt some interest and I might confess also a bit of curiosity. I had heard enough to know that there was something irregular with the business of Brown going out with me on that fateful voyage. I believed him innocent of any wrong-doing, but, as it had been Mr. Ropesend himself who had sent him, I was not certain. A young man might do many{280} things which would get him into trouble and still not be a very bad sort of chap. I had committed several little acts in my day that I would not care to repeat, but I never held that I was a great villain because of them. Ignorance and temptation are factors which the tolerant and trained observer of events must take into consideration. I’ve always noticed that the man who is quick to condemn is quick to commit crime.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Crime is the practical application of selfishness and the unselfish man does not condemn his fellow. I was prepared to hear Brown own up to some foolish speculation which involved the firm’s finances, and I went boldly to the side door, the door which opened into the room in which I had seen them talking but a short time before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Knocking loudly, I listened for further developments. There were sounds of a scuffle, then panting and shuffling of feet, as when men are struggling in desperate encounter. A loud crash followed this, and then there was a cessation of noises, but the panting breaths of the men continued.{281}\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s Gore, let me in,” I cried, pounding again upon the panels and putting the whole weight of my shoulder upon the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I can’t get up, he has me down,” gasped Brown from somewhere within.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What’s the matter?” I bawled. “Open the door.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anderson, probably seeing that I would force an entrance directly, went to the latch, and in a moment I entered the room. Brown was in the act of rising from the floor. He greeted me with a knowing look.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, what’s the trouble?” I asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anderson gave a deprecatory gesture with both hands and sat down at the desk. He evidently had nothing to say. Brown hesitated while he regained his composure. Then he spoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You know what I went to sea for,” he began, “you know that I was accused of appropriating the firm’s money—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stopped a moment, and I nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” I said, “I had heard something to that effect.”{282}\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, here is the culprit,” said he, and pointed to Anderson.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I always thought as much,” I said, with some feeling, and as I spoke the man at the table turned upon me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “See here, Gore,” said he, “you are not wanted in this affair, my father—Mr. Ropes—” Here he stopped a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He doesn’t know, but as long as you have begun, you might as well tell him all,” said Brown. “Mr. Ropesend is Mr. Anderson’s father, and you will doubtless incur the wrath of the firm if you meddle with this, so you might just as well go.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll go if you say so,” I said, “but it looked as though murder was being done when I broke in,” and for the life of me I could not help the following question, “And Miss Anderson is not your sister, then?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Thank God, no, she is not,” put in Brown.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mr. Ropesend will not care to have any of his sailing-masters taking part in this affair,” said Anderson, coldly. “What you{283} have heard you can keep to yourself. If you don’t you will probably suffer the consequences. Now you can get out, for Mr. Brown and I will settle this matter before we leave here to-night.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I fail to see how we can settle it without you making good and confessing everything,” said Brown. “There is hardly room in the firm for both of us, and I’m tired of going to sea.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anderson rose from his chair. He was cool and collected, but something in his manner made me think he was on the point of collapse.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You had better go, Mr. Gore,” said he, quietly. “There will be no more disturbance, I forgot myself just before you arrived, and I thank you for coming when you did. You can go without fear of any harm to Mr. Brown. Good-bye.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He held out his hand and I took it. His fingers were cold and, although he was a large and powerful fellow, he shook visibly when I let go. “Good night,” I said, and turned to the door.{284}\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good night, Gore,” said Brown. “I have your word not to talk about anything you have seen or heard.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” I answered, “good night.” And I went forth.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1857/53836.html","bookId":833,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 8:15:38 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 8:15:38 AM"}
