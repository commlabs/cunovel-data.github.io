She is fast asleep when we arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carry her inside and place her on the bed I used to sleep in when I came here. I brush her hair out of her face and she moans and whispers a name, \"Sebastian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI back away, feeling dirty, like I\u0027ve committed a crime touching her. I can\u0027t feel sorry for myself, I made my bed. I sacrificed myself to save her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at the ceiling and smile. Em would have wanted it this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and sit on the couch to watch her sleep, in case the lonely comes. She\u0027s had such a hard day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard\u0027s words ring in my head. He loves me too. He loves me and accepts me and wants me to be with her, to be part of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt some point I fall asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I wake it\u0027s light out and she is gone. It takes me a second to panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leap up and run to the window. I don’t see her. My heart is racing as I run through the house, \"Sarah! Sarah, where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run out the front door and down the snowy path to the beach. I feel like a parent searching for a toddler. Her missing makes me panic in an unhealthy way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get down the path and stop when I see her. She is smiling, texting, and laughing. I don’t feel the snow hitting me or the icy wind coming off the ocean. I know my body is shaking from the cold and my tee shirt isn’t enough to make me warm, but I can\u0027t feel anything but the snapping feeling in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seeing him again today?\" The words fall out of my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spins and frowns, \"You\u0027ll freeze. Where is your coat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to her, \"Don’t change the subject.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You plan on just seeing both of us? Use me when you need me and be with him the rest of the time?\" I can\u0027t stop myself from saying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks shocked, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull her into me, \"You want me, Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushes me away, \"I don’t want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to know.\" I kiss her hand and just say it, \"I love you. Not because you\u0027re my replacement for my sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rejects me, \"I never want to talk about this again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel myself vibrating as the white noise takes over, \"She is obsessed with me. I didn’t know.\" It\u0027s not entirely true. I just didn’t know how far Jane would take it, and it was worth sacrificing myself to save her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks back at me, disgusted, \"Did you sleep with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I don’t answer she spits her words at me \"Gross. What is wrong with you? Why would you sleep with your therapist? Did you take her to that room? Is that how she knows you like to punish girls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"It happened once, two years ago. It was a mistake. I was drunk in the bar, after I found you. I was celebrating.\" I was cocky and wanting to convince her to help me with my quest. I can\u0027t say that I did it to win her over for Sarah. She will never understand that or the fucked-up mind of Jane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe covers her ears, \"WHAT THE FUCK? I DON’T WANT TO KNOW THIS SHIT! JESUS!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe runs. I try to catch her but I can\u0027t. She is an elite runner. I am not. She gets farther and farther away from me. I drop to my knees and let the snow fall down on me. I wish it would cover me up and hide me but I have to find her. She can\u0027t run off alone in the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run back and get my keys and my coat. I drive around for a while but she isn’t there. She must have hitched a ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive faster than I should in the snow but I need to know she is safe. I get to the hotel and she isn’t there yet. Her family is waiting in the room I have arranged for breakfast. I don’t dare face them after what Richard said to me yesterday. I can\u0027t bare to have lost her. I pace and panic until I see the Tahoe pull up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart went and got her and never messaged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they walk in, she doesn’t see me but he does. He looks like he might try to defend himself but I see the hold Michelle has on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sees my look and nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I help you?\" A lady at the front desk asks them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s with me.\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good, Mr. Adams.\" the lady says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offer her my hand but she walks past me, \"Not now.\" Stuart sees my face and drags Michelle down the hall. I am about to go off. I grab her arm and pull her to where I can talk to her. \"You ever scare me like that again and I will make sure you don’t ever forget to let me know where you are. You don’t run off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up at me boldly, \"You are not the boss of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab her hand and drag her to them so I can be done with it all. I am fucking done. She doesn’t see me or anything I have done for her. She doesn’t see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother smiles when we get in the room, \"Good morning, honey.\" She looks at me, \"Morning Eli, honey.\" I lean in and kiss her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sit and her dad smiles at her, \"Did you sleep well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles and nods, \"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course she did. I watched over her most of the night and soothed her when she cried in her sleep. Even when she didn’t say my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit and watch them and realize how pathetic and destroyed I have let myself get. I fixed them all and like Jane said it would, it consumed me. I am a shell of the man I might have been, had I just walked away from it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to talk to her but she rushes off with Stuart. He avoids my eye contact but texts me from the road as I follow them back to my apartment, \u0027I\u0027ll tell her I have to drop her off at your place. You can talk there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the message and frown. I planned to go and tell Emalyn that I had done what I had once promised I would. I follow Stuart’s SUV to the apartment but as he stops the truck, she leaps from it and runs to Sebastian\u0027s waiting car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drive off and I drive past, to the cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI park and crunch along the way to the monument I had made for her when I got to be a little older. I sit on the bench across from it and stare at the wording.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did everything I said I would. I saved her and found her family and cured her sadness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear crunching from behind me, \"You did a lot more than that, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to cry when I see him. I don’t want to talk about it. I bury my face in my hands and just sob at the finality of it all. A great weight should be lifted from my shoulders, but I have never felt more weighed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finish crying and sit up again. I take a deep breath of the cold, snowy air. He sits next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a beautiful thing you did. I know she doesn’t see it, but it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Doesn’t really matter unless she sees it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me, \"Why don’t you just tell her everything, how you feel and how it is, and everything you\u0027ve given up? You gotta talk, bro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I don’t know how. I just keep thinking my grand gestures will do it for me and then I fuck them up by being me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told Michelle everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him, \"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"She knows you\u0027re my brother and that we have been homies since we were young and all the shit you\u0027ve done for Sarah and Emalyn. I told her everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl, \"Why? I don’t even like her. You have to break up with her. She\u0027s evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"Easy, dude. I love her. Ya know, I don’t get why the fuck you love Sarah either. We aren’t supposed to. If I saw the reason you liked her, I\u0027d like her, and then we\u0027d have a problem. ‘Cause you know, the ladies always pick me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to argue that point but he\u0027s right, they do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the monument and sigh, \"I just don’t know how to say everything without making it like she was a burden. It never felt that way. I\u0027ve carried her for so many years, she\u0027s just become part of the load that I call life. I love her and I don’t know how to fix this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nudges me, \"You gotta talk. Use your words not your hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at the phone and dial, praying she just answers this time. It\u0027s been a day of me phoning her nonstop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"WHAT!\" she answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI panic, not sure what to say. I\u0027ve called hundreds of times but she hasn’t answered till now, \"You have to see this isn’t about you. She wants you and I under her thumb. I haven’t had a session with her since it happened. She isn’t my therapist. It isn’t even a big deal. You slept with that Sebastian fellow on your birthday and I never brought it up. I haven’t been with anyone since I found you. I swear to God. I haven’t slept with anyone since I found you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t hear me, she just rages, \"YOU LET ME GO THERE! YOU LET HER TREAT ME! YOU TWO FUCKING TORTURED ME IN A CELL! YOU FUCKED A WOMAN YOU LET TORTURE ME!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rage back, \"SHE IS THE BEST, SARAH. FOR FUCK\u0027S SAKE!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hangs up on me. She never denied sleeping with Sebastian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am determined this is going to end today. Stuart texts me, \u0027Gym.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive there and wait in the rings, ready to box with her, or beg her to listen, or kidnap her and force her to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour goes by and finally I text her, \u0027Where are you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t answer. I wait longer. No one is there. Thank God. I walk to the hallway, about to leave, when she emerges from the change room, taping her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head at me, \"Do you have a GPS tracker on me?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, nervously, \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What do you want to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and climb into the ring. This way she is trapped a little and running is harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring her some gloves so she can hit me instead of running away. I speak softly as I put them on her, \"She is the best. She was the only one who believed that you could be rescued and I needed you. I needed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to walk away to say the next part and do my own gloves, \"No one believed me about you… that I didn’t invent you. No one saw me as a hero. No one but you, and for that belief in me that you had, I let you down. I left you sleeping in that barn, thinking it would be better if you didn’t have to see the police. I was protecting you, even then. You have never, nor will you ever, be my sister. I know I\u0027m messed up and I am insane in so many different ways, but the fact you could believe me capable of such a horrific thing…\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-31.html","bookId":1889,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM"}
