It would make for a corny—oh, holy crap.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up, Madison frowned at her friend. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget’s blue eyes were wide. “Uh, take a look for yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfused, Madison followed Bridget’s gaze and her mouth dropped open. “Oh my God…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the glass walls surrounding her office, there was no mistaking the dark head prowling directly toward her or the broad shoulders squared with intent and determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was he doing here? Why? There wasn’t any time for her to come up with those answers, because her door flew open and Chase stood there, tall, dark, sinfully sexy, and a whole lot pissed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison started to stand, but her legs were too weak. “Chase, what are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire lit his eyes as they landed on her. “We need to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, right now?” She looked around her office helplessly. “I think it—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It can’t wait,” he all but growled. “We need to talk now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget started to stand. “I think I’ll give you guys some privacy. There are other desks out there I’m sure need organizing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison was already on her feet, smoothing her hands down the cotton of her skirt. Over Chase’s shoulder, she could see plenty of her co-workers staring from their cubicles. This was going to get awkward. “No. You don’t have to leave. Um, Chase and I can—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could finish her sentence, he was in front of her. Without saying a word, he clasped her cheeks and brought his mouth to hers. Too stunned to react at first, she froze as his lips pressed, slowly demanding that her mouth open to his. Then her body melted into his embrace, into the kiss that quickly deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled her against him, lifting her onto the toes of her shoes. He kissed her with all the passion and desperate yearning she had carried with her for so many years. The way his arms trembled against hers reached deep inside, shattering the freshly built walls around her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he pulled back, he kept his arms around her. “Why…why did you do that?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small half grin played across his face. “Sorry. I had to get that out of the way first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow. I need popcorn for this,” Bridget murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison flushed from the roots of her hair to the tips of her curled toes. Somehow, she had forgotten that her friend was still standing there…plus an entire room full of people watching from the outside through the glass walls. Pulling back, she shook her head. “Chase…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me explain something first, okay? Before you run off or start arguing with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maddie,” he said, eyes glittering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You better let the man talk.” Bridget sat back down in her chair, folding her arms. “I cannot wait to hear what he has to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison shot her friend a death glare, but it looked like she wasn’t going anywhere. Neither was he. “Okay,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase took a long breath. “There’s no way around saying this, other than just coming straight out with it. I’ve been an idiot—an ass. Time and time again, I’ve done the wrong thing by you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth dropped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And this whole time I’d been trying to do the right thing by not being with you. I didn’t want to betray Mitch by hooking up with his little sister. I didn’t want to somehow mess up our friendship either, because you have been such a huge part of my life.” He took a deep breath. “And I never wanted to be like my father—to treat you like he treated my mom. And it was stupid—I get that now. Chad was right. Father never loved our mother, but it’s different for me—it’s different for us. It always has been.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole time he spoke, he never looked away from her. She opened her mouth to say something but he rushed ahead. “But all I’ve managed to do is screw things up. That night in the club…I wasn’t drunk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison shifted uncomfortably. “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a lame excuse, and I’m sorry. That night—I should’ve told you how I really felt. And every night thereafter,” he said, taking a step forward. “I should’ve told you how I felt the night in that damn cabin, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart swelled as hope grew in a tangle of emotions she could never unravel. All of this seemed surreal. Tears rushed her eyes as she reached behind her, grasping the edges of her desk. “And how do you feel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase’s smile revealed those deep dimples she loved, and when he spoke, his voice was husky. “Aw hell, Maddie, I’m not good at this kind of stuff. You…you are my world. You’ve always been my world, ever since I can remember.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Bridget’s soft inhale, Madison placed a trembling hand over her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping forward, he placed a hand over hers, gently pulling it away from her mouth. “It’s the truth. You are my everything. I love you. I have for longer than I realized. Please tell me my boneheadedness hasn’t screwed things up beyond repair for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison didn’t move for a moment, didn’t even breathe as his words tumbled inside her and wrapped their way around her heart, just as his strong fingers were wrapping around hers. And then she sprang forward, planting her lips right on his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her back desperately and passionately, his arms crushing her to his chest. She could feel the hard heat of him, from the tips of her breasts down to the harder, hotter part of him pressed against her belly. She revelled in his arousal, in the passion in which he held her—even though this so was not the place for it—but she did, because this was the moment she’d been waiting for her whole life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was it. The lump was back in her throat. She barely realized Bridget had quietly slipped out of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you,” he rasped against her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer breath caught. “You do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase nodded. “There is no one else—there’s never been anyone else for me but you. You’re it, Maddie. And I swear to you, I will never treat you like my father did my mom. Hell, I couldn’t. I’m just not built like that man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking back hot tears, she wrapped her arms around Chase and breathed in the scent of him. “Oh, God, Chase, I love you so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laugh was a mixture of relief and joy as he held her tighter, and she could feel his heart thundering against hers. She placed her lips near his ear and whispered, “I think I need to use a sick day, because there’s something I really want to do right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase’s breath left in an unsteady rush. “I couldn’t agree more, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But?” Madison pulled back with a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at her. “But afterward we’re going to your parents’ house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are?” A smile swept across her lips. Giddy, she looped her arms around his neck. “I’m afraid to even ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase’s smile matched hers. “I think we need to break the news to your parents face-to-face, because this…” He kissed her again, his tongue tangling with hers, drawing a breathy moan. And that kiss went on until her toes curled inside her heels and her heart thudded heavily in her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKissing Chase—loving Chase—was something she’d never get tired of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling back, his mouth formed a smile against hers and he said, “This is forever.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tempting-the-best-man-gamble-brothers-1/page-21.html","bookId":2003,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:04 PM"}
