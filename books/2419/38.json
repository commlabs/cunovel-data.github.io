Firearms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quarles.\" I forced myself to sound upbeat. \"Miss me already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis next exhale was a strong wheeze, maybe what passed for riotous laughter down in the ballistics lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to follow up,\" Quarles said. \"I got the full picture after you left—well, shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListen, that was a tough break about your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not your fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well. I did a little digging—ran a Drugfire search on the casing. We keep a database of casing images from all over the state, goes back two, three years. It\u0027s hit or miss, depending on what individual departments choose to enter into the system, but I ran a check for similar firing pin impressions on spent brass, just to see if I got any hits.\" \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I got one. Maybe. Scored a cold hit on a case from Waco, robberymurder back in 1987. It\u0027s an old damn case. Waco PD just put all their unsolved homicides on the network last month. Sheer luck—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The case,\" I interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robbery gone bad. Perp broke in the back door, surprised the occupant, shot this old guy four times. The victim\u0027s stuff was rifled through—boxes of papers, a file cabinet overturned, all his IDs and money taken. Perp wasn\u0027t too bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragged the body all the way into the bathroom, dumped it in the tub, ran water over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho knows, maybe he was shaken up, got some stupid idea he could scrub the scene clean, then realized it was no good. Despite that, he got away—no leads, no prints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe murder weapon was never found, but Waco PD did recover the four casings—all with distinctive BOB markings. Almost an exact match to the one from Jimmy Doebler\u0027s murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying Garrett\u0027s gun was involved in a crime in 1987?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. That model wasn\u0027t even made back then. What I\u0027m saying is that a gun was used in Waco in 1987 that left an almost identical BOB marking to the casing you found in the lake. And the Waco gun was never recovered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell of a coincidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t use the C word with me, Navarre. Another thing I found out, chatting with people up in Waco—police weren\u0027t careful with their information. They publicized that they were working an anomaly in the shell casing, put a quote to that effect in the local paper. Either they were desperate for leads, or maybe they wanted to sound like they were making progress. Maybe they just didn\u0027t see the case as important enough for tight security. Whatever, it wasn\u0027t any secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still don\u0027t—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I\u0027m saying, Navarre—if I were that killer, and I heard the police talking about my gun that way, I could have some fun with that information. I could examine my own casings, then deface another gun\u0027s firing pin area. I\u0027m saying I could do this, a master gunsmith, somebody who knew what they were doing. In a couple of minutes, I could make another gun have the same BOB markings as mine—as long as it was a similar calibre and make. Potentially, you could play hell with ballistics—modify somebody\u0027s gun, commit a crime with your gun, and then frame the other guy. The BOB markings would be so rare, your frameup victim would seem like a dead ringer. I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s likely, but it\u0027s sure as hell possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my friendly neighbourhood homicide detective, who was stonefaced, tapping his fingers against his sidearm. \"Quarles, you share this information yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. And look, Lopez will tell you it\u0027s a farfetched idea. He\u0027s right. I\u0027m just trying to give you something you could use. You get a good lawyer, maybe he could use this Waco case to cast some doubt on the evidence, point out that ballistics aren\u0027t exact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m giving you advice to help a defence lawyer.

My chest felt like it was turning into something just as insubstantial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ewin Lowry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the picture I\u0027d seen in Faye Ingram\u0027s garden— the rakish gypsy gambler next to Clara Doebler, both of them smiling. I thought about the letter Clara had received from Waco in 1987, the letter she\u0027d thought was from Ewin Lowry, promising retribution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Navarre?\" Quarles asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to go, Quarles. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up, handed Lopez back his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it, Navarre,\" Lopez said. \"It\u0027s the longest of long shots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Maia about the Waco case. Then I told Lopez who Ewin Lowry was, and about Matthew Pena\u0027s parentage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s hard to shake up a homicide detective, but Lopez\u0027s face completely deconstructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once, he was without a reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bathtub,\" said Maia. \"Water. Adrienne Selak drowned. Jimmy\u0027s truck was half submerged. Clara was shot by the lake. This man—Lowry—intentionally dragged into a bathtub. The girlfriend, the brother, the mother, the father ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Ruby,\" I said. \"Disappeared off a boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez snapped his phone shut, clipped it to his belt. \"I like criminal psych profiles as much as anybody, counsellor. But what you\u0027re suggesting ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the photos on the nightstand—the smiling pictures of Ruby McBride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he relented. \"What are you saying—the water has meaning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The killer submerges his victims,\" Maia said. \"At least, he tries to. Water could mean cleansing. Absolution. My guess—he cares for the people he\u0027s killing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cares for them,\" Lopez repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a sick individual. He wants to be close to these people. Maybe he even picks special places—Doebler\u0027s lakefront property, for instance. He killed Jimmy just where his mom died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kills his victims and then washes them,\" Lopez said. \"Tries to cover them in water. A purification ritual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\" Lopez scowled. \"Now you got me doing it. Okay.

Usually, that means one thing.

I went to the map, counted up the arc of red pins, the submerged property line that Ruby had been mapping. I put my finger on the sixth pin—the one farthest out from the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A special place,\" I said. \"A submersion. Call your recovery unit.
