He spent seven months of his spare time writing a book called Strictly Speaking: Will America be the Death of English? Published in 1974 when Newman was 55 years old, it became the nation\u0027s number one best-seller for non-fiction. His follow-up book, A Civil Tongue (1976), was another best-seller.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now Edwin newman has written his first novel, Sunday Punch (Houghton Mifflin, $9.95). Published in June, it has already gone through two printings in hardcover, totaling 60,000 copies. The Atlantic has described the book as \"a Wodehousian excursion that is lighter than air and twice as much fun as laughing gas.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In a leisurely interview at his Rockefeller Plaza office, the author comes across very much as he does on television. His leathery features expand easily into a smile as he delivers, in his slow, concise, foghorn voice, comments that are as thought-provoking as they are witty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sunday Punch, he says, \"is the story of an extremely thin, tall, British prizefighter named Aubrey Philpott-Grimes who comes to the U.S. to fight because he can make more money here than in Britain. The more money he makes, the higher taxes he can pay, and Aubrey is a great believer in paying taxes. He is tremendously interested in economics, so that if he is brought to the microphone after a fight, he\u0027ll probably start talking about structural unemployment and floating exchange rates, rather than talking about fighting. … The book allows me to comment on the United States from the view of an outsider.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His fascination with the cultural and linguistic differences of the U.S. and England dates back to the late 1940s, when Newman left his job with the Washington-based International News Service and moved to London. There, he found work as a \"stringer\" for the NBC network, and when he was invited to join the full-time staff in 1952, he remained at the British capital for five more years. In 1961, after serving as NBC bureau chief in both Paris and Rome, he returned to his native Manhattan and settled into his present Eastside apartment with his English wife, Rigel. The Newmans\u0027 daughter Nancy was educated entirely in England.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A harsh critic of the state of the language in America today, Newman is the head of the Usage Panel for the American Heritage Dictionary. He is always being sent examples of poor English. \"Do you want to know what accountability is?\" he says, his eyes crinkling with amusement as he takes a letter from his desk. \"This is from a teachers\u0027 committee in Kalamazoo, Michigan. \u0027Accountability is a concept that, when operationalized, finds the interrelatedness and parameters of responsibility shaped by individuals within the system.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It seems to me there are two movements going on that affect language in the United States, and it\u0027s curious that they would be going on at the same time, because in a way they conflict with each other. One is the increasing use of jargon and pomposity, which can partly traced to the size of the government. As the government grows, this kind of language grows. … The more technical they make the language sound, the more money they\u0027re likely to earn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you have the influence of the social sciences, where exactly the same thing goes on. People attempt to take familiar ideas, small ideas, and in some cases no ideas, and make them sound large by wrapping them up in grandiose language.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The other movement that is going on is based on the notion that correct, specific, concrete language doesn\u0027t matter very much. What matters is that your heart be in the right place. … This idea was thoroughly welcome to many people in education. For one thing, it means that you have less written work to correct. And also, of course, if you don\u0027t have to teach correct English, you don\u0027t have to know it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e During his 28 years as an NBC news correspondent, Edwin Newman has excelled in so many areas that he has become known as the network\u0027s \"Renaissance man.\" One of the most quick-thinking ad-libbers on the air, he is frequently called upon to do live \"instant specials\" of breaking news. He moderated the first Ford-Carter debate in 1976, has hosted the Today Show numerous times, has covered six national political conventions and reported from 35 foreign countries. Each Monday through Friday, he is heard on both radio and television across the U.S. in a series of news briefs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His biggest project at the moment is a two-hour, prime-time documentary on U.S. foreign policy, which is scheduled to be aired early in September.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think in some way,\" concludes Newman, \"I fell into the right profession. Somebody said — I think it was H.L. Mencken — that you go into the news business because it gives you a front-row seat. And he might have added that not only does it give you a front row seat, but you get the seat free.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e born 1-15-19\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1506/44988.html","bookId":46,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:59:38 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:59:38 AM"}
