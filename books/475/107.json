It was presented to the King of England to blaze in his crown of state. The King sent it to Amsterdam to be cut. It was put into the hands of an expert lapidary. And what do you suppose he did with it?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe took the gem of priceless value, and cut a notch in it. Then he struck it a hard blow with his instrument, and lo! the superb jewel lay in his hand cleft in twain. What recklessness I what wastefulness! what criminal carelessness!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot so. For days and weeks that blow had been studied and planned. Drawings and models had been made of the gem. Its quality, its defects, its lines of cleavage had all been studied with minutest care. The man to whom it was committed was one of the most skillful lapidaries in the world.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDo you say that blow was a mistake? Nay. It was the climax of the lapidary\u0027s skill. When he struck that blow, he did the one thing which would bring that gem to its most perfect shapeliness, radiance, and jewelled splendor. That blow which seemed to ruin the superb precious stone was, in fact, its perfect redemption. For, from those two halves were wrought the two magnificent gems which the skilled eye of the lapidary saw hidden in the rough, uncut stone as it came from the mine.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo, sometimes, God lets a stinging blow fall upon your life. The blood spurts. The nerves wince. The soul cries out in agony. The blow seems to you an apalling mistake. But it is not, for you are the most priceless jewel in the world to God. And He is the most skilled lapidary in the universe.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSome day you are to blaze in the diadem of the King. As you lie in His hand now He knows just how to deal with you. Not a blow will be permitted to fall upon your shrinking soul but that the love of God permits it, and works out from its depths, blessing and spiritual enrichment unseen, and unthought of by you. --J. H. McC.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn one of George MacDonald\u0027s books occurs this fragment of conversation: \"I wonder why God made me,\" said Mrs. Faber bitterly. \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know what was the use of making me!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps not much yet,\" said Dorothy, \"but then He hasn\u0027t done with you yet. He is making you now, and you are quarrelling with the process.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf men would but believe that they are in process of creation, and consent to be made--let the Maker handle them as the potter the clay, yielding themselves in resplendent motion and submissive, hopeful action with the turning of His wheel--they would ere long find themselves able to welcome every pressure of that hand on them, even when it was felt in pain; and sometimes not only to believe but to recognize the Divine end in view, the bringing of a son unto glory.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a single shaft can hit,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTill the God of love sees fit.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　 四月十七日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“…是耶和华的手作成的…“（伯十二：9）。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　几年前，在非洲矿中，发现了一颗有史以来从未有过的大钻石。人把它进贡给英皇，做他冠冕上的饰物。英皇就把它送到荷京阿姆斯坦，交给一个世上最着名的宝石匠，请他切磋。你想他怎样作？\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　他拿起这无价之宝来，先刻了一个深痕。然后拿起铁锤来把它狠命一击。看哪！一块世上仅有的宝石顿时一裂为二。啊，荒谬！该死的宝石匠，闯了弥天大祸！\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　事实并不是这样。那一击是曾经过好几星期的考虑和计划。绘图，打样，曾花了许多功夫。它的性质，硬度，和里面的裂纹，都曾经过详细的研究。英皇所委托的这人，是世上宝石匠中第一名手。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　你说那一击是击错了么？不。这是宝石匠技术最高的表演。那一击使那块宝石成了世上最玲珑，最炫耀的两颗金刚钻。那一击实在是它的拯救。匠人在这块钻石未经琢凿之前，早经胸有成竹，一劈两半，方能显明它是无上的价值。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　有时，在你的生活中，神也把你猛击一下。挂泪，流血，丧志，灰心。你说那一击是击错了。可是并没有，你是神的无价之宝。神是你的宝石匠。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　有一天，你将作神冠冕上发光的宝石。现在你既在他手中，他知道怎样对付你。若不是神的爱所许可的，没有一击能临到你。——马克康该\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　在乔治·麦唐纳的著作里，录有二位女士的对话，一是费柏太太，一是桃乐赛女士。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　费柏太太恼恨地说：“我不知道神为何要造我，造我有什么用处”？\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　桃乐赛告诉她道：“也许目前还没有显明用处，神尚未将你造得完全，但是在神制造你的过程中，而你就对制造者有所抱怨了！”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　人们只要相信自己尚在被制造的过程中，并且愿意让造物主随意处理，象陶人处理泥土一样，顺服于神的一切工作，不久人们就会欢迎那双加在他们身上压力的手，虽然有时压得痛苦，但是他们深信，而且认识了神制造的目的，是要把人引导进入光荣之境。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e除非神认为适合，\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e否则这支箭决不会射中你。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5043.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:41:40 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:41:40 AM"}
