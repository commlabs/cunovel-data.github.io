She felt better, hungry too. She hurried back to the clearing. She could hear the men talking, but as soon as she came into their view, they all closed their mouths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain, she quickly noticed, wasn\u0027t there. She felt a moment of pure panic. It made her stomach lurch, so quickly did the feeling come upon her. Then she spotted his stallion. The fear immediately eased. The Scottish warrior might very well leave her, but he\u0027d never leave his faithful steed, would he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was alone in the forest with four men who were virtual strangers to her. If word of this circumstance ever reached anyone in England, her reputation would be tattered. Her mother would probably want to kill her, too. Odd, but that last thought didn\u0027t bother Judith much at all. She couldn\u0027t seem to feel anything toward her mother now. Uncle Tekel had excused his sister\u0027s cold attitude toward her only daughter with the lie that Judith was a constant reminder of the man she\u0027d loved and lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLies, so many lies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d best get some rest, lass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith jumped a foot when Alex\u0027s deep voice sounded behind her, and her hand flew to her breast. She took several deep breaths before she answered him. \"We must have our supper before we rest. What have you done with the baggage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex motioned to the opposite side of the clearing. Judith immediately hurried across the area to set out the food. Jane had packed a pretty white cloth at the top of the satchel. She spread that on the hard ground first, then covered it with her offerings. There was thick, crusty black bread, triangles of red and yellowed cheeses, fat strips of salted pork, and fresh, tart green apples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen everything was ready, she invited the men to join her. Then she waited. After a long moment she realized they didn\u0027t have any intention of eating with her. She could feel herself turning red with embarrassment. She sat on the ground, her legs tucked under the hem of her skirts, her hands folded together in her lap. She kept her head bowed so none of them would see her humiliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a stupid mistake, offering to share her food with them. She was English, after all, and they probably couldn\u0027t stomach the thought of eating a meal with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told herself she had nothing to feel embarrassed about. She wasn\u0027t acting like a rude barbarian. They were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain walked back into the clearing and came to a quick stop. One look at Judith told him something was wrong. Her face was flaming red. He turned to look at his men next. Alex and Gowrie sat on the ground on the opposite side of the clearing with their backs resting against tree trunks. Alex was wide awake, but Gowrie looked as though he\u0027d fallen asleep. Brodick, as silent as usual, was already fast asleep. He was so completely wrapped in his plaid, only the top of his white-blond hair was visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain noticed the mound of food in front of Judith and guessed what had happened. He let out a sigh, then clasped his hands behind his back and walked over to stand next to her. She wouldn\u0027t look up at him. As soon as she spotted him coming toward her, she turned her attention to repacking the food. She was stuffing the containers back into her satchel when he sat down across from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up one of the apples. She snatched it out of his hand. He snatched it back. She was so surprised by that boldness, she looked up at him. His eyes sparkled with laughter. She couldn\u0027t imagine what he found so amusing. She continued to stare at him while he took a bite out of the apple. He leaned forward and offered the apple to her. She took a bite before she realized what she\u0027d done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex suddenly appeared at her side. Without a word he sat down and reached into the satchel. He pulled out all the containers she\u0027d just repacked. After tossing a piece of bread to Iain, Alex popped a triangle of cheese into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Gowrie joined them. Judith put one of the apples in her lap and shyly explained that she would save it for the sleeping warrior to eat in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brodick must be terribly weary to miss his supper,\" she remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex snorted with amusement. \"Brodick\u0027s not weary, just stubborn. He won\u0027t eat your apple tomorrow either, you being English and all. No, he—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith\u0027s frown stopped his explanation. She turned to look at Brodick, judged the distance in her mind, then picked up the apple from her lap. \"If you\u0027re really certain he won\u0027t eat the apple tomorrow, he must want to eat it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had every intention of hurling the apple at the surly Scot, but just as soon as she leaned back to take aim, Iain grabbed hold of her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to do that, lass,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t let go of her hand. Judith struggled with him for a second or two before giving up. \"You\u0027re right,\" she said. \"It would be a waste of a perfectly good apple, a superior English apple, I might add, on a mean-tempered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScot.\" She paused to shake her head. \"I cannot believe he\u0027s related to Frances Catherine. You really can let go of my hand now, Iain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obviously didn\u0027t trust her. He did let go of her hand, but he kept the apple. Judith was too surprised by his sudden smile to argue with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want Brodick for an enemy, Judith,\" Alex said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s already my enemy,\" she replied. She had difficulty taking her gaze off Iain when she answered his friend. \"Brodick made up his mind to dislike me even before we met, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one answered her. Then Gowrie turned the topic. \"If you retaliate each time you think someone dislikes you, you\u0027ll be throwing apples all day long once we reach the Highlands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Superior Scottish apples,\" Alex teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith turned to frown at the warrior. \"I don\u0027t care if I\u0027m liked or not,\" she said. \"Frances Catherine needs me. That\u0027s all that really matters. My feelings certainly aren\u0027t important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does she need you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick called out that question. Judith was so surprised the man had spoken to her, she turned and smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could form an answer, he said, \"She has Patrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And all of us,\" Alex said. \"We\u0027re her relatives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned around again. \"I\u0027m certain she\u0027s comforted by such loyalty, but you are men, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain raised an eyebrow over that statement. He obviously didn\u0027t understand what she was talking about. He wasn\u0027t alone in his confusion, either. Gowrie and Alex looked just as puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frances Catherine has relatives who are women, too,\" Gowrie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would imagine she does,\" Judith agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why does she need you?\" Gowrie asked. He reached down to take a third helping of the pork strips, but kept his gaze on her while he waited for her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the birthing,\" Iain guessed aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then she thinks she\u0027s going to have trouble?\" Gowrie asked his laird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain nodded. \"It appears so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex snorted. Judith took exception to that response. \"Frances Catherine has every right to be worried. She isn\u0027t a coward, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re thinking. Why, she\u0027s one of the most courageous women I\u0027ve ever known. She\u0027s strong and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now don\u0027t get yourself all worked up,\" Alex interrupted with a grin. \"We are all aware of Frances Catherine\u0027s many fine qualities. You don\u0027t have to defend her to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she think she\u0027s going to die?\" Gowrie asked. He looked startled, as if he\u0027d only just worked out that possibility in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Judith could answer him, Brodick called out, \"If Patrick\u0027s woman thinks she\u0027s going to die, why did she send for you, English?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned around to glare at the plaid cocoon. Then she turned around again. She decided to ignore the rude man. He could shout a hundred questions at her, but she wasn\u0027t going to answer any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone waited a long minute for Judith to explain. She occupied herself by once again gathering up the containers of food to put away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick\u0027s curiosity proved to be greater than his dislike for her. The rude man didn\u0027t just join the group, either. Nay, he elbowed his way in next to her, shoving Alex out of his way. She moved over to make room for the big man, but his arm still rubbed against hers when he was finally settled. He didn\u0027t recoil away. She looked at Iain to judge his reaction. His expression didn\u0027t tell her anything, though. He picked up the apple and tossed it to Brodick. She still refused to look at the warrior, guessing he was still scowling, but she heard him take a loud bite of the offering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Iain winked at her. She smiled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to make me ask you again, English?\" Brodick muttered around a mouthful of apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided she was. \"Ask me what, Brodick?\" she asked, trying to sound sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sigh was fierce enough to knock over the containers. Judith bit her lower lip to keep herself from laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you pricking my temper on purpose?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex and Gowrie both laughed. Brodick glared. \"Just answer my question,\" he commanded. \"If Frances Catherine thinks she\u0027s going to die, why in thunder did she send for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m Scots?\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let him see her exasperation. \"Do you know, I was always told the Scots could be mule-headed. I never believed such nonsense, of course, but now that I\u0027ve met you, I believe I\u0027ll have to rethink my position on that issue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get him riled,\" Alex warned with a chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, Brodick gets downright surly when he isn\u0027t in a good mood,\" Gowrie told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened. \"Do you mean to say he\u0027s happy now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Gowrie and Alex nodded at the same time. Judith burst into laughter. She was certain they were jesting with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were just as certain she\u0027d lost her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re all curious as to why Frances Catherine sent for you,\" Alex said once she\u0027d controlled herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Since you don\u0027t know me at all well, I\u0027ll have to confess to a few of my considerable flaws so you\u0027ll understand. I\u0027m extremely stubborn, arrogant too, though in truth I have absolutely nothing to be arrogant about. I\u0027m sinfully possessive… did I mention that flaw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone but Iain shook his head at her. Judith stared at their leader, though. His eyes had taken on such a warm glint. It was a little unnerving to have such a handsome man give her his full attention. She had to force herself to turn her gaze away so she could concentrate on what she was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at her lap. \"Well, I am possessive,\" she whispered. \"Frances Catherine is well aware of my many imperfections, too. \u0027Tis the truth she\u0027s counting on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Brodick asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she thinks she\u0027s going to die,\" Judith explained. She let out a little sigh before adding, \"And I\u0027m too stubborn to let her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t laugh at her. Iain smiled, but none of the others showed any reaction to her sinful boast. She could still feel herself blushing. She hid that telling show of embarrassment by turning her attention to repacking the containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t any food left to put away. Once Brodick started eating, he didn\u0027t stop until the last morsel was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith excused herself and went back to the stream to wash the sticky apple juice off her fingers. She sat down on the grassy slope near the water and brushed her hair until her scalp tingled. She was exhausted, yet was enjoying the beauty and the peaceful solitude of her surroundings too much to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the sun had almost disappeared from the sky, and only streaks of golden-orange shadows remained, Iain came to fetch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile of greeting took him by surprise. He reacted by being a bit more gruff than usual. \"You should get some sleep, Judith. Tomorrow will be a difficult day for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will it be difficult for you, too?\" she asked. She stood up, patted the wrinkles out of her gown, and then started down the slope. In her haste she forgot about her brush. It got caught up in her feet, tripping her, and she went flying toward the ground. Iain moved with amazing speed for such a giant of a man. He grabbed her before she could pitch forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was horrified by her clumsiness. She turned her gaze up to his to thank him for his assistance, but the words got caught in her throat and she could only stare up at him in confusion. The intensity of his gaze made her tremble inside. Her reaction to the warrior didn\u0027t make any sense to her, and because she couldn\u0027t reason it through, she couldn\u0027t control it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d whispered that reply. She didn\u0027t have the faintest idea what he was talking about. \"No, what?\" she whispered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, tomorrow won\u0027t be difficult for me,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it won\u0027t be difficult for me, either,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes sparkled with amusement. He smiled, too. Her knees went weak. Lord, he was a handsome devil. She had to shake her head because she\u0027d noticed. She forced herself to turn away from him. He bent down to pick up her brush. She had the same intention. Their foreheads bumped. Her hand reached the brush first. His hand covered hers. The warmth of his fingers startled her. She stared down at his hand, marveling at the sheer size of it. It was at least twice the size of hers. His strength was so apparent to her. He could crush her if he wanted to, she thought to herself. The power radiating from him was fairly overwhelming, yet the gentleness in his touch was evident, too. She knew she could pull her hand away if she wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up when he did, but she still didn\u0027t pull her hand away. Neither did he. They stayed that way for what seemed an eternity to Judith, yet she knew only a minute or two had actually passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain was staring down at her with a puzzled look on his face. She didn\u0027t know what to make of that. Then he suddenly jerked his hand away. The abruptness of that action embarrassed her. \"You confuse me, Iain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t realized she\u0027d spoken those words out loud until she\u0027d said them. She backed away from him, then hurried down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain watched her leave. His hands were clasped behind his back. When he realized how rigid his stance was, he forced himself to relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell,\" he muttered to himself. He wanted her. Iain accepted that fact without flinching. He excused his behavior by telling himself any man with healthy appetites would be drawn to her. She was a damn beautiful woman, after all, incredibly soft and feminine, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat shook Iain was the fact that he\u0027d only just realized she was also attracted to him. He wasn\u0027t at all pleased by that realization, either. He knew he could control his own desires, but he didn\u0027t have any idea how he could control hers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-8.html","bookId":1844,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM"}
