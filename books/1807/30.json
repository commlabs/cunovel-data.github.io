Are you knitting?” Brida asked, her eyes going to the horrible shirt Elise still clung to. “Where are your brothers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise nodded her head to the pond where the swans paddled around—either uninterested in Brida’s entrance, or filled with too many swan thoughts to rally any curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are your brothers?” Brida repeated, speaking loudly and over enunciating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of everyone to find Elise, why did it have to be Brida? Deciding the guard captain would eventually figure out that the swans were her brothers, or they would transform in front of the guard and then she could figure it out, Elise sat back down and went back to knitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Brida was not someone you could easily put off. The bossy female crouched down in front of Elise and put her hand on top of the shirt. “What are you—,” she yelped and drew her hand back when the plants pricked her palm. “Have you gone mad?” Brida asked, never one to sweeten her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise carefully moved the shirt away from Brida.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a message for you from Princess Gabrielle,” Brida said, reaching inside her shirt to withdraw a sealed envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise reached for it, but Brida held it out of range. “I’m not giving it to you until you tell me what is going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise patiently held out her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Brida said, shaking her head. “Get a hold of yourself, Princess, and tell me what’s going on. If you can control yourself and put aside your foolish emotions, I will give you the letter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrida’s arrogance and the way she talked sent a spark of irritation through Elise, but she kept her expression bland as she started at the letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Brida shook her head. “Not until you stop acting petty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought Elise was being petty, did she? Elise glanced down at her hand to assure herself that some of the sharp hairs and thorns from the stinging nettle plant were stuck in her skin. (There were some, drawing tiny pinpricks of blood.) Elise smacked her open hand on top of Brida’s, the stuck nettles scratching the soft, delicate skin on the top of captain’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrida yelped and fell on her rear. Elise used the moment of distraction to snatch the letter from Brida. She tore open the envelope and removed the letter, reading it before Brida recovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dearest sister,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI assume Angelique has already visited you and informed you of our failure. Angelique told me there was little hope that my husband and your brothers would ever return to normal. But there is a small possibility, should you be willing to take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must confess I do not know you as well as I should, but I am confident of the love you have for your brothers. If there is a way to save them, I am positive you will pursue it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping that in mind, I have sent Brida for your disposal. I am aware you two have some differences, (Elise internally snorted.) But Brida is unfailingly loyal to our family, and I dare not send anyone else. She will guard you and see to your needs—although I would never venture to call her a maid, if I were you. You would probably get a black eye for your mistake, Fürstin or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish you luck with your task and our beloved family. I am sorry I failed you, but I shall do my best in your absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith all the luck in the world, Gabrielle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise was grateful Gabrielle had thought to send a guard. Elise would be safer with Brida around. Brida was a skilled warrior, had a healthy set of lungs, and she had brought weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still… did it have to be Brida?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrida was rubbing the top of her hand and looking reproachfully at Elise. “Princess,” she said, grinding her teeth. “I do not know what is wrong with you, but could you please direct me to your brothers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise stared at Brida. Hadn’t Gabrielle told her of her brother’s plight? (Or flight, really, if one wanted to be technical.) Elise stood, carrying the letter and her ugly shirt, and walked to the edge of the pond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was almost set. Elise couldn’t be sure since the trees blocked the last of its descent, but judging on the light, her brothers would be available for a chat with Brida in a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Princess,” Brida said, sounding a little like Falk in her frustration. She walked up to Elise and put her hands on her shoulders, forcing Elise to turn around. “What, in the name of all that is holy, are you—,” Brida broke off her lecture and jumped backwards when a swan furiously paddled across the pond and clambered onto shore, hissing and lunging at Brida.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrida took a few steps before she stopped and held her ground. To her credit, she did not grapple for a weapon. Instead she narrowed her eyes and studied the upset bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral other swans ringed around Elise, forming a white, waist high wall of protection. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wild-swans-timeless-fairy-tales-2/page-30.html","bookId":1807,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:55 PM"}
