Danny shrugged, “Probably.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry didn’t look amused. I laughed, “You’re like the only gay guy here, you’re golden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender walked over with a picture, “You have to sign this for me, please. I almost had a stroke from the other side of the bar, when I saw it was you guys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed, “Told you they would know who you were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLochlan sighed and signed it, sliding it over to Gerry. “Look man, we’re just trying to have an uneventful night out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winked, “Mums the word. I won’t say shit. Thanks guys, I’m a huge fan. I drove all the way to Boston to see you perform, twice.” He was glowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry smiled at him, “Thanks man. We appreciate the support.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender looked like he might hug them, but he turned and took the picture of the band back to the bar. He tacked it to the wall. I laughed and nodded. They never noticed he was doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny tapped his fingers against the wooden table, “So I was thinking that maybe, if we run a couple charity concerts to start you off with the humble U2 vibe, people would have that impression of you. It might help get them past Loch getting kicked off the show. You know, the bad boys of rock and roll are kind of over. Girls think it’s sexy when the lead singer has a puppy and hugs his grandma, ya know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was lost. Danny never said nearly intelligent stuff like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLochlan grinned at Gerry, “We have a gay drummer who is totally comfortable with his sexuality, we’re fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry laughed, “Asshole. I’m not being the poster child for gay musicians; Elton John has that covered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny gave them both a serious look, “I’m serious. You all need to decide which direction, you want that to go. Me and Lenny and Vic were talking about it. I want to maintain this positive type of public perception.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed, “Are you working for them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny beamed, “Yeah.” He said it like it was obvious, I should have known it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Lochlan. He shrugged, “He was right about the dramatic pauses. The intensity of the show was upped. The lights on the crowd only—he has good ideas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry nudged him in the booth, “And he’s cute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny blushed, “Anyway, you want AIDS or kids in Africa, Romanian orphans, or what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLochlan sighed, “Why didn’t Vic and Lenny decide? They started Thin Ice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry looked confused too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny drummed his fingers against the table, “Lenny has kids and a wife. He wants to take a serious backseat in all this. He never started the band and was never comfortable with a leadership role. That was Harris’ job and they don’t want it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry nodded, “It is typically something the front man would control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Vic?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry looked at Lochlan and shook his head, “He never wanted this. He liked it being a small Boston band. He’s starting a company and leaving the band. He’s going to tell you all, when we get back. He emailed me yesterday. It’s too big.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLochlan looked upset, “Is it me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry shook his head, “No way, man. You’ve been the best thing that ever happened to Thin Ice. Me and Mike want this to be big. We hunted you for a reason. If we have to just hire a keyboard and guitar, then so be it. Drums, singer, bass, and one guitar are the most important anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLochlan looked stressed. My buzz was killed. I sipped my glass of red and looked around the bar. A girl waved at me from across the dance floor. I smiled and pushed Lochlan, “Let me out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked confused but climbed out. I kissed his cheek, “Be back in a minute.” The shoptalk was boring, and somehow I felt like I might be to blame. Lochlan had been moody since he met me. I pushed it to the back of my mind and ran to the girl across the bar. “Serena, hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been my roommate for the months I was at dorms. She was an it girl, popular and slightly mean. She had been in love with my brother, thank God. It earned me a place in her world. I never had to worry about being bullied or tortured. I was Serena’s friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my arms around her. She seemed thinner than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you?” she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, “Good. Law school in Boston. How are things with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around the bar, “Same old. I’m a project manager for a construction company.” I assumed it was her dad’s, but I didn’t say that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head, “I’ve never seen you let your hair go curly like that. You always did the sleek look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed a curl, “Oh yeah.” I sounded like I was from North Dakota. I cleared my throat, “My boyfriend likes it curly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the table of good-looking guys I’d just left, “Is that you boyfriend?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He looks like that guy from that America’s Most Talented Stars.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, “Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So he tells you how to wear your hair?” It was a shitty thing to say and my face made her backpedal, “I mean it’s just weird. You were always so strong and never cared what people thought. You were independent and free. I always thought that was so cool.” She used the term like that part of me was long gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “I still am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer pretty face got serious, “How’s Danny?” I was grateful for the change in subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to say awesome, he’d just landed his dream job, and was happy like he’d never been. Instead I shrugged, “You know Danny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes got lost in thought for a second, “That I do.” She snapped out of it and became the blonde, tanned, queen of the mean, “So law school. That always was the dream, wasn’t it?” Her tone was patronizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored it, “Yes, it was. I’m pretty excited.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, “I’m really happy for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. I’m happy for you too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer glossy lips stayed frozen in her fake smile, “It’s great we’re both doing so well.” I caught her gaze travel to the table again, “Say hi to Danny for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will. Anyway, I have to go the bathroom. It’s good to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, “Yeah, you too.” I hugged her again and walked away, “See you around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved. A pop song started to play really loudly. It had hit eleven, the magic dancing hour. The lights dimmed as the dance floor started to get crowded. I walked to the bathroom, weaving through the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom was nearly empty. I washed my hands and looked at myself. I looked different. I felt different. The way I’d gushed about law school felt fake, like what I wanted to gush about was Lochlan. I wanted her to know I was dating him. It was for petty reasons. The other girls left in a pack. I’d never had a pack. I’d never made female friends with anyone, who I had maintained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked out of the ladies’ washroom, stopped cold by the stare bearing down on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped my hand in my pocket. It wasn’t there. He was there but it wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat closed. I backed into the washroom, choosing the wrong place to flee. He didn’t chase me. He walked slowly, methodically, as if he’d imagined this moment a thousand times. He closed the door, slipping the lock into place. I was back against the far side of the wall. My breath was stuck, my scream was behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brown eyes looked crazier than I remembered them being. He pointed at me, “I missed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears fell from my eyes, “Mitch, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, “You going to hold out that piece of paper you got, to stop me from seeing you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head as the tears streamed down my face, “No. I swear, I’ll leave and never come back, I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face grew angry, like it had before, “Why would I want you to leave? We’re just getting reunited.” How was he out already? Why had no one told me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy back was pressed against the wall. With my eyes closed, I could see my mace on the bedside table, where I’d left it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped into a stall, slamming the door and locking it. My hands shook as hard as the door that he pounded the shit out of. I dialed Lochlan’s cell. It rang and rang, but went to voicemail. The door bent. I could see the screws were getting ripped out. I screamed, “HELP ME!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“HOW COULD YOU, ERIN? HOW COULD YOU FUCK HIM? YOU THINK I DIDN’T SEE YOUR SLUT FACE ALL OVER THE BLOG SITES? YOU LET HIM SHAME YOU, LIKE A WHORE!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and redialed. It went to voicemail again. I spoke into the phone, “I’m in the bathroom. Help me.” I hung up and texted, ‘I’m in the bathroom, he’s here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was dialing 9-1-1 when he kicked the door in completely, knocking me onto the toilet. I slid the phone along the floor, as he grabbed my arm and dragged me out over the broken door. He slammed me into the counter. I screamed but he hit me hard. I was scratching and flailing, but his hands were everywhere. He held my arms to the floor and sat on my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and me are meant to be together, Erin. I love you. I always loved you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “Please, stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe screamed, “I LOVE YOU! YOU UNGRATEFUL BITCH!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “I know. I love you too. Let’s just go out to the car. I don’t want to be in the bathroom anymore. Please.” I pleaded through the tears, “I love you too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t buy it but he looked like he wanted too. He snorted, “Not yet you don’t, but you will.” He ripped at my shirt. I screamed again, “HELP ME! I’M AT BIG D’S, HELP ME!” I screamed in case I was connected to 9-1-1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a bang and screaming. The lock turned and the door flung open. There was a series of flashes and movements. I saw the tattooed arm around Mitch’s throat. Mitch was ripped off me and tossed. I jumped up, leaping into Lochlan’s arms, wrapping myself around him, getting between him and Mitch. I whispered, “Don’t baby, don’t hurt him. He’s not worth it.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/my-side/page-26.html","bookId":2792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:38 PM"}
