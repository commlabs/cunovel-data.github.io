What happened?” Rune asked, the first to climb free of the cold water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re gone, Rune.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are gone?” Erick said, just behind his younger brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The shirts. They’re gone. King Torgen burned all of them,” Elise said, nudging the rescued shirt to show the burned nettles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elise, I’m so sorry,” Rune said, wrapping his arms around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise cried into his chest, letting the sobs she had held back all afternoon go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRune scooped her up and rocked her like a child as she vented her heartbreak, anger, and misery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Elise was done crying, her eyes were so puffy she could barely see. Rune carried her into cottage, and one of her foster-brothers brought the shirt with and hung it over a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerhart sat in the loft, his legs dangling over the side. Steffen and Erick stood together in one corner of the small cottage. Mikk and Nick were in the other, and Falk stalked back and forth in the open space like a snarling bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked up when Brida entered the cottage, carrying a small sack. “So you know?” she asked, observing their grim looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More or less,” Steffen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From what we can tell, King Torgen spoke to Elise and burned the shirts. We’re guessing she managed to fish that one out of the fire based on the singed patches,” Erick said, pointing to the remaining cape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, that’s roughly how it happened,” Elise said, her voice rough like gravel as she slipped from Rune’s grasp and sat in a free chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteffen crouched down in front of her and put his hands on his knees. “We only have a few minutes left before we change back, but we need to make something clear. Elise, you don’t need to do this again. In fact, you shouldn’t. It’s enough that you tried. We will wait for Angelique. We don’t want to cause you more pain over this. Do you understand?” Steffen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for trying, sister. Your devotion warms my heart, but now it is our turn to take care of you,” Steffen said, hugging Elise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick paced. “Maybe we should leave this place. I thought King Torgen was mad. I didn’t think he was evil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As bad as Clotilde,” Mikk said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since Elise won’t need time to knit, we could travel during the day,” Gerhart said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As swans? It’s dangerous here, but it’s more dangerous in the wild,” Rune said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we can’t leave Verglas. Angelique told us to stay here,” Steffen added, his voice tired and weary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s time,” Erick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteffen nodded and led the way out of the cottage. Mikk and Gerhart were hot on his heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErick paused to place a hand on Elise’s head. “Be well, and please talk during the day,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I agree with Erick,” Nick said, affectionately ruffling Elise’s hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As you should. I am the chancellor of a college,” Erick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hoo, someone’s got an attitude considering he spends his day eating minnows and cracked corn,” Nick said as they left the cottage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRune slid his fingertips under Elise’s chin. “Rest well,” he said. “I am sorry for your heartbreak,” he added, kissing the top of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise would have blushed if her face wasn’t so swollen from all the crying. She looked around. Falk and Brida were the only ones in the cottage. Falk was staring at Elise’s feet, mashing his lips together. “Falk?” Elise cautiously asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalk threw his arms around Elise. It wasn’t the secure, familiar hug Rune gave her. In fact, it was quite awkward and a little uncomfortable, but as he held her to his chest, Elise could hear the quick thud of Falk’s heartbeat and the unsteady heave of his lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise smiled, touched that Falk was so upset on her behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let her go as abruptly as he embraced her before he hurried out of the cottage, without speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise joined Brida at the door and watched the princes grumble as they waded into the cold water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are those knitting needles?” Elise asked Brida.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Brida said, turning the sack around in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” Elise said, holding out a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You still intend to make the shirts? Even after your brothers said not to?” Brida asked, passing the small bag to Elise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise snorted as her hand closed around the bag. “My brothers are not always right. Besides, do I seem like a quitter to you?” she said before she went back into the cottage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrida had a small smile on her lips. “No, you do not, Fürstin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Elise’s swan companion realized the following day that Elise was knitting, he complained all day long. There was hardly a moment when he was not peering over her shoulder, grunting in displeasure or climbing into her lap and getting in the way. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wild-swans-timeless-fairy-tales-2/page-56.html","bookId":1807,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:55 PM"}
