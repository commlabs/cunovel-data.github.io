The raptor was just ahead, cutting diagonally toward them, heading for the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go!\" Kelly shouted. \"Go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor saw them and changed course, angling farther ahead. It was trying to get distance on them but they were moving faster on the open banks. They came abreast of the animal, flanking it, and then Sarah left the banks, heading back onto the grassy plain. The raptor moved right, deeper into the plain. Away from the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did it!\" Kelly shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah maintained her speed, moving slowly closer to the raptor. It seemed to have given up on the river, and now had no plan. It was just running up the plain. And they were steadily, inexorably gaining. Kelly was excited. She tried to wipe the maid off her rifle, preparing to shoot again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn!\" Sarah shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly leaned forward, stared past Sarah\u0027s shoulder. Directly ahead, she saw the herd of apatosaurs. They were only fifty yards from the first of the enormous animals, which bellowed and wheeled in sudden fear. Their bodies were green-gray in the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor streaked directly toward the herd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It thinks it\u0027s going to lose us!\" Sarah gunned the bike, moving closer. \"Get it now! Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly aimed and fired. The gun bucked. But the raptor kept going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Missed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp ahead, the apatosaurs were turning, their big legs stomping the ground. Their heavy tails whipped through the air. But they were too slow to move away. The raptor raced forward, heading directly beneath the big apatosaurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do?\" Kelly shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No choice!\"\u0027 Sarah yelled. She pulled parallel to the raptor just as they passed into shadow, racing beneath the first animal. Kelly glimpsed the curve of the belly, hanging three feet above her. The legs were as thick as tree trunks, stamping and turning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor ran on, darting among the moving legs. Sarah swerved, followed. Above them, the animals roared and turned, and roared again. They were beneath another belly, then out into moonlight, then in shadow again. Now they were in the middle of the herd. It was like being in a forest of moving trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectly ahead, a big leg came down with a slam! that shook the ground. The bike bounced as Sarah swung left; they scraped against the animal\u0027s flesh. \"Hang on!\" she shouted, and swerved again, following the raptor. Above them, the apatosaurs were bellowing and moving. The raptor dodged and turned, and then broke clear, racing out the back of the herd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" Sarah said, spinning the bike around. A whiptail swung low, narrowly missing them, and then they too were free, chasing the raptor again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motorcycle raced across the grassy plain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last chance!\" Sarah shouted. \"Do it\"\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly raised the rifle. Sarah was driving hard and fast, pulling very close to the running raptor. The animal turned to butt her, but she held her position, punched it hard in the head with her fist. \"Now! \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly shoved the barrel against the flesh of the neck, and squeezed the trigger. The gun snapped back hard, jolting her in the stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor ran on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" she shouted. \"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then suddenly the raptor fell, tumbling end over end in the grass, and Sarah swung the bike away and pulled to a stop. The raptor was five yards away, flopping in the grass. It snarled and yelped. Then it was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah took the rifle, snapped open the cartridge pack. Kelly saw five more darts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought that was the last one,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lied,\" Sarah said. \"Wait here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly stayed by the bike while Sarah moved cautiously forward through the grass. Sarah fired one more shot, then stood waiting for a few moments. Then she bent down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she came back, she was holding the key in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the nest, the raptors were still tearing at the carcass, off to one side. But the intensity of the behavior was diminishing: some of the animals were turning away, rubbing their jaws with their clawed hands, drifting slowly toward the center of the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving closer to the cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne climbed into the back of the jeep, pushing aside the canvas cover. He checked the rifle in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine slid into the driver\u0027s seat. He started the engine. Thorne steadied himself in the back of the jeep, gripped the rear bar. He turned to Levine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jeep raced forward across the clearing- By the carcass, the raptors looked up in surprise as they saw the intruder. By then the jeep was past the center of the clearing, driving past the enormous dead skeletons, the broad ribs high over their heads, and then Levine was swinging the car left, pulling alongside the aluminum cage. Thorne jumped out, and grabbed the cage in both hands. In the darkness he couldn\u0027t tell how badly Arby was hurt; the boy was turned face down. Levine climbed out of the car; Thorne yelled for him to get back in, as he lifted the cage high and swung it onto the back of the Jeep. Thorne jumped into the back, next to the cage, and Levine shoved the car in gear. Behind them, the raptors snarled and raced forward in pursuit, running among the skeletal ribs. They crossed the clearing with stunning speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Levine stepped on the gas, the nearest raptor leapt high, landing up on the back of the car, and grabbing the canvas tarp in its teeth. The animal hissed and held on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine accelerated, and the Jeep bounced out of the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn darkness, Malcolm sank back into morphine dreams, images floated in front of his eyes: fitness landscapes, the Multicolored computer images now employed to think about evolution. In this mathematical world of peaks and valleys, populations of organisms were seen to climb the fitness peaks, or slide down into the valleys of nonadaptation. Stu Kauffman and his coworkers had shown that advanced organisms had complex internal constraints which made them more likely to fall off the fitness optima, and descend into the valleys. Yet, at the same time complex creatures were themselves selected by evolution. Because complex creatures were able to adapt on their own. With tools, with learning, with cooperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut complex animals had obtained their adaptive flexibility at some cost-they had traded one dependency for another. It was no longer necessary to change their bodies to adapt, because now their adaptation was behavior, socially determined. That behavior required learning. In a sense, among higher animals adaptive fitness was no longer transmitted to the next generation by DNA at all. It was now carried by teaching. Chimpanzees taught their young to collect termites with a stick. Such actions implied at least the rudiments of a culture. a structured social life. But animals raised in isolation, without parents, without guidance, were not fully functional. Zoo animals frequently could not care for their offspring, because they had never seen it done. They would ignore their infants, or roll over and crush them, or simply become annoyed with them and kill them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe velociraptors were among the most intelligent dinosaurs, and the most ferocious. Both traits demanded behavioral control. Millions of years ago, in the now-vanished Jurassic world, their behavior would have been socially determined, passed on from older to younger animals. Genes controlled the capacity to make such patterns, but not the patterns themselves. Adaptive behavior was a kind of morality; it was behavior that had evolved over many generations because it was found to succeed - behavior that allowed members of the species to cooperate, to live together, to hunt, to raise young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut on this island, the velociraptors had been re-created in a genetics laboratory. Although their physical bodies were genetically determined, their behavior was not. These newly created raptors came into the world with no older animals to guide them, to show them proper raptor behavior. They were on their own, and that was just how they behaved - in a society without structure, without rules, without cooperation. They lived in an uncontrolled, every-creature-for-himself world where the meanest and the nastiest survived, and all the others died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jeep picked up speed, bouncing hard. Thorne held on to the bars, to keep from being thrown out. Behind him, he saw the raptor swinging back and forth in the air, still clinging to the tarp. It wasn\u0027t letting go. Levine drove back onto the flat muddy banks of the river, and turned right, following the edge of the water. The raptor hung on tenaciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectly ahead, lying in the mud, Levine saw another skeleton. Another skeleton? Why were all these skeletons here? But there was no time to think - he drove forward, passing beneath the row of ribs. Without lights, he leaned forward and squinted in the moonlight, looking for obstacles ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the back of the car, the raptor scrambled up, released the tarp, clamped its jaws on the cage, and began to pull it out of the back of the Jeep. Thorne lunged, grabbed the end of the cage nearest him. The cage twisted rolling Thorne onto his back. He found himself in a tug of war with the raptor - and the raptor was winning. Thorne locked his legs around the front passenger seat, trying to hold on. The raptor snarled; Thorne sensed the sheer fury of the animal, enraged that it might lose its prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here!\" Levine shouted, holding a gun out to Thorne. Thorne was on his back, gripping the cage in both hands. He couldn\u0027t take the gun. Levine looked back, and saw the situation. He looked in the rearview mirror. Behind them, he saw the rest of the pack still in pursuit, snarling and growling. He could not slow down. Thorne could not let go of the cage. Still driving fast, Levine swung around in the passenger seat, and aimed the rifle backward. He tried to maneuver the gun, knowing what would happen if he accidentally shot Thorne, or Arby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch it!\" Thorne was shouting. \"Watch it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine managed to get the safety off, and swung the barrel straight at the raptor, which was still gripping the cage bars in its jaws. The animal looked up, and in a quick movement closed its jaws over the barrel. It tugged at the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor\u0027s eyes popped wide as the dart slammed into the back of its throat. It made a gurgling sound, then went into convulsions, toppling backward out of the Jeep - and yanking the gun from Levine\u0027s hands as it fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne scrambled to his knees, and pulled the cage inside the car. He looked down inside it, but he couldn\u0027t tell about Arby. Looking back, he saw the other raptors were still pursuing, but they were now twenty yards back, and losing ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the dashboard, the radio hissed. \"Doc.\" Thorne recognized Sarah\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Following the river,\" Thorne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storm clouds had now cleared, and it was a bright moonlit night. Behind him, the raptors still continued to chase the Jeep. But they were now failing steadily behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t see your lights,\" Sarah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t have any.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. The radio crackled. Her voice was tense: \"What about Arby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have him,\" Thorne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God. How is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landscape opened out. They came back into a broad valley, the grass silvery in the moonlight. Thorne looked around, trying to orient himself. Then he realized: they were back on the plain, but much farther to the south. They must still be on the same side of the river as the high hide. In that case, they ought to be able to make their way up onto the ridge road, somewhere to the left. That road would lead them back to the clearing, and the remaining trailer. And safety. He nudged Levine, pointed to the right. \"Go there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine turned the car, Thorne clicked the radio. \"Sarah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going back to the trailer on the ridge road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Sarah said. \"We\u0027ll find you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah looked back at Kelly. \"Where\u0027s the ridge road?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s that one up there,\" Kelly said, pointing to the spine of the ridge, on the cliffs high above them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Sarah said. She gunned the bike forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jeep rumbled across the plain, deep in silvery grass. They were moving fast. The raptors were no longer visible behind them. \"Looks like we lost them,\" Thorne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Levine said. When he had pulled out of the streambed, he had seen several animals dart off to the left. They would now be hidden in the grass. He wasn\u0027t sure they would give up so easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jeep was roaring toward the cliffs. Directly ahead he saw a curving switchback road, running up from the valley floor. That was the ridge road, he felt sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that the terrain was smoother, Thorne crawled back between the seats and crouched over the cage. He peered in through the bars at Arby, who was groaning softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf the boy\u0027s face was slick with blood, and his shirt was soaked. But his eyes were open, and he seemed to be moving his arms and legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne leaned close to the bars. \"Hey, son,\" he said gently. \"Can you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArby nodded, moaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How you doing there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been better,\" Arby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jeep ground onto the dirt road, and headed upward along the switchbacks. Levine felt a sense of relief as they moved higher, away from the valley. He was finally on the ridge road, and he was going to be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up, toward the crest. And then he saw the dark shapes \u0027in the moonlight, already at the top of the road, hopping up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaptors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled to a stop. \"What do we do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move over,\" Thorne said grimly. \"I\u0027ll take it from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Edge OF Chaos\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne came up onto the ridge, and turned left, accelerating. The road stretched ahead in the moonlight, a narrow strip running between a rock wall to his left, and a sheer cliff falling away on the right. Twenty feet above him, on the ridge, he saw the raptors, leaping and snorting as they ran parallel to the Jeep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine saw them too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we going to do?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne shook his head. \"Look in the too] kit. Look in the glove compartment. Get anything you can find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine bent over, fumbling in darkness. But Thorne knew they were in trouble. Their gun was gone. They were in a jeep with a cloth top, and the raptors were all around them. He guessed he was probably about half a mile from the clearing, and the trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf a mile to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne slowed as he came into the next curve, moving the car away from the plunging drop of the cliff. Rounding the curve, he saw a raptor crouched in the middle of the road, facing them, its head lowered menacingly. Thorne accelerated toward it. The raptor leapt up in the air, legs raised high. It landed on the hood of the car, claws squealing as they raked metal. It smashed against the windshield, the glass streaking spiderwebs. With the animal\u0027s body lying against the windshield, Thorne couldn\u0027t see anything. On this dangerous road, he slammed on the brakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Levine shouted, tumbling forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor on the hood slid off to the side. Now Thorne could see again, and he stamped on the gas. Levine fell back again as the car moved forward. But three raptors were charging the car from the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne jumped onto the running board and locked its jaws on the side mirror. The animal\u0027s glaring eye was close to Thorne\u0027s face. He swung the wheel left, scraping the car along the rocky face of the road. Ten yards ahead a boulder protruded. He glanced at the raptor, which continued to hold on tenaciously, right to the moment when the boulder smashed into the side mirror, tearing it away. The raptor was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road widened a little. Thorne had more room to maneuver now. He felt a heavy thump, and looked up to see the canvas top sagging above his head. Claws slashed down by his ear, ripping through the canvas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung the car right, then left again. The claws pulled out, but the animal was still up there, its body still indenting the cloth. Beside him, Levine produced a big hunting knife, and thrust it upward through the Cloth. Immediately, another claw raked downward, slashing Levine\u0027s hand. He yelled in pain, dropping the knife. Thorne bent over, reaching down to the floor for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the rearview mirror, he saw two more raptors in the road behind him, chasing the Jeep. They were gaining on him,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the road was broader now, and he accelerated. The raptor on the roof peered over the top, looking in through the broken windshield. Thorne held the knife in his fist and jabbed it straight up with full force, again and again. It didn\u0027t seem to make any difference. As the road curved, he jerked the wheel right, then back, the whole jeep tilting, and the raptor on the roof lost its grip and rolled backward off the top. It tore most of the canvas roof away as it went. The animal bounced on the ground and hit the two pursuing raptors. The impact knocked all three over the side; they fell snarling down the cliff face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That does it!\" Levine shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a moment later, another raptor jumped down from the cliff and ran forward, only a few feet from the Jeep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd lightly, almost easily, the raptor leapt up into the back of the Jeep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn, the passenger seat, Levine stared. The raptor was fully inside the Jeep, its head low, arms up, jaws wide, in an unmistakable posture. The raptor hissed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine thought, It\u0027s all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shocked: his entire body broke out in sweat, be felt dizzy, and he realized in a single instant there was nothing he could do, that he was moments from death. The creature hissed again, snapping its jaws, crouching to lunge - and then suddenly white foam appeared at the corners of its mouth, and its eyes rolled back. Foam bubbled out of its jaws. It began to twitch, its body going into spasms. It fell over on its side in the back of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them he now saw Sarah on the motorcycle, and Kelly holding the rifle. Thorne slowed, and Sarah pulled alongside them. She handed the key to Levine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the cage!\" she shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine took it numbly, almost dropped it. He was in shock. Moving slowly. Dumbly. I nearly died, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get her gun!\" Thorne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine looked off to the left, where more raptors were still racing along, parallel to the car. He counted six, but there were probably more. He tried to count again, his mind working slowly -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the damned gun!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine took the gun from Kelly, feeling the cold metal of the barrel in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now the car sputtered, the engine coughing, dying, then coughing again. Jerking forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" he said, turning to Thorne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trouble,\" Thorne said. \"We\u0027re out of gas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne popped the car into neutral, and it rolled forward, losing speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead was a slight rise, and beyond that, across a curve, he could see the road sloped down again. Sarah was on the motorcycle behind them, shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne realized his only hope was to make it over the rise. He said to Levine, \"Unlock the cage. Get him out of there.\" Levine was suddenly moving quickly, almost panicky, but crawled back, and got the key in the lock. The cage creaked open. He helped Arby out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne watched the speedometer as the needle fell. They were going twenty-five miles an hour...then twenty...then fifteen. The raptors, running alongside, began to move closer, sensing the car was in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen miles an hour. Still falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s out,\" Levine said, from the back. He clanged the cage shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Push the cage off,\" Thorne said. The cage rolled off the back, bouncing down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen miles an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car seemed to be creeping. And then they were over the rise, moving down the other side, gaining speed again. Twelve miles an hour. Fifteen. Twenty. He careened around the curves, trying not to touch the brakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine said, \"We\u0027ll never make it to the trailer!\" He was screaming at the top of his lungs, eyes wide with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Thorne could see the trailer off to the left, but separated from them by a gentle rise in the road. They could not get there. But up ahead the road forked, sloping down to the right, toward the laboratory. And if he remembered correctly, that road was all downhill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne turned right, away from the trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the big roof of the laboratory, a flat expanse in the moonlight. He followed the road past the laboratory, down around the back, toward the worker village. He saw the manager\u0027s house to the right, and the convenience store, with the gas pumps in front. Was there a chance they might still have gasoline?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look!\" Levine said, pointing behind them. \"Look! Look!\" Thorne glanced over his shoulder and saw that the raptors were dropping back, giving up the chase. In the vicinity of the laboratory, they seemed to hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not following us any more!\" Levine shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Thorne said. \"But where\u0027s Sarah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, Sarah\u0027s motorcycle was nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrailer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Harding twisted the handlebars, and the motorcycle shot forward over the low rise in the road ahead. She crested and came down again, heading toward the trailer. Behind her, four raptors snarled in pursuit. She accelerated, trying to get ahead of them, to gain precious yards. Because they were going to need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned back, and shouted to Kelly, \"Okay! This has to be fast!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Kelly shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we get to the trailer, you jump off and run in. Don\u0027t wait for me. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly nodded, tensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever happens, don\u0027t wait for me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarding roared up to the trailer, braked hard. The bike skidded on the wet grass, banged into the metal siding. But Kelly was already leaping off, scrambling up toward the door, going into the trailer. Sarah had wanted to get the bike inside, but she saw the raptors were very close, too close. She pushed the bike toward them and in a single motion stepped up and threw herself through the trailer door, landing on her back on the floor, She twisted her body around and kicked the door shut with her legs, just as the first of the raptors slammed against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the dark trailer, she held the door shut as the animals pounded it repeatedly. She felt for a lock on the door, but couldn\u0027t find one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian. Does this door lock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard Malcolm\u0027s voice, dreamy in the darkness. \"Life is a crystal,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian. Try and pay attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Kelly was alongside her, hands moving up and down. The raptors thumped against the door. After a moment she said, \"It\u0027s down here. By the floor.\" Harding heard a metallic click, and stepped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly reached out, took her hand. The raptors were pounding and snarling outside. \"It\u0027ll be okay,\" Harding said reassuringly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went over to Malcolm, still lying on the bed. The raptors snapped and lunged at the window near his head, their claws raking the glass. Malcolm watched them calmly. \"Noisy bastards, aren\u0027t they?\" By his side, the first-aid kit was open, a syringe on the cushion. He had probably injected himself again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the windows, the animals stopped throwing themselves against the glass. She heard the sound of scraping metal, from over by the door, and then saw that the raptors were dragging the motorbike away from the trailer. They were hopping up and down on it in fairy. It wouldn\u0027t be long before they punctured the tires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian,\" she said. \"We have to do this fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in no rush,\" he said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"What kind of weapons have you got here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weapons...oh...I don\u0027t know...\" He sighed. \"What do you want weapons for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re talking so fast,\" he said. \"You know, Sarah, you really ought to try to relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the darkened trailer, Kell was frightened, but she was reassured at the no-nonsense way Sarah talked about weapons. And Kelly was beginning to see that Sarah didn\u0027t let anything stop her, she just went and did it. This whole attitude of not letting other people stop you, of believing that you could do what you wanted, was something she found herself imitating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly listened to Dr. Malcolm\u0027s voice and knew that he would be of no help. He was on drugs and he didn\u0027t care. And Sarah didn\u0027t know her way around the trailer, Kelly did; she had searched the trailer earlier, looking for food. And she seemed to remember...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the darkness, she pulled open the drawers quickly. She squinted, trying to see. She was sure she remembered one drawer, low down had contained a pack marked with a skull and crossbones. That pack might have some kind of weapons, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard Sarah say, \"Ian: try and think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she heard Dr. Malcolm say, \"Oh, I have been, Sarah. I\u0027ve had the most wonderful thoughts. You know, all those carcasses at the raptor site present a wonderful example of - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now, Ian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly went through the drawers, leaving them open so she would know which ones she had already checked. She moved down the trailer, and then her hand touched rough canvas. She leaned forward. Yes, this was it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly pulled out a square canvas pack that was surprisingly heavy. She said, \"Sarah. Look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Harding took the pack to the window, where moonlight shone in. She unzipped the pack and stared at the contents. The pack was divided into padded sections. She saw three square blocks made of some substance that felt rubbery. And there was a small silver cylinder, like a small oxygen bottle. \"What is all this stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We thought it was a good idea,\" Malcolm said. \"But now I\u0027m not sure it was. The thing is that -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" she said, interrupting. She had to keep him focused. His mind was drifting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonlethals,\" Malcolm said. \"Alexander\u0027s ragtime band. We wanted to have - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this?\" she said, holding up one of the blocks in front of his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Area-dispersal smoke cube. What you do is - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just smoke?\" she said. \"It just makes smoke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this?\" she said, raising the silver cylinder. It had writing on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cholinesterase bomb. Releases gas, Produces short-term paralysis when it goes off. Or so they say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How short?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few minutes, I think, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does it work?\" she said, turning it in her hand. There was a cap at the end, with a locking pin. She started to pull it off, to get a look at the mechanism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t!\" he said. \"That\u0027s how you do it. You pull the pin and throw. Goes off in three seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said. Hastily, she packed up the medical kit, throwing the syringe inside, shutting the lid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Malcolm said, alarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re getting out of here,\" she said, as she moved to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm sighed. \"It\u0027s so nice to have a man around the house,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cylinder sailed high through the air, tumbling in the moonlight. The raptors were about five yards away, clustered around the bike. One of the animals looked up and saw the cylinder, which landed in the grass a few yards away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah stood by the door, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian! It didn\u0027t work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, one raptor hopped over toward where the cylinder had landed in the grass. It ducked down, and when it raised its head, it held the cylinder glinting in its jaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"It didn\u0027t work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, never mind,\" Malcolm said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raptor shook its head, biting into the cylinder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do now?\" Kelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a loud explosion, and a cloud of dense white smoke blasted outward across the clearing. The raptors disappeared in the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarding closed the door quickly. \"Now what?\" Kelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Malcolm leaning on her shoulder, they moved across the clearing in the night. The gas cloud had dissipated, several minutes before. The first raptor they found in the grass was lying on its side, eyes open, absolutely motionless. But it wasn\u0027t dead: Harding could see the steady pulse in the neck. The animal was merely paralyzed. She said to Malcolm, \"How long will it last?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have no idea,\" Malcolm said. \"Much wind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no wind, Ian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it should last a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved forward. Now the raptors lay all around them. They stepped around the bodies, smelling the rotten odor of carnivores. One of the animals lay across the bike. She eased Malcolm down to the ground, where he sat, sighing. After a moment, he began to sing: \"I wish in the land of cotton, old times there are not forgotten, look away...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarding tugged at the motorcycle handlebars, trying to pull the bike from beneath the raptor. The animal was too heavy. Kelly said, \"Let me,\" and reached for the handlebars. Harding went forward. Without hesitating, she bent over and put her arms around the raptor\u0027s neck, and pulled the head upward. She felt a wave of revulsion. Hot scaly skin scraped her arms and cheek. She grunted as she leaned back, raising the animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Dixie land...duh-duh-duh-duh...to live and die in Dixie...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said to Kelly, \"Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" Kelly said, pulling on the handlebars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarding\u0027s face was inches from the velociraptor\u0027s head and laws. The head flopped back and forth as she adjusted her grip. Close to her face, the open eye stared at her, unseeing. Harding tugged, trying to lift the animal higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost... \" Kelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarding groaned, lifting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eye blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrightened, Harding dropped the animal. Kelly pulled the bike away. \"Got it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Away, away...away down south...in Dixie...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarding came around the raptor. Now the big leg twitched. The chest began to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" she said. \"Ian, behind me. Kelly, on the handlebars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Away...away...a-way down south...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Harding said, climbing on the bike. She kept her eyes on the raptor. The head gave a convulsive jerk. The eye blinked again. It was definitely waking up. \"Let\u0027s go, let\u0027s go. Let\u0027s go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillage\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah drove the motorcycle down the hill toward the worker village. Looking past Kelly, Sarah saw the Jeep parked at the store, not far from the gas pumps. She braked to a stop, and they all climbed off in the moonlight. Kelly opened the door to the store, and helped Malcolm inside. Sarah rolled the motorcycle into the store, and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re over here,\" Thorne said. \"With Arby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the moonlight filtering in through the windows, she could see the store looked very much like an abandoned roadside convenience stand. There was a glass-walled refrigerator of soft drinks, the cans obscured by mold on the glass. A wire rack nearby held candy bars and Twinkies, the wrappers speckled green, crawling with larvae. In the adjacent magazine rack, the pages were curled, the headlines five years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo one side were rows of basic supplies: toothpaste, aspirin, suntan lotion, shampoo, combs and brushes. Alongside this were racks of clothing, tee shirts and shorts, socks, tennis rackets, bathing suits. And a few souvenirs: key chains, ashtrays, and drinking glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the center of the room was a little island with a computer cash register, a microwave, and a coffee maker. The microwave door hung wide; some animal had made a nest inside. The coffee maker was cracked, and laced with cobwebs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a mess,\" Malcolm said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks fine to me,\" Sarah Harding said. The windows were all barred. The walls seemed solid enough. The canned goods would still be edible. She saw a sign that said \"Restrooms,\" so maybe there was plumbing, too. They should be safe here, at least for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe helped Malcolm to lie down on the floor. Then she went over to where Thorne and Levine were working on Arby. \"I brought the first-aid kit,\" she said. \"How is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty bruised,\" Thorne said. \"Some gashes. But nothing broken. Head looks bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything hurts,\" Arby said. \"Even my mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody see if there\u0027s a light,\" she said. \"Let me look, Arby. Okay, you\u0027re missing a couple of teeth, that\u0027s why. But that can be fixed. The cut on your head isn\u0027t so bad.\" She swabbed it clean with gauze, turned to Thorne. \"How long until the helicopter comes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne looked at his watch. \"Two hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where does it land?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pad is several miles from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking on Arby, she nodded. \"Okay. So we have two hours to get to the pad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly said, \"How can we do that? The car\u0027s out of gas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Sarah said. \"We\u0027ll figure something out. It\u0027s going to be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always say that,\" Kelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s always true,\" Sarah said. \"Okay, Arby, I need you to help now. I\u0027m going to sit you up, and get your shirt off....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne moved off to one side with Levine. Levine was wild-eyed, his body moving in a twitchy way. The drive in the Jeep seemed to have finished him off. \"What is she talking about?\" he said. \"We\u0027re trapped here. Trapped!\" There was hysteria in his voice. \"We can\u0027t go anywhere. We can\u0027t do anything. I\u0027m telling you, we\u0027re all going to d - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it down,\" Thorne said, grabbing his arm, leaning close. \"Don\u0027t upset the kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What difference does it make?\" Levine said. \"They\u0027re going to find out sooner or - Ow! Take it easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne was squeezing his arm hard. He leaned close to Levine. \"You\u0027re too old to act like an asshole,\" he said quietly. \"Now, pull yourself together, Richard. Are you listening to me, Richard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Now, Richard, I\u0027m going to go outside, and see if the pumps work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can\u0027t possibly work,\" Levine said. \"Not after five years. I\u0027m telling you, it\u0027s a waste of - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Richard,\" Thorne said. We have to check the pumps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. The two men looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you\u0027re going outside?\" Levine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine frowned. Another pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrouched over Arby, Sarah said, \"Where are the lights, guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute,\" Thorne said to her. He leaned close to Levine. \"Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Levine said, taking a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne went to the front door, opened it, and stepped out into darkness. Levine closed the door behind him. Thorne heard a click as the door locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe immediately turned, and rapped softly. Levine opened the door a few inches, peering out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Christ\u0027s sake,\" Thorne whispered. \"Don\u0027t lock it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I just thought - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t lock the damn door!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Christ\u0027s sake,\" Thorne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed the door again, and turned to face the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround him, the worker village was silent. He heard only the steady drone of cicadas in the darkness. It seemed almost too quiet, he thought. But perhaps it was just the contrast from the snarling raptors. Thorne stood with his back to the door for a long time, staring out at the clearing. He saw nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he walked over to the jeep, opened the side door, and fumbled in the dark for the radio. Ills hand touched it; it had slid under the passenger seat. He pulled it out and carried it back to the store, knocked on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine opened it, said \"It\u0027s not lock - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\" Thorne handed him the radio, closed the door again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, he paused, watching. Around him, the compound was silent. The moon was full. The air was still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved forward and peered closely at the gas pumps. The handle of the nearest one was rusted, and draped with spiderwebs. He pulled the nozzle up, and flicked the latch. Nothing happened. He squeezed the nozzle handle. No liquid came out. He tapped the glass window on the pump that showed the number of gallons, and the glass fell out in his hand. Inside, a spider scurried across the metal numerals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to find gas, or they\u0027d never get to the helicopter. He frowned at the pumps, thinking. They were simple, the kind of very reliable pumps you found at a remote construction site. And that made sense, because after all, this was an island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was an island. That meant everything came in by plane, or boat. Most times, probably by boat. Small boats, where supplies were offloaded by hand. Which meant...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent over, examining the base of the pump in the moonlight. just as he thought, there were no buried gas tanks. He saw a thick black PVC pipe running at an angle just tinder the ground. He could see the direction the pipe was going - around the side of the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne followed it, moving cautiously in the moonlight. He paused for a moment to listen, then moved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came around to the side and saw just what he expected to see: fifty-gallon metal drums, ranged along the side wall. There were three of them, connected by a series of black hoses, That made sense. All the gasoline on the island would have had to come here in drums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped the drums softly with a knuckle. They were hollow. He lifted one, hoping to hear the slosh of liquid at the bottom. They needed only a gallon or two -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drums were empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut surely, he thought, there must be more than three drums. He did a quick calculation in his head. A lab this large would have had a half-dozen support vehicles, maybe more. Even if they were fuel-efficient, they\u0027d burn thirty or forty gallons a week. To be safe, the company would have stored at least two months\u0027 supply, perhaps six months\u0027 supply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant ten to thirty drums. And steel drums were heavy, so they probably stored them close by. Probably just a few yards...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned slowly, looking. The moonlight was bright, and he could see well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the store, there was an open space, and then clumps of tall rhododendron bushes which bad overgrown the path leading to the tennis court. Above the bushes, the chain-link fence was laced with creeping vines. To the left was the first of the worker cottages. He could see only the dark roof. To the right of the court, nearer the store, there was thick foliage, although he saw a gap -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved forward, leaving the store behind. Approaching the dark gap in the bushes he saw a vertical line, and realized it was the edge of an open wooden door. There was a shed, back in the foliage. The other door was closed. As he came closer, he saw a rusted metal sign, with flaking red lettering. The letters were black in the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRECAUCION\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNON FUMARE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINFLAMMABLE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused, listening. He heard the raptors snarling in the distance, but they seemed far away, back up on the hill. For some reason they still had not approached the village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne waited, heart pounding, staring forward at the dark entrance to the shed. At last he decided it wasn\u0027t going to get any easier. They needed gas. He moved forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe path to the shed was wet from the night\u0027s rain, but the shed was dry inside, His eyes adjusted. It was a small place, perhaps twelve by twelve. In the dim light he saw a dozen rusted drums, standing on end. Three or four more, on their sides. Thorne touched them all quickly, one after another. They were light: empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery one, empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling defeated, Thorne moved back toward the entrance to the shed. He paused for a moment, staring out at the moonlit night. And then, as he waited, he heard the unmistakable sound of breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the store, Levine moved from window to window, trying to follow Thorne\u0027s progress. His body was jumpy with tension. What was Thorne doing? He had gone so far from the store. It was very unwise. Levine kept glancing at the front door, wishing he could lock it. He felt so unsafe with the door unlocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Thorne had gone off into the bushes, disappearing entirely from view. And he had been gone a long time. At least a minute or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine stared out the window, and bit his lip. He heard the distant snarl of the raptors, and realized that they had remained up at the entrance to the laboratory. They hadn\u0027t followed the vehicles down, even now. Why not? he wondered. The question was welcome in his mind. Calming, almost soothing. A question to answer. Why had the raptors stayed up at the laboratory?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll kinds of explanations occurred to him. The raptors had an atavistic fear of the laboratory, the place of their birth. They remembered the cages and didn\u0027t want to be captured again. But he suspected the most likely explanation was also the simplest - that the area around the laboratory was some other animal\u0027s territory, it was scent-marked and demarcated and defended, and the raptors were reluctant to enter it. Even the tyrannosaur, he remembered now, had gone through the territory quickly, without stopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut whose territory?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine stared out the window impatiently, as he waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the lights?\" Sarah called, from across the room. \"I need light here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a minute\" Levine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the entrance to the shed, Thorne stood silently, listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Soft, snorting exhalations, like a quiet horse. A large animal, waiting. The sound was coming from somewhere to his right. Thorne looked over, slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw nothing at all. Moonlight shone brightly over the worker village. He saw the store, the gas pumps, the dark shape of the Jeep. Looking to his right, he saw an open space, and clijmps of rhododendron bushes. The tennis court beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared, listening hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soft snorting continued. Hardly louder than a faint breeze. But there was no breeze: the trees and bushes were not moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr were they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne had the sense that something was wrong. Something right before his eyes, something that he could see but couldn\u0027t see. With the effort of staring, he began to think his eyes were playing tricks on him. He thought he detected a slight movement in the bushes to the Tight. The pattern of the leaves seemed to shift in the moonlight. Shift, and stabilize again. But he wasn\u0027t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne stared forward, straining. And as he looked he began to think that it wasn\u0027t the bushes that had caught his eye, but rather the chain-link fence. For most of its length, the fence was overgrown with an irregular tangle of vines, but in a few places the regular diamond pattern of links was visible. And there was something strange about that pattern. The fence seemed to be moving, rippling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne watched carefully. Maybe it is moving, he thought. Maybe there\u0027s an animal inside the fence, pushing against it, making it move. But that didn\u0027t seem quite right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was something else....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, lights came on inside the store. They shone through the barred windows, casting a geometric pattern of dark shadows across the open clearing, and onto the bushes by the tennis court. And for a moment - just a rnoment - Thorne saw that the bushes beside the tennis court were oddly shaped, and that they were actually two dinosaurs, seven feet tall, standing side by side, staring right at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir bodies seemed to be covered in a patchwork pattern of light and dark that made them blend in perfectly with leaves behind them, and ith the fence of the tennis court. Thorne was confused. Their concealment had been perfect - too perfect - until the lights from the store windows had shone out and caught them in the sudden bright glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne watched, holding his breath. And then he realized that the leafy light-and-dark pattern went only partway up their bodies, to mid-thorax. Above that, the animals had a kind of diamond-shaped crisscross pattern that matched the fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as Thorne stared, the complex patterns on their bodies faded, the animals turned a chalky white, and then a series of vertical striped shadows began to appear, which exactly matched the shadows cast by the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd before his eyes, the two dinosaurs disappeared from view again. Squinting, with concentrated effort, he could just barely distinguish the outlines of their bodies. He would never have been able to see them at all, had he not already known they were there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were chameleons. But with a power of mimicry unlike any chameleon Thorne had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, he backed away into the shed, moving deeper into darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God!\" Levine exclaimed, staring out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Harding said \"But I had to turn on the lights. That boy needs help. I can\u0027t do it in the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine did not answer her. He was staring out the window, trying to comprehend what he had just seen. He now realized what he had glimpsed the day Diego was killed. That brief momentary sense that something was wrong. Levine now knew what it was. But it was quite beyond anything that was known among terrestrial animals and -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" she said, standing alongside him at the window. \"Is it Thorne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Levine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared out through the bars. \"At the bushes? What7 What am I supposed to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched for a moment longer, then shook her head. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Start at the bottom of the bushes,\" Levine told her. \"Then let your eyes move up very slowly....Just look...and you\u0027ll see the outline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard her sigh. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then turn out the lights again,\" he said. \"And you\u0027ll see,\" She turned the lights out, and for a moment Levine saw the two animals in sharp relief, their bodies pale white with vertical stripes in the moonlight. Almost immediately, the pattern started to fade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarding came back, pushed in alongside him, and this time she saw the animals instantly. Just as Levine knew she would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit,\" she said. \"There are two of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Side by side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And...is the pattern fading?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s fading.\" As they watched, the striped pattern on their skins was replaced by the leafy pattern of the rhododendrons behind them. Once again, the two dinosaurs blended into invisibility. But such complex patterning implied that their epidermal layers were arranged in a manner similar to the chromatophores of marine invertebrates. The subtlety of shading, the rapidity of the changes all suggested -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarding frowned. \"What are they?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chameleons of unparalleled skill, obviously. Although I\u0027m not sure one is entirely justified in referring to them as chameleons, since technically chameleons have only the ability - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they?\" Sarah said impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I\u0027d say they\u0027re Carnotaurus sastrei. Type specimen\u0027s from Patagonia. Two meters in height, with distinctive heads - you notice the short, bulldog snouts, and the pair of large horns above the eyes? Almost like wings - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re carnivores?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course, they have the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Thorne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He went into that clump of bushes to the right, some time ago. I haven\u0027t seen him, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do?\" Levine said. \"I\u0027m not sure I follow you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to do something,\" she said, speaking slowly, as if he were a child. \"We have to help Thorne get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how,\" Levine said. \"Those animals must weigh five hundred pounds each. And there are two of them. I told him not to go out in the first place. But now...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarding frowned. Staring out, she said, \"Go turn the lights back on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d prefer to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go turn the lights back on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine got up irritably. He had been relishing his remarkable discovery, a truly unanticipated feature of dinosaurs - although not, of course, entirely without precedent among related vertebrates - and now this little muscle-bound female was barking orders at him. Levine was offended. After all, she was riot much of a scientist. She was a naturalist. A field devoid of theory. One of those people who poked around in animal crap and imagined they were doing original research. A nice outdoor life, is all it amounted to. It wasn\u0027t science by any stretch -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On!\" Harding shouted, looking out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flicked the lights on, and started to head back to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHastily, he went back and turned them off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned them on again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up from the window, and crossed the room. ,They didn t like that,\" she said. \"It bothered them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s probably a refractory period - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I think so. Here. Open these.\" She scooped up a handful of flashlights from one of the shelves, handed them to him, then went and got batteries from an adjacent wire rack. \"I hope these still work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\" Levine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We,\" she said, grimly. \"We.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorne stood in the darkness of the shed, staring outward through the open doors. Someone had been turning the lights on and off inside the store. Then, for a while they remained on. But now suddenly they went off again. The area in front of the shed was lit only by moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard movement, a soft rustling. He heard the breathing again. And then he saw the two dinosaurs, walking upright with stiff tails. Their skin patterns seemed to shift as they walked, and it was difficult to follow them, but they were moving toward the shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey arrived at the entrance, their bodies silhouetted against the moonlight beyond, their outlines finally clear. They looked like small tyrannosaurs, except they had protuberances above the eyes, and they had very small, stubby forelimbs. The carnivores ducked their squarish heads down, and looked into the shed cautiously. Snorting, sniffing. Their tails swinging slowly behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were really too big to come inside, and for a moment he hoped that they would not. Then the first of them lowered its head, growled, and stepped through the entrance. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lost-world-jurassic-park-2/page-15.html","bookId":1710,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:13 AM"}
