It would seem from the teaching of this parable that we have something to do with the soil. The fruitful seed fell into \"good and honest hearts.\" (Lk.8:15) I suppose the shallow people are the soil without much earth--those who have no real purpose, are moved by a tender appeal, a good sermon, a pathetic melody, and at first it looks as if they would amount to something; but not much earth--no depth, no deep, honest purpose, no earnest desire to know duty in order to do it. Let us look after the soil of our hearts.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen a Roman soldier was told by his guide that if he insisted on taking a certain journey it would probably be fatal, he answered, \"It is necessary for me to go; it is not necessary for me to live.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis was depth. When we are convicted something like that we shall come to something. The shallow nature lives in its impulses, its impressions, its intuitions, its instincts, and very largely its surroundings. The profound character looks beyond all these, and moves steadily on, sailing past all storms and clouds into the clear sunshine which is always on the other side, and waiting for the afterwards which always brings the reversion of sorrow, seeming defeat and failure. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen God has deepened us, then He can give us His deeper truths, His profoundest secrets, and His mightier trusts.
