They spent two days exploring the central business district and a day at Lake Pontchartrain. Lara found two sites she liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA day after they returned, Keller walked into Lara\u0027s office. \"We had some bad luck on the Atlanta project,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone beat us to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara looked at him, surprised. \"How could they? Those properties weren\u0027t even on the market.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Word must have leaked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara shrugged. \"I guess you can\u0027t win them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat afternoon Keller had more bad news. \"We lost the Lake Pontchartrain deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following week they flew to Seattle and explored Mercer Island and Kirkland. There was one site that interested Lara, and when they returned to New York, she said to Keller, \"Let\u0027s go after it. I think it could be a money-maker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a meeting the next day Lara asked, \"Did you put in the bid on Kirkland?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller shook his head. \"Someone got there ahead of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was thoughtful. \"Oh. Howard, see if you can find out who\u0027s jumping the gun on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him less than twenty-four hours. \"Steve Murchison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he get all those deals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So someone in this office has a big mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was grim. The next morning she hired a detective agency to find the culprit. They had no success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As far as we can tell, all your employees are clean, Miss Cameron. None of the offices is bugged, and your phones haven\u0027t been tapped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had reached a dead end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe they were just coincidences, Lara thought. She did not believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sixty-eight-story residential tower in Queens was half completed, and Lara had invited the bankers to come and inspect its progress. The higher the number of floors, the more expensive the unit. Lara\u0027s sixty-eight stories had only fifty-seven actual floors. It was a trick she had learned from Paul Martin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody does it,\" Paul had laughed. \"All you do is change the floor numbers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very simple. Your first bank of elevators is from the lobby to the twenty-fourth floor. The second bank of elevators is from the thirty-fourth floor to the sixty-eighth. It\u0027s done all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the unions, the construction jobs had half a dozen phantoms on salary - people who did not exist. There was a Director of Safety Practices, the Coordinator of Construction, the Supervisor of Materials, and others with impressive-sounding titles. In the beginning Lara had questioned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" Paul had told her. \"It\u0027s all part of the CDB - the cost of doing business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller had been living in a small apartment in Washington Square, and when Lara had visited him one evening, she had looked around the tiny apartment and said, \"This is a rattrap. You\u0027ve got to move out of here.\" At Lara\u0027s urging, he had moved into a condominium uptown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night Lara and Keller were working late, and when they finally finished, Lara said, \"You look exhausted. Why don\u0027t you go home and get some sleep, Howard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea,\" Keller yawned. \"See you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in late,\" Lara told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller got into his car and started driving home. He was thinking about a deal they had just closed and how well Lara had handled it. It was exciting working with her. Exciting and frustrating. Somehow, in the back of his mind, he kept hoping that a miracle would happen. / was blind not to have seen it before, Howard darling. I\u0027m not interested in Paul Martin or Philip Adler. It\u0027s you I\u0027ve loved all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFat chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Keller reached his apartment, he took out his key and put it in the lock. It did not fit. Puzzled, he tried again. Suddenly the door flew open from the inside, and a stranger was standing there. \"What the hell do you think you\u0027re doing?\" the man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller looked at him, bewildered. \"I live here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I...\" Realization suddenly hit him. \"I...I\u0027m sorry,\" he stammered, red-faced. \"I used to live here. I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was slammed in his face. Keller stood there, disconcerted. How could I have forgotten that I moved? I\u0027ve been working too hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was in the middle of a conference when her private phone rang. \"You\u0027ve been pretty busy lately, baby. I\u0027ve missed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been traveling a lot, Paul.\" She couldn\u0027t bring herself to say that she had missed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s have lunch today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara thought about all he had done for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that,\" she said. The last thing in the world she wanted to do was to hurt him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had lunch at Mr. Chow\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re looking great,\" Paul said. \"Whatever you\u0027ve been doing agrees with you. How\u0027s the Reno hotel coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s coming along beautifully,\" Lara said enthusiastically. She spent the next fifteen minutes describing how the work was progressing. \"We should be ready to open in two months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man and woman across the room were just leaving. The man\u0027s back was to Lara, but he looked familiar. When he turned for an instant, she caught a glimpse of his face. Steve Murchison. The woman with him looked familiar also. She stooped to pick up her purse, and Lara\u0027s heart skipped a beat. Gertrude Meeks, my secretary. \"Bingo,\" Lara said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is anything wrong?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Everything\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara went on describing the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lara returned from lunch, she sent for Keller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember the property in Phoenix we looked at a few months ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we turned it down. You said it was a dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve changed my mind.\" She pressed down the intercom. \"Gertrude, would you come in here, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGertrude Meeks came into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to dictate a memo,\" Lara said. \"To the Baron Brothers in Phoenix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGertrude started writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gentlemen, I have reconsidered the Scottsdale property and have decided to go ahead with it immediately. I think in time it is going to be my most valuable asset.\" Keller was staring at her. \"I\u0027ll be in touch with you regarding price in the next few days. Best regards. I\u0027ll sign it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Miss Cameron. Is that all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller watched Gertrude leave the room. He turned to Lara. \"Lara, what are you doing? We had that property analyzed. It\u0027s worthless! If you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down. We\u0027re not making a deal for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless I miss my guess, Steve Murchison will. I saw Gertrude having lunch with him today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller was staring at Lara. \"I\u0027ll be damned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to wait a couple of days and then call Baron and ask about the property.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later Keller came into Lara\u0027s office, grinning. \"You were right,\" he said. \"Murchison took the bait - hook, line, and sinker. He\u0027s now the proud owner of fifty acres of worthless land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara sent for Gertrude Meeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Miss Cameron?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re fired,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGertrude looked at her in surprise. \"Fired? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the company you keep. Go back to Steve Murchison and tell him I said so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGertrude\u0027s face lost its color. \"But I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all. I\u0027ll have you escorted out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt midnight Lara buzzed Max, her chauffeur. \"Bring the car around to the front,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car was there waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where would you like to go, Miss Cameron?\" Max asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drive around Manhattan. I want to see what I\u0027ve done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring at her. \"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to look at my buildings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drove around the city and stopped at the shopping mall, the housing center, and the skyscraper. There was Cameron Square, Cameron Plaza, Cameron Center, and the skeleton of Cameron Towers. Lara sat in the car, staring at each building, thinking about the people living there and working there. She had touched all their lives. I\u0027ve made this city better, Lara thought. I\u0027ve done everything I wanted to do. Then why am I restless? What is missing? But she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning Lara telephoned William Ellerbee, Philip\u0027s concert manager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Mr. Ellerbee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Miss Cameron. What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wondering where Philip Adler is playing this week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philip has a pretty heavy schedule. Tomorrow night he\u0027ll be in Amsterdam, then he goes on to Milan, Venice, and...do you want to know the rest of his...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. That\u0027s fine. I was just curious. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara walked into Keller\u0027s office. \"Howard, I have to go to Amsterdam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her in surprise. \"What do we have going on there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just an idea,\" Lara said evasively. \"I\u0027ll let you know if it checks out. Have them get the jet ready for me, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sent Bert to London on it, remember? I\u0027ll tell them to have it back here tomorrow, and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to leave today.\" There was an urgency in her that took her completely by surprise. \"I\u0027ll fly commercial.\" She returned to her office and said to Kathy, \"Get me a seat on the first flight to Amsterdam on KLM.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to be gone long?\" Keller asked. \"We have some meetings coming up that...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be back in a day or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to come with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Howard. Not this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I talked to a senator friend of mine in Washington. He thinks there\u0027s a chance they\u0027re going to pass a bill that will remove most of the tax incentives for building. If it passes, it\u0027s going to kill capital gains taxes and stop accelerated depreciation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be stupid,\" Lara said. \"It would cripple the real estate industry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. He\u0027s against the bill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot of people will be against it. It will never pass,\" Lara predicted. \"In the first place...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe private phone on the desk rang. Lara stared at it. It rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to answer it?\" Keller asked. Lara\u0027s mouth was dry. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Martin listened to the hollow ring a dozen times before he replaced the receiver. He sat there a long time thinking about Lara. It seemed to him that lately she had been less accessible, a little cooler. Could there be someone else? No. Paul Martin thought. She belongs to me. She\u0027ll always belong to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flight on KLM was pleasant. The first-class seats in the wide-bodied 747 were spacious and comfortable, and the cabin attendants were attentive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was too nervous to eat or drink anything. What am I doing? she wondered. I\u0027m going to Amsterdam uninvited, and he\u0027ll probably be too busy to even see me. Running after him is going to ruin whatever chance I might have had. Too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe checked in at the Grand Hotel on Oudezijds Voorburgwal 197, one of the most beautiful hotels in Amsterdam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a lovely suite for you, Miss Cameron,\" the clerk said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. I understand that Philip Adler is giving a recital this evening. Do you know where he would be playing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Miss Cameron. At the Concertgebouw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you arrange a ticket for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be my pleasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lara entered her suite, the telephone was ringing. It was Howard Keller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have a nice flight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d like to know that I\u0027ve spoken to the two banks about the Seventh Avenue deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was vibrant. \"They\u0027re jumping at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was elated. \"I told you! This is going to be a big one. I want you to start assembling a team of architects, builders - our construction group - the works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. I\u0027ll talk to you tomorrow.\" She replaced the receiver and thought about Howard Keller. He was so dear. I\u0027m so lucky. He\u0027s always there for me. I have to find someone wonderful for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip Adler was always nervous before playing. He had rehearsed with the orchestra in the morning, and had a light lunch, and then, to take his mind off the concert, had gone to see an English movie. As he watched the picture, his mind was filled with the music he was going to play that evening. He was unaware that he was drumming his fingers on the arm of his seat until the person next to him said, \"Would you mind stopping that awful sound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon,\" Philip said politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and left the theater and roamed the streets of Amsterdam. He visited the Rijksmuseum, and he strolled through the Botanical Gardens of the Free University, and window-shopped along the P.C. Hooftstraat. At four o\u0027clock he went back to his hotel to take a nap. He was unaware that Lara Cameron was in the suite directly above him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 7:00 P.M. Philip arrived at the artists\u0027 entrance of the Concertgebouw, the lovely old theater in the heart of Amsterdam. The lobby was already crowded with early arrivals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBackstage, Philip was in his dressing room, changing into tails. The director of the Concertgebouw bustled into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re completely sold out, Mr. Adler! And we had to turn away so many people. If it were possible for you to stay another day or two, I would...I know you are fully booked...I will talk to Mr. Ellerbee about your return here next year and perhaps...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip was not listening. His mind was focused on the recital that lay ahead. The director finally shrugged apologetically and bowed his way out. Philip played the music over and over in his mind. A page knocked at the dressing-room door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re ready for you onstage, Mr. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time. Philip rose to his feet. He held out his hands. They were trembling slightly. The nervousness before playing never went away. It was true of all the great pianists - Horowitz, Rubinstein, Serkin. Philip\u0027s stomach was churning, and his heart was pounding. Why do I put myself through this agony? he asked himself. But he knew the answer. He took one last look in the mirror, then stepped out of the dressing room, and walked through the long corridor, and started to descend the thirty-three steps that led onto the stage. There was a spotlight on him as he moved toward the piano. The applause grew thunderous. He sat down at the piano, and as if by magic, his nervousness disappeared. It was as though another person were taking his place, someone calm, and poised, and completely in charge. He began to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara, seated in the audience, felt a thrill as she watched Philip walk out on the stage. There was a presence about him that was mesmerizing. I am going to marry him, Lara thought. I know it. She sat back in her seat and let his playing wash over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe recital was a triumph, and afterward the greenroom was packed. Philip had long ago learned to divide the crowd invited to the greenroom into two groups: the fans and other musicians. The fans were always enthusiastic. If the performance was a success, the congratulations of the other musicians were cordial. If it was a failure, their congratulations were very cordial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip had many avid fans in Amsterdam, and on this particular evening the greenroom was crowded with them. He stood in the center of the room, smiling, signing autographs, and being patiently polite to a hundred strangers. Invariably someone would say, \"Do you remember me?\" And Philip would pretend to. \"Your face looks so familiar...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered the story of Sir Thomas Beecham, who had hit upon a device to conceal his bad memory. When someone asked, \"Do you remember me?\" the great conductor would reply, \"Of course, I do! How are you, and how is your father, and what is he doing?\" The device worked well until a concert in London when a young woman in the greenroom said, \"Your performance was wonderful, Maestro. Do you remember me?\" and Beecham gallantly replied, \"Of course, I do, my dear. How is your father, and what is he doing?\" The young woman said, \"Father is fine, thank you. And he\u0027s still king of England.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip was busily signing autographs, listening to the familiar phrases - \"You made Brahms come alive for me!\"...\"I can\u0027t tell you how moved I was!\"...\"I have all your albums\"...\"Would you sign an autograph for my mother too? She\u0027s your biggest fan...\" - when something made him look up. Lara was standing in the doorway, watching. His eyes widened in surprise. \"Excuse me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made his way over to her and took her hand. \"What a wonderful surprise! What are you doing in Amsterdam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCareful, Lara. \"I had some business to attend to here, and when I heard you were giving a recital, I had to come.\" That was innocent enough. \"You were wonderful, Philip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you...I...\" He stopped to sign another autograph. \"Look, if you\u0027re free for supper...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m free,\" Lara said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had supper at the Bali restaurant on Leidsestraat. As they entered the restaurant, the patrons rose and applauded. In the United States, Lara thought, the excitement would have been for me. But she felt a warm glow, simply being at Philip\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a great honor to have you with us, Mr. Adler,\" the maitre d\u0027 said as he led them to their table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they were being seated, Lara looked around at all the people staring admiringly at Philip. \"They really love you, don\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"It\u0027s the music they love. I\u0027m just the messenger. I learned that a long time ago. When I was very young and perhaps a little arrogant, I gave a concert, and when I had finished my solo, there was tremendous applause, and I was bowing to the audience and smugly smiling at them, and the conductor turned to the audience and held up the score over his head to remind everyone that they were really applauding Mozart. It\u0027s a lesson I\u0027ve never forgotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you ever get tired of playing the same music over and over, night after night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, because no two recitals are the same. The music may be the same, but the conductor is different, and the orchestra is different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ordered a rijsttafel dinner, and Philip said, \"We try to make each recital perfect, but there\u0027s no such thing as a completely successful one because we\u0027re dealing with music that is always better than we are. We have to rethink the music each time in order to recreate the sound of the composer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re never satisfied?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never. Each composer has his own distinctive sound. Whether it\u0027s Debussy, Brahms, Haydn, Beethoven...our goal is to capture that particular sound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupper arrived. The rijsttafel was an Indonesian feast, consisting of twenty-one courses, including a variety of meats, fish, chicken, noodles, and two desserts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can anyone eat all this?\" Lara laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Dutch have hearty appetites.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip found it difficult to take his eyes off Lara. He found himself ridiculously pleased that she was there. He had been involved with more than his share of beautiful women, but Lara was like no one he had ever known. She was strong and yet very feminine and totally unselfconscious about her beauty. He liked her throaty, sexy voice. In fact, I like everything about her, Philip admitted to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you go from here?\" Lara was asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow I\u0027ll be in Milan. Then Venice and Vienna, Paris and London, and finally New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds so romantic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip laughed. \"I\u0027m not sure romantic is the word I would choose. We\u0027re talking about iffy airline schedules, strange hotels, and eating out in restaurants every night. I don\u0027t really mind because the act of playing is so wonderful. It\u0027s the \u0027say cheese\u0027 syndrome that I hate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Being put on exhibit all the time, smiling at people you care nothing about, living your life in a world of strangers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what that\u0027s like,\" Lara said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they were finishing supper, Philip said, \"Look, I\u0027m always keyed up after a concert. Would you care to take a ride on the canal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey boarded a canalbus that cruised the Amstel. There was no moon, but the city was alive with thousands of sparkling lights. The canal trip was an enchantment. A loudspeaker poured out information in four languages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are now passing centuries-old merchants\u0027 houses with their richly decorated gables. Ahead are ancient church towers. There are twelve hundred bridges on the canals, all in the shade of magnificent avenues of elm trees...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed the Smalste Huis - the narrowest house in Amsterdam - which was only as wide as the front door, and the Westerkerk with the crown of the Hapsburg emperor Maximilian, and they went under the wooden lift bridge over the Amstel and the Magere Brug - the skinny bridge - and passed scores of houseboats that served as home for hundreds of families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is such a beautiful city,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve never been here before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re here on business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara took a deep breath. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her puzzled. \"I thought you said...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to Amsterdam to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a sudden frisson of pleasure. \"I...I\u0027m very flattered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I have another confession to make. I told you I was interested in classical music. That\u0027s not true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile touched the corner of Philip\u0027s lips. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara looked at him in surprise. \"You know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor Meyers is an old friend of mine,\" he said gently. \"He called to tell me that he was giving you a crash course on Philip Adler. He was concerned that you might have designs on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara said softly, \"He was right. Are you involved with anyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean seriously?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was suddenly embarrassed. \"If you\u0027re not interested, I\u0027ll leave and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand in his. \"Let\u0027s get off at the next stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they arrived back at the hotel, there were a dozen messages from Howard Keller. Lara put them in her purse, unread. At this moment nothing else in her life seemed important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your room or mine?\" Philip asked lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a burning urgency in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to Lara that she had waited all her life for this moment. This was what she had been missing. She had found the stranger she was in love with. They reached Philip\u0027s room, and there was an urgency in both of them. Philip took her in his arms and kissed her softly and tenderly, exploring, and Lara murmured, \"Oh, my God,\" and they began to undress each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence of the room was broken by a sudden clap of thunder outside. Slowly, gray clouds in the sky spread their skirts open, wider and wider, and soft rain began to fall. It started quietly and gently, caressing the warm air erotically, licking at the sides of buildings, sucking at the soft grass, kissing all the dark corners of the night. It was a hot rain, wanton and sensuous, sliding down slowly, slowly, until the tempo began to increase and it changed to a driving, pounding storm, fierce and demanding, an orgiastic beat in a steady, savage rhythm, plunging down harder and harder, moving faster and faster until it finally exploded in a burst of thunder. Suddenly, as quickly as it had started, it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara and Philip lay in each other\u0027s arms, spent. Philip held Lara close, and he could feel the beating of her heart. He thought of a line he had once heard in a movie. \"Did the earth move for you?\" By God, it did, Philip thought. If she were music, she would be Chopin\u0027s Barcarolle or Schumann\u0027s Fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel the soft contours of her body pressed against him, and he began to get aroused again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philip...\" Her voice was husky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like me to go with you to Milan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found himself grinning. \"Oh, my God, yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Lara murmured. She leaned over him, and her soft hair started to trail down his lean, hard body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt began to rain again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lara finally returned to her room, she telephoned Keller. \"Did I wake you up, Howard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" His voice was groggy. \"I\u0027m always up at four in the morning. What\u0027s going on there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara was bursting to tell him, but she said, \"Nothing. I\u0027m leaving for Milan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? We aren\u0027t doing anything in Milan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes, we are, Lara thought happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see my messages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had forgotten to look at them. Guiltily, she said, \"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been hearing rumors about the casino.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There have been some complaints about the bidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it. If there\u0027s any problem, Paul Martin will take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to send the plane to Milan. Have the pilots wait for me there. I\u0027ll get in touch with them at the airport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go back to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt four o\u0027clock in the morning, Paul Martin was wide-awake. He had left several messages on Lara\u0027s private answering machine at her apartment, but none of his calls had been returned. In the past, she had always let him know when she was going to be away. Something was happening. What was she up to? \"Be careful, my darling,\" he whispered. \"Be very careful.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-shine-down/page-22.html","bookId":2364,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM"}
