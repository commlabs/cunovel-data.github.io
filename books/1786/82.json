Clearly he was delighted by his new acquisition, and even more by the fact that Miss Marks seemed to want it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me out!\" Harrow cried in a smothered voice, and there was a violent pounding from inside the wardrobe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That blasted weasel,\" Miss Marks muttered. \"This is a game to him. He\u0027ll spend hours teasing us with that vial and keeping it just out of reach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring at the ferret, Leo sat on the carpet and relaxed his voice. \"Come here, you flea-ridden hair wad. You\u0027ll have all the sugar biscuits you want, if you\u0027ll give your new toy to me.\" He whistled softly and clicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the blandishments did not work. Dodger merely regarded him with bright eyes and stayed at the threshold, clutching the vial in his tiny paws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give him one of your garters,\" Leo said, still staring at the ferret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\" Miss Marks asked frostily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard me. Take off a garter and offer it to him as a trade. Otherwise we\u0027ll be chasing this damned animal all through the house. And I doubt Rohan will appreciate the delay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe governess gave Leo a long-suffering glance. \"Only for Mr. Rohan\u0027s sake would I consent to this. Turn your back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake, Marks, do you think anyone really wants a glance at those dried-up matchsticks you call legs?\" But Leo complied, facing the opposite direction. He heard a great deal of rustling as Miss Marks sat on a bedroom chair and lifted her skirts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt just so happened that Leo was positioned near a full-length looking glass, the oval cheval style that tilted up or down to adjust one\u0027s reflection. And he had an excellent view of Miss Marks in the chair. And the oddest thing happened-he got a flash of an astonishingly pretty leg. He blinked in bemusement, and then the skirts were dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" Miss Marks said gruffly, and tossed it in Leo\u0027s direction. Turning, he managed to catch it in midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodger surveyed them both with beady-eyed interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo twirled the garter enticingly on his finger. \"Have a look, Dodger. Blue silk with lace trim. Do all governesses anchor their stockings in such a delightful fashion? Perhaps those rumors about your unseemly past are true, Marks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head, my lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDodger\u0027s little head bobbed as it followed every movement of the garter. Fitting the vial in his mouth, the ferret carried it like a miniature dog, loping up to Leo with maddening slowness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a trade, old fellow,\" Leo told him. \"You can\u0027t have something for nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully Dodger set down the vial and reached for the garter. Leo simultaneously gave him the frilly circlet and snatched the vial. It was half-filled with a fine dull green powder. He stared down at it intently, rolling it in his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Marks was at his side in an instant, crouching on her hands and knees. \"Is it labeled?\" she asked breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Damn it all.\" Leo was gripped with volcanic fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me have it,\" Miss Marks said, prying the vial from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo jumped to his feet immediately, hurling himself at the wardrobe. He slammed it with both his fists. \"Damn you, Harrow, what is it? What is this stuff? Tell me, or you\u0027ll stay in there until you rot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was.nothing but silence from the wardrobe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By God, I\u0027m going to-,\" Leo began, but Miss Marks interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s digitalin powder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo threw her a distracted glance. She had opened the vial and was sniffing it cautiously. \"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My grandmother used to take it for her heart. The scent is like tea, and the color is unmistakable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the antidote?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea,\" Miss Marks said, looking more distressed by the moment. \"But it\u0027s a powerful substance. A large dose could very well stop a man\u0027s heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo turned back to the wardrobe. \" Harrow,\" he bit out, \"if you want to live, you\u0027ll tell me the antidote now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me out first,\" came the muffled reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No negotiating! Tell me what counteracts the poison, damn you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leo?\" A new voice entered the fray. He turned swiftly to see Amelia, Win, and Beatrix at the threshold. They were staring at him as if he\u0027d gone mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia spoke with admirable composure. \"I have two questions, Leo: Why did you send for me, and why are you having an argument with the wardrobe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Harrow \u0027s in there,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression changed. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to make him tell me how to counteract an overdose of digitalin powder.\" He glared vengefully at the wardrobe. \"And I\u0027ll kill him if he doesn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s taken an overdose?\" Amelia demanded, her face draining of color. \"Is someone ill? Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was meant for Merripen,\" Leo said in a low voice, reaching out to steady her before he continued. \"But Cam took it by mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strangled cry escaped her. \"Oh God. Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Gypsy campsite. Merripen\u0027s with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears sprang to Amelia\u0027s eyes. \"I must go to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t do him any good without the antidote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin brushed by them, striding to the bedside table. Moving with swift deliberation, she picked up an oil lamp and a tin matchbox, and brought them to the wardrobe. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-82.html","bookId":1786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:00 PM"}
