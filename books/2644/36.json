She never shed a single tear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruth was that Llorente\u0027s wound was a wee bit worse. The bullet had torn past his side leaving a sizable gash. Court himself had collected a good-sized shard of glass, and since it was wedged into his calf, sitting seemed much preferable to walking, even if he had to do it with Llorente. Hugh had found the two of them propped up against separate walls, drinking whisky and sniping at each other. He\u0027d sent Liam to fetch a physician, then stood guard as they waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She really dinna cry?\" Hugh asked as he pressed his shirt to the ragged slashes on his face caused by the splintering rock. Though successful, Hugh had returned, shaking his head and mumbling, \"Slate. Who knew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt sounded proud when he said, \"Bravest lass I\u0027ve ever known.\" Of course he was proud, but he didn\u0027t get to be. She wasn\u0027t his any longer. His head fell back against the wall, and he stared at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God damn it, Court\" - Hugh kicked his good leg - \"I\u0027ll no\u0027 tell you again to keep pressure on your shoulder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you do that?\" Llorente bit out the question for the fifteenth time. \"Make him shoot me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured my aim was better than his. Looks about right to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He bloody shot me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you had killed the others we would no\u0027 be in this situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That one had a gaping hole in his stomach. How did he live through that?\" Llorente set his bottle down as if he\u0027d just comprehended something. \"You\u0027ve now done everything you bloody could to wreck my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt swigged, then said, \"I swear to you, man, Anna is no\u0027 the one who should wear skirts in this family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Llorente appeared furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh, tell him what Pascal would\u0027ve done if I had no\u0027 shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He would\u0027ve pulled the trigger soon. He was baiting you, and his aim would\u0027ve been colder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear what he said about Olivia?\" Llorente\u0027s words were a touch slurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Court admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d wondered about her loyalties, could never quite see why she\u0027d do this to her father.\" He added to himself, \"She\u0027d been loyal all along to her mother,\" then frowned. \"Think I love her.\" He winced when he tried to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt shook his head at Llorente\u0027s wound. That one truly needed to get sewn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear Niall and the others yelling and laughing in the distance as the shots became fewer and fewer. They were going to tear apart this place tonight looking for Pascal\u0027s stash of goods and coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt figured they liked playing the heroes because they\u0027d decided almost to a man to restore everything to its rightful owners before Andorra\u0027s typically harsh winter came to these people. Lucrative bounties made it easy to be a hero, he supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to contact Ethan now,\" Llorente said. \"Ask him to send them home with escorts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother said to leave it to him - not to you - when the time came. Now that we\u0027ve won, is there any reason I shouldn\u0027t be bringing my sister and Olivia here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Llorente and Hugh waited for his answer. \"No. No reason no\u0027 to. Ethan will make sure they\u0027re safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll ride before then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt felt a muscle in his cheek twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach hour that had passed on the way home was agony, but at least during the trip Annal¨ªa had stopped throwing up everything she ate. With every mile closer in that coach, she and Olivia had bickered, even after Olivia had said, \"As far as spoiled heiresses go, you\u0027re not too bad,\" and Annal¨ªa had responded, \"As far as conniving witches go, I\u0027ve met worse.\" But truly, if they hadn\u0027t bickered, what else would there have been to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd though Olivia seemed unaffected by the news of her father\u0027s death, Annal¨ªa had kept her occupied in any event. \"I keep replaying the scene we\u0027ll have when we ride into the courtyard,\" Annal¨ªa had told her. \"I\u0027ll rush to MacCarrick. Aleix will push you into the lake. It will be perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep up your teasing. I don\u0027t care,\" Olivia had responded. \"But after I tell Aleix how nasty you\u0027ve been to me, what incentive will he have to be civil to your unsuitable mate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d had a point, but fortunately she suspected Olivia wouldn\u0027t tell Aleix anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, today, they were finally here. When the coach stopped and Ethan\u0027s guards deemed it safe to clear room, Annal¨ªa tumbled out and ran to the house. She tripped in breathless and hugged Aleix, who\u0027d come to greet them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled down at her and then at Olivia when she entered. A peculiar smile for Olivia. A loving smile? She\u0027d never really seen them together. Oh, Olivia did not just blush?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnal¨ªa waved her hand in front of him. \"Where\u0027s MacCarrick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe faced her, his expression turning grave. \"Annal¨ªa, he\u0027s...well, he\u0027s ridden from here. He went north, I believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wheezing sound passed her lips as she sank down onto an ottoman. \"I don\u0027t understand. Why would he do that? Didn\u0027t he know we were returning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia walked up behind her. \"Did he say anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wished Annal¨ªa well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wished me well?\" Her voice was strident. She hadn\u0027t stopped throwing up. She believed she would right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not exactly a man of many words, as you know. Annal¨ªa, he and I decided it was for the best. He wasn\u0027t the right man for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrowed. \"You and he decided? The two of you decided my future? Coach-and-six!\" she cried as she shot to her feet. \"You...You coach-and-sixed me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her as though she\u0027d lost her mind. She felt the blood leaving her face, and her legs buckled, forcing her right back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAleix rushed to her and grabbed her shoulders. \"What\u0027s wrong with you? What did he do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dimly saw a hand snake from behind her to slap his sharply until he released her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annal¨ªa, this is for the best. He\u0027s from a completely foreign culture and doesn\u0027t have wealth to keep you as you should live. And I don\u0027t know if he told you or not, but he can\u0027t father children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up at him, tears welling. \"I beg to differ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Court, are you all right?\" Hugh asked with a snap of his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If your horse had no\u0027 sidestepped, that limb back there would\u0027ve taken your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt jerked around for a look. He\u0027d never seen it. He\u0027d been lost in thought wondering where she was right now, what she was doing, and knowing she was happier than he was. She had to be. He faced front again, surprised they\u0027d already arrived at the drive for Groot\u0027s - though he shouldn\u0027t be surprised. They\u0027d made good time since Hugh had led them off the main road to follow a shorter horse trail. Hugh hadn\u0027t taken any chances that Court might pass Annal¨ªa on her journey home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinkin\u0027 about her,\" Court muttered. \"Miss her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I miss her so bad it\u0027s like...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grief?\" Hugh asked, as he swung from the saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Court, I wish I could tell you it\u0027ll get better.\" Hugh gave him a weary look. \"But it does no\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this wouldn\u0027t get better, if everything continued to remind him of her...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the pretty Andorran?\" Groot asked the minute they entered the posting house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Safe at home,\" Hugh answered for him when Court could only scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good to know,\" he said absently as his wife called him to help with guests. They had another full house. Court sank down on a bench because his leg was paining him, and thought to himself that the seat wasn\u0027t too uncomfortable. He\u0027d sleep right here before he took the room he and Anna had shared before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh crossed to the bar and helped himself to pouring two whiskies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, Hugh, got a missive for you,\" Groot said, leaning in to add, \"From Weyland himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh\u0027s brows drew together and the bottle slammed to the bartop. \"Now, Groot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Hugh ripped open and scanned the message, he went rigid and his face grew tight, the lines there deepening. The new jagged gashes on his forehead and the side of his face twisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is it?\" Court had witnessed Hugh once in a killing fury, and it was a memory he would never forget. The savage look on Hugh\u0027s face right now was so far beyond that - it was chilling. Court rose, then limped over to work the note from a hand clenched so hard it was white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacCarrick,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane\u0027s life is in grave danger. Come quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeyland\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We ride now,\" Court said as he turned for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Court.\" When he looked back, Hugh shook his head hard. \"I go alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if Court didn\u0027t understand what he was capable of. \"I owe you a debt greater than I think you comprehend. And I\u0027ll be payin\u0027 it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God damn it, Court, no. You\u0027re injured, and I\u0027ll need two horses, which means yours as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLess than a minute later, Court stood outside with the wind swirling around him as he watched Hugh ride off at a reckless clip. Court was confident he\u0027d reach her in time, and could almost pity whatever force had jeopardized Hugh\u0027s Jane. In fact, his only concern was if Hugh would be strong enough to resist his feelings for her. For Hugh\u0027s sake he hoped the shameless chit had outgrown her teasing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt ran a hand over the back of his neck, considering his own situation. Damn it, Hugh had been all that had gotten him out of Andorra. If his brother hadn\u0027t been there to warn and rail and commiserate with him, Court doubted he could\u0027ve left. Now the temptation to return and find her was nearly overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched the setting sun through a veil of darting leaves, but everything was dead to him, the colors muted. He had no plans, had no idea what he would do. He could go east with the others and ride for Otto or head north for home. He could go south....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna was better off without him. Established. But was she happy? Or was she as bloody miserable and bad off as he? Was she dreading her trip to Castile?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d given his oath to Llorente not to see her. Vowed not even to go near her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Llorente had proven himself a decent man. He\u0027d presented Hugh with a fine steed for his help. To Court he\u0027d offered a handshake, which was \"much, much harder to part with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn return Court again had given his word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh and Ethan had accepted their fates. But Court had dared to defy it for a time, and that was the only time in his life truly worth living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of the ten lines that had been seared into his mind the first day he\u0027d seen the Leabhar, and narrowed his eyes. As the wind picked up again, rattling the trees, he turned to the south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt had a feeling he\u0027d given Llorente his word as a gentleman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was bloody convenient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutumn had arrived here on the mountain, and as regular as a clock, the meadow turned indigo with blooms. Annal¨ªa sank into the flowers to watch the sun go down - and to get away from Aleix and Olivia as they vainly tried to hide their feelings for each other. Annal¨ªa wanted to shout at them that she was enceinte, not stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe plucked a bloom, then pulled the binding from her hair. Why not let it flow free? Would people talk? The way she was growing, in another month they\u0027d have much more to talk about....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to the news of her condition, Aleix had wanted to kill the Highlander or drag him back here and \"force him\" to marry her. Another dismaying option he\u0027d talked about was going to the family in Castile. \"Should I take her there?\" he\u0027d asked Olivia. Asked Olivia!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnal¨ªa answered again and again, \"I don\u0027t want to marry anyone you\u0027d have to force to the altar or anyone sight unseen.\" Besides the fact that she was still miserably in love with MacCarrick, Annal¨ªa refused to go to Castile, the very image of her mother, carrying a bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia\u0027s solution? Do nothing until they found MacCarrick. \"His mother will tell him soon enough that Annal¨ªa is pregnant. He\u0027ll know the book is wrong, and then he will find her wherever she may be. If she is wed, he will kill the unfortunate groom for touching her and collect her regardless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet it could be months before he returns to London or receives any message from us,\" Aleix had pointed out. \"Years, even, if he rejoins his men to the east. Her child will be a bastard in seven months if we don\u0027t get her married!\" But fortunately, he\u0027d taken her advice. Olivia usually did give good advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince they\u0027d arrived home, Olivia had settled in here, which wasn\u0027t that difficult since the people at the ranch were grateful to her for freeing Aleix. Even Vitale liked her. Annal¨ªa could only guess that he sensed a hardness in her, a fellow survivor, and respected her....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s getting chilly,\" Aleix said from behind her as he pulled a shawl over her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore long, the snow would come, sealing them in from the rest of the world as though in a cocoon. \"I just want to watch the sun go down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guards don\u0027t like you out after dark.\" Aleix had hired the men Ethan sent down, as they\u0027d planned, until everything was settled in their country and around. She rarely saw them. Mostly they stayed at the foot of the mountain at the narrow passage to the plateaus. \"How are you doing?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to answer lightly. \"Besides being unmarried, with child, and abandoned, I\u0027m far too splendid.\" She\u0027d merely accomplished sullen, and sighed. \"I believe I\u0027ve topped even Mother\u0027s...peccadilloes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean by that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her affairs.\" She waved her hand as if she didn\u0027t care. \"Everyone always said I looked just like her, that I was just like her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Affairs?\" he choked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe faced him with a frown. \"I\u0027ve heard the rumors. I know she abandoned her family because of...passion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think that\u0027s why Mother wasn\u0027t here?\" he asked, his voice incredulous. \"She had an affair with a man - a good man named Nicol¨¢s Beltr¨¢n - whom she\u0027d been in love with her entire life.\" When she shook her head in confusion, he continued, \"They were caught eloping, and the family sent her away. It would\u0027ve been as if someone had forced Mariette away from me the night before our wedding to marry an older stranger in exile. Mariette would\u0027ve wanted me to come for her and nothing would\u0027ve stopped me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what took him so long?\" she asked, becoming completely lost in the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the family was through with him, he was penniless and in ill health. He had no idea where she\u0027d been taken, and it took him years to find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a bitter smile. \"Yes, but when he did, she left me, her own daughter, for him. It didn\u0027t affect you as it did me. You were grown, but I was devastated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annal¨ªa, she didn\u0027t go voluntarily. When Llorente found them together, he disowned her, forbidding her to come near you. Beltr¨¢n took her to France, where she wrote daily to Llorente, begging him to let her see you. She journeyed here again and again, but he always intercepted her. She didn\u0027t stop trying until she died, a year later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B-But I always thought she\u0027d left me for a man. I thought she chose him over her own family. That she\u0027d never looked back and had crushed Father with her indifference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At Mother\u0027s funeral, I talked to Beltr¨¢n. She had been telling him she would never leave her children when Llorente found them together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnal¨ªa rose to pace. \"That bastard! How could Father keep my mother from me? How could he let me think she had many lovers? Aleix, he warned me that I would be like that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Though I make no excuses for him, I know he was devastated because he\u0027d believed she\u0027d grown to love him. Annal¨ªa, I never suspected Llorente would poison your thoughts like that or I\u0027d have taken you away myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she paced faster, he said, \"We should discuss this later. Once you\u0027re feeling better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve waited sixteen years for this! She\u0027d told Beltr¨¢n no?\" She was still shaking her head, disbelieving that everything she\u0027d known was a lie. \"She didn\u0027t leave me of her own will?\" She took her necklace between her thumb and forefinger and felt the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was well old enough then to see that no mother could love a daughter more....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sank down and when the tears fell, she did nothing to stop them. \"I wasn\u0027t at her funeral! I never put flowers on her grave.\" She leveled a watery glare at him. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never knew.\" He appeared dumbfounded. \"You were so young when this happened, and since you never asked me about her, I thought you scarcely remembered her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must go to her grave. I must give her the respect I never have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I can\u0027t leave until things settle here. But we\u0027ll see how you feel after the baby comes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiped at her eyes. \"I\u0027d always thought about going, but I was so angry and so afraid that I would do something like she did. Or what I thought she did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother was a good woman with a kind heart. And you are just like her. I see it more every day. Tomorrow afternoon, when I get back from the council meeting in the village, I\u0027ll tell you everything I know about her, but you need to come in now. You\u0027re to be a mother now, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe exhaled a faltering breath. \"Aleix, what am I going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to have a child that will be loved. We take care of our own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what? Will I grow old here on the mountain waiting for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annal¨ªa, let\u0027s get through one thing at a time. All I know is that these choices are yours. And that I won\u0027t repeat history and try to marry you off to someone you don\u0027t love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for saying that,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you need to concentrate on being healthy. On caring for your new one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose and offered her a hand, but she said, \"Just a minute or two longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe patted her head, then turned for the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was alone, and the last light of the day was mirrored in the lake, she rubbed her barely rounding belly, frowning. \"My new one,\" she said aloud. Mine, she thought. And new. She\u0027d been so busy feeling sorry for herself and thinking of her condition as though she were ill, as though it were lamentable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that she knew her mother had loved her, had never wanted to leave her, Annal¨ªa saw everything differently, as though she\u0027d been looking through a filmy glass that had just been smashed away. She could be a good mother. She would be a good mother and would love as apparently Elisabet had. \"I\u0027m having a baby,\" she whispered as the full truth struck her for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Highlander couldn\u0027t take part in this because he was off warring for years, or if his mistaken beliefs were so strong that he ignored what was in his heart, then so be it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t be in their lives. And it would be his loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause she and her baby were going to have a glorious time of it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1/page-36.html","bookId":2644,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM"}
