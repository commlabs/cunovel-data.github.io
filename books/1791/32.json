She\u0027d finished her task, she told herself. It was over now, finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimbo and Matthew were waiting for her in the hallway. Jimbo handed her the farewell gift she\u0027d asked Harry to have him fetch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be going with you, won\u0027t we?\" Matthew asked, his voice a low whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade nodded. \"I\u0027ll meet you out back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get Caine\u0027s horses ready for the ride,\" Jimbo whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A man can get himself hung for stealing a horse,\" Matthew interjected. His wide grin indicated he thought that was quite all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine won\u0027t tell anyone,\" Jimbo argued. He took hold of Jade\u0027s satchel and started after his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a shame, that. How we ever going to keep up appearances if no one . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sentence faded away as he turned the corner. Jade immediately went to Caine\u0027s bedroom. She placed the long-stemmed white rose on his coverlet. \"I am Pagan,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was done. She turned to leave, then spotted Caine\u0027s black robe draped over the back of a chair near\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe window. On impulse she folded the garment and tucked it under her arm. His scent was on the robe, faint, but there still, and she wanted something to hold during the nights ahead, during the dark nightmares, to comfort her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Caine and Nathan thought Jade was resting in her room. Caine had wanted to chase after her, but Nathan convinced him that his sister needed time alone to calm her temper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might not have noticed yet, Caine, but Jade isn\u0027t one to take orders easily,\" Nathan explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Caine had more than noticed this, he didn\u0027t bother to comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe talk then turned to the problems at hand. Harry was dragged away from his inventory to add his suggestions. Jade\u0027s uncle had a quick mind. Caine watched him closely and came to a remarkable conclusion. Harry was civilized. He naturally kept that discovery to himself, for he guessed Harry\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould take grave exception to being confronted with the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Harry did grumble about the fact that he was going to have to burn a ship. \"It\u0027s a waste of good timber,\" he muttered. \"Still, it could be worse. I might have to be burning my lovely Emerald,\" he added. \"Aye, it could be worse. I\u0027d just as soon put a stake through me heart than damage my baby\u0027s ship. The Emerald\u0027s been home to Jade and me all these many years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Caine could comment on Harry\u0027s remarks, the uncle surprised him by adding that he was in full agreement that his baby get out of her present line of work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good two hours passed before their plans were set to everyone\u0027s satisfaction. Harry strolled back into the dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s bent on eating you out of house and home,\" Nathan drawled out. \"He\u0027ll steal you blind, too,\" he added with a grin. \"Harry likes to keep up appearances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can have whatever he wants,\" Caine returned. \"Jade\u0027s had quite enough time to calm her temper, Nathan. It\u0027s high time your sister and I had our talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you lecture her, you\u0027ll only . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to lecture her,\" Caine replied. \"I\u0027m simply going to tell her what my expectations are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like a lecture to me,\" Nathan drawled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Nathan and Caine walked into the foyer just as the Duchess was coming down the winding staircase. Both men stopped to watch her. Caine\u0027s stepmother was smiling, but also dabbing at the corners of her eyes with her lace handkerchief. She\u0027d obviously had quite a good cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGweneth almost lost her balance when she spotted Nathan. She grasped the banister and let out a soft gasp of surprise. She quickly regained her composure, however, and continued down the steps. When\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe reached the foyer, she moved to Caine\u0027s side. \"Is he the pirate friend of Colin\u0027s?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan heard her. \"I\u0027m not the pirate, Pagan, madam, but I am a friend of your son\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan assumed his voice had been a little too harsh for her liking when she grabbed hold of Caine\u0027s arm and moved closer to his side. Her dark brown eyes widened, too, but she valiantly held her smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look very like a pirate,\" she announced. She adjusted the folds of her pink gown as she waited for his reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen many, madam?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ve never seen a pirate,\" she confessed. \"Though this gentleman certainly fits the picture of one in my mind. I believe it\u0027s because of the length of his hair,\" she explained after turning back to look at Nathan. \"And the scar on your arm, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s also covered with blood,\" Caine drawled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, too,\" his stepmother admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d meant the remark as a jest, but her expression had become so solemn, he knew she didn\u0027t understand he was teasing her. \"Pirates do like to brawl,\" she added with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madam, didn\u0027t Colin explain that. . .\" Caine began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My son insists upon keeping Pagan\u0027s true identity a secret,\" she interrupted. \"Still, I\u0027m not completely obtuse,\" she added with a meaningful glance in Nathan\u0027s direction. \"I\u0027ve been around the corner once or twice. I know who Pagan is,\" she added with a nod. \"Henry also knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry?\" Nathan asked. \"My father,\" Caine explained. \"Henry\u0027s never wrong, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d made that statement to Nathan. He found himself nodding in agreement. \"Then I must be Pagan,\" he announced with a grin. \"If Henry\u0027s never wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled over his easy acceptance. \"Do not worry, sir, for I shall guard your secret. Now where is that lovely young lady I was so horribly rude to, Caine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re never rude, madam,\" Caine interjected. \"I didn\u0027t properly introduce myself,\" she argued. \"Now where is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Upstairs, resting,\" Nathan answered. \"Why do you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know perfectly well why,\" she answered. Her exasperation was obvious. \"I do?\" Nathan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must apologize for my behavior, of course, but also I must thank her for all she\u0027s done for this family.\" \"Nathan is Jade\u0027s brother,\" Caine said. \"I knew that,\" she answered. \"His green eyes gave him away, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duchess walked over to the man she believed was the infamous pirate. \"Lean down, dear boy. I must give you a kiss for being such a loyal friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan was a bit disconcerted. Caine\u0027s stepmother had sounded like a commander when she gave her order. He suddenly felt as awkward as a schoolboy and didn\u0027t have the faintest idea why. He did, however, do as she asked. The Duchess kissed Nathan on both cheekbones. \"You need to wash that blood away, my dear. Then Henry will give you a proper welcome into the family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will he kiss him, too, madam?\" Caine drawled out. He was thoroughly enjoying Nathan\u0027s obvious discomfort. \"Of course not,\" his stepmother answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would he want to welcome me into the family?\" Nathan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duchess smiled, yet didn\u0027t bother to explain herself. She turned back to Caine. \"I should have realized Lady Aisely wasn\u0027t going to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is Lady Aisely?\" Nathan asked, trying to catch the drift of this conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A ball of fluff,\" Caine answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duchess ignored that insult. \"Henry realized right off. The green eyes, you see. And the red hair, of course.\" She patted her blond curls and looked over her shoulder at Nathan. \"Henry\u0027s never wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan found himself agreeing once again with the woman. He still didn\u0027t have a clue as to what she was babbling about, but he found her loyalty to her husband quite honorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry\u0027s infallible.\" Caine said what Nathan was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My baby\u0027s terribly weak,\" the Duchess remarked. \"And as thin as a reed.\" She started toward the dining room. \"I\u0027m going to find Sterns. Colin needs a good hot meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Caine was in a hurry to get to Jade, he forgot all about Harry and his men. Nathan was more astute. He thought about warning Caine, or mentioning the guests to his mother, then decided he\u0027d just wait and see what happened. Besides, Caine was already halfway up the stairs, and the Duchess had already turned the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan started counting. He\u0027d only reached the number five when a shrill scream filled the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise stopped Caine. He turned around and found Nathan lounging against the door frame again, grinning broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the . . .\" Caine began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry,\" Nathan drawled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell,\" Caine returned as he started back down the stairs. \"Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duchess was screaming like a wild woman now. \"Damn it, Nathan,\" Caine roared. \"You could have reminded me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Nathan replied. \"I could have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Caine reached the bottom step, his father appeared at the top. \"What in God\u0027s name is going on?\" he shouted. \"Who is making all that noise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan answered before Caine could. \"Your wife, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine paused to glare at Nathan, then turned to his father again. He was torn between going to his stepmother\u0027s assistance, and preventing his father from doing murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chilling look in his father\u0027s eyes convinced him to handle him first. There was also the fact that even though Harry was probably scaring the Duchess out of her wits, Caine knew he wouldn\u0027t really hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine grabbed hold of his father\u0027s arm when he reached him. \"Father, it\u0027s quite all right, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry didn\u0027t look at all convinced. \"Your wife has just met Black Harry,\" Nathan interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine\u0027s father pulled away from his son\u0027s grasp just as the dining room doors bounded open. Everyone turned to watch the unsavory-looking men filing past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack Harry was the last in the procession. He was dragging the Duchess in his wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan started laughing. Caine shook his head. The Duke\u0027s full attention, however, was centered on the giant of a man with the gleaming gold tooth who was now swaggering toward the front door. A large\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esilver bowl was tucked under the man\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry let out a roar and started forward. Both Nathan and Caine blocked his path. \"Father, let me take care of this, please,\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then tell him to unhand my wife!\" his father bellowed. \"Henry, do something,\" Gweneth cried out. \"This . . . man believes I\u0027m going with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan took a step forward. \"Now, Harry, you can\u0027t be taking . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of my way, son,\" Caine\u0027s father snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father, Harry\u0027s a friend,\" Caine countered. \"He\u0027s Jade\u0027s uncle. You owe this man a debt for helping\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith Colin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry paused to give his son an incredulous look. \"And Gweneth is payment for this debt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me handle this matter,\" Caine demanded once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore his father could argue with him, Caine turned. \"Harry,\" he called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack Harry whirled around and hauled the Duchess up against his side. Caine noticed his grim expression, of course, but also the definite sparkle in his eyes. Appearances, he thought to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd pride. Both needed to be upheld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be taking her with me,\" Harry announced to his audience. His men nodded their agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine would want me to have her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Caine replied. \"I don\u0027t want you to have her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You being inhospitable, boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, it isn\u0027t possible for you to take her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a fair exchange,\" Harry stated. \"You\u0027re determined to have my girl, now aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine nodded. \"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m taking this one,\" Harry countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, she\u0027s already taken,\" Caine argued. He turned to his stepmother then and said, \"Madam, please quit shouting. It\u0027s difficult enough to negotiate with this stubborn pirate. Nathan? If you don\u0027t quit laughing, I\u0027m going to bloody your nose again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this woman to you, Caine?\" Harry asked. \"You just called her madam. Now what the hell does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s my father\u0027s wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she ain\u0027t your mama?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s my stepmother,\" Caine qualified. \"Then it shouldn\u0027t matter to you if I take her or not.\" Caine wondered what Harry\u0027s real game was. \"She has been like a mother to me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry frowned, then turned to his pretty captive. \"Do you call him son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duchess lost her outraged expression and slowly shook her head. \"I didn\u0027t believe he would wish\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme to call him son,\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He ain\u0027t your favorite,\" Harry announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke of Williamshire quit trying to get past Caine. His stance became relaxed. A hint of a smile turned his expression. He understood at last what this was all about, for he remembered Jade\u0027s instructions about loving his children equally. She must have mentioned her concern to Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have a favorite child,\" Gweneth cried out. \"I love all my children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he ain\u0027t yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course he\u0027s mine,\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duchess didn\u0027t look frightened now, only furious. \"How dare you suggest...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well now, if you\u0027d call him son,\" Harry drawled out, \"and if he called you mother, then I couldn\u0027t be taking you with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For heaven\u0027s sake, Gweneth, call Caine son!\" Henry roared, trying to pretend outrage. He was so pleased inside over this surprising development, he wanted to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Son,\" Gweneth blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mother?\" Caine answered. He was looking at Harry, waiting for his next rebuttal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry let go of his hostage. His chuckle was deep as he turned and walked out the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Gweneth threw herself into her husband\u0027s arms, Caine followed Harry outside. \"All right, Harry, what was that all about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My reputation,\" Harry drawled out after his men had taken their leave. \"I\u0027m a pirate, if you\u0027ll remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else?\" Caine asked, sensing there was more to tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My girl worried about Colin being the favorite,\" Harry finally admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine was astonished by that statement. \"Where did she get that idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry shrugged. \"Don\u0027t matter where she got it,\" he replied. \"I don\u0027t want her worrying, no matter what the niggly reason be. You\u0027re going to have to ask me for her, you know. You\u0027ll have to do it proper, too, in front of me men. It\u0027s the only way you\u0027re going to be getting her, son.\" He paused to grin at Caine, then added, \"Course you\u0027re going to have to find her first.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-32.html","bookId":1791,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM"}
