He had a little private trouble of his own. He had now for some time been a frequenter of Tony Denton\u0027s billiard saloon, patronizing both the table and the bar. He had fallen in with a few young men of no social standing, who flattered him, and, therefore, stood in his good graces. With them he played billiards and drank. After a time he found that he was exceeding his allowance, but in the most obliging way Tony Denton had offered him credit. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course, Mr. Duncan\"—Randolph felt flattered at being addressed in this way—\"of course, Mr. Duncan, your credit is good with me. If you haven\u0027t the ready money, and I know most young gentlemen are liable to be short, I will just keep an account, and you can settle at your convenience.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This seemed very obliging, but I am disposed to think that a boy\u0027s worst enemy is the one who makes it easy for him to run into debt. Randolph was not wholly without caution, for he said: \"But suppose, Tony, I am not able to pay when you want the money?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, don\u0027t trouble yourself about that, Mr. Duncan,\" said Tony cordially. \"Of course, I know the standing of your family, and I am perfectly safe.

The day of reckoning always comes in such cases, as I hope my young friends will fully understand.

Of course, his father would give him more than ten dollars for the purpose, and he could privately pay it over to Tony Denton.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But this scheme did not work, and he made up his mind at last that he would have to tell Tony he must wait.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He did so. Tony Denton, who fully expected this, and, for reasons of his own, did not regret it, said very little to Randolph, but decided to go round and see Prince Duncan himself. It would give him a chance to introduce the other and more important matter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was about this time that Linton\u0027s birthday-party took place. Randolph knew, of course, that he would meet Luke, but he no longer had the satisfaction of deriding his shabby dress. Our hero wore his best suit, and showed as much ease and self-possession as Randolph himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What airs that boy Luke puts on!\" ejaculated Randolph, in disgust. \"I believe he thinks he is my equal.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In this Randolph was correct. Luke certainly did consider himself the social equal of the haughty Randolph, and the consciousness of being well dressed made him feel at greater ease than at Florence Grant\u0027s party. He had taken additional lessons in dancing from his friend Linton, and, being quick to learn, showed no awkwardness on the floor. Linton\u0027s parents, by their kind cordiality, contributed largely to the pleasure of their son\u0027s guests, who at the end of the evening unanimously voted the party a success.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3006/82984.html","bookId":285,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:43:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:43:52 AM"}
