{"id":11660,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. THE GOSSIP OF CLUBS.","content":"It was called \"The Skylarks\u0027 Club,\" because, like those tuneful birds, the members were up very early in the morning. Not that the aforesaid members were early risers by any means--but because they never went to bed till three or four o\u0027clock. To put it plainly, they stayed up nearly all night, and it seemed to be a point of honour with them that, as long as a quorum were on the premises, the club should be kept open.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Most of the members were dissipated and led fast lives, drank a good deal, gambled away large sums, betted freely, and, to all appearances, were going to the dogs as fast as they possibly could. The code of morality was not very strict, and the \"Skylarks\" generally viewed each other\u0027s good or bad luck in a cynical manner. Occasionally a member disappeared from his accustomed place, and it was generally understood he had \"gone under,\" or, in other words, was vegetating on some up-country station, doubtless cursing the \"Skylarks\" freely as the cause of his ruin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Other clubs in Melbourne were fast--not a doubt about that--but every one declared that the \"Skylarks\" overstepped all bounds of decency. Whatever devilment was to be done, they would do it, and, as they had no characters to lose, they generally amused themselves by trying to destroy other people\u0027s good name, and generally succeeded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a Bohemian club, and among its members were stock-brokers, musicians, journalists, and actors, so that, whatever the moral tone of the place, the conversation was generally brilliant, albeit rather malicious. One way and another, there was a good deal of money floating about, for if the members worked hard at business during the day, they also worked hard at pleasure during the night, so, systematically, burned the candle at both ends. \"Fay ce que vouldras\" was their motto, and they certainly carried it out to the very last letter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keith Stewart was a member of this delectable fraternity, having been introduced by Ezra Lazarus, and, thanks to his mysterious five hundred pounds, was able to cut a very decent figure among the members. He was still in the pawnbroker\u0027s office, although he very much wanted to leave it, but, having passed his word to old Lazarus to stay six months, he was determined to do so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was now about three months since the diamond robbery, and, after being a nine days\u0027 wonder, it had passed out of the minds of every one. Nothing more was heard of the theft, and, after a great number of surmises, more or less wrong, the matter was allowed to drop, as a new divorce case of a novel character now engrossed the public mind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Prince Carnival\" had been withdrawn after a very successful run, and Kitty Marchurst was now appearing in \"Eblis,\" which, as she expected, had turned out a failure. Under these circumstances, \"Prince Carnival\" was revived, pending the production of \"Faust Upset,\" a new burlesque by Messrs. Stewart and Lazarus.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Both these young men had worked hard at the piece, and Mortimer, having approved of the first act, had determined to put the play on the stage: first, because he saw it was by no means a bad piece, and secondly, he had nothing else handy to bring forward. If he could have obtained a new and successful opera-bouffe from London, \"Faust Upset\" would have been ignominiously shelved, but, luckily for Keith and his friends, all the late opera-bouffes had been failures, so Mortimer made a virtue of necessity, and gave them a chance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was about eleven o\u0027clock at night, and the smoking-room of the \"Skylarks\" was full. Some of the members had been there for some hours, others had dropped in after the theatres were closed, and here and there could be seen a reporter scribbling his notes for publication next day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A luxurious apartment it was, with lounging chairs covered with crimson plush, plenty of mirrors, and a number of marble-topped tables, which were now covered with various beverages. Every one was talking loudly, and the waiters were flitting about actively employed in ministering to the creature comforts of the patrons of the club. What with the dusky atmosphere caused by the smoking, the babel of voices, the jingle of glasses, and the constant moving about of the restless crowd, it looked like some fantastic nightmare.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keith was seated in a corner smoking a cigarette and waiting for Ezra, who had promised to meet him there, and in the meantime was idly watching the crowd of his friends, and listening to their gossip. Malton was also lounging about the room, chatting to his friends on current topics.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Anything going on in the House?\" asked Pelk, a theatrical critic, of Slingsby, who had just entered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That gentleman shrugged his shoulders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A slanging match, as usual,\" he replied, taking a seat and ringing the bell. \"Some members have got an idea that abuse is wit. I don\u0027t think much of the Victorian Parliament.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s better than the New South Wales one, at all events,\" said Keith, smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s not saying much,\" retorted Slingsby, lighting a cigar. \"The Sydney men are more like fractious children than anything else, though to be sure that\u0027s only proper, seeing our Parliaments are nurseries for sucking politicians.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s severe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But true--the truth is always disagreeable.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps that\u0027s the reason so few people speak it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Exactly--truth is a sour old maid whom nobody wants.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not you, at all events, Slingsby\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No--it\u0027s a matter of choice--Video meliora proboque deteriora sequor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t be classical--it\u0027s out of place here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not a bit,\" retorted Slingsby smoothly, looking round at the circle of grinning faces, \"it\u0027s out of the dictionary, you know, foreign words and affixes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Every one roared at this candid confession.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No wonder The Penny Whistle flourishes when there\u0027s such men as you on the staff,\" said Toltby, with a sneer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ve no cause to complain,\" replied Slingsby; \"they\u0027ve been kind enough to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; they recognise good acting.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Slingsby looked at him queerly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dear boy, I prefer the stage of the House to that of the theatre--the actors are much more amusing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At this moment Felix Rolleston, now looking much older since the Hansom Cab murder case, but as lively as ever, entered the room and danced up to the coterie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, gentlemen,\" he said gaily, \"what is the news?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good news, bad news, and such news as you\u0027ve never heard of,\" quoted Keith lazily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, my local Gratiano,\" replied Felix, quickly recognising the quotation as from the \"Merchant of Venice.\" \"By the way, there\u0027s a letter for you outside.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, thanks,\" said Stewart rising, \"I\u0027ll go and get it,\" and he sauntered out lazily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Humph!\" ejaculated Felix, looking after him, \"our friend is the author of \u0027Faust Upset,\u0027 I understand?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" replied Toltby; \"deuced good piece.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That means you\u0027ve got an excellent part,\" struck in Slingsby mercilessly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Quite right,\" retorted Toltby complacently; \"all the parts are good--especially Caprice\u0027s.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, that goes without saying,\" said Pelk, with a grin; \"our friend is rather sweet there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So is she,\" said Felix significantly; \"case of reciprocity, dear boy!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s given Fenton the go-by.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, and Meddlechip is elevated to the vacancy. Wonder how long it will be before she breaks him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, even with her talents for squandering, Caprice can\u0027t burst up the richest man in Victoria,\" said Slingsby vulgarly; \"when she does give him up, I suppose Stewart will succeed him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not enough cash.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pooh! what is cash compared to love?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Eh! a good deal in this case, as Fenton found out.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Speak of the devil,\" said Felix quickly; \"here comes the gentleman in question.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fenton, looking harassed and worn, entered the room, and glanced round. Seeing Rolleston, he came over to him and began to talk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Guess you look happy, boys,\" he said, in his nasal voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s more than you do,\" replied Rolleston, scanning him keenly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No; I\u0027ve overworked myself,\" said Fenton coolly, \"I need pulling up a bit.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go and see a doctor--try tonics.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, bah! glass of champagne will fix me straight. Here, waiter, bring in a bottle of Heidsieck. Any of you boys join?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the boys assenting to the hospitable proposition, Fenton ordered two bottles, and lighted a huge cigar. When the waiter came back with the wine, Keith also entered, with a soft look on his face which puzzled Rolleston. He had put on his overcoat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah!\" said that astute gentleman, \"you look pleased--your letter was pleasant?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, very,\" replied Keith laconically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then it was from a woman,\" said Fenton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Humph! that\u0027s generally anything but pleasant,\" grunted Slingsby.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No doubt, to such a Don Juan as you,\" said Pelk, amid a general laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The waiter was opening the wine so slowly that Fenton lost patience, and snatched one bottle up from the table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Guess we had better fix those two up at once,\" he said. \"Any one got a knife?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keith put his hand in his pocket, and produced therefrom Meg\u0027s present.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Great C?sar, what a pig-sticker,\" said Fenton, holding it up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What made you buy such a thing, Stewart?\" asked Felix, laughing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I didn\u0027t buy it,\" replied Keith; \"it\u0027s a present from a lady.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A very young lady, I should say,\" said Slingsby drily; \"not much idea of taste.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Matter of opinion,\" said Keith serenely; \"I like the knife for the sake of the donor--her name\u0027s on the handle.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fenton by this time had opened the bottle, and laid the knife down on the table, from whence Felix picked it up and examined it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027From Meg,\u0027\" he read, in an amused tone; \"gad, Stewart, I thought it was the mother, not the daughter.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fenton shot a fiery glance at Keith, who laughed in rather an embarrassed manner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was just the child\u0027s whim,\" he said, laughing. \"I saved her from the tram-car, so she gave me this as a souvenir;\" and, taking up the knife, he shut it with a sharp click, and slipped it into his overcoat pocket.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they had all finished the wine, Fenton said he had to see Mortimer about some business.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Half-past ten,\" he said, looking at his watch; \"they\u0027ll just be about through.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve got to see Mortimer to-night,\" observed Keith, \"and I\u0027m waiting here for Lazarus.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"About the new play, I reckon,\" said Fenton; \"well, you\u0027d better walk up with me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Keith shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, thanks; I must wait for Lazarus.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then come and have a game of billiards in the meantime,\" said Felix, rising; \"take off your coat, you\u0027ll find it hot.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right,\" assented Keith readily \"Here, Alfred,\" and, slipping off his coat, handed it to a waiter, who was just passing, \"hang this up for me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The waiter took the coat, threw it over his arm, and vanished; while Keith and Felix strolled leisurely away in the direction of the billiard-room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How the deuce does Stewart run it?\" asked Fenton, looking after them; \"he can\u0027t get much salary at old Lazarus\u0027 place.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Case of God tempering the wind to the shorn lamb,\" said Slingsby ironically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hang it, I don\u0027t think he ought to be a member of the Club, a confounded pawnbroker\u0027s clerk.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is rather a topsy-turvy business, ain\u0027t it; but you see, in the colonies Jack\u0027s as good as his master.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And in some cases a deal better,\" said Pelk, referring to the relative positions of Malton and Fenton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Particularly when Jack\u0027s got a pretty wife,\" finished Toltby significantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fenton knew this was a hint at his penchant for Mrs. Malton, but he did not very well see how he could take it to himself, particularly when he saw every one smiling, so he smiled back saturninely at the circle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re devilish witty, boys,\" he said coldly; \"guess the wine has sharpened your brains.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he strolled away in his usual cool manner, Slingsby looked after him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Our friend\u0027s hard hit over Mrs. Malton,\" he said at length.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Every one knows that,\" grinned Toltby, \"except the husband.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, the husband is generally the last to find out these things,\" remarked Pelk drily; and the conversation ended.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile Rolleston and Keith were playing their game of billiards, a pastime in which the former was an adept, and soon defeated Keith, who threw down his cue in half anger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You always win,\" he said pettishly; \"it\u0027s no use playing with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, yes, it is,\" said Felix cheerfully. \"I know I\u0027m a good player, so if you play with me it will improve you very much--that remark sounds conceited, but it\u0027s true--come and have another game.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not to-night,\" replied Keith; \"I\u0027ve got to keep my appointment with Mortimer--it\u0027s no use waiting for Lazarus.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, yes, it is,\" cried a new voice, and Lazarus made his appearance at the door of the billiard-room. \"I\u0027m sorry for having kept you waiting, but it was unavoidable. I\u0027ll tell you all about it as we walk up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right,\" replied Keith, and turned to go, followed by Ezra, who nodded to Rolleston.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good-night,\" cried that gentleman, making a cannon. \"Good luck be with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Amen,\" responded Keith laughing, and disappeared with Ezra.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1861/53892.html","bookId":829,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:05:35 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:05:35 AM"}
