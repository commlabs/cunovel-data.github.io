To help me get my strength back quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the heck is a hunk of crystal going to do that?\" Emerson growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows?\" Jonas gave his wife a secret grin. \"Look at it this wayâ€”it can\u0027t do any harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see what Lehigh sent,\" Emerson said encouragingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity obediently tore the paper off the last package. When she raised the lid on the long thin box her eyes widened in amazement. Inside lay a dagger with a jeweled handle. \"Lehigh certainly has an odd notion of what to give a newborn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerson chuckled and came around the side of the bed to get a closer look. \"Probably expects the kid to take after his dad. Hell of a dagger though, isn\u0027t it? Look at that handle. Knowing Lehigh, those stones are real. Take a look, Jonas.\" Emerson stood back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas frowned as he glanced at the dagger. \"Looks genuine, all right. Fifteenth- or sixteenth-century Italian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably from his collection,\" Emerson remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas reached into the box. His fingers closed around the hilt of the dagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity sucked in her breath as the walls of the hospital room began to curve around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned in the psychic corridor, searching for him. He smiled at her from the other side of the mysterious tunnel. His golden eyes were gleaming. He held the jeweled dagger in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your talent,\" she whispered. \"It\u0027s back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strong as ever,\" he said with laughing satisfaction. \"Guess it just needed a little time to heal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed the jeweled dagger into the air. It spun end over end, the stones in the handle flashing brilliantly. The corridor wavered and vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas caught the dagger with easy grace and quickly dropped it back into its box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you two okay?\" Emerson demanded. \"You\u0027ve both got funny expressions on your faces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s just fine,\" Jonas said as he leaned down to kiss his wife. \"Isn\u0027t it, my love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect,\" Verity agreed with a smile that was more beautiful than the crystal and the gems around her. It was a smile as brilliant as the gold in her husband\u0027s eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-85.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
