Don\u0027t ever forget that,\" Darlene says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSierra shakes her head and says, \"Are you crushing on someone other than your boyfriend? Colin told Doug you\u0027ve been acting strange lately. As your friends, we\u0027re here to talk some sense into you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on the front stoop and listen to them rant about reputations and boyfriends and loyalty for a half hour. They make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise us there\u0027s nothing going on between you and Alex,\" Sierra says to me alone while Morgan and Darlene are waiting in the car for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing going on between me and Alex,\" I assure her. \"I swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 30 Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sitting in calculus when the security guard knocks on the door and tells the teacher I need to be escorted out of class. Rolling my eyes, I grab my books and let the guy have his kicks by humiliating me in front of an audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What now?\" I ask. Yesterday I was pulled out of class for starting a food fight in the courtyard. I didn\u0027t start it. I might have participated, but I didn\u0027t start it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re taking a little trip to the basketball courts.\" I follow the guy to the courts. \"Alejandro, vandalism to school property is very serious business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t vandalize anything,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a tip that you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tip? You know the phrase \"whoever smelt it, dealt it\"? Well, whoever snitched probably did it, \"Where is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard points to the gym floor, where someone spray painted a very poor replica of the Latino Blood symbol. \"Can you explain this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother security guard joins us. \"We should check his locker,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great idea.\" All they\u0027ll find is a leather jacket and books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m turning the combination lock when Mrs. P. passes us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the problem?\" she asks them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vandalism. On the basketball court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my locker and stand back to let them inspect it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aha,\" the security guy says, reaching inside and pulling out a can of black spray paint from the top shelf. He holds it out to me. \"Are you still going to plead innocent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m bein\u0027 set up.\" I turn to Mrs. P., who\u0027s looking at me like I killed her cat. \"I didn\u0027t do it,\" I tell her. \"Mrs. P., you\u0027ve got to believe me.\" I can see me now, being hauled to jail because of something an idiot did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. \"Alex, the evidence is right there. I want to believe you, but it\u0027s really hard.\" The officers are on either side of me, and I know what\u0027s coming next. Mrs. P. holds up her hand, stopping them. \"Alex. Help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m tempted not to explain, to let them all think I was the one who defaced school property. They probably won\u0027t listen, anyway. But Mrs. P. is looking at me like a teenage rebel who wants to prove everyone wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The symbol is all wrong,\" I tell her. I show her my forearm. \"This is the Latino Blood symbol. It\u0027s a five-point star with two pitchforks coming out the top and LB in the middle. The one on the floor had a six-point star with two arrows. Nobody in the Blood would make that mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says to the officers, \"Where\u0027s Dr. Aguirre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a meeting with the superintendent. His secretary said he doesn\u0027t want to be disturbed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeterson checks her watch. \"I\u0027ve got a class in fifteen minutes. Joe, radio Dr. Aguirre on your walkie-talkie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe the security guy isn\u0027t too happy. \"Ma\u0027am, this is the sort of thing we were hired for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But Alex is my student, and believe me when I say he can\u0027t miss class today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe shrugs, then radios for Dr. Aguirre to meet him in L hall. When his secretary asks if it\u0027s an emergency, Mrs. P. takes the walkie-talkie from Joe and says she\u0027s considering it her personal emergency and Dr. Aguirre should get down to L hall right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo minutes later, Aguirre with a stern look on his face comes into view. \"What\u0027s this all about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vandalism in the gym,\" Officer Joe informs him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAguirre stiffens. \"Dammit, Fuentes. Not you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t do it,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then who did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Aguirre, he\u0027s telling the truth,\" Peterson says. \"You can fire me if I\u0027m wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, then turns to the security guy. \"Get Chuck to the gym and see what he can do to clean that stuff off.\" He points the spray paint can at me. \"But I warn you, Alex. If I find out it was you, you\u0027ll be not only suspended but arrested. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the officers leave, Aguirre says, \"Alex, I didn\u0027t tell you this before, but I\u0027m telling you now. I thought the world was my enemy when I was in high school. I wasn\u0027t that much different than you, you know. It took me a damn long time to learn that I was my own enemy. When I realized that, I turned my life around. Mrs. Peterson and I, we\u0027re not the enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that,\" I say, and actually believe it\u0027s the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Now I happen to be in the middle of an important meeting. If you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027ll be in my office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for believing me,\" I say to Mrs. P. once he\u0027s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know who vandalized the gym?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look her straight in the eye and tell her the truth. \"I\u0027ve got no idea. I\u0027m pretty confident it\u0027s not one of my friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs. \"If you weren\u0027t in a gang, Alex, you wouldn\u0027t get yourself into these messes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but I\u0027d be in other ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 31 Brittany\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks like some of you don\u0027t think my class is important,\" Mrs. Peterson says. She starts handing out the test from yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Mrs. Peterson heads toward my and Alex\u0027s shared table, I sink down in my chair. The last thing I need is Mrs. Peterson\u0027s wrath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice job,\" the woman says as she places my paper facedown in front of me. Then the woman turns to Alex. \"For someone who aspires to be a chemistry teacher, you\u0027re off to a very poor start, Mr. Fuentes. Maybe I\u0027ll think twice about sticking up for you if you don\u0027t come prepared to my class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drops Alex\u0027s test in front of him with her index finger and thumb, as if the paper is too disgusting to touch with the rest of her fingers. \"See me after class,\" she tells him before passing out the rest of the tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t understand why Mrs. Peterson didn\u0027t rip me a new one. I turn my paper over to find an A on the top of it. I rub my palms over my eyes and readjust them. There must be some mistake. It takes me less than a second to realize who was responsible for my grade. The truth hits me like a hammer to my gut. I look over at Alex, tucking his flunked test into his book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you do it?\" I wait until Mrs. Peterson finishes her after-class discussion with Alex before approaching him. I\u0027m standing beside his locker, where he\u0027s paying little, if any, attention to me. I\u0027m ignoring the stares burning into the back of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talkin\u0027 about,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuh! \"You switched our tests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex slams his locker shut. \"Listen, it was no big deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it is. He walks away, as if expecting me to leave it at that. I\u0027d watched him work diligently on his test, but when I glanced at the big red F on the front of his paper, I recognized my own test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school, I hurry out the front doors to catch him. He\u0027s on his motorcycle, getting ready to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, wait!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling fidgety, I curl my hair behind my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hop on,\" he orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hop on. If you want to thank me for savin\u0027 your ass in Mrs. P.\u0027s class, come home with me. I wasn\u0027t kiddin\u0027 yesterday. You showed me a glimpse into your life, I\u0027m gonna show you a glimpse of mine. It\u0027s only fair, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scan the parking lot. Some people are looking our way, probably ready to spread the gossip that I\u0027m talking to Alex. If I actually leave with him, rumors will fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of Alex revving his motorcycle brings my attention back to him. \"Don\u0027t be afraid of what they think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take in the sight of him, from his ripped jeans and leather jacket to the red and black bandanna he just tied on top of his head. His gang colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be terrified. Then I remember how he was with Shelley yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo hell with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift my book bag around to my back and straddle his motorcycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on tight,\" he says, pulling my hands around his waist. The simple feel of his strong hands resting on top of mine is intensely intimate. I wonder if he\u0027s feeling these emotions, too, but dismiss the thought. Alex Fuentes is a hard guy. Experienced. The mere touch of hands isn\u0027t going to make his stomach flutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe deliberately brushes the tips of his fingers over mine before reaching for the handlebars. Oh. My. God. What am I getting myself into?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we speed away from the school parking lot, I grab Alex\u0027s rock-hard abs tighter. The speed of the motorcycle scares me. I feel light-headed, like I\u0027m riding a roller coaster with no lap bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motorcycle stops at a red light. I lean back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear him chuckle when he guns the engine once more as the light turns green. I clutch his waist and bury my face in his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he finally stops and puts the kickstand down, I survey my surroundings. I\u0027ve never been on his street. The homes are so . . . small. Most are one level. A cat can\u0027t fit in the space between them. As hard as I try to fight it, sorrow settles in the pit of my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy house is at least seven, maybe even eight or nine times Alex\u0027s home\u0027s size. I know this side of town is poor, but . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was a mistake,\" Alex says. \"I\u0027ll take you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Among other things, the look of disgust on your face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not disgusted. I guess I feel sorry--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ever pity me,\" he warns. \"I\u0027m poor, not homeless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then are you going to invite me in? The guys across the street are gawking at the white girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, around here you\u0027re a \u0027snow girl.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate snow,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips quirk up into a grin. \"Not for the weather, querida. For your snow-white skin. Just follow me and don\u0027t stare at the neighbors, even if they stare at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sense his wariness as he leads me inside. \"Well, this is it,\" he says, motioning inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe living room might be smaller than any room in my house, but it feels warm and cozy. There are two afghans lying on the sofa I\u0027d love to have on top of me on cold nights. We don\u0027t have any afghans at my house. We have comforters . . . custom-designed ones to match the decor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk around Alex\u0027s house, gliding my fingers over the furniture. A shelf with half-melted candles sits below a picture of a handsome man. I feel Alex\u0027s warmth as he stands behind me. \"Your dad?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t begin to imagine what it would be like to lose my dad.\" Even though he\u0027s not around much, I know he\u0027s a permanent fixture in my life. I always want more out of my parents. Should I feel lucky just having them around? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-24.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
