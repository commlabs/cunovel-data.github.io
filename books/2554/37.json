Not because the O\u0027Donnells were particularly secretive, but because the Internet still wasn\u0027t up to snuff after the crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst thing after leaving the coffee shop, the three of them drove to the county seat and looked up the lot and block number of the property jointly owned by Francis and Marie O\u0027Donnell who were listed as residents of Riviera Beach, Florida. From there to the local library where they used a computer to track the couple. Bits and pieces from multiple sites sketched out the details Jack needed. Francis: seventy-six and a former stockbroker who retired from Bear Stearns well before the meltdown. Marie: seventy-four and a former high school teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack made the assumption that, barring a family emergency, a couple in their midseventies with a primary residence in South Florida would keep their distance from the bitter cold of Long Island in March.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he decided to move in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left Weezy and Dawn in the Hamptons and made the long trip to his apartment to retrieve his break-in kit and a few other goodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness had fallen by the time he returned. Weezy dropped him off at the end of the street and he walked the rest of the way. He had a bad moment when he reached the place and found lights on in the front room and an upstairs window. But a few cautious peeks inside showed no signs of life: he spotted a timer in the socket feeding the light in the front window. No doubt the same story upstairs. A good policy for the owner: The place looked occupied to anyone driving by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used a bump key to enter the house through the rear door into the utility room. The place felt delightfully warm to Jack after the frigid wind off the bay, but still a little cool for the comfort of a couple of septuagenarians. A good sign, but he needed to be absolutely sure the place was empty. He hurried through the first floor, then through the bedrooms upstairs. All empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack on the first floor, he used quick flashes of his penlight to find a thermostat. They\u0027d left it set on fifty-five. He upped that ten degrees and heard a furnace go on. He tried a faucet. No water. Took him a few minutes to find the shut-off valve; he turned it back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called Weezy and gave her the all-clear, then went out by the garage - a one-car garage, unfortunately. But they\u0027d found a spot in the trees down by the highway, not a hundred yards from the O\u0027Donnells\u0027 back door, to stash the SUV. A padlock on the simple gate latch held the garage\u0027s old-fashioned double doors closed. He shimmed it open and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later a car appeared with its headlights out. Jack swung the garage doors open and held them until Dawn\u0027s Volvo was inside, then closed up and replaced the padlock without securing it. Weezy and Dawn emerged from the garage\u0027s rear door with the bare-necessities groceries they\u0027d picked up in Amagansett. Weezy had her backpack with her precious Compendium slung over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said as they unpacked the bags in the kitchen. \"We\u0027ve got heat, water, and power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe backwash of light from the front room provided enough illumination to allow them to see what they were doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the comforts of home,\" Weezy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite. We need to stay out of the front room while the light is on. Same for the lighted room upstairs. The owners may have hired some security people to drive by now and then, or they may have some sort of neighborhood watch. We don\u0027t want to risk someone spotting movement in a supposedly empty house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll find a blanket to drape over the bathroom window, so we can at least put that light on when we need it, but otherwise no lights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn looked at him. \"Sounds like you think we\u0027re going to be here a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I hope not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked from Jack to Weezy. \"I\u0027ve got a feeling there\u0027s another agenda here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo dummy, this girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy said, \"I want you to get your baby back. But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn turned to Jack. \"But what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mister Osala is important too,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. Time to lay out as much as he could for her. He gestured to the kitchen table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should sit down and discuss this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pulled out chairs and seated themselves in the near dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack said, \"Where do I begin, Weez?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cleared her throat. \"I think we should keep this on as mundane a level as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplain it without mentioning the Otherness and the Ally? Not easy, but it would keep them from looking like head cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worth a try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned toward Dawn. \"There\u0027s a war going on. It\u0027s being fought behind the scenes. Mister Osala is a very big player in that war. He\u0027s not a detective, your mother never hired him to protect you - in fact, your mother never met or even heard of him. Everything he told you is a lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He leads a cult. You saw their symbol on the back of your obstetrician\u0027s watch. They think they can take over the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn slapped her hands on the table. \"Oh, I don\u0027t believe this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack saw where Weezy was going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to believe it,\" he said. \"What\u0027s important to know is that Osala believes it. And he believes your baby is the key to that takeover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack didn\u0027t know if that was true - he had no idea what Rasalom had planned for the baby - but it might be. And even if he was wrong, it sounded good. Whatever it took to widen Dawn\u0027s focus from just her baby to a bigger picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s crazy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy said, \"No argument. But crazy or not, the baby is why he took you in during your pregnancy and dumped you as soon as you delivered. That\u0027s why he spirited the baby away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that,\" Jack said, tapping the table, \"is why he\u0027s got to figure into what we do here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I just want my baby back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack hit her with an angle he thought would lock her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to keep your baby once you find him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you can depend on Osala to do his damnedest to get him back. So unless we deal with Osala here and now, you and your baby could spend the rest of your lives on the run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn leaned forward. \"What do you mean by \u0027deal\u0027 with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave that to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause, then, \"You\u0027re a little scary, you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scarier than the guy who locked you away in his apartment for months on end and then stole your baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pause. \"Score one for you. But how does this affect what we\u0027re doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Jack said. \"We\u0027re working with only two facts right now: Osala\u0027s driver is over there, and the pediatric surgeon present during your labor has paid a visit. Everything else is assumption. We can assume your baby is there but we need to establish that as a fact. And even if we do, we can\u0027t move until we can establish beyond a doubt that Osala is there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack thought he\u0027d made that obvious but Dawn\u0027s tunnel vision persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that when you take the baby and leave, I can make sure no one hounds your trail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy rested her hand atop Dawn\u0027s. \"Larger issues than you and your baby are at stake here, Dawn. You don\u0027t need to know the details, but you were right: We have another agenda. But it dovetails perfectly with yours. We\u0027ll help you get and keep your baby, but you\u0027ve got to promise us you\u0027ll play it Jack\u0027s way and let him decide the timing. That way we\u0027ll all walk away with what we came for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I have a choice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you have a choice,\" Jack told her. \"But if you do something rash, we could all come away empty-handed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rash?\" She sounded offended. \"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like going over there and peeking in the windows to see if you can spot the baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On target?\" Jack said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed and he saw her nod in the dim light. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d figured if she hadn\u0027t already thought of that, it wouldn\u0027t be long before she did. Might as well get it on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just promise me, Dawn, that the only window you\u0027ll peek through is one of those upstairs, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA reluctant tone: \"Okay. But somebody needs to look in that house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree. And that would be me. Dark is the best time. In fact, I\u0027ll take a look right now.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-37.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
