He rolled Ramsgate’s desk chair over to the window, took hold of the man under the arms, hauled him to his feet, then heaved him out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the chair back, tore the second sheet off the pad, crumpled it, tossed it at the basket. That was better, he decided-no note, just a pad on the desk, and then, when they look in the basket, they can come up with two drafts of a note he decided not to leave after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice touch. They’d pay more attention to a note if they had to hunt for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaneane was back at her desk when he left, chatting on the phone. She didn’t even look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller, back in New York, started each of the next five days with a copy of theWashington Post from a newsstand across the street from the UN building. There was nothing in it the first morning, but the next day he found a story on the obituary page about an established Washington patent attorney, an apparent suicide. Keller learned where Howard Ramsgate had gone to college and law school and read about a couple of inventions he’d helped steer through the patent process. The names of his survivors were given as well-a wife, two children, a brother in Lake Forest, Illinois.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat it didn’t say was that he was a spy, a traitor. Didn’t say he’d had help getting out the window. Keller, perched on a stool in a coffee shop, wondered how much more they knew than they were letting on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next three days he didn’t find one more word about Ramsgate. This wasn’t suspicious in and of itself-how often was there a follow-up to the suicide of a not-too-prominent attorney?-but Keller found himself trying to read between the lines of other stories, trying to find some subtle connection to Ramsgate’s death. This lobbyist charged with illegal campaign contributions, that Japanese tourist caught in the crossfire of a drug-related shootout, a key vote on a close bill in Congress-any such item might somehow link up to the defenestration of Howard Ramsgate. And he, the man who’d made it happen, would never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the fifth morning, as he found himself frowning over a minor scandal in the mayor’s office, it occurred to Keller to wonder if he was being watched. Had anyone observed him in the days since Ramsgate’s death? Had it been noted that he was starting each day, not around the corner from his apartment with theNew York Times but five blocks away with theWashington Post?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought it over and decided he was being silly. But then was he being any less silly buying thePost each morning? He’d tossed a pebble into a pond days ago, and now he kept returning, trying to detect the shadow of a ripple on the pond’s smooth surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got out of there and left the paper behind. Later, thinking about it, he realized what had him acting this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was looking for closure, for some sense of completion. Whenever he did a job for the old man, he made a phone call, got a pat on the back, bantered a bit with Dot, and, in the ordinary course of things, collected his money. That last was the most important, of course, but the acknowledgment was important, too, along with the mutual recognition that the job was done and done satisfactorily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Ramsgate he got none of that. There was no report to make, nobody to banter with, no one to tell him how well he’d done. Tight-lipped men in Washington offices might be talking about him, but he didn’t get to hear what they were saying. Bascomb might be pleased with what he’d done, but he wasn’t getting in touch, wasn’t dispensing any pats on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Keller decided, that was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause, when all was said and done, wasn’t that the soldier’s lot? There would be no drums and bugles for him, no parades, no medals. He would get along without feedback or acknowledgment, and he would probably never know the real results of his actions, let alone the reason he’d drawn a particular assignment in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could live with that. He could even take a special satisfaction in it. He didn’t need drums or bugles, parades or medals. He had been leading the life of a scoundrel, and his country had called on him. And he had served her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had given him a pat on the back. No one had called to say well done. No one would, and that was fine. The deed he had done, the service he had performed, was its own reward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime passed, and Keller got used to the idea that he would never hear from Bascomb again. Then one afternoon he was standing on line at the half-price ticket booth in Times Square when someone tapped him on the shoulder. “Excuse me,” a fellow said, handing him an envelope. “Think you dropped this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller started to say he hadn’t, then stopped when he recognized the man. Bascomb! Before he could say anything the man was gone, disappearing into the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a plain white envelope, the flap glued down and taped shut. Nothing written on it. From the heft of it, you’d put two stamps on it before putting it in the mail. But there were no stamps, and Bascomb had not entrusted it to the mails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller put it in his pocket. When he got to the front of the line he bought a ticket to that night’s performance of a fifties musical. He thought of buying two tickets and hiding one in a hollowed-out pumpkin. Then, when the curtain went up at eight o’clock, Bascomb would be in the seat beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went home and opened the envelope. There was a name, along with an address in Pompano Beach, Florida. There were two Polaroid shots, one of a man and woman, the other of the same man, alone this time, sitting down. There were nine hundred-dollar bills, used and out of sequence, and two fifties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller looked at the photos. They’d evidently been taken several years apart. The fellow looked older in the photo that showed him unaccompanied, and was that a wheelchair he was sitting in? Keller thought it might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor bastard, Keller started to think, and then caught himself. The guy had no pity coming. The son of a bitch was a traitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thousand in cash fell a ways short of covering Keller’s expenses. He had to pay full coach fare on the flight to West Palm Beach, had to rent a car, had to stay three nights in a hotel room before he could get the job done and another night afterward, before he could catch a morning flight home. The five hundred dollars he’d received as expenses for the Howard Ramsgate incident had paid for the Metroliner and his room and a good dinner, with a couple of dollars left over. But he had to dip into his own pocket to get the job done in Pompano Beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that it really mattered. What did he care about a few dollars one way or the other?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might have cut corners by getting in and out faster, but the operation turned out to be a tricky one. The traitor-his name was Drucker, Louis Drucker, but it was simpler for Keller to think of him as “the traitor”-lived in a beachfront condo on Briny Avenue, right in the middle of Pompano Beach. The residents, predictably enough, had a median age well into the golden years, and the traitor was by no means the only one there with wheels on his chair. There were others who got around with aluminum walkers, while the more athletic codgers strutted around with canes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first time Keller’s work had taken him to such a venue, so he didn’t know if security was as much of a priority at every senior citizens’ residence, but this one was harder to sneak into than the Pentagon. There was an attendant posted in the lobby at all hours, and there was closed-circuit surveillance of the elevators and stairwells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe traitor left the building twice a day, morning and evening, for a turn along the beach. He was always accompanied by a woman half his age who pushed his chair on the hard-packed sand, then read a Spanish magazine and smoked a cigarette or two while he took the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller considered and rejected elaborate schemes for getting into the building. They’d work, but then what? The woman lived in the traitor’s apartment, so he’d have to take her out, too. He had no compunctions about this, recognizing that civilian casualties were inevitable in modern warfare, and who was to say she was an entirely unwitting pawn? No, if the only way to nullify the traitor led through her, Keller would take her out without a second thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a double homicide made for a high-profile incident, and why draw unnecessary attention? With an aged and infirm quarry, it was so much simpler to make it look like natural causes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he lure the woman off the premises? Could he gain access during her absence? And could he get out unobtrusively, his work completed, before she got back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was working it out, fumbling with a plan, when Fate dropped it all in his lap. It was mid-morning, with the sun climbing the eastern sky, and he’d dutifully dogged their footsteps (well,her footsteps, since the traitor’s feet never touched the ground) a mile or so up the beach. Now the traitor sat in his chair facing the ocean, his head back, his eyes closed, his leathery skin soaking up the rays. A few yards away the woman lay on her side on a beach towel, smoking a cigarette, reading a magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put out the cigarette, burying it in the sand. And, moments later, the magazine slipped from her fingers as she dozed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller gave her a minute. He looked left, then right. There was nobody close by, and he was willing to take his chances with those who were fifty yards or more from the scene. Even if they were looking right at him, they’d never realize what was happening right before their eyes. Especially given the age of most of those eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came up behind the traitor, clapped a hand over his treacherous mouth, used the thumb and forefinger of his other hand to pinch the man’s nostrils closed, and kept his air shut off while he counted, slowly, to a number that seemed high enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he let go, the traitor’s hand fell to one side. Keller propped it up and left him looking as though asleep, basking like a lizard in the warm embrace of the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’ve you been, Keller? I’ve been calling you for days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was out of town,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Out of town?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ Florida, actually.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ Florida? Disney World, by any chance? Do I get to shake the hand that shook the hand of Mickey Mouse?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wanted a little sun and sand,” he said. “I went to the Gulf Coast. Sanibel Island.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you bring me a seashell, Keller?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A seashell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The shelling is supposed to be spectacular there,” Dot said. “The island sticks out into the Gulf instead of stretching out parallel to the land, the way they’re supposed to.” “ ‘The way they’re supposed to’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, the way they usually do. So the tides bring in shells by the carload and people come from all over the world to walk the beach and pick them up. But why am I telling you all this? You’re the one who just got back from the damn place. You didn’t bring me a shell, did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to get up early in the morning for the serious shelling,” Keller said, wondering if it was true. “The shellers are out there at the crack of dawn, like locusts on a field of barley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Barley, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amber waves of grain,” he said. “Anyway, what do I care about shells? I just wanted a break.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You missed some work.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-man-keller-1/page-35.html","bookId":2312,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM"}
