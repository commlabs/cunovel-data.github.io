But, they\u0027d done such a good job the first time around, he couldn\u0027t give them any more rage or any more anguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plus, you\u0027re gorgeous.\"Taylorwondered what she was doing. Her words were true. What was also true was that she could never deliver on the promise implied in the flirtatious tone. And even if she could have, she was nowhere nearJackson\u0027s league. The man was linked with superstar actresses whose beauty shone from the silver screen and glittered on red carpets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust last week, she\u0027d read an article where a titian-haired actress had stated that the reclusive head of Santorini Studios was her dream man. Though the megastar couldn\u0027t understand why such an important man chose to live in so small a country, it made him all the more interesting to her. All the more desirable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think anyone would describe me as gorgeous.\"Jackson\u0027s response was dry. \"But thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowled. \"You\u0027re not pretty, not like the actors. There\u0027s nothing soft about you. Your face is strong, interesting ... gorgeous.\" She wasn\u0027t going to back down. Just like the world-famous actress, dark-eyed, dark-haired JacksonSantorini was her dream man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people might say that he was a little too muscular, but onJackson, the bulk looked good. Very, very good. She wanted to reach over and squeeze one of those taut arm muscles to see if there was any give at all. Then she wanted to bite down on that firm, golden flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd therein lay her problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacksonhad been the best employer she\u0027d ever had. The most demanding but also the most appreciative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA permanent job with him would\u0027ve been perfect ... if she hadn\u0027t stupidly gone and fallen in lust with her married boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil she\u0027d met him, she\u0027d thought of lust as something frightening and dirty. Given her childhood, she knew that was understandable. But, the moment she\u0027d seen JacksonSantorini in the flesh, it had hit her like a thunderbolt. She\u0027d been flabbergasted, having no idea what to do about the heat that pooled in her stomach like high-octane fuel whenever he so much as glanced at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven more disturbing were the other emotions that had crept in while she wasn\u0027t guarding her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDangerous emotions like trust. And hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that she\u0027d ever followed up on the attraction. Touching another woman\u0027s husband was an unbreakable taboo. Even if her morals hadn\u0027t stopped her, practicality would have\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; she\u0027d seen firsthand what happened to discarded mistresses. But she hadn\u0027t been able to stop fantasizing about her sexy Italian boss, even as she adamantly refused to open the door to any other feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the media storm had broken overBonnie\u0027s lover, she\u0027d wanted to slap the other woman for throwing away a man ofJackson\u0027s worth. Though she\u0027d had no right, she\u0027d ached to go to him, and try and soothe his unbearable pain. How dare that woman hurtJacksonwhere he was most vulnerable\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; in that proud heart of his?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been over a year since their last meeting but her feelings hadn\u0027t changed. Even her upsetting experience at Donald\u0027s hands couldn\u0027t alter that, because she trustedJacksonon a gut level. She\u0027d never felt safe with a man until he\u0027d started bullying her with his protectiveness, walking her to her car and more than once following her home late at night to ensure that she arrived safely. And he\u0027d never made any demands in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was, her sexy ex-boss still made her burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacksonwas stunned byTaylor\u0027s little speech. Nobody had ever called him gorgeous, not even starlets who thought he might be influenced by flattery. That was a lie too big even for them. And yet he knew that the woman in the passenger seat did not tell lies. Who else butTaylorwould\u0027ve dared to inform him that he looked like he was strung out on cocaine when he\u0027d dragged himself into the office one Monday after fighting with Bonnie all weekend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question was,what was he going to do with the knowledge that she considered him gorgeous? At that moment, his attention was caught by flashing red lights up ahead. \"Looks like there might have been an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope no one was hurt.\"Taylorleaned forward, blanket clutched tight. When he glanced at her, he saw that heat had given her face a soft pink glow that was at once enchanting and innocently seductive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see.\" Reaching the poncho-clad cop standing in the middle of the street, he wound down the window. Sharp drops of rain immediately assaulted his face. \"What\u0027s the problem, officer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man leaned down. His eyes flicked toTaylorand then back toJackson. \"There\u0027s been a three-car crash up ahead. Pretty messy. We\u0027re detouring people up through there.\" He pointed to an upward-sloping street on his right, the route marked with orange safety cones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacksonnodded. \"Was anyone badly injured?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No fatalities.\" His relief was clear. \"Drive safely.\" Moving back, he let them pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter turning up the small incline,Jacksonsaid, \"Look, you need to dry out and with this detour and the weather, we won\u0027t reach your place for at least another hour.\" Water sloshed around the tires as he came to a level section of the road. \"You can spend the night at my place\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; the drive will only take twenty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t do that!\" she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" It angered him that she didn\u0027t trust him, when he\u0027d never given her reason not to. Okay, so maybe he\u0027d yelled at her once or twice while she\u0027d been his secretary, but she\u0027d yelled right back and they\u0027d got along fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, she surprised him. \"Because paparazzi stalk you. They\u0027re probably hiding in the bushes by the door. I don\u0027t want to be famous.\" She sounded determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head at her amazing mind. \"If there is a paparazzo there tonight, piccola , I swear I\u0027ll beat him up for you.\" The endearment slipped out without thought. \"Of course, he\u0027s probably already drowned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA laugh escaped her. \"Well, if you promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraffic being much lighter on this side of the city, they reached his eight-month-oldMissionBayhome in less time than he\u0027d anticipated. Pressing an electronic key, he drove the car through the security gates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout fifty meters up the drive he pushed another button to raise the garage door before driving in. It shut behind them, enclosing them in a dry haven lit with a strong white bulb. The sound of rain on hard surfaces was muted to a soft lullaby, lending an unexpected intimacy to the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think garages should have bleary yellow lights?\"Taylorstretched out to pop her door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let her lighten the mood, giving her space. For now. \"You think something\u0027s wrong with my ambience?\" Stepping out, he found her standing beside her door like some sort of disheveled fairy wrapped in tartan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrinkled her nose at him. \"When I\u0027m no longer in danger of turning into an icicle, I\u0027ll tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting back his first real smile for a year, he led her out of the garage, through the converted basement which he used as a gym, and up to the first floor of his home. \"Bathroom\u0027s upstairs on the right.\" He pointed to the stairs leading up from the living room. \"There should be fresh towels on the rails. I think the cleaning service came today. I\u0027ll find you a robe and throw it through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t peek.\" She started to struggle up the stairs, trying not to trip on the blanket she refused to release, an empress giving an order to a lowly servant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head at her impudence, he dropped his keys on a table in the living area and walked into his study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the blinking message light on his phone, he placed a call to the Auckland Police Station. As usual, Detective Cole McKenna was pulling the graveyard shift. AfterJacksonexplained the matter to one of the few men he trusted implicitly, Cole swore creatively under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your lady doesn\u0027t want to press charges?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacksonthought aboutTaylor\u0027s attempts to brush off the entire incident. \"I\u0027d like to take care of it without pulling her into something messy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s what I figured. I need a diversion from paperwork anyway. Let\u0027s see\u0026nbsp; -\u0026nbsp; Donald Carson, Project Director atDracena Medical.\" He tapped some keys. \"Got him. I think3:00 a.m.sounds like a good time for a visit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacksonitched to face Carson himself but he\u0027d made a promise and if he saw the man, he\u0027d surely break it. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll swing by your place and drop off yourTaylor\u0027s purse when I\u0027m heading off shift, just after six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes,Jacksonthought, she was his . \"I don\u0027t want Taylor to start thinking I\u0027m about to get arrested so leave the black and white at the station,\" he joked, trying not to let his frustration at being unable to act himself seep into his tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole chuckled, seeing through him. \"Lady must be something special if you\u0027re trying to behave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hung up on that note. His tension easing now that he\u0027d done something about the man who\u0027d dared to hurtTaylor, he quickly played back his messages. All four were from very smart people, including his mother, wanting something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demanding note in his mother\u0027s voice wasn\u0027t unusual. A rising star when she\u0027d inconveniently fallen pregnant with Jackson to AnthonySantorini , her husband at the time, Liz Carlyle had had neither the time nor the inclination to raise her son. She\u0027d saved that for his half brotherCarlton, born almost ten years later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Anthony, the celebrated director\u0027s paternal instincts had finally kicked in nine years afterJackson\u0027s birth, when he\u0027d sired Mario closely followed by Valetta, with wife number three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, now thatJacksonwas a success, both Liz and Anthony preferred to forget that the closest they\u0027d ever come to parenting him was writing checks for boarding schools and nannies. Neither had any compunction against using family ties to solicit his help. Frowning, he noted the details of the messages before erasing them. He\u0027d take care of their requests later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he took care ofTaylor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeading upstairs, he passed the closed door of his admittedly huge bathroom and entered his bedroom, knowing he had an unused robe someplace. Except when he reached the closet, he picked out his favorite. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/awaken-to-pleasure/page-3.html","bookId":1881,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:23 PM"}
