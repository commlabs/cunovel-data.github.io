The soldiers were therefore enabled to enjoy a much needed rest; besides they had found stores of cloth, shoes, food and forage at Guermesheim, at Kaiserlauten, and at Landau; a single store at Kaiserlautern having supplied them with one thousand woollen comforters. The time had therefore come for Pichegru to keep his promises.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Estève\u0027s accounts had been rendered, and the twenty-five thousand francs, deposited to the credit of the battalion of the Indre with the general, had been increased by twelve hundred, the price of the two cannon which the battalion had captured. This sum of twenty-six thousand two hundred francs was enormous, for it was all in gold; and the gold louis at that time was worth seven hundred and twelve francs in paper money.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The general sent for Faraud and the two soldiers who had accompanied him each time that he had come as ambassador from the battalion. The three appeared, Faraud[Pg 220] with his sergeant-major\u0027s stripes, and one of the others with corporal\u0027s stripes, which he had earned since his first interview with the general.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Here I am, general,\" said Faraud; \"and here are my two comrades, Corporal Groseiller and Comrade Vincent.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are all three welcome.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are very kind, general,\" said Faraud, with the twist of the neck which was peculiar to him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You know that a sum of twenty-five thousand francs has been allotted for the widows and orphans of the dead of the battalion of the Indre.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, general,\" replied Faraud.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To which sum the battalion has added another twelve hundred francs.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, general. And by the same token, it was an idiot named Faraud who was carrying it in his handkerchief and who let it fall for sheer joy on hearing that he had been made a sergeant-major.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will you give me your word that he will not do it again?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Word of a sergeant-major! not even if you should make him a colonel.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We have not got as far as that yet.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So much the worse, general.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But still I am going to promote you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Again?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am going to make you paymaster.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In place of citizen Estève?\" said Faraud, with his peculiar twist of the head. \"Thanks, general, the place is a good one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, not quite that,\" said Pichegru, smiling at the fraternal familiarity which makes the strength of the army, and which the Revolution introduced into that of the Republic.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Too bad,\" said Faraud.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 221]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I appoint you paymaster in the department of the Indre to the extent of twenty-six thousand and two hundred francs. In other words, I charge you and your two comrades, whose conduct has given me satisfaction, to divide the sum among the families whose names you will find there.\" And the general gave Faraud a list.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah! general,\" said Faraud, \"that is indeed a reward! What a pity that they have done away with the good God!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why so?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Because the prayers of these good folks would have taken us straight to heaven.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" said Pichegru, \"it is probable that when you are ready to go there, there will be a restoration. And now how will you go?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where, general?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To the Indre. There are a good many departments to cross before you get there.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"On foot, general; that will take time, though.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wanted to hear you say that, brave hearts that you are! Here, this is the money for your expenses, nine hundred francs in all—three hundred for each of you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We could go to the end of the world with that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you must not stop at every tavern for a drink.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We shall stop nowhere.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nowhere?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No. I shall take the Goddess of Reason with me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then we will have to add three hundred francs for the Goddess of Reason. Here is a draft on citizen Estève.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thanks, general; and when must we start?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"As soon as possible.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To-day?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, go, my brave fellows; but at the first shot—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will find us at our posts, general.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good, and now go tell them to send citizen Falou to me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He will be here in five minutes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The three messengers bowed and went out. Five min[Pg 222]utes later, citizen Falou presented himself, wearing the general\u0027s sword at his side with great dignity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Since the general had seen him his face had undergone a change. A gash, beginning at the ear and extending to his upper lip, had cut open his right cheek; the flesh was held in place by strips of plaster.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah!\" said Pichegru, \"it looks as if your defence had come rather late.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s not it, general,\" replied Falou; \"but they were three to my one; and before I had time to kill the other two, the third had given me this razor-cut. It\u0027s nothing; it would be healed already if we had had any wind. Unfortunately the weather is damp.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, upon my honor, I am not sorry that it has happened to you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thanks, general; a fine scar like that does not harm a chasseur\u0027s face.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That was not what I meant.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What then?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It will give me an excuse to send you away.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Say, general, no jokes; it is not a final dismissal?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, a fortnight\u0027s furlough.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What for?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To go and see Mother Falou.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah, yes, the poor old woman; that\u0027s so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you not your back-pay to carry her?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah! general, you have no idea of the quantity of brandy compresses that I had to put on this wound! It is like a mouth, it drinks and drinks, you have no idea how much.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"In other words your pay is almost gone?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Worse than my sword was when you were good enough to give me this one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then I will do for your pay what I did for your sword.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will you give me more?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh! the Prince de Condé will pay the piper!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 223]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Gold!

Charles!\" called Pichegru.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A door opened, and Charles, who was in an adjoining room, hurried in. \"Here I am, general,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you know where Abatucci is?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"With us, general.

My choice of you to carry the captured flags to the Convention, as well as the rank I have just bestowed upon you, proves my esteem for your courage and ability.
