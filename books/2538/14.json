Bryn put a hand on his arm, holding him in place. “Joe.” She got his full, alert attention. “Thanks. You’re sure I’m not putting anybody in danger by being here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “You really think I’d bring you within a mile of my kids if I thought there was any chance at all of that? Bryn, you’re a nice girl, and I admit, I got you brought back mostly because I felt I’d let you down. But you ever pose any danger to my family and I’ll make you permanently dead, and I won’t hesitate for a second.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe believed him. She let go, and Joe picked up her empties and cleaned up the table, just like a normal guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I ever did pose a danger to them, I’d want you to do it,” she said. “You’ve got a lovely family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You say that now; wait until you spend a couple of hours with the little terrors,” he said. “Come on. I owe Jeff a video game or two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormal life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryn wondered if she would ever have this again, this taste of a future, of life, of family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she thought, if this is all I get, I might as well enjoy it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, the family had breakfast, and Joe drove Bryn to drop off Mr. French at her apartment, and then to see what was left of Fairview Mortuary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a grim sight. Most of the building was still standing, but the other part was blackened and had collapsed in on itself. The serene little garden out front had been trampled into mush by firefighters and emergency crews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you stage a rescue, you don’t go about it subtly, do you?” she asked. Joe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I tried that,” he said. “Fairview had hardened the doors. Only choice I had was to break down the loading-dock wall, and I had to use explosives to do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you just carry those around with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he said, “I do. In my job, it pays to be prepared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like a Boy Scout.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With C-four.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a substantial number of trucks pulled up in the driveway, unloading materials. Repairs, it seemed, were already under way, and a work crew in hard hats was swarming around the place looking purposeful. Bryn got out of the SUV and walked toward the building, then stopped. She turned to Joe. “What about the bodies?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which bodies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fairview, Fast Freddy, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, Mr. Garcia …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The basement bodies. They were removed already.” Joe cleared his throat. “Mrs. Jones and Mr. Garcia were special problems. They were, ah, cleared separately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe meant dismembered. Or burned. Or both. Bryn felt a little wave of faintness come over her, and had to grip Fideli’s arm tight for a second until it passed. He didn’t say anything about it, which she appreciated. Once she felt steady again, she started to walk on—and then stopped, stock-still. She turned to look at Fideli. “Just those two?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he said, and his brows came down to a level, concerned line. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because Fast Freddy was the same. Like me, I mean. Revived.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck,” he spat, and pulled out his cell phone. He turned away and marched off, talking softly but quickly. She waited. He finally finished and came back, looking even grimmer. “Should have done a blood test. Damn it. Body’s already been processed and sent off for cremation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well—that’s okay, then, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would have been,” he said, “except that nobody had any warning ol’ Freddy might get all better, get up, and walk away. Which he did. He’s in the wind.” He shook his head. “Listen, Bryn, I’ve got to get back—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, of course. I’ll be fine, Joe. Thank you for … for everything.” Including, she thought, the clothes on her back … a gift from Kylie of a butter-soft tan sweater and jeans that fit like a dream. Even the shoes—loafers again— were her size, or close enough. Kylie had gotten her sizes and gone on a midnight shopping run, and that woman had some clothing feng shui, no doubt about it. “I’m sorry. I should have told you about Freddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You had other things on your mind, and I never asked. This one’s on me,” he said. He climbed in the truck and started it up, then leaned out the window. “Forgot to tell you, your ride’s over there in the lot. It’s the black one.” He tossed her a set of keys, which she caught automatically, still not understanding. He grinned at her and backed out, then gunned the engine to a full roar on his way out of the parking area and onto the main road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryn watched until he was out of sight, then looked around again. She wasn’t quite sure what her role here was supposed to be, considering the damage that had been done—or she wasn‘t, until a big Cadillac sedan made the turn off the road and pulled up in the lot near her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy, the receptionist, got out and stood there, staring. “Lord,” she said. “I was told, but I didn’t believe it. Is it true? Mr. Fairview, gone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Freddy,” Bryn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy tore her gaze away from the damaged building and glanced over at her, lifting an eyebrow. “I’m not crying over him. Oh, you didn’t meet him, did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Bryn lied. “I went home. After … after what happened to Melissa.” That, Fideli had told her, was the official story, and it made sense. More sense than what she’d done. “I guess Mr. Fairview and Freddy were working late. They say it was some kind of explosion and fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some of those chemicals are real nasty,” Lucy agreed. “It’s just awful. Well, I suppose both of us are out of a job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Bryn took a deep breath. “I … I was Mr. Fairview’s niece.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You what? Why didn’t anybody tell me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wanted me to make it on my own. Without any special treatment. You know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s just like him, fair as always,” Lucy said. “What a good man. But still …” She let it go. “I guess you’ll be inheriting the place? I know he didn’t have a wife or any children.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Bryn said. “I’m going to get it up and running as fast as possible. You still have a job, Lucy—if you’re willing to work for me, I mean. I really need your help. You know so much, and I have so much to learn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You must be related to Mr. Fairview. You flatter just like him.” Lucy tilted her head slightly, her expression gone calculating. “So you want me to be more of an administrator, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, there’s a raise,” Bryn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much do you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy seemed startled by that, but she didn’t let it throw her too far off. “Thirty percent,” she said. “That’s only fair. There’s a lot more to really running this place than just answering the phone and handing out tissues to the bereaved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m starting to realize that. Yes, that sounds fair. Shake on it?” She held out her hand, and Lucy took it for a brief squeeze. “I don’t think we’ll get much done today. Maybe we should make lists of what we need to find first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First thing, you’d better start looking for a good downstairs man; they don’t come cheap. I do wish we’d never let Vikesh go. And we’ll have to make sure these construction crews know which permits they’re supposed to get.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think you can handle that last part?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy smiled. “That’s what you’re going to be paying me for, Ms. Bryn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did we have anything scheduled for this week?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We had Mr. Granberry down there in the freezer—good Lord, we’re going to get our asses sued off for that, I’ll bet. I’ll be in touch with our lawyer to see if he can get ahead of that and offer some kind of settlement. It’d just be the meetings you had yesterday we have to worry about, and I’ll take care of that.” Lucy thought for a second. “Hmm I think Mr. Fairview had some private meetings booked. I only know that because I worked late a couple of times and people came in looking for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you remember any names? Maybe I can contact them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy leaned against her car and patted her carefully lacquered hair as wind skirled through the parking lot, picking up ashes and random trash and stirring them ankle-high. “You think he was doing something illegal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy was quiet a moment; then she crossed her arms and stared off at the wrecked building with a distant expression. “I don’t know. He was a good man, but he had his darkness, Mr. Fairview. I know that. Those folks that came in at night—they seemed scared. And desperate. But he seemed to be helping them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucy, do you remember the names? It may be important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “He was right there, soon as they came in. I didn’t even have a chance to ask. There was a man and a woman; she looked familiar but I couldn’t place her. I saw them twice. She didn’t look so good the second time. You think he was selling drugs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,” Bryn said. “We need to find out what was going on. Is there anything you can tell me that would help?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy hesitated this time for so long Bryn thought that she wouldn’t bite, but finally she said, “You’re going to think I’m crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I promise I won’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think …” She took a deep breath. “I said the woman looked familiar. She did. She looked like one of the clients we had. And the man—I know he was a paying customer. The bereaved husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By client you mean …” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/working-stiff-revivalist-1/page-14.html","bookId":2538,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:32 PM"}
