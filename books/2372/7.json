Kate Blackwell was sitting in the very same chair as the young man. Counting back, Lionel Neuman realized with a shock that Kate must already have been sixty at the time. The image his mind\u0027s eye had carefully filed away was of a middle-aged but still beautiful woman: slim, impeccably dressed, and with a full head of glossy black hair only intermittently laced with silver threads. She was worried about her son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony isn\u0027t himself, Lionel. It\u0027s as if something has died inside. I\u0027ve tried everything I can to make him happy, but it\u0027s no use. He\u0027s determined not to marry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with Kate Blackwell was that although she sought advice from time to time, from Lionel Neuman, Brad Rogers and a few other Kruger-Brent lifers, she never took any of it. Any fool could see what was wrong with Tony Blackwell. The boy wanted to be an artist, and Kate wouldn\u0027t let him. Her ruthless trampling on his dreams eventually cost poor Tony his sanity. But Kate Blackwell could never see it that way. She went to her grave believing she\u0027d done the best for her son. That it was Tony who had let her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Tony Blackwell did marry. For a few short months he was happy, blissfully happy, until his wife, Marianne, died giving birth to their twins, Eve and Alexandra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re all dead now. Kate, Tony, Marianne, Alexandra. But I\u0027m still here. Same office. Same family. Same problems. What a curious thing life is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man sitting opposite Lionel Neuman was Kate Blackwell\u0027s great-grandson, Robert Templeton. Had Tony not married, of course, young Robert wouldn\u0027t be here. Neither here in this office nor here on this earth. But Kate Blackwell had gotten her way on that as on all things. It hardly seemed possible, but the child was nineteen years old already, six feet tall in his socks and as blond and chiseled as any matinee idol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s not a child, though, is he? He\u0027s a man. That\u0027s the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing you can do to stop me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobbie\u0027s tone was surly and aggressive. He sat forward, his delicate pianist\u0027s fingers resting on his knees, and glared at the old man defiantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m legally an adult now. This is my decision and mine alone, so show me where to sign and I\u0027ll get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not quite as simple as that, Robert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLionel Neuman ran a crepey hand through his wiry, salt-and-pepper hair. He reminded Robbie of an elderly rabbit. His nose seemed to be permanently twitching, as if he could pick up nuances of legal language purely through smell. Even his office had the air of a burrow, with its dark wood, dimly lit Tiffany lamps and wine-red leather-bound legal tomes stuffed into every nook and cranny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father has nothing to do with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobbie slammed his fist down on the desk. The top pages of Lionel Neuman\u0027s neat pile of documents fluttered in consternation, then lay still. The old man himself remained unperturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see you have your great-grandmother\u0027s hot temper. But you don\u0027t scare me, kid. I\u0027ve been shouted at by more angry Blackwells than you\u0027ve had hot dinners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a pity. Robert had been an adorable little boy. No wonder Kate had loved him as she did. But he had grown, in Lionel Neuman\u0027s opinion anyway, into a thoroughly spoiled, thuggish young man. At nineteen, Robert Templeton already had a juvenile police record for theft and drug-related offenses. Theft! What on earth could the heir to Kruger-Brent possibly need to steal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLionel Neuman had been around long enough to know that wealth on the Blackwells\u0027 scale, obscene wealth, was often more of a curse than a blessing. Robbie Templeton showed every sign of going the same way as poor Christina Onassis, lost to drugs, booze and depression. He reminded Lionel of Shakespeare\u0027s Hamlet. Denmark\u0027s prince suffered \"the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.\" Robert Templeton\u0027s fortune was certainly outrageous. Come to think of it, Kruger-Brent\u0027s market cap was probably higher than the entire GDP of Denmark. As for the \"slings and arrows,\" young Robert brought those upon himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLionel Neuman blamed the boy\u0027s father. Ever since that unfortunate incident with the gun, Peter Templeton seemed to have abnegated his paternal responsibilities entirely. He was too guilt-ridden to discipline his own children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stint in the army, that was what Robert needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing like a taste of war to whip a young hoodlum like him into shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As chairman and a life member of the Kruger-Brent board, your father has a right to be informed of decisions that may materially affect the company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he can\u0027t stop me from signing away my inheritance. He can rant and rave about it if it makes him feel better. But there\u0027s nothing he can actually do. Is there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLionel Neuman shook his head. So much anger. And arrogance. The arrogance of youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ultimately, Robert, you are correct. The decision rests with you. However, as your family\u0027s attorney for more than four decades, it is my duty to inform you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobbie wasn\u0027t listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSave it for someone who cares, Grandpa. I don\u0027t want Kruger-Brent. I never did. And I don\u0027t care about the goddamn family. Apart from Lexi, not one of them is worth a damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d come to a decision last night. Admittedly he\u0027d been looped at the time, lost in a heroin and tequila haze while playing the filthy, dilapidated piano at Tommy\u0027s, a gay bar in Brooklyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome older guy who\u0027d been coming on to him all evening yelled out: \"You know what, kid? You could do that shit for a living.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a throwaway remark. But it hit Robbie like a bullet between the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could do this for a living. I could run away. Away from Dad, away from Kruger-Brent, away from my demons. Change my name. Play piano in some anonymous bar somewhere. Find out who I really am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobbie Templeton wasn\u0027t interested in Old Man Neuman\u0027s concerns and warnings and quid pro quos. He wanted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\" He grabbed a piece of paper from Lionel Neuman\u0027s blotter. Using the lawyer\u0027s pen, he scrawled two lines that were to change his life forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI, Robert Peter Templeton, hereby renounce all claims, entitlement and inheritance left to me by my great-grandmother, Kate Blackwell, including all rights and shareholdings in Kruger-Brent, Ltd. I transfer those claims in their entirety to my sister, Alexandra Templeton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s signed and dated. And you just witnessed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanding the paper to the alarmed attorney, Robbie stood up to leave. Lionel Neuman was struck again by how unusually good-looking the boy was. Truly a gilded youth. But the telltale signs of substance abuse were already beginning to show. Bloodshot eyes, sunken cheeks, bouts of uncontrolled shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long before he winds up on the street, another hopeless, helpless, faceless addict?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix months. Tops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for your help, Mr. Neuman. I\u0027ll see myself out.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mistress-of-the-game/page-7.html","bookId":2372,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:56 AM"}
