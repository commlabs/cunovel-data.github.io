She tilted her head alertly, her eyes tracking some near-invisible movement in the undergrowth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt followed her, messenger bag slung over his shoulder. He was trying to walk quietly, too, but sticks and leaves crackled under his feet, and he winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStopping, Chloe blinked for a moment, sniffed the air, and then stretched her hands out toward the bushes to their left. \"Come on,\" she murmured, almost too low for Matt to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a rustling, and slowly a rabbit nosed its way out from between the leaves, staring up at Chloe with wide, dark eyes, its ears quivering. With a quick swoop, Chloe snatched it up. There was a shrill squeak, and then the little animal was still and docile in her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe\u0027s face was buried in the rabbit\u0027s light brown fur, and Matt watched with a sort of detached approval as she swallowed. A drop of blood made a long, sticky track down the animal\u0027s side before dripping to the forest floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaking from its doze, the rabbit spasmed once, kicking out with its hind legs, and then lay still. Chloe wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and laid the rabbit onto the ground, looking down at it mournfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean to kill it,\" she said, her voice low and sad. She pushed back her short ringlets of hair and looked up at Matt beseechingly. \"I\u0027m sorry. I know how gross and weird this is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt opened his messenger bag and pulled out a bottle of water to hand to her. \"You don\u0027t have to apologize,\" he said. Yeah, watching her feed on animals was sort of weird and gross, but less so now than the first time he\u0027d seen it. And it was a hundred percent worth it: Chloe hadn\u0027t relapsed at all, seemed content with drinking animal blood instead of hunting humans. That was all that mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe rinsed out her mouth, spitting pink-tinged water into the bushes, then took a drink. \"Thanks,\" she said shakily. \"It\u0027s been hard, I guess. Sometimes I dream about blood. Real human blood. But the things I did, in those days with Ethan, I can\u0027t really forgive myself for. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever be able to. And Ethan - why did I ever trust him?\" Her Cupid\u0027s-bow mouth trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\" Matt caught her arm and shook it lightly. \"Ethan had us all fooled. If Stefan hadn\u0027t saved me, I\u0027d be in the same situation you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Chloe leaned against him. \"I guess you\u0027re saving me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt tangled his fingers with hers. \"I wasn\u0027t ready to lose you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe tipped her face up to his, her eyes widening. Matt brushed his mouth against her cheek and then her mouth, just a light brush of lips at first, and then more deeply. Matt closed his eyes, feeling the softness of her lips against his. He felt like he was falling. Each day he spent with Chloe, helping her turn toward the light, seeing her strength, he loved her just a little more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith stretched and groaned quietly to herself. The room was dark, except for the light of her laptop screen. Elena and Bonnie were fast asleep in their beds, and Meredith glanced longingly at her own bed. Nights of patrolling and days spent at the gym meant that she had been collapsing gratefully into deep dreamless sleep as soon as she lay down lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut unlike many of the classes on campus, her English section was still meeting, and Meredith had a paper due. She\u0027d been a straight-A student in high school, and her pride wouldn\u0027t let her miss the deadline on a paper or do a shoddy job, no matter how tired she was. Forcing herself back into student mode, Meredith yawned and typed: From their first encounter Anna and Vronsky\u0027s relationship is clearly doomed to end in mutual destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudent mode or not, she was still a hunter, still an exquisitely balanced weapon, still a Sulez, and she snapped to attention as soon as Bonnie\u0027s voice rose from her bed on the other side of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t like to be alone,\" Bonnie said abruptly. Her usually expressive voice had that flat, almost metallic quality that signaled one of her visions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie?\" Meredith said tentatively. Bonnie didn\u0027t answer, and Meredith turned on her desk light to illuminate the rest of the room, careful not to shine it directly in Bonnie\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie\u0027s eyes were shut, although Meredith could see them moving beneath their lids as if she were trying to wake, or trying to see something in her dreams. Her face was strained, and Meredith made a soothing sound in her throat as she crept across the room and shook Elena gently by the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena gave a half-asleep mmph rolling over, and muttered, \"What? What?\" in irritation before she blinked all the way awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh,\" Meredith told her, and said gently to Bonnie, \"Who doesn\u0027t like to be alone, Bon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Klaus,\" Bonnie answered in that same deadened voice, and Elena\u0027s eyes widened in comprehension. Elena sat up, her golden hair tousled with sleep, and reached for a notebook and pen on her desk. Meredith sat down on Bonnie\u0027s bed and waited, staring at the smaller girl\u0027s sleeping face beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Klaus wants his old friends,\" Bonnie told them. \"He\u0027s calling for one now.\" Still sleeping, she raised one thin, white arm out above her and crooked her finger, beckoning into the darkness. \"There\u0027s so much blood,\" she added in that flat voice, as her hand flopped back down by her side. The skin on Meredith\u0027s arms pebbled into goose bumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena scribbled something in her notebook and held it up: in big letters she\u0027d written ASK HER WHO. They\u0027d found in the past that it was better for just one person to question Bonnie when she was seeing visions, to keep her from getting confused and snapping out of her trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is Klaus calling for?\" Meredith asked, keeping her voice calm. Her heart was pounding hard at the idea, and she pressed one hand against her chest as if to calm it. Anyone Klaus considered a friend was definitely dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie\u0027s mouth opened to answer, but she hesitated. \"He calls them to join his fight,\" she said after a moment, her voice hollow. \"The fire\u0027s so bright, there\u0027s no way to tell who\u0027s coming. It\u0027s just Klaus. Klaus and blood and flames in the darkness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is Klaus planning?\" Meredith asked. Bonnie didn\u0027t answer, but her eyelids fluttered, her lashes looking thick and dark against the paleness of her cheeks. She was breathing more heavily now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should we try to wake her up?\" Meredith wondered. Elena shook her head and wrote on the pad again. ASK HER WHERE KLAUS IS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you tell where Klaus is right now?\" Meredith asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRestlessly, Bonnie moved her head back and forth against the pillow. \"Fire,\" she said. \"Darkness and flames. Blood and fire. He wants them all to join his fight.\" A thick chuckle forced its way out of her mouth, although her expression did not change. \"If Klaus has his way, everything will end in blood and fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we stop him?\" Meredith asked. Bonnie said nothing, but grew more restless. Her hands and feet started to drum against the mattress, lightly and then more heavily, a rapid patter. \"Bonnie!\" Meredith said, and leaped to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a great gasp, Bonnie\u0027s body stilled. Her eyes flew open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith grabbed the smaller girl\u0027s shoulders. A second later, Elena was beside them on the bed, reaching out and taking hold of Bonnie\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie\u0027s brown eyes were wide and blank for a moment, and then she frowned and Meredith could see the real Bonnie flooding back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow!\" Bonnie complained. \"What are you doing? It\u0027s the middle of the night!\" She pulled away from them. \"Cut it out,\" she said indignantly, rubbing at her arm where Elena had grabbed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had a vision,\" Elena said, shifting back to give her some room. \"Can you remember anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh.\" Bonnie made a face. \"I should have known. My mouth always tastes funny when I come out of one of those. I hate that.\" She looked at Elena and Meredith. \"I don\u0027t remember anything. What\u0027d I say?\" she asked tentatively. \"Was it bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, blood and fire and darkness,\" Meredith said dryly. \"The usual sort of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wrote it down,\" Elena said, and handed Bonnie her notebook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie read Elena\u0027s notes and paled. \"Klaus is calling someone to come to him?\" she asked. \"Oh, no. More monsters. We can\u0027t - there\u0027s no way this is good for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any guesses about who he might be calling?\" Elena wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith sighed and stood, beginning to pace between the beds. \"We don\u0027t really know that much about him,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thousands of years of being a monster,\" Elena added. \"I imagine Klaus has a lot of evil in his past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite her quick strides across the room, a cold shiver ran down Meredith\u0027s back. One thing was certain: anyone Klaus wanted to join him would be the last person they would want here. Decisively, she clicked her laptop closed and went to her closet to pull out the weapons trunk. There was no time to be a student now. She had to prepare for war. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-destiny-rising-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-12.html","bookId":2123,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:14 PM"}
