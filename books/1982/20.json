He was in love with Charlotte, no question. He woke in the morning and his first thoughts were of her. When he went to bed at night, she was there in his mind, following him into sleep. His whole day was focused on when he’d see her again. Kiss her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jason?” his mother urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I’m sure I’ll eventually marry Charlotte.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hot damn.” His father slapped the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Jason, I couldn’t be happier.” His mother dabbed the corners of her eyes with a napkin. “I’m so pleased,” she said with a sniffle, reaching for her husband’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m happy you two are so happy.” Jason hadn’t talked about marriage with Charlotte yet, but he’d do that in due course. They were still beginning to know each other, feel comfortable together. By next summer at just about this time, they’d be ready to take such a monumental step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now this is important, son,” his father said, his eyes serious. “Your mother and I want your word that you’re not going to do what your sisters and Rich and Paul did. In other words, don’t marry Charlotte without the family being there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth backed her husband up. “I’ve waited all these years for a family wedding and I refuse to be cheated out of my last chance. Do you understand me, Jason?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry,” Jason said calmly. “When Charlotte and I get married, we’ll do it up big, just for you. The whole nine yards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A reception, with a dinner and dance?” His mother’s eyes implored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As long as Charlotte agrees, and I’m sure she will. She enjoys that sort of thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But will she mind…my helping with the arrangements?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason shrugged. “My guess is she’d welcome it. She doesn’t have any family of her own, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Personally, I don’t care if your mother has her hand in the arrangements or not,” his father muttered. “I just want to be sure you aren’t going to marry Charlotte behind our backs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already promised I wouldn’t.” Still, given their family’s history, Jason could understand his parents’ skepticism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I have your word on this?” his mother asked anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My word of honor. Only…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only what?” His mother looked concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing, Mom. Don’t worry about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I was wondering…Once Charlotte and I decide to marry, would you show her how to make fried chicken like yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t fair to bother Jason with her problems, but there wasn’t anyone she trusted more, anyone’s opinion she valued as much. Her day at the office had been one of the worst ever. Her boss, Mr. Ward, had been unreasonable and demanding in the past, but his abuse that afternoon had reached an all-time high. He’d shouted at her, called her incompetent, belittled her. And it had been over something that was completely out of her control. A client had left the agency due to a problem with accounting, not anything Charlotte had done, yet she’d taken the brunt of Mr. Ward’s anger. Unfortunately the insurance agency wasn’t large enough to have a Human Resources department, so there was no one to complain to, no recourse to speak of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t the first time and it wouldn’t be the last. For three years she’d been employed as an executive assistant at the insurance agency. In the beginning she’d enjoyed her job and thrived on the challenge. Then, six months ago, Mr. Beatty, her original boss, had retired, and she’d found his replacement to be the worst kind of supervisor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d made her decision earlier that afternoon, prepared her letter of resignation and placed it on Mr. Ward’s desk before leaving the office. Although she’d felt confident when she left work, she was vacillating now, uncertain that she’d made the right decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt always seemed to be like this. She’d become indignant, decide to leave, and later, after her anger had cooled, she’d change her mind. Mr. Ward would seem repentant, try to convince her that his outbursts weren’t personal; they were just his way. She’d start to believe him, at least until the next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it occurred to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of woman would allow a man to verbally abuse her like that? What kind of woman allowed herself to be swayed by cheap talk and empty promises? The kind of woman who’d stayed married to Tom Weston for as long as she had, that was who.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed a sounding board, someone who’d listen to her frustration and doubts without casting judgment, without anger. Someone whose self-esteem was strong enough to accept her decisions whether she took his advice or not. Someone like Jason Manning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason answered the phone immediately, sounding delighted to hear from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I had a crummy day,” she said when he asked. “Do you…would you go for a walk with me?” She considered bringing Higgins, but he was curled up with Carrie on the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be right over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Charlotte left, Carrie was talking on the phone with Brad. She hadn’t told her daughter about quitting her job, although she was sure Carrie would cheer her decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” Jason said, kissing her lightly on the lips when she stepped out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte closed her eyes. They joined hands and walked in the direction of the community park several blocks over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evening was beautiful. The fragrance of rhododendrons filled the evening air, mingling with the scent of blooming azaleas. Birds chirped and several people were getting a start on their yard work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…did something I’m not positive I should have done,” she said, keeping her eyes lowered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was it illegal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question made her smile. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why look so grave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to tell me about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, grateful they’d arrived at the park. Jason steered her toward an unoccupied bench and they sat down, his hand still holding hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I don’t get along with my boss. I’m good at my job—at least I used to be. But now…Mr. Ward makes unreasonable demands and takes out his frustration on whoever’s close at hand. Unfortunately most of the time that’s me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t seem like a healthy atmosphere to be working in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It isn’t.” Charlotte wasn’t the only employee who felt unhappy. Cheryl was on the verge of giving her notice, too, and so were a couple of the others. It wouldn’t surprise Charlotte if half the office staff left with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you should quit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made it sound so straightforward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never been a quitter. It’s one of the reasons the divorce was so difficult for me. I—” She stopped abruptly. She hadn’t meant to drag her marriage into this, lay it out for Jason to examine…yet, perhaps it was time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go on,” he urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte inhaled deeply, gathering her resolve. “I wrote my two-weeks’ notice this afternoon and left it on Mr. Ward’s desk and now…now I’m having second thoughts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why? Do you want to continue working at the agency?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you afraid you won’t be able to find another job?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not particularly—there’s always a high demand for executive assistants. It’s just…I know what’s going to happen in the morning. Mr. Ward will arrive and read my letter and call me into his office. He’ll apologize the way he always does. He seems to know exactly what to say, and when he’s through with the apology, he’ll offer me a token raise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’d be nice if he threw in a bouquet of flowers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He might. He has before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to be swayed by that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No-o.” Her voice trembled and she shut her eyes to hold back the tears that burned. “It’s so much like my marriage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Having to deal with an angry unreasonable man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes…but more than that. Mr. Ward treats me the same way Tom did, and I swore…I promised myself I’d never allow another human being to do the things he did to me. And yet I take it, day after day, and I hate myself for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason’s arm was around her now, hugging her close as if he wanted to absorb her pain. She was thankful he wasn’t kissing her; she couldn’t have endured that just then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I feel so angry when I let someone manipulate me. I want so badly to believe that things will change…that they’ll get better. But they never do. Sooner or later Mr. Ward will go back to doing exactly what he’s always done…and I’ll realize I’ve let myself be controlled again. I can’t seem to deal with the truth…. I guess it’s easier to deny everything than face the reality. Why is truth so painful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason waited a few minutes, his arm about her calm and comforting. “Is it your boss you’re talking about or your ex-husband?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Both.” Charlotte raised her head and wiped the tears from her eyes before they had a chance to fall. “Tom…had an affair. I knew it for months but…I pretended I didn’t. I made believe we were happy and in love, while doing everything I could to win him back. But it wasn’t enough…Now I know nothing would have been enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason didn’t interrupt her with questions; once again she was grateful. The effort not to weep had produced a lump in her throat, and talking was almost painful. She hesitated, head still lowered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason’s mouth brushed her hair. “Your husband was a fool, Charlotte.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t respond; she couldn’t. Jason didn’t know the full story, didn’t understand that there’d been a reason Tom had turned to another woman. Any healthy male would have, or so her ex-husband had vehemently assured her time and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m stubborn and hardheaded,” she said, her voice cracking. “I don’t know when to let go and…so I hold on, no matter how painful…or damaging.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t tell you what to do,” Jason said after a thoughtful moment, “but don’t judge yourself so harshly. Some people know exactly what to say to get what they want. Everyone needs to hear they’re important, that they’re loved and appreciated. But those are only words, and talk is cheap. You got out of your marriage at the right time and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she sobbed, “I didn’t…. I didn’t want out of the marriage, don’t you see? It was Tom who asked for the divorce, Tom who forced everything into the open. I would’ve gone on pretending forever if he hadn’t. I won’t do it again. I won’t! I’m quitting my job, Jason. I’m walking out two weeks from now and I won’t look back. I swear to you, I won’t look back.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-manning-grooms-those-manning-men-0/page-20.html","bookId":1982,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:50 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:50 AM"}
