{"id":90437,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u003cp\u003eThat Friday, Kori came to the back room for lunch. She seemed in awe of the older girls and was even absently respectful of Cassie, which was nice. Certainly Suzan and Deborah had no such respect. The strawberry blond seemed unaware of Cassie\u0027s existence unless she wanted something passed to her or picked up, and the biker fixed Cassie with a surly glare whenever they passed in the hall. Deborah and Doug - the other Henderson brother - had appeared in the back room only once since Cassie started eating there, and they had spent the entire time arguing furiously about some heavy-metal band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Faye nor Nick, the dark, coldly handsome boy who\u0027d rescued Cassie\u0027s backpack, showed up at all that week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Kori Henderson was nice. Now that Cassie knew, she could see the resemblance to Chris and Doug - the blond hair and the blue-green eyes that Kori emphasized by wearing a turquoise necklace and ring all the time. Kori wasn\u0027t as wild as her brothers, though. She seemed just an ordinary, friendly, going-on-fifteen girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been waiting so long for it, I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s finally here,\" she was saying at the end of lunch. \"I mean, just think, next Tuesday\u0027s the day! And Dad says we can have the party down on the beach - or at least he didn\u0027t say we couldn\u0027t - and I want to make it really special, because of it being a holiday, too...\" She trailed off suddenly. Cassie, following her gaze, saw that Diana had her lip caught between her teeth and was almost imperceptibly shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was Kori saying wrong? Cassie wondered. And then it struck her: this was the first she\u0027d heard about a party, although it clearly wasn\u0027t news to the others. Was she not invited?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, uh, do you think Adam will be back in time for- - for - I mean, when do you think Adam will be back?\" Kori stuttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t really know. I hope it\u0027s soon, but...\" Diana gave a little shrug. \"Who can tell? Who can ever tell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Adam?\" Cassie said, determined to show she didn\u0027t care about the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean she hasn\u0027t told you about Adam yet? Diana, there\u0027s such a thing as carrying modesty too far,\" Melanie said, her cool gray eyes disbelieving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color had come to Diana\u0027s cheeks. \"There just hasn\u0027t been time - \" she began, and Laurel and Melanie hooted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie was surprised. She\u0027d never seen Diana react this way. \"No, but really,\" she said. \"Who is he? Is he your boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only since childhood,\" Laurel said. \"They\u0027ve been together forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where is he? Is he in college? What\u0027s he like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s just - visiting some people,\" Diana said. \"He\u0027s a senior, but he\u0027s been away so far this year. And as for what he\u0027s like... well, he\u0027s nice. I think you\u0027ll like him.\" She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie looked toward Laurel for more information. Laurel waved a zucchini stick in the air. \"Adam\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKori said, \"Yes, he\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Melanie couldn\u0027t seem to find the right words. \"You\u0027ll have to meet him,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie was intrigued. \"Do you have a picture of him?\" she asked Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a matter of fact, I don\u0027t,\" Diana said. Seeing Cassie\u0027s disappointment, she went on, \"You see, around here people have a sort of silly superstition about photographs - they don\u0027t like them. So lots of us don\u0027t get pictures taken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie tried to pretend this wasn\u0027t as bizarre as she thought it was. Like aboriginals, she thought in amazement. Thinking the camera will steal their souls. How can anybody in the twentieth century think that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s cute, though,\" Kori was saying fervently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzan, who had been absorbed in eating, looked up from her lunch to proclaim in feeling tones: \"That bod.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those eyes,\" Laurel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better go easy,\" Melanie said, smiling. \"You\u0027re going to drive Diana crazy before he gets back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crazy enough to give somebody else a chance, maybe?\" Sean piped up. Looks of forbearance passed between the girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe, Sean - sometime in the next millennium,\" Laurel said. But being a kind girl, she didn\u0027t say it very loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking amused, Melanie explained to Cassie, \"Adam and Diana don\u0027t even see anyone of the opposite sex except each other. For years Adam thought the rest of us were boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which in Suzan\u0027s case took quite a lot of imagination,\" Laurel put in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzan sniffed and glanced at Laurel\u0027s flat chest. \"And in some people\u0027s case took no imagination at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you, Cassie?\" Diana interrupted before an argument could begin. \"Did you leave a boyfriend back home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" Cassie said. \"There was one guy, though, this summer. He was...\" She stopped. She didn\u0027t want to tell the story in front of Suzan. \"He was sort of... all right. So, anyway, how did Faye\u0027s date with Jeffrey go?\" she asked Suzan abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzan\u0027s look said she wasn\u0027t fooled by the sudden change of subject, but she couldn\u0027t resist answering. \"The fish got hooked,\" she said with a smirk. \"Now all she has to do is reel him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bell rang then, and there was no further conversation about boyfriends or dates. But Cassie noticed a look about Diana\u0027s eyes - a tender, wistful dreaminess - that lingered for the rest of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school, Diana and Cassie drove back to Crowhaven Road together. As they drove by the Henderson house - one of those in the worst repair - Cassie noticed Diana biting her lip. It was a sure sign the older girl was worried about something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie thought she knew what. \"I don\u0027t mind about Kori\u0027s party,\" she offered quietly, and Diana looked at her, surprised. \"I don\u0027t,\" Cassie insisted. \"I don\u0027t even know Kori, really. The only time I saw her before was when she was out with Faye on the steps. What\u0027s wrong?\" she added as Diana looked even more surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kori was eating with Faye and the others that day you overheard them talking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes - well, she came when they were almost finished eating. There was a whole group of kids, but she was the only one Faye would let stay. Faye said...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faye said what?\" Diana sounded resigned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said, \u0027I thought you\u0027d be eating in the cafeteria with the rest of the goody-goodies.\u0027\" Cassie left out the Princess of Purity part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hm. And what did Kori say to that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie felt uncomfortable. \"She said something about too much goodness being boring. She didn\u0027t stay with them long, though. I think Faye and Suzan were trying to embarrass her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mm,\" said Diana. She was biting her lip again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" Cassie went on, \"I don\u0027t mind not being invited to her party, but do you think... well, do you think there\u0027s a chance that someday I could be in the Club too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s green eyes had widened fractionally. \"Oh, Cassie. But you don\u0027t want to,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I said things last week that sounded that way. But you told me not to judge the Club by Faye, and I\u0027m not, now. And I like you and Melanie and Laurel and Kori - and Suzan\u0027s sort of okay. Even Chris Henderson is. So I thought, maybe...\" She let her sentence trail off delicately. She could feel her heart beating faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I meant,\" Diana replied. \"I meant you don\u0027t want to because you want to go back home, to California, whenever you can. That\u0027s the truth, isn\u0027t it? You said you were planning to go to college there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yes, eventually, but...\" Cassie had said that, that first night at Diana\u0027s house. Now she was no longer so sure, but she didn\u0027t quite know how to explain this. \"What has that got to do with it?\" she said. \"I mean, joining doesn\u0027t mean staying here the rest of your life, does it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s eyes were on the road. \"It\u0027s hard to explain.\" Then she said softly, \"And in any case - well, I\u0027m afraid membership is sort of limited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly Cassie remembered Deborah\u0027s words after Kori had left that day. One empty space, one candidate, you know? And Kori was part of the neighborhood. She\u0027d grown up here. Chris and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug were her brothers. She wasn\u0027t a stranger taken in just because Diana insisted, a puppy picked up off the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Cassie said. She tried to sound as if it were all okay, as if it didn\u0027t matter. But it did. It did, terribly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t,\" Diana murmured. \"But I think that\u0027s better. It really is, Cassie, believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no,\" Diana said. \"I don\u0027t have the Scotch tape. It must have rolled under the car seat. You stay here; there\u0027s no reason for us both to go back.\" She turned and hurried toward the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were early that morning. Diana had a banner that she and Laurel had painted, saying \"Happy Birthday, Kori.\" She was going to hang it above the main entrance of the school, and Cassie had offered to help. Cassie thought that was a particularly noble and unselfish gesture, considering she still wasn\u0027t invited to Kori\u0027s party. It also showed how much she didn\u0027t really mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she looked up at the main entrance of the school building that had scared her to death two weeks ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo weeks. The first week she had spent as a pariah, an outcast, someone too dangerous to speak to because it might bring down the wrath of Faye on the speaker\u0027s head. But the second week...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana, she mused, didn\u0027t influence people by frightening them. She did it much more subtly, with love. It sounded impossibly stupid and Hallmark card-ish, but it was true. Everyone loved Diana - girls as well as boys - and most of them would walk over hot coals for her. As Diana\u0027s adopted \"little sister\" Cassie had instantly gained status far beyond anything she could have ever achieved on her own. She now went around with the coolest crowd in school - and if she wasn\u0027t completely a part of it, only the real insiders knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re almost one of us. She heard Faye\u0027s words to Kori in her mind again. Well, today was Kori\u0027s birthday, and today Kori would be one of them. Today Kori would join the Club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Cassie never would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie hunched her shoulders, trying to shrug the thought off, but a shiver caught her midway through. She wrapped her arms around herself, clasping her elbows. It was colder than she was used to for late September. Laurel and Melanie had been talking over the weekend about the fall equinox, which was today too. Melanie had explained that it was the day when the hours of daylight and darkness were of equal length, which meant the start of fall. Cassie supposed it had a right to be cold. Everyone said the leaves would be turning soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie and Laurel had really gotten into that discussion of the equinox. It had seemed terribly important to them, although Cassie couldn\u0027t exactly see why. It was another of the little mysteries about New Salemers that were starting to drive Cassie crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered again and began to pace, rubbing her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hill spread out beneath her. She walked to the top of the stairs and stood bouncing on her toes. It was a clear, crisp day, and mixed in with the luxuriant green all around her she could see a tinge of fall colors here and there. The shrubs across the road - what had Laurel called them? Sumac. The sumac across the road was already red. And some of the sugar maples were turning golden yellow, and there was more red at the bottom of the hill...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie frowned and forgot to rub her arms. She took a step or two down and leaned forward, looking again. The red at the bottom of the hill was almost too red, too bright. She\u0027d never known foliage could turn that color. It wasn\u0027t natural.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA violent shiver went through her. God, it was cold. Whatever was down there was half hidden by the underbrush, but it wasn\u0027t a bush itself, she decided. It looked more like a sweater somebody had discarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027ll get ruined, lying on the damp ground like that, Cassie thought. Whoever owns it is going to be unhappy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took another step down. Of course, it\u0027s probably ruined already - or maybe it\u0027s just a scrap somebody\u0027s thrown out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it didn\u0027t look like a scrap. It had a shape - she could see what looked like the sweater\u0027s arm. In fact, it looked like a whole bundle of clothes. See, there was something like jeans lying below it...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Cassie couldn\u0027t breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s funny - that\u0027s really funny, because it looks almost like a person. But that would be so stupid - it\u0027s cold and wet on the ground. Anybody lying down there would freeze -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was moving down the steps quickly now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid - but it really does look a lot like somebody. See, there\u0027s legs. That yellow could be hair. They must be asleep - but who would go to sleep like that? Right beside the road. Of course, the weeds and stuff screen them -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was very close now, and everything had gone into slow motion - everything but her whirling, reeling thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, thank God - it isn\u0027t a person after all; it\u0027s just a dummy. Like one of those stuffed scarecrow things they put out at Halloween to scare people. See, it\u0027s all floppy in the middle... no person could bend that way... the neck looks like the neck of that doll in my locker. Like somebody pulled the head out...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie\u0027s own body was reacting strangely. Her chest was heaving and her muscles were shaking. Her knees were trembling so hard she could scarcely remain standing. And her vision was sparkling at the edges as if she were going to faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God, it\u0027s not a person - but oh, my God, is that a hand? Dummies don\u0027t have hands like that... not hands with little pink fingers... and dummies don\u0027t wear rings, turquoise rings...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had she seen a ring like that before?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook at it closer; no, don\u0027t look, don\u0027t look -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she had seen. The hand, stiff as a claw, was human. And the ring was Kori\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie didn\u0027t realize that she was screaming until she was halfway up the hill. Her legs, which had been trembling so badly, were taking her up in leaps and surges. And she was screaming over and over again: \"Help, help, help.\" Only they were such thin, pathetic little shrieks - it was no wonder no one heard her. It was like one of those nightmares where your vocal cords are paralyzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut someone had heard. As she reached the top of the hill Diana appeared, running. She caught Cassie by the shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kori!\" Cassie gasped in a strangled voice. She could hardly speak. \"Diana - help Kori! She\u0027s hurt. Something\u0027s wrong - \" She knew it was more than something wrong, but she couldn\u0027t bring herself to say the words. \"Help her, please - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" Diana cut in sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bottom. Bottom of the hill. But don\u0027t go down there,\" Cassie gasped illogically. Oh, God, she was completely falling apart. She couldn\u0027t cope - but she couldn\u0027t let Diana go down there alone, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana was flying down the stairs. Stiff-legged, Cassie followed. She saw Diana reach the bottom and hesitate, then swiftly kneel and bend forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she - ?\" Cassie\u0027s hands were clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana straightened up. Cassie saw the answer in the set of her shoulders. \"She\u0027s cold. She\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Diana turned around. Her face was white, her green eyes burning. Something in her expression gave Cassie strength, and she stumbled down the last two steps and flung her arms around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel Diana shaking, clinging to her. Kori had been Diana\u0027s friend, not hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be okay. It\u0027ll be okay,\" she gasped, illogical again. There was no way for this to be okay, ever. And over and over in Cassie\u0027s mind other words were echoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeday they may find you at the bottom of those stairs with a broken neck. Someday they may find you...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKori\u0027s neck was broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was what the police doctor said. After Cassie and Diana went back up the stairs, everything that day seemed like a dream. Adults came and took over. School officials, the police, the doctor. They asked questions. They made notes in their notebooks. Throughout it all the kids in the school stood aside and watched. They weren\u0027t part of the adults\u0027 process. They had questions of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we waiting for? Why don\u0027t we just get her?\" Deborah was saying as Cassie came into the back room. It wasn\u0027t her lunch period, but all the rules seemed to have been suspended that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all heard her say it,\" Deborah was continuing. \"Suzan, Faye, and me - even she heard it.\" She gestured at Cassie, who was numbly trying to get a can of juice out of the machine. \"That bitch said she was going to do it, and she did it. So what are we waiting for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the truth,\" Melanie said quietly and coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From them? Outsiders? You can\u0027t be serious. They\u0027ll never admit Sally did it. The police are saying it was an accident. An accident! No sign of a struggle, they\u0027re saying. She slipped on a wet step. And you know what the kids are saying? They\u0027re saying it was one of us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel looked up from the hot water she was pouring over some dried leaves in a mug. The end of her nose was pink. \"Maybe it was one of us,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like who?\" Deborah blazed back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like somebody who didn\u0027t want her in the Club. Somebody who was afraid she\u0027d come in on the wrong side,\" said Laurel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we all know which side would be afraid,\" said a new voice, and Cassie jerked around, nearly dropping her juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Faye. Cassie had never seen her in the back room before, but she was here now, her honey-colored eyes hooded and smoldering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Diana\u0027s side certainly had nothing to be afraid of,\" Laurel said. \"Kori idolized Diana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she? Then why did she spend the last week having lunch with me?\" Faye said in her slow, husky voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel stared, looking uncertain. Then her face cleared and she shook her head. \"I don\u0027t care what you say; you\u0027re never going to make me believe Diana would hurt Kori.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s right,\" Suzan put in, to Cassie\u0027s surprise. \"Diana wouldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, we already know who would,\" Deborah said sharply. \"It was Sally - or maybe that moron boyfriend of hers. I say we get them - now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s right,\" said Sean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel looked at him, then at Deborah, then at Faye. \"What do you think, Melanie?\" she said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie\u0027s voice was still quiet, detached. \"I think we need to have a meeting,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean bobbed his head. \"She\u0027s right,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Diana came in. The Henderson brothers were behind her. They both looked ravaged - and bewildered. As if they couldn\u0027t understand how this could happen to them. Chris\u0027s eyes were red-rimmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone sobered at the sight of the brothers. There was silence as they sat down at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Faye turned to Diana. Her golden eyes were like two golden flames. \"Sit down,\" she said flatly. \"We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat down, and so did Faye. Laurel, after putting two cups of hot liquid in front of the Henderson brothers, did the same. Deborah jerked out a chair and threw herself into it. Suzan and Melanie had already been seated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone turned to look at Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir faces were strange. Alien. Laurel\u0027s normally elfin face was closed. Melanie\u0027s cool gray eyes were more remote than ever; Suzan\u0027s pouting lips were compressed tightly; Deborah\u0027s fierceness was barely kept in check. Even Sean\u0027s usually furtive expression had an unprecedented dignity. Diana was pale and stern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass door swung open and Nick came in. His face was like a cold and handsome stone, revealing nothing, but he sat down at the table beside Doug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie was the only one in the room left standing. She looked at them, the members of the Club, and they looked at her. No one needed to say anything. She turned around and left the room. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-initiation-the-secret-circle-1/page-10.html","bookId":2095,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:42:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:42:46 PM"}
