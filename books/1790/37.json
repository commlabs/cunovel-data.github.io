I can see you\u0027re uncomfortable with this topic. I\u0027m not going to let it go, so you might as well answer directly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara\u0027s a woman,\" Nathan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized the foolishness in that statement almost as soon as his sister did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a woman,\" Jade said. \"What does that have to do with the issue under discussion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course you\u0027re a woman,\" Nathan answered. \"But you\u0027re different, Jade. You don\u0027t behave like one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know if she\u0027d just been insulted or complimented. She looked at her husband to judge his reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine\u0027s expression showed his exasperation. \"Nathan, haven\u0027t you learned anything about women in all the time you spent with Sara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine, I don\u0027t condemn her,\" Nathan argued. \"I\u0027m still a little angry with her, but only because she wouldn\u0027t admit to me that she had told them. She shouldn\u0027t have lied to me. Still,\" he added, \"she probablyâ€”\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me guess,\" Caine interrupted. \"She probably couldn\u0027t help herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your views about women are appalling,\" Jade said. \"I had no idea you\u0027d become so misdirected.\" She realized she\u0027d raised her voice and forced herself to calm down when she asked, \"Is it because she\u0027s a Winchester that you have so little faith in her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine let out a snort. \"Isn\u0027t that a little like the pot calling the kettle black? If Nathan doesn\u0027t have any faith in his wife because of her background, she sure as hell shouldn\u0027t have any faith in him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan was becoming more uncomfortable with each question. His family was forcing him to reevaluate beliefs he\u0027d held for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course Sara has faith in me,\" he muttered. \"As I said before, I don\u0027t condemn her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you say again that she probably couldn\u0027t help herself, I do believe I will try to strangle you, Nathan,\" Jade announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan shook his head. \"These questions are pointless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan started to stand up, but Caine\u0027s next question stopped him. \"What if she\u0027s innocent? Nathan, don\u0027t you realize what that means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was more the tone of voice than the question itself that caught Nathan\u0027s attention. \"What are you suggesting?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m suggesting that if you happen to be wrong about Sara, then someone else got hold of your father\u0027s file. And that means that someone got into the War Department, breached the inner sanctuary, and got into the vault. We could damn well be dealing with another traitor. England\u0027s most carefully guarded secrets are kept inside that safe. Nathan, your file\u0027s there, and so are Colin\u0027s and mine. We\u0027re all at risk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re jumping to conclusions,\" Nathan announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, brother, you\u0027ve jumped to conclusions,\" Jade whispered. \"Caine, you must find out the truth as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damned right I will,\" Caine announced. He looked at Nathan again. \"Sara told us she was going home. It was a contradiction, though. She said she wanted to see her mother, and then she was going home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She also told us that she\u0027d disowned her family. I got the feeling that you were included in that remark, Nathan,\" Jade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother was already striding toward the foyer. \"If I have to tear apart the Winchester\u0027s townhouse from rafter to cellar, by God I will,\" he bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming with you,\" Caine announced. \"There might be more than one Winchester waiting to greet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need your help,\" Nathan replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care if you need it or not,\" Caine argued. \"You\u0027re getting it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, I don\u0027t need anyone to fight my battles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine wasn\u0027t deterred. \"I\u0027ll let you fight the bigger battle all on your own, brother, but I\u0027m going with you to the Winchesters\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns had just started down the stairs when Nathan bellowed, \"What the hell are you talking about, Caine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe infant\u0027s wail of distress echoed throughout the foyer. Without breaking his stride Sterns turned around again and started back up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the bigger battle?\" Nathan demanded to know as he opened the front door and started out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine was right on his heels. \"The battle to win Sara back,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremor of worry nagged Nathan. He pushed the feeling aside immediately. \"Damn it, Caine, lower your voice. You\u0027re upsetting my godchild.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine suddenly wanted to throttle his brother-in-law. \"Nathan, I hope Sara makes you suffer. If there\u0027s any justice in this world, she\u0027ll bring you to your knees before she ever forgives you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan didn\u0027t tear down the rafters of the Winchester residence, but he did break through a couple of locked doors. While Caine kept watch from the foyer Nathan quite methodically searched every room from top to bottom. Luck was on his side. Both the earl and his daughter Belinda were away from the townhouse, no doubt searching for Sara, Nathan surmised, and at least he didn\u0027t have to put up with their interference. It wouldn\u0027t have stopped him, of course, but it might have slowed him down a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara\u0027s mother stayed out of his path, too. The fragile-looking gray-haired woman hovered next to the fireplace inside the drawing room and simply waited until the marquess had finished his task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Victoria Winchester could have saved Nathan considerable time by simply telling him that Sara had paid a brief visit and had already left, but the marquess of St. James overwhelmed the timid woman, and she couldn\u0027t seem to find her courage or her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine and Nathan were leaving when Sara\u0027s mother called out to them. \"Sara was here, but she left a good twenty minutes ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan had forgotten the woman was in the drawing room. He walked toward her but stopped in the center of the room when she cringed away from him. \"Did she tell you where she was going?\" he asked softly. He took another step forward, then stopped again. \"Madam, I\u0027m not going to harm you. I\u0027m worried about Sara, and I would like to find her as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gentle voice helped her regain her composure. \"Why do you want to find her? She told me you don\u0027t care for her, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been telling me these past weeks that I do,\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara\u0027s mother slowly shook her head. The sadness in her eyes was apparent. Superficially, she looked like her sister Nora, but Nora had a zest for life, while Sara\u0027s mother looked like a frightened, defeated woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you want to find Sara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Because she\u0027s my wife,\" Nathan replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it true you only want Sara back so that you can have the king\u0027s gift? My Sara\u0027s determined to find a way for you to have both the land and the treasure, sir. But she doesn\u0027t want anything from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears filled the elderly woman\u0027s eyes. \"You\u0027ve destroyed her innocence, m\u0027lord. She had such faith in you all these years. We have both wronged my Sara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara has always had kind words for you, madam,\" Nathan said. \"She doesn\u0027t believe you\u0027ve ever wronged her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to call her my little peacemaker,\" she said. \"When she was older she often took up my battles for me. It was so much easier, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" Nathan said. \"What battles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just family squabbles,\" she answered. \"My husband Winston often dragged his brother Henry into our personal disagreements. Sara put herself in front of me to weight the odds more equally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan shook his head. He decided that Sara\u0027s mother had a little spirit left inside her when she suddenly straightened her shoulders and frowned at him. \"Sara deserves to find peace and joy for herself. She won\u0027t settle the way I did. She won\u0027t be coming back here, either. She\u0027s very disappointed in all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madam, I have to find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis anguish got through to her. \"You are worried about her, then? You do care, if only just a little?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan nodded. \"Of course I\u0027m worried. Sara needs me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Victoria actually smiled. \"Perhaps you also need her,\" she remarked. \"She told me she was going home,\" she added. \"I assumed she meant she was returning to you. She said there were several details she needed to see to before she left London again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She isn\u0027t leaving London.\" Nathan made that statement in a hard voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine walked forward. \"Could Sara have gone to your townhouse?\" he asked his brother-in-law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan frowned at him. \"I don\u0027t have a townhouse, remember? It was burned to the ground by a few of my father\u0027s associates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine nodded. \"Hell, Nathan, where else could she have gone? Where is your home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan turned back to Sara\u0027s mother. \"Thank you for giving me your help. I\u0027ll send word to you as soon as I\u0027ve found Sara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman got teary-eyed again. She reminded Nathan of Sara, and he smiled at her. He knew where his wife had inherited her trait for weeping at the slightest provocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hand on Nathan\u0027s arm and walked by his side to the front door. \"Since my Sara was a little girl she\u0027s loved you. Oh, she would only admit it to me, of course. The rest of the family would have ridiculed her. She was always given to fantasy. You were her knight in shining armor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s getting more tarnished by the minute,\" Caine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan ignored that insult. \"Thank you again, Lady Winchester.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine was astonished by the tenderness in Nathan\u0027s voice. When he bowed formally to the elderly woman Caine did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both out the door and halfway down the steps when Sara\u0027s mother whispered from behind, \"His name is Grant. Luther Grant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Caine and Nathan turned around. \"What did you say?\" Nathan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man who found out about your father,\" Sara\u0027s mother explained. \"His name is Luther Grant. He works as a guard, and my husband paid him handsomely to look into the files. That\u0027s all I chanced to overhear,\" she added. \"Will it help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan was speechless. Caine nodded. \"Thank you. It saves considerable time, I assure you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you tell us?\" Nathan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it was wrong. Winston went too far this time. My husband gets caught up in his greed, and he doesn\u0027t consider what his plans will do to others. I cannot let Sara be his scapegoat again. Please don\u0027t let anyone know I told you. It would be difficult for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara\u0027s mother closed the door before either man could give her his promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s terrified of her husband,\" Caine whispered. \"It sickens me to see such sadness in her eyes. No woman should have to live her life in fear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan nodded. His mind wasn\u0027t on Sara\u0027s mother, though, and when he turned to Caine he couldn\u0027t hide his fear. \"Where do I look for her now, Caine? Where could she have gone? My God, if anything happens to her, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ve grown accustomed to having her around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as close as Nathan was going to come to admitting the truth, Caine realized. He wondered then if his stubborn-headed brother-in-law knew he loved Sara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll find her, Nathan,\" he promised. \"I think we should go back to the wharf first. Colin might have some news for us. One of the men might have spotted her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan grabbed at that thread of hope. He didn\u0027t say another word until he and Caine had reached their destination. His fear was tearing at his nerves. He couldn\u0027t seem to think straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was sunset when they reached the waterfront. The streets were cast in orange shadows. Candles burned bright inside the Emerald Shipping office. As soon as Nathan and Caine walked inside Colin bounded to his feet so quickly that shooting pains radiated up his injured leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did anyone find Sara yet?\" Caine asked his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin nodded. \"She found us,\" he said. His forehead was beaded with perspiration, and he was taking deep breaths in an attempt to ease the pain. Neither Caine nor Nathan remarked upon his obvious distress, for they both knew their sympathy would only irritate the proud man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan waited until Colin lost some of his grimace, then asked, \"What do you mean, she found us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara came back here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then where the hell is she now?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She demanded to be taken home. Jimbo and Matthew escorted her. Sara\u0027s back on board the Seahawk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine\u0027s sigh of relief filled the room. \"So she considers the Seahawk her home, does she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tightness inside Nathan\u0027s chest began to loosen up. He was so relieved to know that Sara was safe, he literally broke out in a cold sweat. He snatched the linen handkerchief Colin had pulled from his vest pocket and wiped his brow. \"It\u0027s the only home we\u0027ve shared,\" Nathan muttered in a low, gruff voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess that means Sara isn\u0027t holding a grudge,\" Caine said. He leaned against the edge of the desk and grinned at his brother. \"Pity, that. I was really looking forward to watching Nathan practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Practice what?\" Colin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting down on his knees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fourteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan couldn\u0027t stand the idle chitchat long. He had to get to Sara. He needed to see for himself that she was all right. It was the only way he would be able to calm his racing heartbeat. He had to know she was safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word of farewell he left Colin and Caine and rowed out to the Seahawk. He was surprised to find that most of the crew had already boarded. The men traditionally spent the first night back in port getting drunk enough to fight anything that moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA portion of the crew stood guard on the three decks while the others took up their positions in the wardroom area. Some of the men had strung their hammocks up between the hooks in the ceiling and slept with their knives on their chests for the sake of readiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hammocks were used only in foul weather or when it was too cold to sleep on deck. It was warm that dayâ€”exceedingly so, as a matter of factâ€”and Nathan knew the men were there solely for protective purposes. They were watching over their mistress. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-37.html","bookId":1790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM"}
