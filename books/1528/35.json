Once the way was clear, he headed out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced to the Chernobyl plant as the sun sank toward twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time tomorrow, a new world would be born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:49 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouthern Ural Mountains\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk stood on a ridge and stared out across the low mountains. With the sun sinking, the valley below lay in deep shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to cross that?” he asked. “There’s no other way around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin folded the map. “Not without going hundreds of miles to circle it, which would take many days. The mine we must reach on the far side of Lake Karachay lies only twelve miles away if we cross here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk stared down at the swampy valley. The river they’d floated down dumped over this last ridge and fed into the wide valley below. Many other creeks and streams did the same. In the slanted sunlight, waterfalls and cataracts shone like flows of quicksilver. But shadowed by the low mountains, the valley floor was all drowned forests and wide stretches of open black marshes rimmed by reeds and grasses. It would be difficult to cross, and once it got dark, it would be easy to get lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed heavily. They had no choice but to cross the swamplands. He turned to where Kiska and Pyotr sat on a log. The kids still looked like a pair of half-drowned kittens. They had ridden the river for a quarter mile until the chill drove them to shore. Monk had them exit on the opposite side of the river from the hunting cats. The water should break their trail, and the river only grew wider the farther down the mountains it flowed. The tigers would have to brave a stiff river crossing to pick up their scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for the past two hours, Pyotr had remained silent, plainly worried about Marta. But at least the boy showed no panic, no sign he sensed the tigers nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce out of the water, Monk had everyone remove their clothes, twist them as dry as possible, and redress. The two-hour hike during the warmest part of the day had helped dry most of their clothes. But now they would get wet again, and the sun was setting. It would be a cold night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Konstantin was right. They had to keep moving for now. It was not safe to remain on solid ground with two tigers stalking these highland forests. The swamp would at least offer some shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk picked a path down the steep ridge. He helped Pyotr, while Konstantin held his sister’s hand. The two youngest children were fading fast. As a group, they sank out of the warmer sunlight and into the chillier shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrees grew heavier here, mostly pines and birches. But along the maze of creeks that flowed into the bog, willows draped with sullen shoulders, the tips of their branches sweeping the waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk headed out, forcing a path. The underbrush was a tangled mix of juniper bushes and berries. But the way grew clearer as the ground grew muddier. Soon they were stepping from moss clump to moss clump, which was not difficult, considering how well the mosses flourished here. The fuzzy green carpet covered rocky outcroppings and climbed up the white trunks of birches, as if trying to drag them beneath the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir pace began to slow, literally bogged down as the patches of stagnant water rose around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA piercing call drew Monk’s eyes up. An eagle swept past with wings as wide as Monk’s outstretched arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt reminded Monk of the dangers behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe increased their pace. For once, the small children seemed better suited for the terrain. Their lighter bodies floated over the sucking mud, whereas Monk had to watch each step or lose a boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next hour, they moved sluggishly, traversing less than a mile by Monk’s calculation. He spotted snakes that slithered from their path and caught a flashing glimpse of a fox as it hopped from hillock to hillock and vanished. Monk’s ears strained for every noise. He heard things lumbering through the swamps. A heavy set of antlers marked the passage of a massive elk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore they knew it, they were ankle-deep in water, moving in a zigzagging pattern from island to island. The cold air smelled dank with algae and mold. Insects buzzed with a continual white noise. The passage grew darker as the sun continued to fall behind the mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk’s steps slipped to a plodding pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin moved alongside Monk’s flank. He still held Kiska’s hand. The girl was nearly asleep on her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyotr stuck close to Monk’s hip. Monk had to hike the boy onto his shoulders whenever they crossed through deeper water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePyotr suddenly grabbed Monk’s hand, clamping hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething crashed through the trees, coming right at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk yelled, knowing what was coming. “Go! Run!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk snatched up the boy, who struggled and cried out. Konstantin splashed away, his knees high, dragging his sister behind him. Monk’s left foot sank to his calf. He tugged, but he could not free his limb. It was as if it had sunk into cement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rip and snap of branches aimed for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk tossed Pyotr ahead of him and twisted around to face the charge. He heard the boy splash into the water. But instead of running away, Pyotr scrabbled back to Monk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! Pyotr, go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy continued past him as a large shadow leaped out of the trees and landed heavily into the water with a splash. Boy and shadow fell upon each other in a warm greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk fought the hammering in his heart. “Pyotr, next time…some warning.” He wormed his foot slowly out of the muck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chimpanzee hugged the boy and lifted him bodily out of the shallow water. Konstantin and Kiska splashed back to them. Marta let Pyotr go and gave each child a tight squeeze. She came next to Monk, arms up and wide. He bent down and accepted a hug from her, too. Her body was hot, her breath huffing in his ear. He felt the tremble of exhaustion in her old body. He returned the hug, knowing how hard she must have fought to rejoin them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Monk straightened, he wondered how Marta had found them. He did understand how she had overtaken them. While they had slogged through mud and water, she had swept through the bog’s trees, closing the distance. But still, how had she tracked them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk stared back into the dark fen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she could follow them…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s keep moving,” he said and waved toward the heart of the swamps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether again, they traversed the swamplands. The reappearance of Marta invigorated the children, but the weight of the bog soon had them all heaving and struggling again. Konstantin drifted farther ahead. Pyotr hovered next to Monk, while Marta kept mostly to the trees, swinging low, her toes skimming the waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, the sun vanished behind the mountains, leaving them in dark twilight. Monk could barely make out Konstantin. Off to the left, an owl hooted in a long hollow note as full night threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin called softly back to them out of a denser copse of willows, sounding urgent. “An izba!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk didn’t know what he meant, but it didn’t sound good. Hauling after the boy, Monk found the water growing less deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed through a drape of willow branches and saw that one of the ubiquitous tiny islands rose ahead. But it wasn’t empty. Atop the low hillock squatted a tiny cabin on short pylons. It was constructed of rough-hewn logs and topped by a moss-covered roof. The single window was dark. There was no sign of life. No smoke from the chimney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin waited at the edge of the island among some tall reeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk joined him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall boy pointed. “A hunter’s berth. Cabins like this are all over the mountains.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll check it out,” Monk said. “Stay here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed up onto the island and circled the cabin. It was small, with a chimney of stacked stone. Grasses grew as high as his waist. It didn’t look as if anyone had been here in ages. There was a single window, shuttered closed from the inside. Monk spotted a short pier, empty of any boats. But a flat-bottomed punt—a raft with a pointed prow—had been pulled into some neighboring reeds. Moss covered half the raft, but hopefully it was still serviceable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk returned to the front of the cabin. He tried the door. It was unlocked, but the boards had warped, and it took some effort to tug it open with a creaking pop from its rusted hinges. The interior was dark and smelled musty. But at least it was dry. The log cabin had only one room. The floor was pine with a scatter of hay over most of it. The only furniture was a small table with four chairs. Crude cabinets lined one whole wall, but there was no kitchen. It appeared that all the cooking was done at the fireplace, where some cast-iron pans and pots were stacked. Monk noted a stack of dry wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk stepped to the door and waved for the kids to come inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hated to stop, but they all needed to rest for a bit. With the window shuttered, Monk could risk a small fire. It would be good to dry out their clothes and boots, have a warm place for the coldest part of the night. Once rested and dry, they could set out before dawn, hopefully using that raft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKonstantin helped him get a fire started while the two children sat on the floor, leaning on Marta. The older boy found matches in a waxen box, and the old dry wood took to flame with just a touch of kindling. A fire stoked quickly, snapping and popping. Smoke vanished up the chimney’s flue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Monk added another log, Konstantin searched the cabinets. He discovered fishing tackle, a rusted lantern with a little sloshing kerosene, a single heavy bowie-style knife, and a half-empty box of shotgun shells. But no gun. In a closet, he found a few curled, yellow magazines sporting naked women, which Monk confiscated and found a good use for as kindling. But on the top shelf, four heavy faded quilts had been folded and stacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Konstantin handed out the quilts, he pointed to Monk’s discarded pack. Monk glanced over. The boy indicated his radiation monitor. No longer white, it now had a pink hue to it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-oracle-sigma-force-5/page-35.html","bookId":1528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM"}
