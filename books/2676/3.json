But that is weakness, also. Continue, if you please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plays bagpipes,\" said Ramsey. He looked at the doctor. \"Now there\u0027s something: a Latin American playing the bagpipes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see nothing wrong with that, Johnny. For certain moods, nothing is more soothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey raised his gaze to the ceiling. \"Soothing!\" He looked back at the BuPsych chief. \"Why am I reading this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to get the full flavor of Garcia in mind before imparting the latest morsel from Security.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Garcia may be one of these sleepers who are giving Security so many sleepless nights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey snorted. \"Garcia! That\u0027s insane! As well suspect me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are still investigating you,\" said Dr. Oberhausen. \"As to Garcia -- perhaps; perhaps not. Counter-intelligence has turned up the description of a sleeper supposed to be in the subtugs. The description fits Garcia. Security almost called off the mission. I convinced them to go ahead by suggesting that you be primed to watch Garcia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey returned to the color photograph in his file folder, observed the sardonic smile. \"I say we\u0027re chasing shadows. And that may be what the EPs really want. If it\u0027s carried to its illogical extreme, certain Security-thinking is first cousin to paranoia -- dementia praecox type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Oberhausen lifted himself from the rattan chair. It gave off a reedy creaking. \"Do not say that to the Security gentlemen when they come to brief you on Garcia,\" he said. \"Oh, and one other thing: the commodore is sharpening knives with which to carve you if there is some error on this mission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have you to thank for that,\" said Ramsey. \"I take care of my own,\" said Dr. Oberhausen. \"Fear not on that score.\" He waved toward the viewerscope. \"Continue with your studies. I have other work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey waited for the door to close, threw the file folder back onto the coffee table, took twenty deep breaths to calm his nerves. Presently, he leaned to the right, captured the folders on the other two crew members, scanned them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Harvey Acton Sparrow. Age forty-one. Picture of a tall, thin man with balding sandy hair, a face of sharp planes, stooped shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks like a small-town college professor, thought Ramsey. How much of that is conditioned on his early desire to teach mathematics? Does he resent the fact that his hardcrust Navy family forced him to follow in the old man\u0027s footsteps?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather: Rear Admiral Acton Orwell Sparrow, lost with subcruiser Plunger in Battle of Irish Sea, 16 October 2018. Mother: Genene Cobe Sparrow. Invalid (heart), lives at Walters Point Government Rest Home. Wife: Rita. Age thirty-six. Blonde? Childless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes Sparrow know that his wife is unfaithful Ramsey asked himself. Most of their friends are aware of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQualifications: navigator -- superior; gunnery officer -- superior; medical officer (advanced first aid and pressure syndrome) -- excellent; general submarine competence -- superior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey turned to the other folder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Commander Leslie (none) Bonnett. Age thirty-eight. Picture of a heavy-bodied man (just under six feet) with brown wavy hair (artificial wave?), aquiline nose, overhanging eyebrows, the look of a brooding hawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrphan foundling. Raised at Cape Neston Home for the Unwanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the Unwanted! thought Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarried four times. Two children -- one by each of first two wives. Maintains marriage relationship with number four: Helene Davis Bonnett. Age twenty-nine. Miss Georgia of 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Unwanted, thought Ramsey. He\u0027s carrying out an unconscious revenge pattern against women, getting even with the mother who deserted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQualifications: navigator -- good; supply officer -- excellent; gunnery officer -- superior (top torpedo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eofficer of subtugs four years running); general submarine competence -- excellent plus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey looked at the note in the psych record: \"Held from advancement to his own command by imperfect adjustment to deep-seated insecurity feelings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Unwanted, he thought. Bonnett probably doesn\u0027t want advancement. This way, his commander supplies the father authority lacking in his youth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey tossed the folders back onto the coffee table, leaned back to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn association of twisted and tangled threads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow and Bonnett were Protestants, Garcia a Catholic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo evidence of religious friction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese men have evolved a tight working arrangement. Witness the fact that their subtug has the highest efficiency rating in the service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat has been the effect of losing Heppner, the other electronics officer? Will they resent his replacement?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn! Heppner was the wrong one to go! A case history with no apparent clues. Quiet childhood. Calm home life. Two sour notes: a broken love affair at age twenty-four; a psychotic blowup at age thirty-two. It should have been someone like Bonnett. The Unwanted. Or Captain Sparrow. The frustrated mathematician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleeping?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Reed, the constant tutor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s three o\u0027clock,\" he said. \"I brought a layout plan of the electronics shack on these Hell Divers.\" He handed a blueprint to Ramsey, pointed as he spoke. \"Bench here. Vise there. Wrench kit. Micro-lathe. Vacuum pumps. Testingboard plugs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I can read.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to be able to plug into that test board in total darkness,\" said Reed. He sat down squarely in the rattan chair lately occupied by Dr. Oberhausen. \"Tomorrow you\u0027re going to start training on a mock-up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow\u0027s Saturday, Clint!\" Ramsey glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t get out of here before 1800,\" said Reed. He bent forward over the plan. \"Now, concentrate on that plug layout. This here is emergency lighting. You\u0027ll be expected to find it the first time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if it takes me two tries?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReed leaned back, turned his flinty gaze on Ramsey. \"Mr. Ramsey, there\u0027s something you should understand so thoroughly that it\u0027s second nature to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no such thing as a minor accident on a submarine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Sparrow trotted down the ramp from the tube landing, slowed as he stepped into the cavernous, floodlighted gloom of the underground submarine moorage. A fine mist of condensation from the rock ceiling far away in upper blackness beat against his face. He picked his way through the pattern of scurrying jitneys, darting, intent people. Ahead of him, the bulbous whale mound of his subtug rose above the pier; a 140-foot Wagnerian diva center stage beneath banks of floodlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstructions from the final Security session jangled through his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your crew has the top Security rating of the service, but you must remain alert for sleepers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my crew? Hell, man, I\u0027ve known them all for years. Bonnett\u0027s been with me eight years. Joe Garcia and I served together before the war. Heppner and --\" His face had crimsoned. \"What about the new E-officer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t need to worry about him. Now, the inspectors assure us there are no enemy signal devices aboard your boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why this gadget in my neck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just an added precaution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about this new man? What\u0027s his E-rating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s one of the best in the service. Here, look at his record.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Limited combat experience in gulf patrol! He\u0027s practically a dryback!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But look at his E-rating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Limited combat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA jitney driver shouted at Sparrow, bringing him out of his reverie. He glanced at his wrist watch: 0738 -- twenty-two minutes until castoff. His stomach tightened. He quickened his steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn Security\u0027s last-minute details!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the ebony velvet of the mooring pool he could see the glow tubes outlining the marine tunnel. Down the 160-mile slant of that tunnel, out into the underwater deeps of De Soto Canyon and the Gulf of Mexico -- and beyond -- ranged the enemy. An enemy grown suddenly, terrifyingly, one hundred percent effective against vessels such as his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came to Sparrow that the marine tunnel formed a grotesque birth canal. This cavern carved under a Georgia mountain was nestled in the earth like a fantastic womb. When they took their vessel out to do battle they were born into a terrible world that they did not want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered what BuPsych would think of an idea like that. They\u0027d probably rate it as an indication of weakness, he thought. But why shouldn\u0027t I have a weakness? Something about fighting a war a mile and a half under the ocean -- the unrelenting pressure of water all around -- exposes every weakness in a man. It\u0027s the pressures. Constant pressures. Four men isolated in pressure, held in a, plasteel prison as they are held in the prisons of their souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother jitney scurried across Sparrow\u0027s path. He dodged, looking up at his boat. He was close enough now to make out the name plate on the retractable conning tower high above him: Fenian Ram SI881. The boarding ramp swooped down from the tower in a long graceful curve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dock captain, a moonfaced lieutenant commander in fatigues, hurried up to Sparrow, a check list in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain Sparrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow turned without stopping. \"Yes? Oh, hullo, Myers. Are all the ready crews off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMyers fell into step beside him. \"Most of them. You\u0027ve lost weight, Sparrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touch of dysentery,\" said Sparrow. \"Got some bad fruit up at Garden Glenn. Has my new electronics officer showed up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t seen him. His gear came along earlier. Funny thing. There was a sealed box with his stuff. About so by so.\" He gestured with his hands. \"Cleared by Admiral Belland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ComSec?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why was it sealed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s supposed to contain some highly delicate instruments to monitor your new long-range search equipment. It was sealed so no zealous searcher could foul the works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. I take it the new long-range gear is installed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You\u0027re battle-checking it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cluster of men at the foot of the boarding ramp snapped to attention as the two officers approached. Sparrow and Myers stopped. Sparrow said, \"At ease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMyers said, \"Sixteen minutes, Captain.\" He held out his hand, shook with Sparrow. \"Good luck. Give \u0027em hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMyers headed for the foot of the dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow turned toward a heavy-bodied, hawk-faced man beside the ramp, First Officer Bonnett. \"Hi, Les.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good to see you, Skipper,\" said Bonnett. He tucked a clipboard under his left arm, dismissed three ratings who were with him, turned back to Sparrow. \"Where\u0027d you and Rita go after the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Home,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So\u0027d we,\" said Bonnett. He hooked a thumb toward the submarine behind him. \"Final safety inspection\u0027s completed. Spare gear checked out. But there\u0027s a bit of a delay. Heppner\u0027s replacement hasn\u0027t reported.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow cursed inwardly, felt a stomach-gripping surge of frustration-anger. \"Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett shrugged. \"All I know is that Security called and said there might be some delay. I told them --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Security?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suffering Jesus!\" barked Sparrow. \"Do they always have to wait until the last minute? They had me --\" He broke off. That was classified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They said they\u0027d do their best,\" said Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow pictured the complicated arrangements which would pass the Fenian Ram through their own defense network outward bound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could take another day to set up a new passage time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett glanced at his wrist watch, took a deep breath. \"I told them 0800 was the latest. They wouldn\u0027t answer a damned one of my --\" He fell silent as the ramp beside them rattled to descending footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men looked up, saw three figures coming down: two ratings carrying heavy-duty electronics detection gear, followed by a short wiry man with dark Latin features. He wore stained service fatigues, carried a small electronic search box under his right arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don Jose Garcia,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia shifted the search box to his left arm, stepped down to the dockside. \"Skipper! Am I glad to see you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow moved back to permit the ratings to pass with their load, looked questioningly at the search box under Garcia\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia shook his head. \"For God and Country,\" he said. \"But sometimes I think I overdraw my account with God.\" He crossed himself. \"The Security chaps have had us at this floating sewer pipe half the night. We\u0027ve been over it from stem to stern four distinct times. Not a blip. Now, I say to you: they want me to make another search after we get underway down tunnel!\" He raised his eyebrows. \"I ask you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to do it,\" said Sparrow. \"I\u0027ve allowed time before our first contact point for total deep-dive inspection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say,\" said Garcia. He grinned. \"You know, I\u0027ve already gone and rigged for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow answered the grin, felt some of the tensions inside him begin to unknot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett glanced significantly at his watch. \"Twelve min --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whine of a command jitney\u0027s electric motor intruded upon him. All three men turned toward the sound. It came down the dark line of mooring slots, its single light casting an erratic Cyclops gleam upon the damp concrete. The jitney swerved up to the ramp, jerked to a stop. A redheaded man with a round, innocent face sat beside the driver, clutching his uniform cap in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow saw ensign\u0027s bars on the man\u0027s collar, thought: That will be my new E-offlcer. Sparrow grinned at the man\u0027s obvious relief upon a safe arrival. The recklessness of the base jitney drivers was a standard service joke. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-in-the-sea/page-3.html","bookId":2676,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:59 AM"}
