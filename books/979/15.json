{"id":40360,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER 15","content":"\u0026nbsp;\"You mean Ross spent five years here!\" Kirk stared in amazement at Cortland, sitting beside him. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The older officer turned toward him, shifting his position on the grassy ledge to which they had climbed for a look at the surrounding countryside. \"Yes, that\u0027s right. Ross was straight out of the Institute then, had an A-1 record, and this place had just been discovered. They thought then it might have all sorts of valuable minerals and things. It seemed like a great chance.\" He shrugged. \"As it turned out, of course, there was nothing, but nobody could have known then.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They know now,\" Kirk said shortly. He sat looking over the valleys beneath them, silent for a moment. It was discouraging to learn Ross had been here and had not turned up anything: Ross was capable, whatever else he might be, and it would take luck as well as work to succeed where he had failed. And his luck didn\u0027t seem to be working out too well, he thought, unhappily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But this might throw some new light on why he\u0027d been sent here. Maybe Ross\u0027s reason for sending the Institute\u0027s star pupil had been one he could never have guessed at the time—a gesture of sentimentality. Maybe he wanted to help these people with whom he had spent his first years as an Administrator. Maybe he wanted to make up for his own failure to help lift their living standards.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He turned toward the other man. \"Cortland, you say you\u0027ve done a lot of traveling here. How about the rest of the planet? Are any of the other villages more advanced; are the people any different?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cortland laughed shortly. \"Thinking of hiring yourself a new native staff? Your impatience about worn out bucking this one? Can\u0027t say I blame you, but it\u0027s no go. All these villages are the same. One outfit\u0027s as bad as the next. Oh, they go in for different things—one will go all out for sculptures, one will be great on weaving, and another one maybe will grow a special kind of fruit. But the people are all alike—all equally charming and equally impossible. All sweet and friendly on the surface and stubborn as mules underneath. All acting like they know something they\u0027re not talking about, like they\u0027ve got some secret hidden behind those clear, guileless eyes of theirs, some source of strength that makes them able to tell us to go to hell—figuratively, of course—when they don\u0027t like our orders.\" He leaned forward, intently. \"I\u0027d give a lot to find out what makes them tick.\" A look of insecurity, almost of anxiety filled his eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A sudden gust of wind blew a flurry of leaves against Kirk\u0027s face. He brushed them away, feeling chilled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cortland blinked his eyes, and his face resumed its customary firm look. \"But to get back to your question—this village here is supposed to be a center of government. When the Nemarians have to decide on anything that affects the whole planet, the Council in this village does it. The Council has nothing to do with the Galactic union set-up, of course. It\u0027s strictly local, was here before GU discovered this place. You probably studied up on it before you came here.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kirk nodded. Every planet with an indigenous population had its own political set-up. It was GU policy not to interfere with them, unless their interests clashed in some way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cortland went on. \"Anyone who likes being in on that sort of thing packs up and emigrates to this village. I don\u0027t know whether you\u0027ve noticed, but these people are pretty casual about moving from one town to another. Anyway, when your would-be politician gets here, the people take him in and watch him awhile, and then, if they like him all right, he\u0027s put on the Council. What a system! The truth is, most of the Nemarians consider political work something of a nuisance and would just as soon somebody else did it. They don\u0027t care for power the way we do. They look on it as just a heavy responsibility and a burden.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kirk shifted his leg uncomfortably, feeling a bit self-conscious.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"By the way,\" Cortland added casually, \"how are you getting on with that girl?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What girl?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That beautiful creature who keeps house for you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nanae?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Nanae. The beauty of the village, the girl who cooks breakfast for you, the head of the Council—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What did you say? What was that about the Council?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She\u0027s head of the Council. Didn\u0027t you know?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How can she be? She\u0027s a maid, she—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They don\u0027t have maids here. She\u0027s being neighborly. And they have sort of a \"power corrupts\" philosophy here. If you\u0027re in a position of authority, you\u0027re sort of expected to go out and do humble tasks for people once in awhile, so you won\u0027t get to feeling above them. These people like to keep everyone on the same low—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But head of the Council!\" Kirk broke in. \"She\u0027s just a young girl!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So what? You\u0027re just a young man.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sorry for the levity. But they let women do everything here. They\u0027ve got equality of the sexes, old man. They—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We\u0027d better be starting back,\" Kirk broke in. He rose to his feet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He walked silently down the hill beside Cortland, his head whirling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3075/84943.html","bookId":979,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 12:53:16 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 12:53:16 PM"}
