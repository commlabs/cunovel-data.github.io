It has a dual function, both to follow old satellites known to be in orbit and to track new ones. There are twelve satellites in orbit at this time that cannot be accounted for; in other words, they are not ours, and are not the result of announced Soviet launches. It is thought that some of these represent navigation satellites for Soviet submarines. Others are presumed to be spy satellites. But the important thing is that Russian or not, there are a hell of a lot of satellites up there. As of last Friday, the Air Force reported five hundred and eighty-seven orbiting bodies around the earth. This includes some old, nonfunctioning satellites from the American Explorer series and the Russian Sputnik series. It also includes boosters and final stages-- anything in stable orbit large enough to reflect back a radar beam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"That\u0027s a lot of satellites.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yes, and there are probably many more. The Air Force thinks there is a lot of junk out there-- nuts, bolts, scraps of metal-- all in more or less stable orbit. No orbit, as you know, is completely stable. Without frequent corrections, any satellite will eventually decay out and spiral down to earth, burning up in the atmosphere. But that may be years, even decades, after the launch. In any event, the Air Force estimates that the total number of individual orbiting objects could be anything up to seventy-five thousand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"So a collision with a piece of junk is possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yes.

That\u0027s where the satellite and the two people are now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"But they\u0027re sealed off from us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Then how do we get to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Have you ever used a glove box?\" Burton asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Hall shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Burton explained that glove boxes were large clear plastic boxes used to handle sterile materials. The boxes had holes cut in the sides, and gloves attached with an airtight seal. To handle the contents, you slipped your hands into the gloves and reached into the box. But your fingers never touched the material, only the gloves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"We\u0027ve gone one step further,\" Burton said. \"We have whole rooms that are nothing more than glorified glove boxes. Instead of a glove for your hand, there\u0027s a whole plastic suit, for your entire body. You\u0027ll see what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They walked down the curved corridor to a room marked CENTRAL CONTROL. Leavitt and Stone were there, working quietly. Central Control was a cramped room, stuffed with electronic equipment. One wall was glass, allowing the tails, were considered particularly trying. Many a scientist workers to look into the adjacent room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Through the glass, Hall saw mechanical hands moving the\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;capsule to a table and setting it down. Hall, who had never\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;seen a capsule before, watched with interest. It was smaller than he had imagined, no more than a yard long; one end was seared and blackened from the heat of reentry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The mechanical hands, under Stone\u0027s direction, opened the little scoop-shaped trough in the side of the capsule to expose the interior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"There,\" Stone said, taking his hands from the controls. The controls looked like a pair of brass knuckles; the operator slipped his own hands into them and moved his hands as he wanted the mechanical hands to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Our next step,\" he said, \"is to determine whether there is still anything in the capsule which is biologically active.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Suggestions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"A rat,\" Leavitt said. \"Use a black Norway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The black Norway rat was not black at all; the name simply designated a strain of laboratory animal, perhaps the most famous strain in all science. Once, of course, it had been\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;both black and Norwegian; but years of breeding and countless generations had made it white, small, and docile. The biological explosion had created a demand for genetically uniform animals. In the last thirty years more than a thousand strains of \"pure\" animals had been evolved artificially.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In the case of the black Norwegian, it was now possible for a\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;scientist anywhere in the world to conduct experiments using this animal and be assured that other scientists elsewhere could repeat or enlarge upon his work using virtually identical organisms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Follow with a rhesus,\" Burton said. \"We will want to get onto primates sooner or later.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The others nodded. Wildfire was prepared to conduct experiments with monkeys and apes, as well as smaller, cheaper animals. A monkey was exceedingly difficult to work with: the little primates were hostile, quick, intelligent. Among\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;scientists, the New World monkeys, with their prehensile tails, were considered particularly trying.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Many scientists had engaged three or four lab assistants to hold down a monkey while he administered an injection-- only to have the prehensile tail whip up, grasp the syringe, and fling it across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The theory behind primate experimentation was that these animals were closer biologically to man. In the 1950\u0027s, several laboratories even attempted experiments on gorillas, going to great trouble and expense to work with these seemingly most human of animals. However, by 1960 it had been demonstrated that of the apes, the chimpanzee was biochemically more like man than the gorilla. (On the basis of similarity to man, the choice of laboratory animals is often surprising. For example, the hamster is preferred for immunological and cancer studies, since his responses are so similar to man\u0027s, while for studies of the heart and circulation, the pig is considered most like man.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Stone put his hands back on the controls, moving them gently. Through the glass, they saw the black metal fingers move to the far wall of the adjoining room, where several caged lab animals were kept, separated from the room by hinged airtight doors. The wall reminded Hall oddly of an automat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The mechanical hands opened one door and removed a rat in its cage, brought it into the room, and set it down next to the capsule. The rat looked around the room, sniffed the air, and made some stretching movements with its neck. A moment later it flopped over onto its side, kicked once, and was still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It had happened with astonishing speed. Hall could hardly believe it had happened at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"My God,\" Stone said. \"What a time course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"That will make it difficult,\" Leavitt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Burton said, \"We can try tracers...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yes. We\u0027ll have to use tracers on it,\" Stone said. \"How fast are our scans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Milliseconds, if necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"It will be necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Try the rhesus, \" Burton said. \"You\u0027ll want a post on it, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Stone directed the mechanical hands back to the wall, opening another door and withdrawing a cage containing a large brown adult rhesus monkey. The monkey screeched as it was lifted and banged against the bars of its cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Then it died, after flinging one hand to its chest with a look of startled surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Stone shook his head. \"Well, at least we know it\u0027s still biologically active. Whatever killed everyone in Piedmont is still there, and still as potent as ever. \" He sighed. \"If potent is the word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Leavitt said, \"We\u0027d better start a scan of the capsule.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"I\u0027ll take these dead animals,\" Burton said, \"and run the initial vector studies. Then I\u0027ll autopsy them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Stone worked the mechanical hands once more. He picked up the cages that held the rat and monkey and set them on a rubber conveyor belt at the rear of the room. Then he pressed a button on a control console marked AUTOPSY. The conveyor belt began to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Burton left the room, walking down the corridor to the autopsy room, knowing that the conveyor belt, made to carry materials from one lab to another, would have automatically delivered the cages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Stone said to Hall, \"You\u0027re the practicing physician among us. I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ve got a rather tough job right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Pediatrician and geriatrist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Exactly.
