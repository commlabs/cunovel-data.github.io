She slept, and in her dream she was led to a place where many crosses lay, crosses of different shapes and sizes. There was a little one most beauteous to behold, set in jewels and gold. \"Ah, this I can wear with comfort,\" she said. So she took it up, but her weak form shook beneath it. The jewels and the gold were beautiful, but they were far too heavy for her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNext she saw a lovely cross with fair flowers entwined around its sculptured form. Surely that was the one for her. She lifted it, but beneath the flowers were piercing thorns which tore her flesh.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt last, as she went on, she came to a plain cross, without jewels, without carvings, with only a few words of love inscribed upon it. This she took up and it proved the best of all, the easiest to be borne. And as she looked upon it, bathed in the radiance that fell from Heaven, she recognized her own old cross. She had found it again, and it was the best of all and lightest for her. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGod knows best what cross we need to bear. We do not know how heavy other people\u0027s crosses are. We envy someone who is rich; his is a golden cross set with jewels, but we do not know how heavy it is. Here is another whose life seems very lovely. She bears a cross twined with flowers. If we could try all the other crosses that we think lighter than our own, we would at last find that not one of them suited us so well as our own.--Glimpses through Life\u0027s Windows\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf thou, impatient, dost let slip thy cross,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThou wilt not find it in this world again;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNor in another: here and here alone,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIs given thee to suffer for God\u0027s sake.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn other worlds we may more perfectly,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLove Him and serve Him, praise Him,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGrow nearer and nearer to Him with delight.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut then we shall not any more,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBe called to suffer, which is our appointment here.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eConst thou not suffer, then, one hour or two?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf He should call thee from thy cross today,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSaying: “It is finished-that hard cross of thine.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom which thou prayest for deliverance,”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThinkest thou not some passion of regret\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWould overcome thee?
