It\u0027s not dawn yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were at Thierry\u0027s house, in the elegant bedroom with the softly burnished gold walls. The window\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad just begun to turn gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so good to rest, to let go of tension, to feel her battered body relax. It was so good to be alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt as if she\u0027d been reborn and was looking at the world with wide new eyes. Even the smallest\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomforts-a hot drink, a fire in the fireplace-were immeasurably precious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was good to be with Thierry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sitting on the bed, holding her hand, watching her as if he couldn\u0027t believe she was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe healer had come and gone, and now it was just the two of them. They sat together quietly, not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneeding words. They looked into each other\u0027s eyes,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then they were reaching for each other, holding each other. Resting like weary travelers in each\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah leaned her forehead against Thierry\u0027s lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s over, she thought. I was right when I told Paul the apocalypse was coming-but it\u0027s over now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry stirred, kissing the hair on her forehead. Then he spoke, not out loud but with his mental voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Hannah heard it, she knew he was trying to say something serious and important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know, you came very close to becoming a vampire. You \u0027re going to be sick for a few days while\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour body shifts back to human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah nodded without pulling away to look at him. The healer had told her all that. She sensed that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere was something more Thierry wanted to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd... well, you still have a choice, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. Then Hannah did pull away to look at him. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, then said out loud, \"I mean, you can still choose to be a vampire. You\u0027re right on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe edge. If you want, we can make you change over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah took a long breath of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t thought about this-but she was thinking now. As a vampire, she\u0027d be immortal; she could stay\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith Thierry continuously for who knew how many thousands of years? She would be stronger than a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehuman, faster, telepathic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd perfect physically. Involuntarily, her hand went to her left cheek, to her birthmark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctors couldn\u0027t take it away. But becoming a vampire would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked directly at Thierry. \"Is that what you want? For me to become a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was looking at her cheek, too. Then he met her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want what you want. I want you to be happy. Nothing else matters to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah took her hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then,\" she said very softly, \"if you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027ll stay human. I don\u0027t mind the birthmark. It\u0027s just-part\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof me, now. It doesn\u0027t bring up any bad memories.\" After a moment, she added, \"All humans are\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eimperfect, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see tears in Thierry\u0027s eyes. He gently lifted her hand and kissed it. He didn\u0027t say anything, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething about his expression made Hannah\u0027s throat and chest fill with love..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he took her in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Hannah was happy. So happy that she was crying a little, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was with her flying companion-her playmate. The one who was sacred to her, who was the other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehalf of the mysteries of life for her. The one who would always be there for her, helping her, watching her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback, picking her up when she fell down, listening to her stories-no matter how many times she told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoving her even when she was stupid. Understanding her without words. Being inside the innermost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecircle in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer soulmate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings are going to be all right now, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly it was as if she could see the corridor of time again, but this time looking forward, not back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would go to college and become a paleontologist. And she and Thierry would work with Circle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaybreak and the Old Powers that were rising. They would be happy together, and they would help the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworld through the enormous changes that were coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sadness would go out of Thierry\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would love and discover and learn and explore. And Hannah would grow up and get older, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry would love her just the same. And then one day, being human, she would go back to Mother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarth, like a wave going out to the ocean. Thierry would grieve for her-and wait for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they would start all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne lifetime with him was enough, but Hannah sensed that there would be many. There would always be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething new to learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry moved, his breath warming her hair. \"I almost forgot,\" he whispered. \"You\u0027re seventeen today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCongratulations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s right, Hannah thought. She looked toward the window, startled and overwhelmed. The sky was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturning pink now. She was seeing the dawn of her seventeenth birthday-something that had never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappened before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve changed my destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" she whispered to Thierry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they just sat together, holding each other as the room filled with light. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-17.html","bookId":2080,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:27 PM"}
