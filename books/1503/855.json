Fen Tian, are you that shameless? This is the Grand Tournament. As a leader of a Saint Land, you actually wanted to taint the impartiality of the tournament by taking action by force. To think you’re actually someone with an established name for such a long time.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFen Tian’s initial anger that filled his heart was about to erupt and could not be contained any longer. The Blood Red Hell powerhouses behind his back were also prepared to fight with full force at any time. However, who knew that the moment Zhou Weiqing landed onto the ground, he actually blamed him instead.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Don’t tell me you did not hear me saying I concede defeat?” shouted Fen Tian in anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing nodded and replied, “I heard it! However, my Deputy Sect Leader might not have heard it. The battle between the two Heavenly Emperors was very heated up and intense - both parties were attacking each other at full force. Do you think any of them would have noticed your yells from down below? If we were to let you go up to assist, who knows whether or not you’d attack our Deputy Sect Leader instead, out of revenge? So what’s wrong with me stopping you? Ultimately, it seems to me that the people of the Blood Red Hell are unskilled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter saying that, Zhou Weiqing looked around at the powerhouses of the other Great Saint Lands and said righteously, “Everyone, are the lives of the Blood Red Hell cultivators exceptionally precious? The Passion Valley had lost a life earlier too, but what did Valley Master Huang say? Nothing at all. So why makes the Blood Red Hell so special that their people are not allowed to die? Furthermore, in the previous Grand Tournaments, was there a single tournament where there were absolutely no deaths at all? Isn’t it a normal phenomenon? If they really do have what it takes, the Blood Red Hell should send out someone stronger. If he manages to kill off my Deputy Sect Leader in a fair combat, I, the Sect Leader, will definitely have nothing to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFen Tian had never wanted to kill someone that badly before - be it before or after he possessed the Destructive Attribute. At this moment, he truly wanted to disregard everything and ignore everyone else, and attack Zhou Weiqing and the Peerless Sect. Even if he were to dismember Zhou Weiqing’s body into several pieces, it would not dispel the hatred he had towards him! This little fellow was absolutely too repulsive - he distorted the truth and insisted he was right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Fen Tian could not do that right now. He had not achieved his objectives - it was not the right time to launch a full-on offensive attack. Furthermore, both the people of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain were looking at him in an unfriendly manner.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Alright, alright. Zhou Weiqing, Wu Yunyue, just you wait.” As he was yelling angrily, Fen Tian waved his hand violently, gesturing to his subordinates to retreat. He himself had also taken a few steps back to his original position. Naturally, some people from the Blood Red Hell went to pick up the bloodied corpse. At the same time, he nodded towards a short elder who had been standing continuously next to him. The elder slowly got up and walked out, joining the battle line without saying a single word, waiting for the Blood Red Hell’s next battle.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Yunyue had already continuously won back-to-back battles, and had killed off two Heavenly Emperors in succession. All of a sudden, the Peerless Sect had secured the upper hand in the tournament.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in the next moment, Zhou Weiqing made a decision that nobody could understand.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“We concede defeat in the next battle. The Deputy Sect Leader has won several battles. He deserves huge credit. Please go back to rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Wu Yunyue could not understand Zhou Weiqing’s rationale behind his decision. He sent a voice transmission to him and said, “Weiqing, I can still fight. Let me kill one more Blood Red Hell bastard before you take me out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing shook his head and looked indifferently at him. An invisible commanding pressure flashed across his eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Yunyue took a deep breath and looked unhappily at the Blood Red Hell before returning to the Peerless Sect.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing had his own plans - even though Wu Yunyue had recovered quite a lot of his energy earlier with his help, the current battles were the decisive ones. He did not want the Demonic Emperor to drain too much of his energy, Furthermore, he had other intentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps, Xue AoTian could not see Zhou Weiqing’s rationale behind it, but Shangguan Tianyang managed to figure certain things out. To put it simply, if one were to look at the sequence of the battles, he would be able to figure it out. In the next cycle, the order was the Passion Valley, the Blood Red Hell and the Peerless Sect. That was also to say, the Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell would have to fight first, and the winner would be the one going up against the Peerless Sect. Hence, if the Blood Red Hell wanted to inflict any harm or death to the people of the Heavenly Snow Mountain or the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, it would be a lot harder. This little fellow was practically too cunning and intelligent.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second person that Zhou Weiqing sent out had caused everyone to be taken aback. Long Shiya’s plump figured swayed as he slowly walked out and joined the battle line. Nobody had expected Zhou Weiqing to send the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor out after the Demonic Emperor. Without a doubt, in doing so, he had messed up the plans of all the other Great Saint Lands, especially that of the Blood Red Hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing returned to the Peerless Sect, remaining calm and collected. Shangguan Bing’er even gave him a chair to sit. Zhou Weiqing had arrogantly sat there, secretly laughing to himself:\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;Didn’t all of you experience the great presence of my master earlier? Great, I will let you think that the Peerless Sect had exposed our hidden trump. I’d like to see how you will deal with us.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tournament continued; Zhou Weiqing had gotten Wu Yunyue to forfeit the tournament, which is equivalent to the Peerless Sect losing that battle. Hence, the next battle was held between the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain’s second participants, the two Heavenly Kings.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, the two powerhouses were sent forth as cannon fodders. However, little did they expect the current situation to occur. When the two Heavenly Kings exchanged glances, there was an intense spark in their eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this battle between the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain, even though their representatives were two Heavenly Kings, it was a rather intense battle. It seemed to be the longest battle ever since the tournament started. Ultimately, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s Heavenly King powerhouse defeated his opponent with the help of his Consolidated Equipment Set. However, he did suffer some minor injuries as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Tianyang had immediately announced that he wanted to forfeit the next battle.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo cycles had been completed thus far, since the tournament started. Apart from the Peerless Sect who had only one person who was disqualified, the other four Great Saint Lands had two people who were disqualified, and had to send in their third participant.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment Shangguan Tianyang announced that he wanted his Heavenly King to forfeit the battle, Fen Tian’s pupils clearly contracted. Even though the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain had each gotten two of their participants disqualified, they were still at the back of the battle line. Moreover, they did not lose any of their members, unlike the Blood Red Hell that had already lost two Heavenly Emperors. Fen Tian had already started to sense something amiss, albeit just vaguely.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third cycle began - it was the battle between the Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell. They continued to send out a Heavenly Emperor each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any suspense, it was clear who won the battle. The Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor managed to force his opponent to surrender within a very short period of time. It was a battle without any casualties. However, this Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor had to face the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya in the next battle.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor, that had just won the previous match, fell to the ground. He slightly tilted his head towards Fen Tian, communicating with his gaze. Fen Tian nodded his head slightly, seemingly indicating something.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the battles were not based on power but body weight, Long Shiya would definitely be at the top amongst all five Great Saint Lands’ powerhouses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body seemed to have become rounder and rosy; his rosy face clearly showed how healthy the state of his body was. He placed both hands behind his back, taking his time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blood Red Hell powerhouse snapped out of his thoughts and said in a deep voice, “Brother Long, after you.” As he spoke, took the lead and levitated.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong Shiya smiled; his plump body swayed slightly and he had already arrived within the sky. A layer of faint six-colored light appeared around his body. As his body soared into the sky, albeit indistinctly, a series of shadows could be seen behind him at the same time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Huh?” Xue AoTian, who had been watching the battles in silence, couldn’t help but make a sound the moment he saw Long Shiya’s present appearance. Shock gradually filled his eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing asked Wu Yunyue in a low voice, “Father-in-law, do you recognize the person that the Blood Red Hell sent out? From the looks of it, Fen Tian seems to view him highly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Yunyue nodded his head slightly, “His name is Devil Shen, the Deputy Hell Lord. He is one rank below Fen Tian.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDevil Shen?\u003c/em\u003e Hearing that name, Zhou Weiqing immediately thought of Shen Little Demon, who he had defeated more than once. From the name, he could tell that Shen Little Demon was connected to this Devil Shen individual before his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Blood Red Hell’s Deputy Hell Lord? From the looks of it, Fen Tian cannot hold himself back any longer!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Devil Shen flew to an altitude of a thousand meters, he was not in a hurry to attack Long Shiya. Instead, he waited for Long Shiya to stop right before his eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Brother Long, it’s been a very long time since we met, right? Is everything well with you?” Even though Devil Shen was the Deputy Hell Lord of the Blood Red Hell, he was older than Fen Tian - he was one of the biggest elders within the Blood Red Hell. He was of the same generation as Long Shiya; he was only a couple of years younger than Long Shiya.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong Shiya smiled and said, “Everything’s good. I managed to take in a good disciple in my later years. I’ve always been in a good mood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevil Shen replied, “If he was really a good disciple, he wouldn’t have dragged you into this mess. You don’t have a chance, just give up. It has been many years since you have been stuck at the Max Level Heavenly Emperor Stage, Brother Long. If you are willing to join the Blood Red Hell, perhaps I might have a way to help you break through the very last step.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been several long years since Long Shiya established a name for himself. Most importantly, he had always been a free cultivator in the past, or else Devil Shen wouldn’t have made that offer. Even though the requirement that Devil Shen brought up was simple, but he was very clear that to a Max Level Heavenly Emperor who had been facing a bottleneck for several years, the ability to make a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage was a huge temptation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“You have a way to help me make a breakthrough?” Long Shiya asked in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevil Shen nodded his head and said, “I am at least 80% confident, Brother Long. I’m afraid you won’t have many more opportunities like these.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong Shiya chuckled. His smile, coupled with his plump body, made him look rich and contented. He did not look like one of the world’s top powerhouses at all.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Over the past few years, the Blood Red Hell people had been having a lot of fun. Perhaps it’s because of the Destructive Energy, right? The breakthrough method that you mentioned, is perhaps due to it as well?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-291-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-291-3\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-291-2","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
