Ed Steinberg was alone in his office on the third floor of the new county courthouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut the door,\" her boss said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteinberg looked disheveled- loose tie, collar button undone, one sleeve rolled up higher than the other- but that was pretty much his normal look. Loren liked Steinberg. He was smart and played fair. He hated the politics of the job but understood the necessity of the game. He played it well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren found her boss sexy in that cuddly-bear, hairy-Vietnam-vet-on-his-Harley vein. Steinberg was married, of course, with two kids in college. Cliche but true: The good ones were always taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Loren was young, her mother would warn her to wait: \"Don\u0027t get married young,\" Carmen would slur through the daytime wine. Loren never consciously followed that advice, but she realized somewhere along the way that it was idiotic. The good men, the ones who wanted to commit and raise children, were scooped up early. The field became thinner and thinner as the years went by. Now Loren had to settle for what one of her friends called \"retreads\"- overweight divorcees who were making up for the years of high school rejection or those still cowering from the anguish of their first marriage or those semi-decent guys who were interested- and why not?- in some young waif who\u0027d worship them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you doing in Delaware?\" Steinberg asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Following a lead on our nun\u0027s identity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think she\u0027s from Delaware?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Loren quickly explained about the implants\u0027 identification code, the initial cooperation, the stonewalling, the connection to the feds. Steinberg stroked his mustache as if it were a small pet. When she finished, he said, \"The SAC in the area is a fed named Pistillo. I\u0027ll call him in the morning, see what he can tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteinberg stroked his mustache some more. He looked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you needed to see me about?\" she asked. \"The Sister Mary Rose case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The lab guys dusted the nun\u0027s room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They found eight sets of prints,\" he said. \"One set matched Sister Mary Rose. Six others matched various nuns and employees of St. Margaret\u0027s. We\u0027re running those through the system, just in case, see if anybody had a record we don\u0027t know about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren came over to the desk and sat down. \"I assume,\" she said, \"you got a hit on the eighth set?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did.\" His eyes met hers. \"That\u0027s why I called you back here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spread her hands. \"I\u0027m all ears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The prints belong to a Max Darrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for him to say more. When he stayed quiet, she said, \"I assume this Darrow has a record?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd Steinberg shook his head slowly. \"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how did you get a match?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He served in the armed forces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the distance, Loren could hear a phone ring. Nobody answered it. Steinberg leaned back in his big leather chair. He tilted his chin to look up. \"Max Darrow isn\u0027t from around here,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He lived in Raleigh Heights, Nevada. It\u0027s near Reno.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren considered that. \"Reno\u0027s a pretty long way from a Catholic school in East Orange, New Jersey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed.\" Steinberg was still looking up. \"He used to be on the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darrow was a cop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Retired. Detective Max Darrow. Worked homicide in Vegas for twenty-five years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren tried to fit that into her earlier theory about Sister Mary Rose being a fugitive. Maybe she was from the Vegas or Reno area. Maybe she\u0027d stumbled across this Max Darrow sometime in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next step seemed pretty obvious: \"We need to locate Max Darrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd Steinberg\u0027s voice was soft. \"We already have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darrow is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir eyes met and something else clicked into place. She could almost see Trevor Wine pulling up his belt. How had her patronizing colleague described his murder victim?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A retired white guy... a tourist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteinberg nodded. \"We found Darrow\u0027s body in Newark, near that cemetery off Fourteenth Avenue. He was shot twice in the head.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-21.html","bookId":1557,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM"}
