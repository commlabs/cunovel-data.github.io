He was on foot. He was pursuing a broad paved road, which undulated between two rows of trees, over the hills which succeed each other, raise the road and let it fall again, and produce something in the nature of enormous waves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe had passed Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. In the west he perceived the slate-roofed tower of Braine-l\u0027Alleud, which has the form of a reversed vase. He had just left behind a wood upon an eminence; and at the angle of the cross-road, by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet bearing the inscription Ancient Barrier No. 4, a public house, bearing on its front this sign: At the Four Winds (Aux Quatre Vents). Echabeau, Private Cafe.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA quarter of a league further on, he arrived at the bottom of a little valley, where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through the embankment of the road. The clump of sparsely planted but very green trees, which fills the valley on one side of the road, is dispersed over the meadows on the other, and disappears gracefully and as in order in the direction of Braine-l\u0027Alleud.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOn the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cart at the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried brushwood near a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, and a ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions. A young girl was weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster, probably of some outside spectacle, such as a parish festival, was fluttering in the wind. At one corner of the inn, beside a pool in which a flotilla of ducks was navigating, a badly paved path plunged into the bushes. The wayfarer struck into this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAfter traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the fifteenth century, surmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks set in contrast, he found himself before a large door of arched stone, with a rectilinear impost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked by two flat medallions. A severe facade rose above this door; a wall, perpendicular to the facade, almost touched the door, and flanked it with an abrupt right angle. In the meadow before the door lay three harrows, through which, in disorder, grew all the flowers of May. The door was closed. The two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an old rusty knocker.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering of May, which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind. A brave little bird, probably a lover, was carolling in a distracted manner in a large tree.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation, resembling the hollow of a sphere, in the stone on the left, at the foot of the pier of the door.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment the leaves of the door parted, and a peasant woman emerged.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the wayfarer, and perceived what he was looking at.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a French cannon-ball which made that,\" she said to him. And she added:--\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That which you see there, higher up in the door, near a nail, is the hole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg. The bullet did not pierce the wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What is the name of this place?\" inquired the wayfarer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hougomont,\" said the peasant woman.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe traveller straightened himself up. He walked on a few paces, and went off to look over the tops of the hedges. On the horizon through the trees, he perceived a sort of little elevation, and on this elevation something which at that distance resembled a lion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe was on the battle-field of Waterloo.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e①尼维尔（Nivelles），比利时城市，在布鲁塞尔和滑铁卢的西南面，距布鲁塞尔三十多公里。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e②布兰拉勒（BraineClAAlleud），地名，在滑铁卢和尼维尔之间。　　\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e从那咖啡馆再往前走八分之一法里，他便到了一个小山谷的底里，谷底有一条溪流，流过路下的涵洞。疏朗翠绿的树丛，散布在路旁山谷里，在路的另一面，树丛散乱有致地展向布兰拉勒。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e路的右边，有一家小客店，门前摆着一辆四轮小车、一大捆蛇麻草和一个铁犁，青树篱边，有一堆干刍，在一个方坑里，石灰正冒着气，一张梯子卧倒在一个用麦秆作隔墙的破棚子的墙边。田里有个大姑娘在锄草，一大张黄色广告，也许是什么杂技团巡回演出的海报，在田边迎风飘动。在那客店的墙角外面，有一群鸭子在浅沼里游行，一条路面铺得很坏的小道沿着那浅沼伸入丛莽。那行人向丛莽中走去。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e他走上百来步，到了一道十五世纪的墙脚边，墙上有用花砖砌的山字形尖顶，沿墙过去，便看见一扇拱形石库大门，一字门楣，配上两个圆形浮雕，具有路易十四时代的浑厚风格。大门的上方便是那房屋的正面，气象庄严，一道和房屋正面垂直的墙紧靠在大门旁边，构成一个生硬的直角。门前草地上，倒着三把钉耙，五月的野花在耙齿间随意开着。大门是关着的。双合门扇已经破烂，一个旧门锤也生了锈。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e日光和煦宜人，树枝在作五月间那种轻柔的颤动，仿佛来自枝上的鸟巢，而不是由于风力。一只可爱的小鸟，也许是怀春吧，在一株大树上尽情啼唱。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e过客弯下腰去细察门左石脚上的一个圆涡，圆涡颇大，好象是个圆球体的模子。正在这时，那双合门扇开了，走出来一个村姑。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e她望着过路客人，看见了他正在细看的东西。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“这是一颗法国炮弹打的。”她向他说。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e随后她又接着说：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“稍高一点，在这大门的上面，那颗钉子旁边，您看见的是一个大铳打的窟窿。铳子并没有把木板打穿。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“这叫什么地方？”过客问道。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“乌古蒙。”村姑说。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e过客抬起头来。他走了几步，从篱笆上面望去。他从树枝中望见天边有一个小丘，丘上有一个东西，远远望去，颇象一只狮子①。 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e①那是滑铁卢战场上的纪念墩，墩上有个铜狮子，是英普联军在击溃拿破仑后建立的。 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4206.html","bookId":542,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 6:46:56 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 6:46:56 AM"}
