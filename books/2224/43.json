It was black, about the size of a wine cork, and had a tiny antenna on top. “Couple of these babies for the trailer and another for the telephone ought to do the trick. They’ll pick up a whisper from fifty meters. What we’ll do is, we’ll stash a receiver in the trunk of a car, connect the receiver to a voice-activated tape recorder with four-hour cassettes. We’ll park the car about a block away from the trailer. The recorder has a real-time indicator so you’ll know what was said and when it was said. You just cruise by every couple of hours—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not going to work,” I said. “There’s no place to park the car. It’s a very dense, very high-traffic area. The car would be spotted in ten minutes. People would be asking questions about it an hour later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That makes it tougher.” Lantry set the bug back on the shelf and glanced over the rest of his equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Also, I want to be able to monitor what is being said in real time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tougher still,” Lantry said. “How close can you get?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a motel room nearby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How near?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three hundred, maybe three hundred and fifty yards as the crow flies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t you say so? Piece of cake.” Lantry snatched a bug off yet another shelf. Like the other listening device, it was black. It was about two-thirds the size of a business card and had the width of a ballpoint pen. There was a cable jack and two wires with clamps protruding from the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The double-oh-six,” he said. “It monitors telephone conversations when the phone is in use. It’s a room transmitter at all other times. It transmits on UHF so no dork with a police scanner will intercept your conversations. Great range. Just one of these and you’re covered. But it’s expensive. It retails for about five hundred and seventy-five pounds in England.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much is that in real money?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do I install it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t. I’ll do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chewed on the inside of my cheek, thinking it over. “There’s no reason for you to take a chance like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better me than you, McKenzie. You’ll only screw it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was probably right, and I told him so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can let myself in,” Lantry said. “Question is—can you make sure the trailer is empty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For how long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much time do you need?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten minutes. Maybe fifteen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next question—how many times do you need to go in? Once to plant the bug, yeah. But do we need to remove it later?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can it be traced back to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then leave it for the maid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Final question—who’s the target?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A federal agent named Sykora.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Federal agent?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“FBI”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Getting a little ambitious, aren’t you, son?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s bent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How bent?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Paper clip bent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bent enough to take violent action should we be discovered?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLantry wasn’t being sarcastic. He meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Know what’s more fun?” I told him. “Not getting caught.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but it’s the fear that makes it … Never mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need this done right away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tomorrow soon enough?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much is this going to set me back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Normally I’d give you a discount seein’ how we go back some.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But for the FBI—the price is five large, McKenzie, including expenses. Nonnegotiable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A workman is worthy of his hire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I want it in cash.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You gonna tell me why you’re doing this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marshall, my friend. We live in an age of confusion, mistrust, and deteriorating moral values.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A terrible thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I fear for the future of the Republic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to get something to eat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carport next to Pen’s trailer was still empty when I rapped on her aluminum door at 9:00 A.M. I waited a moment, listening to the wind chimes she had hung there, then knocked again. Pen swung open the door like she expected to see a loving friend on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jake Greene.” She spoke my name as if I were that friend. “Good morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you this beautiful, sunshiny day?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA simple question, yet the way she asked it made me feel as if the success of her own day depended on my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine. How are you after yesterday?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2/page-43.html","bookId":2224,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:57:25 PM"}
