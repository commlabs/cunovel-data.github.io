E.’s own family.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Only my beloved Mother—the ‘Laura’ of these pages—could have penned the words which should adequately tell all that my dear Aunt was to those who knew her best and loved her most fondly. And she, little as she had expected it, was the first of the two to be called Home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It has, however, been a great satisfaction to me to intrust the preparation of the Life to Miss Giberne; and I am glad to have this opportunity of expressing my hearty appreciation of the literary skill, the sympathy, and the fidelity to truth with which she has accomplished her task.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Averse as my Aunt ever was to any fuss being made about her, nothing would have reconciled her to the publication of a Biography, save the hope that its story might be used of God to stimulate others to consecrate their lives to the Service of Christ, whether in the Foreign[viii] or Home Mission Field. It is in such hope that it is now sent forth, with the earnest prayer that His blessing may rest upon it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e W. F.
