The girl will not be harmed. Kyle means only to explore her thoughts and alter her memory if necessary then send her on her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy and Jen are mere fledglings. They will be placed under a master\u0027s care until they are strong enough to stand on their own and cause the rest of us no harm. Until that time, they will have no contact with anyone from their past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrann will be their master?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian\u0027s soft laugh whispered along her spine. No, while Brann can remove the witch\u0027s taint and remake them, he has no patience for training fledglings. There are others among us who relish that role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye nodded, her mind lingering for a moment on the images that his words created. Though she wasn\u0027t drawn to the BDSM scene, she had hunted among its participants in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy\u0027s half-brother will not give up looking for her now that I\u0027ve told him that I think she\u0027s alive, Skye said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he must be convinced that she is dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye nodded. His personal aide is in town, waiting for my call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian licked along her neck then scrapped his fangs over her pulse. I have met very few humans who couldn\u0027t be hypnotized by us, by the Angelini. Call him to you. Let him carry the news of Amy\u0027s true death back to her brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be better if we could also send proof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian looked to Brann and Skye knew that they talked, though she had only the impression of words and not their sound. When Gian shifted his attention back to her, he said, Amy possesses a ring that she stole from her brother. Brann has commanded that she surrender it. Haley will give it to you when we return to the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they were in Gian\u0027s car, Skye used her cellular to call Martin. \"Have you located her?\" he asked without preamble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to meet with you. Immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis manic, nervous energy flowed down the telephone line. \"At your hotel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027ve got a rental car. Name a place where no one will notice us and I\u0027ll pick you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on my way to a bar named Fangs. I can wait for you there. Do you need directions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027ll get them. How long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I trust you\u0027ve been discreet and no one else knows that you\u0027ve located Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye\u0027s instinct warned that the question was more important than it seemed. \"I\u0027ve got a silent partner. He knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a tense silence. \"None of the research indicated that you had a partner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a hunch she said, \"He doesn\u0027t want the police department to monitor him as they do me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you in thirty minutes,\" Skye said, snapping the cellular closed and returning it to her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s nervous,\" Gian said. \"Untrustworthy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye laughed even though warmth flooded her heart at his unspoken concern. She moved closer, her body touching his, and the warmth became heated need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater. His voice was a husky caress in her mind. Let us deal with this and get it behind us, then there will be time to love and play at our leisure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye reached to find Rico. He was still at Toppers, but close to being finished. She could feel his body respond as her thoughts and needs brushed against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley was waiting for them as Skye and Gian moved through the back entrance of Fangs. Her hand fluttered nervously to her pendant as her gaze moved back and forth between Gian and Skye then finally settled on Skye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kyle said that you\u0027d been injured and that your clothes were bloody. I left something for you to wear, in the room you were in before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" Skye said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian pressed a kiss to Skye\u0027s temple. I will meet you in a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he walked away, Haley handed a heavy, masculine ring to Skye. \"I\u0027m supposed to give this to you. Amy said that her brother stole it from his grandfather. It was supposed to be buried with his grandfather, but her brother paid someone to remove it before they buried the coffin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye studied the ring and knew instantly why Amy had stolen in from her brother. It had the look of something old and mystical, though she could feel no magic attached to it. \"Somehow that\u0027s fitting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley twisted the pendant she was wearing. \"Thanks for finding Jen. And for not killing her...them.\" In a rush, she added, \"They didn\u0027t mean for Brittany Armstrong to die. They wanted to make her a vampire-their vampire and not the witch\u0027s. But they weren\u0027t strong enough.\" She took a deep breath, her eyes both pleading and hopeful. \"I hope we can be friends. This life is...it\u0027s hard sometimes...not being able to talk about...things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe request surprised Skye. She\u0027d had people ask her for many things, but no one had ever asked for friendship. Feelingly oddly disoriented, she nodded and said, \"I\u0027d like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley\u0027s smile was brilliant. \"Thanks.\" She moved back. \"You probably want to take a shower and change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye found it amusing that the senator\u0027s aide drove past Fangs several times before finally parking in a remote, pitch-black area of the lot. If he only knew what lurked in the dark, he\u0027d park directly under a light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched as Gian glided toward the car, toward the unsuspecting man. She followed, sure to stay in the light, to keep Martin\u0027s attention away from the unexpected menace that was Gian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was close, she heard the click of electric door locks being released. Front seat or back? she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night grows short. I will take the front and with it the blame for whatever happens. Your other mate comes to us now. Let\u0027s be done with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if Skye had wanted to argue, there was no choice. Just as Martin frowned his annoyance that she was getting in the backseat, Gian joined him in the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartin whirled and stood no chance at all. The instant his eyes met Gian\u0027s, he was trapped, his thoughts and intentions spilling out like the insides of a gutted fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe makes it easy for us, Gian said, satisfaction in his voice at the aide\u0027s plan to kill Amy and bury her in the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye laughed silently and pulled the ring from her pocket. Gian took it and offered it to Martin, along with the suggestion that he go to the place where Skye had buried the now-retrieved coffins and sleep until the sun rose. The disturbed dirt and the shovel in the trunk of his car, along with the ring were all the proof his mind would require that his plans had been successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartin took the ring and slipped it over his finger. Skye could sense the glee in him, the expectation of having the Senator in his debt for taking care of this matter. Through the aide\u0027s memories, she could see that it was a debt the Senator willingly took on, though he\u0027d been careful never to give the order directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle appeared with a shovel. At Gian\u0027s command, Martin unlocked the trunk. As soon as the shovel was in place, Kyle said, Your mate has arrived, then blended back into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian said, I will finish providing him with the details of his crime and meet you in the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye slipped from the car and went into Fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico was leaning against the bar. At the sight of him, Skye\u0027s pulse quickened and when he looked up and smiled, joy rushed through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe skirted the dance floor and got to him, wrapping her arms around him and pressing a kiss against his lips in greeting. Everything\u0027s okay? she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and leaned his forehead against hers. Yeah. There were plenty of witnesses, so I only got a little bit of my ass chewed off for letting you guys leave the scene. He gently ran a hand along her side. He healed you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think you\u0027d come here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico laughed at that. Well, what happened last night kind of put a new slant on things. He opened his eyes and stared into hers. They towed the guy\u0027s car in and supposedly found a link to his blog. Brittany Armstrong\u0027s murder is detailed in it, along with the deaths of three girls and David Olney. All of them were supposedly in the woods that night. According to what he wrote, they all died attempting to turn into vampires and he burned the bodies so they wouldn\u0027t be recovered. The captain is ready to close the case. Rico hesitated several heartbeats before adding, I\u0027ve never had a case tie together so conveniently before. But I wouldn\u0027t mind seeing this one shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye could almost hear Brann\u0027s laugher in her mind as she remembered his earlier boast. My companion has his share of useful talents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be other hunts, but this one was over. She pressed a kiss to Rico\u0027s lips. Justice has been served.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRico nodded and relaxed against her, content with her answer. Content with being here with her. He would never get enough of her, of what they had together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye could sense the moment Gian entered the club. Her blood heated and her body moistened. She turned in Rico\u0027s arms and watched as Gian glided toward them. She could feel their anticipation, their desire, their need for her. Love was a pale word for the bond that held them together and yet that was there too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGian came to a stop in front of her, his penis as heavy and engorged as Rico\u0027s. The night disappears quickly and I would feel your mouth on my cock. I would see you mounted and mount you myself. Shall we go play?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkye laughed, her heart light, her soul complete. She looked at Rico and knew that the flames danced as wildly in her eyes as they did in Gian\u0027s. Shall we?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLust roared through every pore in Rico\u0027s body. He pressed her back against his erection. Yeah. Let\u0027s go play. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/skye-s-trail-the-angelini-1/page-19.html","bookId":1765,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:54 AM"}
