The door stood open that morning, and my brave Francis John looked in when he went on his way to the well. He seen the old girl sitting on a small creepy stool by the fire, with a row of clay images baking in front of the turf. Wasn’t she singing a [176]song—and a queer cracked voice was her own—every word of it came good and plain to the ears of the lad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ye that I bake before the fire,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bring me the milk from my neighbour’s byre;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gather the butter from off the churn\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And set it forenenst me before you burn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Francis John didn’t ask to disturb her diversions at all, so he went on his way and filled up his can at the spring. But all the road home the old lassie’s song tormented his mind, and as he came in at the door he began for to sing:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ye that she bakes before the fire,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bring me the milk from the neighbour’s byre;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gather the butter from off the churn\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And set it forenenst me before you burn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With the power of the words coming from him didn’t the boots on his feet fill up with sweet milk, and it running out on the lace holes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Man, but that’s an enchanted song,” says he. And what did he do only step into four pounds of butter that fell on the threshold before him, for he never remarked it at all!\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1800/52278.html","bookId":1054,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:50:11 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:50:11 PM"}
