Just visible across the harbor\u0027s half mile of dark water was the silhouette of Hog Island against the stars, and nearer at hand he could see bare masts swaying gently to the breeze and the low swells. He heard the chuff of boots approaching from behind him, and when he turned back toward the fires he saw the lean figure of Philip Davies striding toward him, a bottle of wine in each hand. Behind him the settlement musicians had begun tuning up their random instruments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here y\u0027are,\" said Davies drunkenly. \"Who deserves the best of the wine, if not the cook?\" He held out one of the bottles, which for lack of a corkscrew had simply been broken off at the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, captain,\" said Shandy, taking the bottle and eyeing the jagged neck mistrustfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chateau Latour, 1702,\" Davies said, tilting up his own bottle for a swig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShandy sniffed his and then raised it and poured some into his mouth. It was the driest, smoothest Bordeaux he\u0027d ever tasted - and his father and he had had some fine ones at times - but he kept any pleasure from showing in his face. \"Huh,\" he said carelessly. \"Wish I\u0027d found some of this when I was scouting up ingredients for the stew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the stew.\" Half of Davies\u0027 face was lit by the firelight, and Shandy saw it crinkle in a sour grin. \"I was a youngster in Bristol, and one Christmas evening when I was just leaving the woodworking shop where I was \u0027prenticed, some street boys broke our window to snatch some stuff. What they didn\u0027t take they knocked over, and there was this ... \" He paused for a sip of the wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was this set of little carved choirboys, none of \u0027em bigger than your thumb, all painted nice, and I saw one of \u0027em fall out onto the snow, and one of the boys caught it with his toe as he ran off, and it ricocheted away down the street. And I remember thinking that whatever became of that little wooden fellow, he\u0027d never again sit in that little slot he fell out of.\" Davies turned toward the harbor and breathed deeply of the sea breeze. \"I know what you\u0027re planning,\" he said to Shandy over his shoulder. \"You\u0027ve heard about how Woodes Rogers is due here any day with the King\u0027s Pardon, so you\u0027re planning to slip away up the beach tonight, around out of sight of the settlement, and hide till the Carmichael leaves - no, don\u0027t interrupt, I\u0027ll let you talk in a moment - and then you\u0027ll walk back here and resume your cooking and lay about in the sun and the rum until Rogers arrives. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long pause, Shandy laughed softly and had another sip of the excellent wine. \"It did seem feasible,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavies nodded and turned to face him. \"Sure it did,\" he said, \"but you\u0027re still thinking in terms of that shop window you fell out of, see? You won\u0027t ever get back to where you were.\" He had a slug from his bottle and then sighed and ran a hand through his tangled black hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First,\" Davies said, \"it\u0027s a capital offense to jump ship in the middle of an enterprise, and so if you came wandering back into the settlement tomorrow after the Carmichael was gone, you\u0027d be killed - regretfully, since you\u0027re a likeable lad and you can cook, but the rules are the rules. Remember Vanringham?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShandy nodded. Vanringham had been a cheerful boy of not more than eighteen, who\u0027d been convicted of having hidden below when the brigantine he was in was fired on by a Royal Navy vessel. When the pirate ship had limped its way back to New Providence, its captain, a burly old veteran named Burgess, had let Vanringham believe that the prescribed penalty would be waived in consideration of his youth ... and then that night after dinner Burgess walked up behind Vanringham and, with tears glinting in his eyes, for he liked the boy, put a pistol ball through Vanringham\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Second,\" Davies went on, \"you cut me, after having surrendered. True, it was because I\u0027d just killed your friend when I suppose I could have stopped him less lethally - but then he\u0027d surrendered, too. In any case, you owe your life to the fact that I didn\u0027t care to have my showdown with Venner right then. But when I let you take the choice, it wasn\u0027t a choice between death on the one hand and three weeks of free food and drink on a tropical island on the other. You owe me hard service for that cut, and I\u0027m not letting you out of the bargain you made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe musicians, having found some basis for cooperation, began to play Greensleeves, and the melancholy old melody was at once so familiar and so out of place here - the tune rolling away down the lonely beach, bizarrely mocked by the cries of alarmed tropical birds - that it made all Old World things, and gods, and philosophies, seem distant and tenuous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And third,\" Davies said, the hard edge gone from his voice, \"it may be that all those kings and merchants on the far side of the Atlantic are about to see the end of their involvement with these new lands. To them, Europe and Asia are still the chessboard that matters; they can\u0027t see this new world except in terms of two purposes: as a source of quick, careless profit, and as a dumping ground for criminals. It may be a ... surprising crop, that springs up from such ploughing and sowing, and Rogers may find when he arrives that none of us need, nor could even benefit from, a pardon issued by a man who rules a cold little island on the other side of the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea breeze, a bit chilly now, whispered among the palms on Hog Island and made the pirates\u0027 fires flicker and jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavies\u0027 words had upset Shandy, and not least because they seemed to take the righteousness out of the purpose he\u0027d crossed the ocean for - suddenly his uncle\u0027s action seemed as impersonally pragmatic as the devouring of the baby sea turtles by the hungry sea gulls, and his own mission as ill-considered as an attempt to teach the gulls compassion. He opened his mouth to object, but was pre-empted by a call from the crowd around the fires behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phil!\" someone was yelling. \"Cap\u0027n Davies! Some of the boys is askin\u0027 questions too hard for me to answer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavies dropped his bottle into the sand. \"That\u0027s Venner,\" he said thoughtfully. \"How did that move go? Over the blade and fake a poke inside, then when he parries across you duck under - but not all the way around - and hit him in the flank?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShandy shut his eyes and pictured it. \"Right. And then run past him on his outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it.\" Raising his voice, Davies said, \"With you in a moment, Venner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two men trudged back toward the fires, Davies pulled a pistol out of his belt. \"If Venner plays me square I can handle him,\" he said quietly. \"But if he doesn\u0027t, I want you to hang back with this and make sure no - \" He stopped talking suddenly and gave a weary laugh. \"Never mind. I forgot I was talking to the little wooden choirboy.\" He put the pistol away and lengthened his stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShandy followed, angry with himself - partly for feeling bad at staying out of a squabble between pirates - like a child feeling bad about refusing a foolish dare! - but partly, too, at the same time, for staying out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis petticoat breeches whirling out around his knees at each ponderous step, Leo Friend reached the bottom of the sandstone track that led down from the ruined fort, and, sweating profusely in the confinement of his fantastically ribboned doublet, struck out across the sand toward the fires where Davies\u0027 crew was. Beth Hurwood strode along next to him, sobbing with fury and trying to disentangle the mummified dog paw that Friend had shoved into her hair - \"This\u0027ll protect you in case we get separated!\" he\u0027d snarled impatiently - -just before dragging her out of her windowless room and unceremoniously propelling her ahead of him down the track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough she was having no difficulty in keeping up with the laboring young man, he turned around to face her every few steps, both to wheeze, \"Hurry, can\u0027t you?\" and to peer furtively down the neckline of her dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn all these delays, Friend thought, and damn the sort of fools we have to consort with in order to get to the focus in Florida! Why did it have to be ignorant, bickering brigands that found it? Though of course if a more savvy sort had found it, Hurwood and I wouldn\u0027t be able to manipulate them this way ... and I gather this Blackbeard fellow is very nearly too clever for us anyway. He\u0027s hanging back now, letting us commit ourselves to this Florida trip before joining us; he could have got those protective Indian medicinal herbs just by purchasing them, for God\u0027s sake, but instead he has to blockade the entire city of Charles Town, capture nine ships and a whole crowd of hostages including a member of the Governor\u0027s Council, and then ask for the crate of medicinal herbs as ransom. I wish I knew, thought Friend, whether the man is just showing off, just keeping his crew in battle trim, or whether he\u0027s using all that spectacle to conceal some furtive other purpose. But what plans could the man have that would involve the all-too-civilized and law-and-orderly Carolina coast?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced again at Beth Hurwood, who had finally pulled the dog paw free of her hair, and as she flung it away he whispered a quick phrase and caressed the air, and her dress flew up - but she forced it back down before he\u0027d seen anything more than her knees. Oh, just wait, girl, he thought, his mouth going dry and his heart thumping even faster - soon enough you\u0027ll be so hungry for me you won\u0027t be able to take a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend came blundering into the fireside crowd just as Davies entered it from the beach side. The pirate chief was grinning confidently, and Friend rolled his eyes in exasperation. Oh, spare us the brave show, captain, thought the fat physician; you\u0027re in no danger from anyone here ... unless you really annoy me with your gallant posturing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, here\u0027s our captain!\" cried one of the pirates, a stocky red-haired man with a broad, freckled, smiling face; and though some of the men in the crowd were frowning angrily, Friend watched this smiling man, for he sensed that it was he who posed the threat. \"Phil,\" the man said earnestly, \"some of the lads here were wonderin\u0027 exactly what action we\u0027ve worked so hard outfitting the Carmichael for, and how much profit we stand to take from it compared to what sorts of perils there be waitin\u0027. I tried to answer \u0027em in general, but they want specific answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavies laughed. \"I\u0027d have thought they\u0027d all know better than to go to you for specifics, Venner,\" he said easily - though to Friend the apprehension behind the unconcerned pose was obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend saw the new recruit - Elizabeth\u0027s friend, what was his name? Shandy, that was it - scuffling his way through the crowd behind Davies, and for a moment the physician considered engineering things so that the interfering puppeteer would be killed ... or, better, maimed, rendered simple-minded by a blow to the head ... but he regretfully decided that it would be difficult enough to restrain a crowd this big and wild from mutiny, without trying to get them to swat his personal fly at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned his attention to Venner, whose face, despite the smile, shone with sweat in the firelight. \"That\u0027s what I told \u0027em, cap\u0027n,\" he said, and for a moment the falsity of his smile must have been obvious to everyone present, \"but several have said they plain won\u0027t sail if we be goin\u0027 to that damned place on the Florida coast where Thatch got infested by ghosts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavies shrugged. \"Any of \u0027em who be not satisfied with my promise to make \u0027em rich, or who doubt my word on that, can see me privately to settle it. And any that want to desert in mid-endeavor know the prescribed penalties. Do you fit into any of those groups, Venner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend, peering in from the periphery, whispered and held up his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVenner tried to reply, but produced only a choked grunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I have him provoke his own death, Friend wondered, or save him? Better let him live - there is real fear and anger in this crowd, and I don\u0027t want it stirred to a blaze. He whispered and gestured again, and Venner suddenly hunched forward and vomited onto the sand. The people near him drew away, and coarse laughter broke the tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaying to the audience, Davies said, \"I don\u0027t call that a responsive answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend\u0027s fat fingers danced in the air, and Venner straightened and said, loudly but haltingly, \"No ... Phil. I ... trust you. I ... what\u0027s happening here? These aren\u0027t my ... I was just drunk, and wanted to ... stir up a bit of trouble. All these lads ... know you\u0027ve got their best ... damn me! ... interests at heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavies raised his eyebrows in surprise, then frowned suspiciously and peered around among the crowd; but Venner\u0027s words had been convincing enough for one pirate, who clumped up and punched the would-be mutineer in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Treacherous pig,\" the pirate muttered as Venner sat down in the sand, blood spilling from his nose. The man turned to Davies. \"Your word sooner\u0027n his, anytime, cap\u0027n.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavies smiled. \"Try not to forget, Tom,\" he said mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut at the edge of the crowd, Friend smiled too - all this was so much easier here than it had been back in the eastern hemisphere - and then he turned to Elizabeth Hurwood. \"We can return to the fort now,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him. \"That\u0027s all? You ran down here, so fast I thought your heart was going to burst, just to see that man throw up and get hit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to make sure that was all that did happen,\" said Friend impatiently. \"Now come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"As long as we\u0027re here, I\u0027ll say hello to John.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriend turned on her furiously, then caught himself. He smirked and raised his eyebrows. \"The keel-scraper and brigand chef? I believe he\u0027s here,\" he said, simpering, \"unless what I smell is a wet dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go back to the fort,\" she said wearily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you c-can ... have c-c-congress with him, I suppose?\" sputtered Friend, his voice shrill with scorn. He wished he could refer to sexual matters without stuttering. \"B-banish that thought, my d-d-d - Elizabeth. Your father commanded me not to let you out of my sight.\" He nodded virtuously. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-stranger-tides/page-9.html","bookId":1558,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:24:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:24:13 PM"}
