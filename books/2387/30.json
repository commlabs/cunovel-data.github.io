Didn’t you find out what happened to her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shook her head dazedly. “I never met the husband—and it wouldn’t have mattered anyway, since we didn’t know what he looked like until Tabitha’s body was found. Plus Gayle goes by Riggs, not Clark. She never told me any details of what happened to her daughter, either, just said she disappeared. And none of this ever came up on a Google search!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna ran her hands down the length of her face. “Why didn’t she turn us in?” She could barely get the words out she was breathing so hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily bit her lip. “Maybe she doesn’t know for sure. Maybe this is her way of drawing us out and making us confess. She’s trying to drive us crazy, make us tell the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So do you still think Ali’s A, Em?” Aria snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily looked terrified. “I guess not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all turned and peered at the photograph again. For a split second, it looked like Tabitha was winking at them. Gotcha! It was the same expression Ali used to have when she’d pressured the girls into doing something they didn’t want to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, clear as day, came a keening, desperate wail. The girls whipped around. Hanna grabbed Aria’s hand, and Aria grabbed Emily’s. The wail persisted, growing louder and more urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A baby,” Hanna whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Violet!” Emily screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot down the hall, running blindly toward the sound. Aria ran after her, and Hanna brought up the rear, her heart pounding. They zipped past an office, a powder room, and an enormous, immaculately clean marble kitchen that smelled like fresh lemons. The sound seemed to be coming from just beyond a set of French doors on the other side of the island. Emily twisted the lock and flung one of the doors open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked onto a massive brick patio. The fog had grown even denser since they’d been inside. The mewling cries echoed through the air, but there were no signs of a baby anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Violet?” Emily spun around, tears in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the noise ceased. The silence was deafening. Hanna looked up at her friends, the fog curling around their faces. She thought the worst: Was the baby dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna stood up straighter, staring at the garage and the trees through the fog. Even though she couldn’t see anything, she sensed a presence. Then she heard it: footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guys.” Her voice quivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe it’s just Spencer,” Emily said bravely. Her phone’s screen glowed in the darkness. “She just texted me that she’s here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then where’s her car?” Aria gestured to the driveway. Besides Aria’s Subaru, there was no other vehicle there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily bit her lip. “Maybe she parked it at the bottom of the hill and is walking up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna marched across the patio toward the driveway. “Someone’s out here, and it’s not just Spencer. We need to warn her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was halfway past the garage when she heard the sound of something metal—car keys, maybe—dropping on the blacktop. She froze and looked around, but all she could see was fog. Footsteps followed, and then tense whispers, a conversation back and forth that she couldn’t hear. Finally, there was a boom so loud it made Hanna’s teeth hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swung around and stared at her friends. They stood paralyzed on the patio. Then she turned back and peered at the driveway again. When she saw a blurry figure lying splayed out near one of the flower beds, she screamed. Whoever it was wore a heavy coat with a hood that covered her turned face; the only part of her Hanna could see was a small, delicate hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that Spencer?” Aria shrieked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna groped through the mist toward the figure. Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably. Didn’t Spencer have a down jacket just like that? Didn’t she own pointy leather boots? Suddenly, Hanna stopped. Was the murderer lurking nearby? Were they next?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spencer?” Emily came up behind Hanna. “Spencer?” She looked at Hanna in horror. “Do you think she’s . . . ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna reached out to touch the down-filled hood, but then drew her hand away. She was terrified of what she was going to see. Spencer’s face, frozen in a scream? Half of Spencer’s brains collected inside the hood?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car passed on the road, its headlights momentarily illuminating their bodies. When the beams bounced off the figure on the ground, Hanna noticed someothing wasn’t right. The few strands of hair peeking out from under the hood were paler than Spencer’s. The hand looked veiny and older. There was an enormous diamond ring on the fourth finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is that?” Aria whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing in a breath, Hanna pulled back the figure’s hood. Aria screamed. Emily covered her eyes. And just as the sound of sirens filled the air, Hanna peered down. The two eyes were closed, the lips parted just so. It looked like the person was sleeping, save for the horrible gash just above her right temple. She took in the whole face, and then realized. She sank to her knees, feeling relieved, horrified, and confused at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure on the ground wasn’t Spencer. It was Gayle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE TRUTH COMES OUT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stared at Gayle’s inert features, her pale skin, and the blood seeping out of her head. A shrill noise rang in her ears, and it took her a few seconds to realize it was the sound of her own screams. She spun around and bent over, dry-heaving on the grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of sirens roared closer, and a car purred up the drive. It was Spencer. She slammed the door and took a few steps toward them, a confused look on her face. Then she saw Gayle’s figure on the ground and stopped short. Her face registered a series of emotions—surprise, horror, fear—in a split second. “Oh my God,” she screamed. “Is that . . . ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gayle,” Emily croaked, her voice quavering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer looked like she was going to be sick. “What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not sure.” Tears ran down Aria’s face. “We came out into the courtyard because we heard a baby crying, there was all this fog, we heard footsteps, and then something that sounded like a gunshot, and then . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolice cars blazed up the street, and the girls froze. The vehicles sped up the driveway and screeched to a stop behind Spencer’s car. Hanna’s mouth dropped open. Spencer instinctively raised her hands in surrender. Emily took a big step away from Gayle’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors to the police cars opened, and four cops jumped out. Two of them rushed to the fallen body, requesting for backup, while the other two stalked over to Emily and her friends. “What the hell is going on here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stared up at the cop who’d spoken. He had spiky blond hair, acne scars, and wore a shiny gold Lieutenant’s badge that said LOWRY. “We didn’t do this!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can explain!” Aria shouted at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowry twisted around and stared into the darkness beyond the police cars. “Where’s the person who called this in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here,” a voice responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother figure emerged through the fog. Emily presumed it would be a neighbor, but then she noticed the guy’s black tuxedo, shiny shoes, and shoulder-length brown hair. Her stomach dropped to her feet. It was Isaac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“W-what are you doing here?” Emily sputtered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac stared at her. “I followed you—I was worried about you. Then I heard the gunshot, so I called the cops.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s head whirled. “You had no right to follow me! This is private!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you would have told me what was going on I wouldn’t have!” Isaac’s voice cracked. “I was afraid you were in trouble!” His gaze fell to Gayle’s body, and his mouth wobbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowry snatched his walkie-talkie from his belt and checked in on the backup and ambulance. Then he looked at the girls. “Do you know who this woman is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her name is Gayle Riggs,” Aria said in a small voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowry stared, chewing his gum hard. “Were you trying to rob her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not!” Emily cried. “We were just . . . here! Someone else did this!” She looked at Isaac. “Tell him I wouldn’t do something like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac rolled his jaw. “Well, I didn’t actually see what happened—the fog was too thick. But Emily wouldn’t do something like this, Officers. She’s not a killer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy who was holding Spencer snorted. “People can surprise you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowry chomped on his gum and stared at Emily. “You want to explain what you are doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily glanced guiltily at Isaac. The whirling lights on top of the cop car cast blue and red lights across his face. He was still looking at her with loving concern. “It’s personal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowry looked annoyed. “If you can’t explain why you’re here, we’ll have to bring you into the station as suspects.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer friends gasped beside her. Emily’s stomach clenched. Could she seriously allow them to be accused of a crime they didn’t commit just to keep her secret?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cleared her throat. “I’m here because I thought my baby was in danger. I thought she’d been kidnapped. We didn’t know Gayle Riggs lived here—we just got a tip that the baby was at this address.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac’s eyes bugged. “What baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowering her eyes, Emily took the deepest breath ever. “I had a baby girl this summer.” She said the words very fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac looked stunned. “You did?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “She’s yours, Isaac.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, everything in the world went still. Isaac scrunched up his face. “Uh . . . what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s true.” Emily’s voice trembled. “I found out several months after we broke up. I hid in Philly last summer and looked into giving the baby up for adoption. I met Gayle, and she was interested in adopting the baby, but I decided that I wanted to give the baby to someone else. Afterward, Gayle made threats that sounded like she might try to steal the baby from the new family. So when I got the tip that the baby was here, I dragged my friends along to see if it was true.” Emily figured this was as close to the truth as she could get. “And we really thought she was here—we heard a baby crying. But then it . . . stopped. We didn’t do anything to hurt Gayle, though,” she added. “And don’t punish my friends. It’s because of me that they’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was finished, her throat was raw and she felt like she’d just swum the English Channel. Isaac’s expression morphed from disbelief to confusion to anger all in the matter of a few seconds. “A . . . baby?” he squeaked out, his voice cracking. “A girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Emily felt tears in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaac ran his hand over the top of his head. “Unbelievable.” He took a step to the right, then a tottering lurch to the left. All of a sudden, he turned around and staggered toward the other two cops, his posture stiff. Emily stepped forward to go after him, but Hanna touched the small of her back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stunning-pretty-little-liars-11/page-30.html","bookId":2387,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:15 AM"}
