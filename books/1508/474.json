After tempering his marrow, the resilience of his body had reached a terrifyingly formidable degree. In addition to the Yang Reversion Pill’s heaven defying effects, Lin Ming felt the stream of blood trickling down his chest instantly stop.

With his severe wounds, he wouldn’t be able to fight any further.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the Divine Phoenix Island side, besides Lin Ming and the Mu sisters, the other Elders were all surrounded by several other Elders of the South Sea Demon Region.

This Elder that had been grievously wounded was only a side Elder of the Vermillion Bird Faction. He wasn’t involved in the conflict of interests between the different factions, and was usually honest. Although he was hesitant to participate in the conflict between Divine Phoenix Island and the South Sea Demon Region, he had still helped in the end. Although the situation wouldn’t have been worse if he hadn’t joined, at present, he had been severely wounded and he was in a life threatening situation. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Mu Qingyi saw that the Ninth Elder had been injured to this extend, the raging anger in her heart soared to the heavens! “Mu Chihuo!

If we wait any longer, even if Lin Ming dies in battle, in the future us two old men won’t have any place to stand! Mu Fengxian will absolutely not forgive us! Not just that, but there is no way that we will be able to prevent news of this matter from spreading to the sect; we have already been witnessed by many people!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Chihuo was quiet.

Mu Yanzhuo’s complexion continuously changed, and finally he clenched his teeth and his words died in his throat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mu Chihuo! You!” Mu Qingyi’s rage had risen to the extreme. However, Mu Chihuo was still unmoved. But Mu Yanzhuo, who was standing near Mu Chihuo, seemed to be suffering a great deal of agony, and his expression was pained as if he were undergoing an intense psychological struggle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe situation was becoming increasingly bad! After the Ninth Elder had been injured, the pressure increased on Divine Phoenix Island! Even Mu Qingyi was in immediate danger!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for Lin Ming, although he had managed to gain an advantage by using the rules of this world and pills, he could only maintain the Heretical God Force for around 30 more breaths of time!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf this continued, they would all be forced into a dead end!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLian Chengji’s eyes flashed with a hideously savage color, “Lin Ming! No matter how strong you are, you cannot change anything! How long can you last for? Give this old man the devil arts jade slip you have like a good little boy, and this old man will let off the other people and let you die a painless death. Otherwise, this old man will torture your soul, and have you suffer endlessly for over a hundred years!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming grinned, revealing a shining row of sharp teeth. He took out a crimson pill from his spatial ring and popped it into his mouth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBefore he came to the South Sea battlefield, Mu Fengxian had called Lin Ming to the back mountains to give him three pills and also a silk sack. Of these three pills, two were Yang Reversion Pills and one was a Scarlet Blood Pill.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe pill that Lin Ming had just eaten was a Scarlet Blood Pill.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was a special pill that was used by the inner leaders of Divine Phoenix Island. There were all sorts of precious materials that were used to refine one, and it even required a massive amount of Vermillion Bird blood. Although ordinary Vermillion Bird blood was much less valuable that Vermillion Bird blood essence, it couldn’t be produced in massive amounts. This meant that the value of the Scarlet Blood Pill wasn’t much lower than the Yang Reversion Pill.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Scarlet Blood Pill could only be used by disciples with the Vermillion Bird bloodline. After using one, one’s strength would skyrocket for a brief period of time, but they would be greatly weakened for a long period of time afterwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBecause of this side effect, Lin Ming hadn’t yet used it, nor had he been in a situation where he needed to.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Liang Chengji saw Lin Ming take this Scarlet Blood Pill, he didn’t know what it was. He only thought that it was some sort of recovery pill.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis caused him to be nervous. This boy simply had too many top quality pills on his body. He couldn’t let Lin Ming continue to recover. At least, he had to delay him until the other Elders were victorious in their battles.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Die, boy!” Lian Chengji gave a loud shout and slammed a claw down on Lin Ming. The surging true essence behind him formed into a massive bloody eagle dozens of feet long. Lian Chengji’s skinny face twisted into a devilish visage. This was an attack with 120% of his strength!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming had just swallowed the Scarlet blood Pill. He felt as if a fire had ignited in his stomach, and a burst of energy erupted within him, recklessly riding through his meridians.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm? This feeling is…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Scarlet Blood Pill was able to strengthen a Divine Phoenix Island disciple by galvanizing their Vermillion Bird bloodline. But now, to Lin Ming’s amazement, he discovered that the Scarlet Blood Pill was causing the burning Ancient Phoenix blood within his body to become increasingly vibrant!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Scarlet Blood Pill had caused a chain reaction with the blood of the Ancient Phoenix. Lin Ming was surprised, but then understood. The Vermillion Bird shared a homologous bloodline with the Ancient Phoenix. If the Scarlet Blood Pill was able to energize the bloodline of the Vermillion Bird, then it would also be able to energize the bloodline of the Ancient Phoenix.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt that moment, Lin Ming felt the blood within his entire body burning, as if his body was about to explode with energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hah!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming shouted, and his body emitted loud popping sounds. As he stretched out, his bones seemed to snap together, emitting a resonant dragon roar that pierced the heavens. Behind Lin Ming, the dual phantoms of an Azure Dragon and Ancient Phoenix appeared.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Ancient Phoenix that could be reborn through a sea of flames. The Azure Dragon that soared in the skies. Dragon and Phoenix rejoiced together.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt that moment, Lin Ming’s momentum climbed to the utter extreme!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis full energy, his full strength, all of his will was poured into the Great Desolate Blood Halberd. The wind howled and 14 Blood Drinking Seals madly spun around, lifting red sand into the air and forming a bloody tornado!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Slaughter!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA halberd cut forth. Time seemed to come to a standstill, and the bloodstained sand filled the air through the battlefield. Throughout heaven and earth, it was as if the only image left over was the exquisite Great Desolate Blood Halberd. It split apart space. The world seemed to lose its color and all sounds faded away. As the fluctuations of energy ravaged forth, there was strangely not a single noise.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA wave of blood shot into the sky, blooming like a fiery lotus at night – beautiful and deadly!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven the sound of Lian Chengji gasping was torn apart by that bloody storm. He helplessly looked on as the Great Desolate Blood Halberd shattered his blood claw and minced the bloody eagle to pieces. And then… it became a twisting wind that pierced his dantian!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ahhh!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLian Chengji’s expression was crazy with unwilling disbelief. He grabbed the Great Desolate Blood Halberd with one hand and clawed down at Lin Ming with the other!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This old man will have you follow me in death!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLian Chengji vomited blood, and his teeth were stained red. At that moment, it was as if he had gone mad!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe burning hot fire of the Scarlet Blood Pill was still flooding Lin Ming’s body like before. As Lin Ming saw the claw reaching towards him, he shouted out like a savage beast and punched with his fist!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKacha!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat skinny claw was directly broken apart by Lin Ming’s fist!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Lian Chengji’s dantian had been twisted apart, he had lost most of his true essence. At this time, his claw was only supported by his fragile mortal body; how could he possibly resist Lin Ming’s tempering marrow and his impenetrable fist!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter Lin Ming’s fist shattered Lian Chengji’s claw, it continued through and smashed into Lian Chengji. As Lian Chengji’s bodily true essence protection had mostly dissipated, Lin Ming’s fist penetrated right through and crashed into him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter losing their bodily true essence protection, a martial artist’s body was exceedingly frail. In that instant, blood shot everywhere as Lian Chengji’s internal organs were demolished by Lin Ming’s fist!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Come out!

There was a muffled explosion as a cloud of bloody fog broke free of Lian Chengji’s body, arriving in front of Lin Ming and quickly turning into a mysterious, ancient-looking seal. Lian Chengji’s bloodshot eyes rapidly lost their color.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe blood seal constantly twisted.
