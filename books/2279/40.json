I want to see if Zachary Chase is around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” he said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he parked, he noticed that there was a Ranger car in front of the Longhorn farther down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, maybe Jackson had decided that when the forensic crew had finished, the inn—or the crime scene—was going to be in need of some protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went to their usual bench. It was early, but already the plaza was busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder if Zachary will expect us at this hour,” Logan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needn’t have worried. They’d only been there a few minutes when Kelsey nudged him. He saw Zachary excusing himself, unheard, as he made his way through a sea of tourists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey and Logan moved apart, as they usually did, so Zachary could sit between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m surprised to see you two,” he said. “And I’m sorry, but I have nothing to tell you. I suppose that’s good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually,” Kelsey began, “I’ve come to tell you something. Rose is still here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZachary Chase was silent. There was hope on his face, and sorrow. “My poor Rose. Her life became so wretched, and now she lingers in death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe she needs a friend,” Kelsey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZachary was silent again, and neither of them broke the silence. Then he turned to Kelsey, puzzled. “Why don’t you just ask Rose about the diamond? If the wretched gem is found, then—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She doesn’t know where it is, Zachary. She died—and it disappeared,” Kelsey told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “It’s terrible, isn’t it?” he mused. “That people could kill, and die, for a stone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A stone, a hunk of glittering rock…greed,” Logan said. “Zachary, none of this is your fault, and what happened at the Alamo certainly wasn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps I’ve been waiting… .” Zachary shrugged. “Could you… Maybe you could suggest to Rose, if you see her, that she take a stroll. That she walk by the Alamo. That she…well, perhaps you could tell her I’m here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey smiled. “The Longhorn welcomes guests, Zachary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it can’t hold good memories for her,” he said, his voice hoarse. “I don’t want to be part of the memories she must have of being used and sold…and murdered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll see what I can do,” Kelsey promised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I am ever vigilant,” he promised in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan rose. “We’d better get going,” he said to Kelsey. Zachary got up when she did, and he gave a slight bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll remain vigilant,” he vowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched as he walked away and disappeared into the crowd. Then they headed for Logan’s car. Kelsey paused, looking at the Longhorn down the street and the vehicle parked in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a Ranger car,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it a friend?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “There aren’t that many of us, so most likely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you arrange it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “No, I assume Jackson did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just one car,” she murmured. “One Ranger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess you haven’t heard all our stories,” he said. “In the early 1900s, the mayor of Dallas called on the Rangers because he was about to deal with an angry mob. When Ranger Captain W. J. McDonald stepped off the train, the mayor asked him, ‘Where are the others?’ To which McDonald replied, ‘One riot, one Ranger,’ or words to that effect. Trust me, Kelsey. One Ranger can keep a curious crowd from making Sandy crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sandy is going to be crazy, no matter what,” Kelsey said. “Trust me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, climbed into the car and revved the engine, then drove to the station. An exhausted Kat Sokolov was just leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I brought my findings in,” she said. “The body was little more than a skeleton. There was some soft tissue left, but because of the situation, it became almost mummified. She was stabbed to death—no surprise there. I was able to tell she’d also been drugged, with the same cocktail used on the others. What I haven’t been able to find yet is any puncture mark on any of the victims. Not even Vanessa Johnston. I don’t know how this man is managing to get the drugs into their systems. Possibly a patch, as I mentioned before, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll figure it out,” Logan said. “Now it’s your turn to get some rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and smiled wearily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean was in the office when they arrived, working industriously at a computer. “We’ve got you for the day?” Kelsey asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Work on the documentary has been suspended.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hadn’t realized Ned Bixby had that big a role in it. He doesn’t really look like a Mexican,” Logan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean raised one shoulder in a shrug. “He was playing a bunch of different roles. Word just came down from the producer, perhaps out of respect for the situation, that we’d resume next week.” He looked at them both for a moment. “I think I’ve found something you’ll want to see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan and Kelsey walked around to stand behind him. Sean had a series of emails up on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This showed up at eight,” he said, indicating the computer. “It belonged to Linsey Applewood, and her landlord had it in storage. I hacked her code and brought up her emails. She was corresponding with someone called Mr.Alamo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were you able to trace it back to a name?” Logan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean’s expression was sheepish. “If I’d traced a name, I’d be dancing a jig. No, no name, but I did find out that the emails were all coming and going from an internet café a few blocks from the Longhorn. The thing is, you need to read the email correspondence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean stood and allowed Logan to take his place. “Go to the first one. They start about two years ago, and become more…evocative, I guess you could say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinsey Applewood’s screen name had been seeitgirl. The first email had been sent by Mr. Alamo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey. Heard you have a gift. I have a gift. Maybe we could get together and explore options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeitgirl had written back:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m the real deal. I don’t play games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen you should come here. The area is full of legends, mysteries—and riches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore emails followed in a teasing vein, including some that questioned seeitgirl’s abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI talk to the dead, she’d written at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Mr.Alamo had responded:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what is needed. Only the dead can tell the tale. When you come, I will prove that I am everything I claim. And then you must prove that you are all that you claim. If so, we can share fame and treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s the internet café?” Logan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean gave him the exact address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll need to bring photos of the woman,” Logan murmured. “Do we have a list yet of people working at the Longhorn at the time Sierra was murdered?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have what I could pull off IRS logs,” Sean said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess being federal is good.” Logan grinned. “Very helpful. But we still need to interview Sandy, see what she remembers about any staff who were there a year ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Kelsey. She groaned. “I think that someone other than me should call her right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan nodded. “I’ll do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, wait,” Kelsey said, heading for one of the other desks. “I’ll get her down here. I can’t believe she’s still that upset with me, or that she’ll refuse to help with an ongoing murder investigation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat down and dialed the Longhorn. Logan watched as she got an answer, as she waited and then frowned. Finally, she hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Logan, Sandy is gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean, gone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey’s face was taut with tension. “I spoke with Ricky. He got the customers out at about four in the morning. He didn’t see Sandy then, but he assumed she’d gone to bed. He went to wake her when she didn’t show up this morning and he found that her bed hadn’t been slept in. Her handbag’s there, none of her clothing is gone, but he can’t find her. Oh, God, Logan, do you think the killer was there last night? That…he’s taken Sandy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fifteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey felt dizzy for a moment, worried sick, afraid that her affiliation with the case and her relationship with Sandy might have put her friend at risk. She was going to stand, but she didn’t. She couldn’t allow trembling knees in front of her coworkers. And a U.S. Marshal didn’t burst into tears. Neither did an FBI agent. She had strength. She knew it, and she knew her work. However, she’d had no idea what it would feel like when someone she cared about might be in a deadly position because of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean looked at her from behind the computer desk. She saw the concern in his eyes. Logan, too, wore an expression of concern; he moved closer to her. “She has a crush on Chasson, right? Let’s find out if she went home with him.” He glanced at Sean. “Try to get him on the phone, and try everyone you know until you find him. Sandy’s probably with him, but even if she’s not, we’ll want to question him.” He looked back at Kelsey. “Sandy could be walking around the city, just needing a break from the Longhorn. I’m not going to say you shouldn’t worry, but the last day’s been traumatic for her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey nodded. Before panicking, there were a dozen intelligent avenues she could follow. “Under normal circumstances, she wouldn’t even be considered missing yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go. While Sean tracks down Jeff Chasson, we’ll start at the Longhorn and try to retrace Sandy’s steps,” Logan said. “Meanwhile, Sean can get a list of addresses for everyone we know was in the saloon last night, and we’ll pay calls on them while we keep trying to reach Sandy. Sean, could you send someone to the evidence locker to see if they had a computer for Sierra Monte? You might check where Sheryl Higgins was last seen, too, and if there’s a possibility she had a computer, iPhone, iPad, whatever. We’ll stay in close contact.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-unseen-krewe-of-hunters-5/page-40.html","bookId":2279,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:33 PM"}
