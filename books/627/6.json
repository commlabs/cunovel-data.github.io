{"id":19210,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"All of the children in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class, except Todd, were talking and carrying on. Todd was thinking. Todd always thought before he spoke. When he got an idea, his eyes lit up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd finished thinking and began to speak. But before he said two words, Mrs. Jewls called him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Todd,\" she said, \"you know better than to talk in class. You must learn to work quietly, like the other children.\" She wrote his name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd looked around in amazement.\n\u003cbr\u003e 20All of the other children, who had been talking and screaming and fighting only seconds earlier, were quietly working in their workbooks. Todd scratched his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e A child was given three chances in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. The first time he did something wrong, Mrs. Jewls wrote his name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE. The second time he did something wrong, she put a check next to his name. And the third time he did something wrong, she circled his name.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd reached into his desk and pulled out his workbook. He had only just started on it when he felt someone tap him on the shoulder. It was Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What page are you on?\" Joy asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Page four,\" Todd whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m on page eleven,\" said Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd didn\u0027t say anything. He didn\u0027t want to get into trouble. He just went back to work.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Five minutes later, Joy tapped him again. Todd ignored her. So Joy poked him in the back with her pencil. Todd pretended he didn\u0027t notice. Joy got up from her seat and sharpened her pencil. She came back and poked it in Todd\u0027s back. \"What page are you on?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Page five,\" Todd answered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Boy, are you dumb,\" said Joy. \"I\u0027m on page twenty-nine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It isn\u0027t a race,\" Todd whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Five minutes later Joy pulled Todd\u0027s hair and didn\u0027t let go until he turned around. \"What page are you on?\" she demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Page six,\" Todd answered as quietly as he could.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027M ON PAGE TWO HUNDRED!\" Joy shouted.\n\u003cbr\u003e 21Todd was very angry. \"Will you please let me do my work and stop bothering me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls heard him. \"Todd, what did I say about talking in class?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd scratched his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls put a check next to Todd\u0027s name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd really tried to be good. He knew that if he talked one more time, Mrs. Jewls would circle his name. Then he\u0027d have to go home early, at twelve o\u0027clock, on the kindergarten bus, just as he had the day before and the day before that. In fact, there hadn\u0027t been a day since Mrs. Jewls took over the class that she didn\u0027t send Todd home early. She said she did it for his own good. The other children went home at two o\u0027clock.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd wasn\u0027t really bad. He just always got caught. He really wanted to stay past twelve o\u0027clock. He wanted to find out what the class did from twelve to two. But it didn\u0027t look as though this was going to be his day. It was only ten-thirty, and he already had two strikes against him. He sealed his lips and went back to work.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a knock on the door. Mrs. Jewls opened it. Two men stepped in wearing masks and holding guns. \"Give us all your money!\" they demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All I have is a nickel,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have a dime,\" said Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have thirteen cents,\" said Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have four cents,\" said Dameon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What kind of bank is this?\" asked one of the robbers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s not a bank, it\u0027s a school,\" said Todd. \"Can\u0027t you read?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e 22\"No,\" said the robbers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Neither can I,\" said Todd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you mean we walked all the way up thirty flights of stairs for nothing?\" asked the robber. \"Don\u0027t you have anything valuable?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd\u0027s eyes lit up. \"We sure do,\" he said. \"We have knowledge.\" He grabbed Joy\u0027s workbook and gave it to the robbers. \"Knowledge is much more valuable than money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thanks, kid,\" said one of the robbers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe I\u0027ll give up being a criminal and become a scientist,\" said the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They left the room without hurting anybody.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now I don\u0027t have a workbook,\" complained Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls gave her a new one. Joy had to start all the way back at the beginning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, Joy, what page are you on?\" asked Todd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Page one,\" Joy sighed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m on page eight,\" laughed Todd triumphantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls heard him. She circled his name. Todd had three strikes against him. At twelve o\u0027clock he left the room to go home early on the kindergarten bus.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But this time when he left, he was like a star baseball player leaving the field. All the children stood up, clapped their hands, and whistled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd scratched his head.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56812.html","bookId":627,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM"}
