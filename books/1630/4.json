Unlike the Master Builder’s proposed Halos, the Shield Worlds did not require a great extinction, and in fact they could be used as immense refuges in time of crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response, the Master Builder ordered that his Halos also be adapted to support and preserve species. Playing politics better than any of us, the Master Builder knew that this removed the Council’s last objection to his Halo strategy—the threat of violating the Mantle, of destroying the galaxy in order to save it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorse, in asking me to design these sanctuaries, a request I could not refuse, I was perceived as working with the Master Builder, against the wishes of my husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Builder, sensing a winning strategy, now volunteered that the great extragalactic factory used to manufacture Halos, known as the Ark, would also safely carry protected populations—at tremendous expense and great profit for Builders. Builders heartily approved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he suggested that a second Ark be constructed, in secret, to expand that role. More species could be saved, more Halos could be made. Additionally, all of the problems now apparent with the first Ark could be addressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe choices my husband and I faced were narrowing. Politically, our paths would soon diverge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife roils with competition, death, and replacement, from the tide pool borders of our natal ocean to the farthest stars. Its cruelty and creativity are interwoven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet this was a time—far from the first time—when Forerunner defiance of the dictates of the Mantle pushed us perilously close to tyranny, desecration, and—I use the oldest of our words here—outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had the excuse that Lifeworkers and Warrior-Servants were not in supreme power, that the Old Council was being managed by Builders, that even the Juridicals were under their sway … And that the Flood might again place the entire galaxy in peril.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut was even all of that justification enough?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Builders made the first Ark and the earliest Halo installations … large revolving rings, thirty thousand kilometers in diameter, capable of sustaining millions if not billions of organisms on their inner surfaces. Paradises for research, in one way—but designed ultimately to destroy all life for hundreds of thousands of light-years around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Old Council had the wisdom at least to delay construction of the second Ark. No need to make the Builders too powerful to be controlled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last physically intact humans arrived on Erde-Tyrene. They were very few, much fewer than I had planned. Almost immediately, I began my program of rebuilding their populations—away from the critical eye of the Master Builder, the Council, and even the Didact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this familiar environment, my humans thrived. In fact, they demonstrated an astonishing, almost supernatural resilience. To the shock of my Lifeworkers, the reverted humans bred to more and more advanced forms over just a thousand years, diverging into distinct varieties like a bush blooming with a thousand brilliant flowers. Their numbers grew as well, from thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not explain this effect. I sought for it in their genetics, and found nothing. Was there something else at work here—something that had somehow remained hidden from us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy humans soon gathered into bands, tribes, villages. Tilled the soil and raised crops. Took wolves and goats and sheep, cattle, birds, and charmed them into domestication. Made many tools, developed crude trade and industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin a thousand years, some of them reminded me of the Lord of Admirals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers—of the wise-eyed children …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept their extraordinary progress hidden from the Old Council and the Builders. I did not tell my husband. Erde-Tyrene was far outside the usual runnels of Forerunner commerce. I removed my Lifeworkers, trimming their numbers to a few, and then, to none. The planet became a forgotten backwater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery now and then, I dropped by in person to study their progress. I gave them all my geas, my mark of instruction, utility and pride. I wished to be remembered. My own existence seemed so frail, after what we had done. When I worked with the humans, studying their genetics and personalities, I could almost forget the larger conflicts that loomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that time was also spent away from my husband, and his difficulties were growing. The Didact continued to stubbornly promote his Shield Worlds, demonstrating their effectiveness again and again to Council audiences. He continued to make dangerous enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the memories of his victories … they slipped into the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dimmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Builder brilliantly chipped away at the Didact’s remaining base of support. The political war between Builders and Warrior-Servants came to a head. Warrior-Servants were reduced as a rate. Many moved to the Builder rate, taking on the role of Builder Security. The insult was obvious—but at least they survived, found prosperity, and became of value to the new regime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then came the final blow. Juridicals ruled against my husband. The Didact was found in contempt of the Council, ordered to stop making Shield Worlds, turn over his records and ancillas, end his planning, and submit to the authority of the Builders—and in particular to Faber, the Master Builder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Didact refused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as my humans revived classic forms, then flowered into new and unexpected variations, the possibility grew to certainty that I would have to proceed alone, because of the my husband’s pending exile—or execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTRING 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLIBRARIAN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI LAST SAW the Didact on our estate around Far Nomdagro, a small orange star seven light-years from the Capital system. We shared this world with a million Warrior-Servants. Many of our neighbors were already pulling up their estates and families, abandoning their birth rate to enlist in Builder Security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNomdagro was temperate, ancient of birth and low of mountains, half-ocean and half-land. I suppose by comparison our estate was humble, but I had never lived anywhere more luxurious. Unlike Lifeworkers, Warrior-Servants were not inclined to live frugally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Didact, when he designed our nuptial house, demonstrated a style some would call severe, but still inclined to majesty. I have seen ancient fortresses with less grandeur. Our central quarters were cut from blocks of lava filled with the fossils of Nomdagro’s only indigenous species, a lovely variety of silicon worm, long since extinct. They seemed to have swum through the lava before it cooled, but that had likely not been the case; more true to imagine them having died in great, contorted coils, their immensely strong cuticles and cartilaginous members resisting as the lava washed over, entombing them until masons split the solid blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Didact had picked those stones with me in mind, and they were lovely, in a forbidding sort of way. The fossils bore enough residual thorium and uranium to glow softly at night, lighting our way as we went to that last supper before he entered his Cryptum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember those hours with crystal clarity. An associate of Haruspis had been called and had arrived the night before. Those were brilliant nights indeed. An unstable star on the far side of the Orion complex had supernovaed one hundred years before. That long-traveling radiation was now, to our eyes, lighting up the vast nebula, washing over the far-spreading clouds and wisps of gas as if in preternatural warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A well-chosen occasion. The delay of space is profound,” the Haruspis’s associate intoned. Its attitude—it was a self-gelding like all associates—irritated the Didact. More so was my husband annoyed by the implication that we might have chosen this occasion to highlight the occasion, to grandstand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he controlled himself, and faced off with the associate under the burning streamers of yellow and orange and deep purple. At the associate’s signal, the Didact’s armor lifted from his hard light under-sheath, uncoiling and separating, protruding wedges and spikes as if preparing for battle—and then slumped into a compact egg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Didact lifted his hands to receive the cup containing the first full measure of inchukoa and drank it back in one swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis began the process of living desiccation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur conversation around that spare supper was mostly gentle and loving. The Didact and I had been a highly unsuitable match, and yet we had been married for thousands of years. What some might have interpreted as disagreement, debate, barely contained irritation or competition, was in fact the fire of our deepest love. We still took delight in the sparks we struck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember this so clearly.…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHousehold monitors arranged towels and cups around the Didact’s chair as his skin wept salty drops. The skin of his broad, noble face stretched tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFace glistening—shedding his water—flesh turning to leather, blood a glassy gel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis speech became slow and precise; he had difficulty moving his lips. “I hate to abandon you,” he said. “If there was another way…” He shook his great head and reached to massage a shrinking shoulder. His skin, normally gray and rich purple, had darkened to reddish brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he smiled—most unexpectedly. I had not seen him smile since we had been Manipulars, and did not know he still had it in him. Perhaps the mature musculature was being liberated by this awful process. Perhaps he was simply expressing a final ironic amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you’ve made plans best carried out in my absence,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our own plans are not finished,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There will be many voices,” the Didact said. “The Master Builder may not find me, but that does not mean he won’t find a means by which to invoke my support.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He will hold off such treachery for a good long while,” I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if he does not, still you’ll carry out your pact with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To save your beloved species.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And your humans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even those who killed our children.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You told me it was honorable, that they fought well—and you agreed this was our best strategy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You agreed too quickly.” Again that odd, tightening smile. The Didact meant his words kindly. The pain we had suffered during the long war—and the loss—had inured us to such recrimination. Our children had followed the way of their Warrior-Servant father. They had proved themselves capable and courageous. It was the Warrior’s creed within the Mantle to honor one’s finest enemies, and humans had been that. “I sometimes wish you were more bloody-minded, more vengeful, Wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not the way of the Warrior or of the Mantle—and of course not mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Didact’s discomfort increased. He swallowed half of the second cup of inchukoa, then lifted the cup and turned it in his fingers. “The ecumene has become confused. The Council steeps itself in lies and dishonor. But … you foresee my return, in one form or another, and the resumption of our struggle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is often a sickness before the purge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That sounds gross and bloody-minded.” He returned the cup to his lips and swallowed the last measure. “I am reminded of why I sought our love in the first place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sought it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That isn’t how I remember it, Warrior. An unlikely love, at any rate—so your fellows said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we knew. As you have instructed me often, we play out our parts in Living Time and accept all that life brings, and all that it takes away. So we support the Mantle: Daaowa maadthu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis use of that human phrase, so ancient and fraught with meaning, caught me by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe added, “The humans … Had they been willing to acknowledge their crimes, they would have made a great civilization, worthy to join our own. But they did not. I hope that what remains of them, in your care, does not disappoint you. My anger would then be impossible to control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Didact’s aide returned with the Haruspis’s associate close behind. The associate peered around the hall with a critical squint. Display of wealth and power was exquisitely distasteful to those who served the Domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didact, you must recline and complete the vitrifaction, before we move you to your Cryptum,” the aide said. She stood in a submissive posture that could be interpreted as the first stage of mourning—something the Didact had forbidden. But he could not bring himself to correct her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonitors brought forward a hovering bed, shaping to support his shrunken frame. He rose with some difficulty. I could hardly bear to look at him. But I knew this was nothing close to death—though it would bring a separation of centuries, while he lay in a meditative trance and while that awful political purge worked its way through the Forerunner body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the Master Builder ultimately overreached, as we knew he would, and the return of the Flood would compel the Didact’s revival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked beside my husband as he was carried to the Cryptum. The glow of the far supernova had dimmed, as all had known it would. The farther one is from astronomical events, the less surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Haruspis’s associate spoke the words, in middle Digon, which would help the Didact focus on his long meditation: enchanting, musical words we all hoped might open access, if the Domain was so disposed, if the Didact was so disposed, to higher experience and greater awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words penetrated my husband’s discomfort. He tried to reach for me. I saw his effort and stroked his face, his naked arm. Already his flesh, rapidly cooling, felt like rock. His eyes tracked with increasing difficulty the shadowy figures around him. Soon he would see and hear and feel nothing of this world. He would be connected to us by the barest metaphysical thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne step away from death itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne step from knowing all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe delivered the Didact to the elliptical hatch, opening wide like the mouth of an eyeless fish; only we who were flesh. Neither monitors nor ancillas were allowed to participate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Didact stared straight up as he vanished from our sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCATALOG\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Librarian pauses. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-silentium-the-forerunner-saga-3/page-4.html","bookId":1630,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:36 PM"}
