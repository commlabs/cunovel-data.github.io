You know it, even if you don\u0027t want to admit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For someone who says they\u0027ll never be friends with me, you sure are sharing a lot this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to admit I kinda wish you were the bitch some people say you are,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s easy to hate someone who has it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short, cynical laugh escapes from my mouth. I\u0027m not about to tell her the truth--that my life is crumbling beneath my toes just like that sand was last night. \"I\u0027ve got to get home. Where\u0027s my cell?\" I ask, patting my back pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex has it, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo sneaking out without talking to him isn\u0027t an option. I struggle to keep the Oompa Loompas at bay as I stagger out of the bedroom, searching for Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not hard to find him, the house is smaller than Sierra\u0027s pool house. Alex is lying on an old sofa, wearing jeans. Nothing else. His eyes are open, but they\u0027re bloodshot and glazed with sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" he says warmly while stretching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God. I\u0027m in big trouble. Because I\u0027m staring. I can\u0027t keep my eyes from ogling his chiseled triceps and biceps and every other \"eps \u0027 he has. The butterflies in my stomach have just multiplied tenfold as my wandering gaze meets his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\" I swallow, hard. \"I, urn, guess I should thank you for taking me here instead of leaving me passed out on the beach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze doesn\u0027t falter. \"Last night I realized somethin\u0027. You and I, we\u0027re not so different. You play the game just like I do. You use your looks, your bod, and your brains to make sure you\u0027re always in control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hungover, Alex. I can\u0027t even think straight and you\u0027re getting all philosophical on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See, you\u0027re playin\u0027 a game right now. Be real with me, mamacita. I dare you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he kidding? Be real? I can\u0027t. Because then I\u0027ll start crying, and maybe freak out enough to blurt the truth--that I create a perfect image so I can hide behind it. \"I better get home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before you do that, you should probably go to the bathroom,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I ask why, I catch a glimpse of my reflection in a mirror hanging on the wall. \"Oh, shit!\" I shriek. Black mascara is caked under my eyes and streaky lines of it are running down my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resemble a corpse. Hurrying past him, I find the hall bathroom and stare at myself in the mirror. My hair is a stringy bird\u0027s nest. If the mascara marring my cheeks wasn\u0027t bad enough, the rest of me is as pale as my aunt Dolores without her makeup. I have puffy bags under my eyes as if I\u0027m storing water for the winter months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, not a pretty sight. By anyone\u0027s standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wet toilet paper and rub under my eyes and on my cheeks until the streaks are gone. Okay, so I need my eye-makeup remover in order to get it completely off. And my mom warned me that rubbing under my eyes will stretch out my skin and I\u0027ll be subject to premature wrinkles. But desperate circumstances call for desperate measures. After the mascara streaks are unnoticeable, I dab cold water on my eye bags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m fully aware that this is damage control. I can only bandage the imperfections and hope nobody else sees me in this condition. I use my fingers as a comb, with little results. Then I poof my hair up, hoping the poof look will be better than the ratty-nest look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rinse my mouth with water and rub my teeth with some toothpaste, hoping to get the worst of the night of puking and sleeping and drunkenness from my mouth until I get home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only I had lip gloss with me. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, alas, I don\u0027t. Squaring my shoulders and keeping my head held high, I open the door and walk back to the living room to find Isabel walking to her room and Alex standing when he sees me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s my cell phone?\" I ask. \"And please put a shirt on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reaches down and grabs my phone off the floor. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reason I need my cell,\" I say as I take it from him, \"is to call a cab and the reason I want you to put a shirt on is, well, because, urn . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve never seen a guy with his shirt off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha, ha. Very funny. Believe me, you don\u0027t have anything I haven\u0027t seen before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanna bet?\" he says, then moves his hands to the button on his jeans and pops it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsabel walks in at that exact moment. \"Whoa, Alex. Please keep your pants on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she looks over at me I put my hands up. \"Don\u0027t look at me. I was just about to call a cab when he--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking her head while Alex buttons back up, she walks to her purse and picks up a set of keys. \"Forget the cab. I\u0027ll drive you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drive her,\" Alex cuts in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsabel seems exhausted dealing with us, similar to how Mrs. Peterson looks during chemistry class. \"Would you rather me drive you, or Alex?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a boyfriend. Okay, so I admit every time I catch Alex looking at me a warmth spreads through my body. But it\u0027s normal. We\u0027re two teenagers with obvious sexual tension passing between us. As long as I never act on it, everything will be just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause if I ever did act on it, the consequences would be disastrous. I\u0027d lose Colin. I\u0027d lose my friends. I\u0027d lose the control I have over my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of all, I\u0027d lose what\u0027s left of my mother\u0027s love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0027m not seen as perfect, what happened yesterday with my mom would seem tame. Being perfect to the outside world equates to how my mom treats me. If any of her country club friends see me out with Alex, my mom might as well be an outcast too. If she\u0027s shunned by her friends, I\u0027ll be shunned by her. I can\u0027t take that chance. This is as real as I can afford to get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isabel, take me home,\" I say, then look at Alex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives a small shake of his head, grabs his shirt and keys, and storms out the front door without another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI silently follow Isabel to her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like Alex more than as a friend, don\u0027t you?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More like a brother. We\u0027ve known each other since we were kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give her directions to my house. Is she telling me the truth? \"You don\u0027t think he\u0027s hot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve known him since he cried like a baby when his ice cream fell on the street when we were four years old. I was there when, well . . . just leave it at the fact that we\u0027ve been through a lot of stuff together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stuff? Want to elaborate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could almost see the invisible wall going up between us. \"So our friendship ends here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at me sideways. \"Our friendship just began, Brittany. Don\u0027t push it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re coming up to my house. \"It\u0027s the third one on the right,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" She stops her car in front of my house, not bothering to pull into the driveway. I look at her. She looks at me. Does she expect me to ask her in? I don\u0027t even let good friends come into my house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, thanks for the ride,\" I say. \"And for letting me crash at your place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsabel flashes me a weak smile. \"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cling to the door handle. \"I won\u0027t let anything happen between me and Alex. Okay?\" Even if there\u0027s something going on below the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Because if something does, it\u0027s going to blow up in your faces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Oompa Loompas start knocking again, so I can\u0027t think too hard about her warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the house, my mother and father are sitting at the kitchen table. It\u0027s quiet. Too quiet. There are papers in front of them. Brochures or something. They quickly straighten, like little kids caught doing something wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... I thought you were st--still ... at Sierra\u0027s,\" my mom says. My senses pick up. My mom never stutters. And she\u0027s not giving me shit about the way I look. This is not good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was, but I got a killer headache,\" I say, walking forward and focusing on the suspicious brochures my parents are so interested in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunny Acres Home for Special People.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you guys doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Discussing our options,\" my dad says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Options? Didn\u0027t we all agree that sending Shelley away was a bad idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom turns to me. \"No. You decided sending her away was a bad idea. We were still discussing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to Northwestern next year so I can live at home and help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next year you\u0027ll have to concentrate on your studies, not your sister. Brittany, listen,\" my dad says, standing. \"We have to look into this option. After what she did to you yesterday--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to hear it,\" I tell him, cutting him off. \"There is absolutely no way I\u0027m letting you send my sister away.\" I snatch the brochures off the table. Shelley needs to be with her family, not in a facility with some strangers. I tear the brochures in two, toss them into the garbage can, then run to my bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open the door, Brit,\" my mom says, jiggling my bedroom doorknob a minute later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on the edge of my bed, my mind whirling with the image of Shelley being sent away. No, it can\u0027t happen. The thought makes me sick. \"You didn\u0027t even train Baghda. It\u0027s like you wanted to send Shelley away all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" my mom\u0027s muffled voice comes through the door. \"There\u0027s a new facility being built in Colorado. If you\u0027d open this door we can have a civilized discussion about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll never let it happen. I\u0027ll do everything in my power to keep my sister at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to have a civilized discussion. My parents want to send my sister to a facility behind my back and my head feels like it\u0027s about to split open. Leave me alone, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething is sticking out of my pocket. It\u0027s Alex\u0027s bandanna. Isabel isn\u0027t a friend, yet she helped me. And Alex, a boy who cared about me last night more than my own boyfriend did, acted as my hero and is urging me to be real. Do I even know how to be real?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clutch the bandanna to my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I allow myself to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 22 Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called me. If it weren\u0027t for the ripped piece of paper with her name and number scribbled on it by my brother Luis, I\u0027d never believe Brittany actually dialed my number. Grilling Luis hadn\u0027t helped because the kid has the memory of a flea and hardly remembered taking the call. The only info I got was that she wanted me to call her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was yesterday afternoon, before she puked her guts out on my shoe and passed out in my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I told her to be real, I could see the fear in her eyes. I wonder what she\u0027s afraid of. Breaking down her \"perfection\" wall is going to be my goal. I know there\u0027s more to her than blond streaks and a killer bod. Secrets she\u0027ll take to the grave and secrets she\u0027s dying to share. Oh, man. She\u0027s like a mystery, and all I can think about is unraveling the clues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I told her we\u0027re similar, I wasn\u0027t bullshitting. This connection we have isn\u0027t going away, it\u0027s only getting stronger. Because the more I spend time with her, the closer I want to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have the urge to call Brittany just to hear her voice, even if it\u0027s filled with venom. Flipping open my cell as I sit on the sofa in my living room, I enter her number into memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who ya\u0027 callin\u0027?\" Paco asks, barging into my house without ringing or knocking. Isa files in behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI click my phone shut. \"Nadie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then get your ass off that couch and come play soccer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaying soccer is a helluva lot better than sitting here thinking about Brittany and her secrets, even if I\u0027m still feeling the effects of last night\u0027s partying. We head to the park where a bunch of guys are already warming up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-17.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
