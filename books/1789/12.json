The entries were completely up-to-date, ending with today\u0027s shipping numbers. He spent an hour double-checking to make certain the totals were accurate, then leaned back in his chair to go through the stack of notes left for him to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine had obviously taken charge, Colin decided. He would have to remember to thank his brother for his help. It had to have taken him the full week, for there were over fifty pages of transfers added, and Colin hadn\u0027t been this current in over a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his attention to his messages. Colin worked in his study from dawn until late afternoon. Flannaghan was pleased to see his employer was looking so much better. He carried up a breakfast tray and another tray of food at the noon hour. Colin had bathed and dressed in a white shirt and black britches, and Flannaghan remarked that the color was coming back to his lord\u0027s complexion. The servant hovered like a mother hen and soon drove Colin to distraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlannaghan again interrupted him around three that afternoon to give him messages from both his father and his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe note from the Duke of Williamshire was filled with concern for Princess Alesandra\u0027s safety. He\u0027d obviously heard about the attack outside the Opera House. He requested a family meeting be set to settle Alesandra\u0027s future and asked that Colin let him know the minute he was feeling well enough to bring the princess to their London town house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine\u0027s note was similar—confusing, too, for he made no mention of helping with the books. Colin thought Caine was simply being humble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good news, isn\u0027t it?\" Flannaghan asked. \"Your family has fully recovered. Cook talked to your father\u0027s gardener and he said everyone was feeling fit again. Your father has already ordered his town house opened and should be settled in by nightfall. The duchess is with him, but your sisters have been ordered to stay in the country for another week or two. Do you wish for me to send a messenger with the news of your recovery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin wasn\u0027t surprised by his servant\u0027s information. The grapevine between the households was always up to the minute with the latest happenings. \"My father wants a family council, or did you already find that out from the gardener?\" he asked dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlannaghan nodded. \"I had heard, but I wasn\u0027t given a specific time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin shook his head in vexation. \"Set the meeting for tomorrow afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At what time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your brother?\" Flannaghan asked. \"Should I send a messenger to him as well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Colin agreed. \"I\u0027m certain he\u0027ll want to be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlannaghan hurried toward the door to see to his duties. He reached the entrance, then paused again. \"Milord, is our home open to visitors yet? Princess Alesandra\u0027s suitors have been begging entrance all week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin frowned. \"Are you telling me the rakes are already camping out on my doorstep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlannaghan flinched over the outrage in his employer\u0027s voice. \"Word has spread like fire that we have a beautiful, unattached princess residing with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Precisely, milord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one is allowed entrance until after the meeting,\" Colin announced. He smiled then. \"You seem as irritated as I am about Alesandra\u0027s suitors. Why is that, Flannaghan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe servant didn\u0027t pretend indifference. \"I am as irritated,\" he confessed. \"She belongs to us, Colin,\" he blurted out, slipping back to their casual relationship of using first names. \"And it is our duty to keep those lechers away from her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin nodded agreement. Flannaghan turned the topic just a little then. \"What should I do about her father\u0027s business associate? Dreyson has sent a note each and every morning begging an audience. He has papers for her signature,\" he added. \"But in one of the notes I chanced to read over Princess Alesandra\u0027s shoulder, Dreyson also insisted he had alarming news to give her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin leaned further back in his chair. \"How did Alesandra react to this note?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wasn\u0027t at all upset,\" Flannaghan replied. \"I questioned her, of course, and asked her if she shouldn\u0027t be a little concerned. She said Dreyson\u0027s alarm probably had something to do with a market downswing. I didn\u0027t know what she was talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was talking about financial losses,\" he explained. \"Send a note to Dreyson, too, telling him that he is invited to call on Alesandra at my father\u0027s town house. Set the time for three o\u0027clock, Flannaghan. We should be through with family business by then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe servant still didn\u0027t leave. \"Was there something more you wanted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will Princess Alesandra be leaving us?\" The worry in the servant\u0027s tone was evident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a good chance she\u0027ll move in with my father and mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, milord…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father is her guardian, Flannaghan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That may be,\" the servant countered. \"But you\u0027re the only one fit enough to watch out for her. Begging your pardon for being so blunt, but your father is getting along in years and your brother has his wife and child to look after. That leaves you, milord. \u0027Tis the truth, I would be very distressed if anything happened to our princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s going to happen to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conviction in his employer\u0027s voice appeased Flannaghan\u0027s worry. Colin was acting like a protector now. He was a possessive man by nature, stubborn, and just a little bit obtuse, in Flannaghan\u0027s estimation, because Colin was taking forever to come to the realization that he and Princess Alesandra were meant for each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin turned his attention back to his ledgers. Flannaghan coughed to let him know he wasn\u0027t quite finished bothering him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else is on your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just thought I would mention… that is, the incident in front of the Opera…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin shut his book. \"Yes?\" he prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s affected her. She hasn\u0027t said anything to me, but I know she hasn\u0027t gotten over the incident. She\u0027s still blaming herself for Raymond\u0027s injury.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlannaghan nodded. \"She keeps apologizing to her guard and this morning, when she came downstairs, I could tell she\u0027d been weeping. I believe you should have a talk with her, milord. A princess should not cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlannaghan sounded like an authority on the topic of royalty. Colin nodded. \"All right, I\u0027ll have a talk with her later. Now leave me alone. For the first time in months, I\u0027m actually close to being caught up and I want to get today\u0027s totals entered. I don\u0027t wish to be disturbed until dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlannaghan didn\u0027t mind his employer\u0027s gruffness. Colin would take care of the princess, and that was all that really mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler\u0027s cheerful mood was sorely tested the rest of the afternoon. He spent most of his time answering the front door and turning away potential suitors. It was a damn nuisance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt seven o\u0027clock that evening, Sir Richards arrived on their doorstep. He didn\u0027t request admission. The head of England\u0027s Security Section demanded to be let in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlannaghan ushered Sir Richards up the stairs and into Colin\u0027s study. The distinguished-looking gray-haired gentleman waited until the butler had taken his leave before speaking to Colin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re looking none the worse for wear,\" he announced. \"I wanted to look in on you to see how you\u0027re doing, of course, and also compliment you on a job well done. The Wellingham business could have gotten sticky. You handled it well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin leaned back in his chair. \"It did get sticky,\" he reminded the director.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but you handled it with your usual tact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin caught himself before he snorted with laughter. Handled with tact? How like the director to summarize in gentlemen\u0027s terms the necessary killing of one of England\u0027s enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you really here, Richards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To compliment you, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin did laugh then. Richards smiled. \"I could use a spot of brandy,\" he announced with a wave of his hand in the direction of the side bar against the wall. \"Will you join me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin declined the offer. He started to get up to see to the director\u0027s request, but Richards waved him back to his seat \"I can fetch it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director poured himself a drink, then went over to sit in the leather-backed chair facing the desk. \"Morgan\u0027s going to be joining us in just a few minutes. I wanted to talk to you first, however. Another little problem has developed and I thought it might be just the task for Morgan to handle. An opportunity, you see, for him to get his feet wet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s joining the ranks then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He would like to be of service to his country,\" the director told him. \"What do you think of him, Colin? Forget diplomacy and give me your gut reaction to the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin shrugged. His neck was stiff from leaning over the ledgers for so long and he rolled his shoulders, trying to work the knots out. \"I understand he inherited title and land from his father a few years back. He\u0027s the Earl of Oakmount now, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Sir Richards replied. \"But you\u0027re only half right. The title and land came from an uncle. Morgan\u0027s father ran tail years ago. The boy was shuffled from one relative to another during the growing years. There was talk of illegitimacy and some think that was the reason the father abandoned the boy. Morgan\u0027s mother died when he was four or five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A difficult childhood,\" Colin remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director agreed. \"It made him the man he is today. He learned to be clever early on, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know more about his background than I do,\" Colin said. \"All I can add is superficial. I\u0027ve seen him at various functions. He\u0027s well liked by the ton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director took a long swallow of the brandy before speaking again. \"You still haven\u0027t given me your opinion,\" he reminded Colin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not hedging,\" Colin replied. \"I honestly don\u0027t know him well enough to form an opinion. He seems likable enough. Nathan doesn\u0027t particularly like him, though. I do remember him making that remark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director smiled. \"Your partner doesn\u0027t like anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true, he doesn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he have specific reasons for disliking Morgan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He referred to him as one of the pretty boys. Morgan\u0027s a handsome man, or so I\u0027m told by the women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan doesn\u0027t like him because of his appearance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin laughed. Sir Richards sounded incredulous. \"My partner doesn\u0027t like charmers. He says he never knows what they\u0027re thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director filed that information away in the back of his mind. \"Morgan has almost as many contacts as you have, and he would be a tremendous asset to the department. Still, I\u0027m determined to take it slow. I still don\u0027t know how he\u0027ll handle himself in a crisis. I\u0027ve invited him here to talk to you, Colin. There\u0027s another delicate matter you might want to consider handling for us. If you decide in favor of taking on the assignment, I\u0027d like Morgan to get involved. He could do well to learn from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m retired, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director smiled. \"So am I,\" he drawled out. \"I\u0027ve been trying to hand the reins over for a good four years now. I\u0027m getting too old for this business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never quit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And neither will you,\" Richards predicted. \"At least not until your company can survive without your added income. Tell me this, son. Has your partner wondered yet where the additional funds are coming from? I know you didn\u0027t want him to know you\u0027ve started helping the department out again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin stacked his hands behind his neck. \"He isn\u0027t aware,\" he explained. \"Nathan\u0027s been occupied opening the second office. His wife, Sara, is due to have their first baby any day now. I doubt Nathan has had time to notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when he does notice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell him the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could use Nathan again,\" the director said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s out of the question. He has a family now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Richards reluctantly agreed. He turned the topic back to the task he wanted Colin to accept. \"About this assignment,\" he began. \"It\u0027s no more dangerous than the last, but… ah, good evening, Princess Alesandra. It\u0027s a pleasure to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood just outside the entrance. Colin wondered how much she had overheard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at the director. \"It\u0027s good to see you again, sir,\" she replied in a soft whisper. \"I hope I haven\u0027t intruded. The door was ajar, but if you\u0027re in the middle of a conference, I\u0027ll come back later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Richards hastily stood up and walked over to her. He took hold of her hand and bowed low. \"You haven\u0027t intruded,\" he assured her. \"Come and sit down. I wanted to talk to you before I left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe latched on to her elbow and ushered her over to a chair. She sat down and smoothed her skirts while she waited for him to take his seat as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard about the unfortunate incident outside the Royal Opera House,\" the director remarked with a frown. He sat down, nodded to Colin, and then turned his attention back to her. \"Have you recovered from your upset?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There wasn\u0027t anything for me to recover from, Sir Richards. My guard was injured. Raymond required eight stitches in all, but they were removed yesterday. He\u0027s feeling much better now. Isn\u0027t that right, Colin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her gaze fully directed on Sir Richards when she included Colin in the conversation. He didn\u0027t mind her lack of attention. He was fully occupied trying to hide his amusement. Sir Richards was blushing. Colin couldn\u0027t believe it. The hard-nosed, steel-hearted director of covert operations was blushing like a schoolboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra was mesmerizing the man. Colin wondered if she had any idea of her effect or if it was deliberate. Her smile was innocently sweet, her gaze direct, unwavering, and if she started in batting her eyelashes, then Colin would know the seduction wasn\u0027t quite so innocent after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you had an opportunity to look into the other matter we discussed?\" she asked. \"I realize it was bold of me to ask anything of such an important man, Sir Richards, and I want you to know how grateful I am for your offer to send someone to Gretna Green.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already taken care of that duty,\" the director replied. \"My man, Simpson, only just returned last evening. You were correct, Princess. There isn\u0027t a record with either Robert Elliott or his rival, David Laing.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-12.html","bookId":1789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM"}
