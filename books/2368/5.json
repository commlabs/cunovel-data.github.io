She thought of seeing Dr. Speakman again, but she knew she dare not discuss this with anyone. She felt guilty even thinking that her father might have done such a terrible thing. She pushed the thought away and tried to concentrate on her work. It was impossible. She looked down in dismay at a logo she had just botched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShane Miller was watching her, concerned. \"Are you all right, Ashley?\" She forced a smile. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really am sorry about your friend.\" She had told him about Jim. \"I\u0027ll - I\u0027ll get over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about dinner tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Shane. I - I\u0027m not up to it just yet. Next week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. If there\u0027s anything I can do - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate it. There\u0027s nothing anyone can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToni said to Alette, \"Miss Tight Ass has a problem. Well, she can get stuffed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel dispiace - sorry\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;for her. She is troubled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sod her. We all have our problems, don\u0027t we, luv?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Ashley was leaving on a Friday afternoon before a holiday weekend, Dennis Tibble stopped her. \"Hey, babe. I need a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Dennis, I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on. Lighten up!\" He took Ashley\u0027s arm. \"I need some advice from a woman\u0027s point of view.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dennis, I\u0027m not in the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve fallen in love with somebody, and I want to marry her, but there are problems. Will you help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley hesitated. She did not like Dennis Tibble, but she could see no harm in trying to help him. \"Can this wait until tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to talk to you now. It\u0027s really urgent.\" Ashley took a deep breath. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we go to your apartment?\" She shook her head. \"No.\" She would never be able to make him leave. \"Will you stop by my place?\" Ashley hesitated. \"Very well.\" That way I can leave when I want to. If I can help him get the woman he\u0027s in love with, maybe he\u0027ll leave me alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToni said to Alette, \"God! Goody Two-shoes is going to the twerp\u0027s apartment. Can you believe she could be that stupid? Where\u0027s her sodding brains?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s just trying to help him. There\u0027s nothing wrong with - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on, Alette. When are you going to grow up? The man wants to bonk her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Non va. Non si fa cosi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t have said it better myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDennis Tibble\u0027s apartment was furnished in neonightmare. Posters of old horror movies hung from the walls, next to pinups of naked models and wild animals feeding. Tiny erotic wood carvings were spread out on tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s the apartment of a madman, Ashley thought. She could not wait to get out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027m glad you could come, baby. I really appreciate this. If - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stay long, Dennis.\" Ashley warned him. \"Tell me about this woman you\u0027re in love with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s really something.\" He held out a cigarette. \"Cigarette?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t smoke.\" She watched him light up. \"How about a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"You don\u0027t smoke, you don\u0027t drink. That leaves an interesting activity, doesn\u0027t it?\" She said to him sharply, \"Dennis, if you don\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only kidding.\" He walked over to the bar and poured some wine. \"Have a little wine. That can\u0027t hurt you.\" He handed her the glass. She took a sip of wine. \"Tell me about Miss Right.\" Dennis Tibble sat down on the couch next to Ashley. \"I\u0027ve never met anybody like her. She\u0027s sexy like you and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it or I\u0027ll leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, that was meant as a compliment. Anyway, she\u0027s crazy about me, but her mother and father are very social, and they hate me.\" Ashley made no comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the thing is, if I push it, she\u0027ll marry me, but she\u0027ll alienate her family. She\u0027s really close to them, and if I marry her, they\u0027ll sure as hell disown her. Then one day, she\u0027ll probably blame me. Do you see the problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley took another sip of wine. \"Yes. I...\" After that, time seemed to vanish in a mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe awakened slowly, knowing that something was terribly wrong. She felt as though she had been drugged. It was an enormous effort merely to open her eyes. Ashley looked around the room and began to panic. She was lying in a bed, naked, in a cheap hotel room. She managed to sit up, and her head started to pound. She had no idea where she was or how she had gotten there. There was a room service menu on the nightstand, and she reached over and picked it up. The Chicago Loop Hotel. She read it again, stunned. What am I doing in Chicago? How long have I been here? The visit to Dennis Tibble\u0027s apartment had been on Friday. What day is this? With growing alarm, she picked up the telephone. \"May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was difficult for Ashley to speak. \"What - what day is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today is the seventeenth of - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I mean what day of the week is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Today is Monday. Can I - \" Ashley replaced the receiver in a daze. Monday. She had lost two days and two nights. She sat up at the edge of the bed, trying to remember. She had gone to Dennis Tibble\u0027s apartment.... She had had a glass of wine.... After that, everything was a blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had put something in her glass of wine that had made her temporarily lose her memory. She had read about incidents where a drug like that had been used. It was called the \"date rape drug.\" That was what he had given her. The talk about wanting her advice had been a ruse. And like a fool, I fell for it. She had no recollection of going to the airport, flying to Chicago or checking into this seedy hotel room with Tibble. And worse -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;no recollection of what had happened in this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got to get out of here, Ashley thought desperately. She felt unclean, as though every inch of her body had been violated. What had he done to her? Trying not to think about it, she got out of bed, walked into the tiny bathroom and stepped into the shower. She let the stream of hot water pound against her body, trying to wash away whatever terrible, dirty things had happened to her. What if he had gotten her pregnant? The thought of having his child was sickening. Ashley got out of the shower, dried herself and walked over to the closet. Her clothes were missing. The only things inside the closet were a black leather miniskirt, a cheap-looking tube top and a pair of spiked high-heeled shoes. She was repelled by the thought of putting on the clothes, but she had no choice. She dressed quickly and glanced in the mirror. She looked like a prostitute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley examined her purse. Only forty dollars. Her checkbook and credit card were still there. Thank God!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went out into the corridor. It was empty. She took the elevator down to the seedy-looking lobby and walked over to the checkout desk, where she handed the elderly cashier her credit card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leavin\u0027 us already?\" He leered. \"Well, you had a good time, hub?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley stared at him, wondering what he meant and afraid to find out. She was tempted to ask him when Dennis Tibble had checked out, but she decided it was better not to bring it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cashier was putting her credit card through a machine. He frowned and put it through again. Finally, he said, \"I\u0027m sorry. This card won\u0027t go through. You\u0027ve exceeded your limit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley\u0027s mouth dropped open. \"That\u0027s impossible! There\u0027s some mistake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk shrugged. \"Do you have another credit card?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I - I don\u0027t Will you take a personal check?\" He was eyeing her outfit disapprovingly. \"I guess so, if you have some ID.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to make a telephone call....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Telephone booth in the corner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"San Francisco Memorial Hospital...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Steven Patterson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One moment, please...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Patterson\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sarah? This is Ashley. I need to speak to my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. Miss Patterson. He\u0027s in the operating room and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley\u0027s grip tightened on the telephone. \"Do you know how long he\u0027ll be there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard to say. I know he has another surgery scheduled after - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley found herself fighting hysteria. \"I need to talk to him. It\u0027s urgent. Can you get word to him, please? As soon as he gets a chance, have him call me.\" She looked at the telephone number in the booth and gave it to her father\u0027s receptionist. \"I\u0027ll wait here until he calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be sure to tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat in the lobby for almost an hour, willing the telephone to ring. People passing by stared at her or ogled her, and she felt naked in the tawdry outfit she was wearing. When the phone finally rang, it startled her. She hurried back into the phone booth. \"Hello...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ashley?\" It was her father\u0027s voice. \"Oh, Father, I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in Chicago and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing in Chicago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t go into it now. I need an airline ticket to San Jose. I don\u0027t have any money with me. Can you help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Hold on.\" Three minutes later, her father came back on the line. \"There\u0027s an American Airlines plane leaving O\u0027Hare at ten-forty A.M., Flight 407. There will be a ticket waiting for you at the check-in counter. I\u0027ll pick you up at the airport in San Jose and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" She could not let him see her like this. \"I\u0027ll -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027ll go to my apartment to change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I\u0027ll come down and meet you for dinner. You can tell me all about it then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Father. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the plane going home, Ashley thought about the unforgivable thing Dennis Tibble had done to her. I\u0027m going to have to go to the police, she decided. I can\u0027t let him get away with this. How many other women has he done this to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ashley got back to her apartment, she felt as though she had returned to a sanctuary. She could not wait to get out of the tacky outfit she was wearing. She stripped it off as quickly as she could. She felt as though she needed another shower before she met her father. She started to walk over to her closet and stopped. In front of her, on the dressing table, was a burned cigarette butt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were seated at a corner table in a restaurant at The Oaks. Ashley\u0027s father was studying her, concerned. \"What were you doing in Chicago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, puzzled. \"You don\u0027t know?\" Ashley hesitated, trying to make up her mind whether to tell him what had happened. Perhaps he could give her some advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said carefully, \"Dennis Tibble asked me up to his apartment to help him with a problem....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dennis Tibble? That snake?\" Long ago, Ashley had introduced her father to the people she worked with. \"How could you have anything to do with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley knew instantly that she had made a mistake. Her father had always overreacted to any problems she had. Especially when it involved a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I ever see you around here again, Cleary. I\u0027ll break every bone in your body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not important,\" Ashley said. \"I want to hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley sat still for a moment, filled with a sense of foreboding. \"Well, I had a drink at Dennis\u0027s apartment and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she talked, she watched her father\u0027s face grow grim. There was a look in his eyes that frightened her. She tried to cut the story short. \"No,\" her father insisted. \"I want to hear it all....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley lay in bed that night, too drained to sleep, her thoughts chaotic. If what Dennis did to me becomes public, it will be humiliating. Everyone at work will know what happened. But I can\u0027t let him do this to anyone else. I have to tell the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople had tried to warn her that Dennis was obsessed with her, but she had ignored them. Now, looking back ID it, she could see all the signs: Dennis had hated to see anyone else talking to her; he was constantly begging her for dates; he was always eavesdropping...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least I know who the stalker is, Ashley thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 8:30 in the morning, as Ashley was getting ready to leave for work, the telephone rang. She picked it up. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ashley, it\u0027s Shane. Have you heard the news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s on television. They just found Dennis Tibble\u0027s body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant the earth seemed to shift. \"Oh, my God! What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to the sheriff\u0027s office, somebody stabbed him to death and then castrated him.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tell-me-your-dreams/page-5.html","bookId":2368,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:53 AM"}
