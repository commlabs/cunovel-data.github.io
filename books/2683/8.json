You\u0027re looking very Uma-ish. Love the outfit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s retro-gone-wacko. I did six shows today. I\u0027m exhausted, she says, signing an autograph. \"I saw you at the Calvin Klein show giving Chloe moral support. Which was so cool of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I wasn\u0027t at the Calvin Klein show but you\u0027re still looking very Uma-ish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, I\u0027m positive you were at the Calvin Klein show. I saw you in the second row next to Stephen Dorff and David Salle and Roy Liebenthal. I saw you pose for a photo on 42nd Street, then get into a black scary car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePause, while I consider this scenario, then: \"The second f**king row? No way, baby. You haven\u0027t started your ignition yet. Will I see yon tomorrow night, baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming with Jason Priestley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why aren\u0027t you coming with me? Am I the only one who thinks Jason Priestley looks like a little caterpillar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, that\u0027s not nice,\" she pouts. \"What would Chloe think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She thinks Jason Priestley looks like a little caterpillar too,\" I murmur, lost in thought. \"The f**king second row?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I meant,\" Anjanette says. \"What would Chloe think of-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spare me, baby, but you\u0027re supergreat.\" I start the Vespa up again. \"Take your passion and make it happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard you\u0027ve been naughty anyway, so I\u0027m not surprised,\" she says, tiredly wagging her finger at me, which Scooter, the bodyguard who looks like Marcellus from Pulp Fiction, interprets as \"move closer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean by that, pu**ycat?\" I ask. \"What have you heard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScooter whispers something, pointing at his watch, while Anjanette lights a cigarette. \"There\u0027s always a car waiting. There\u0027s always a Steven Meisel photo shoot. Jesus, how do we do it, Victor? How do we survive this mess?\" A gleaming black sedan rolls forward and Scooter opens the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you, baby.\" I hand her a French tulip I just happen to be holding and start pulling away from the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Victor,\" she calls out, handing Scooter the French tulip. \"I got the job! I got the contract.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great, baby. I gotta run. What job, you crazy chick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess?.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matsuda? Gap?\" I grin, limousines honking behind me. \"Baby, listen, see you tomorrow night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Guess?.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I already did. You\u0027re mind-tripping me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess?, Victor,\" she\u0027s shouting as I pull away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, you\u0027re great,\" I shout back. \"Call me. Leave a message. But only at the club. Peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess?, Victor!\" she calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, you\u0027re a face to watch,\" I say, already putting a Walkman on, already on 61st. \"A star of tomorrow,\" I call out, waving. \"Let\u0027s have drinks at Monkey Bar after the shows are over on Sunday!\" I\u0027m speaking to myself now and moving toward Alison\u0027s place. Passing a newsstand by the new Gap, I notice I\u0027m still on the cover of the current issue of YouthQuake, looking pretty cool-the headline 27 AND HIP in bold purple letters above my smiling, expressionless face, and I\u0027ve just got to buy another copy, but since I don\u0027t have any cash there\u0027s no way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom 72nd and Madison I called Alison\u0027s doorman, who has verified that outside her place on 80th and Park Damien\u0027s goons are not waiting in a black Jeep, so when I get there I can pull up to the entrance and roll my Vespa into the lobby, where Juan-who\u0027s a pretty decent-looking guy, about twenty-four-is hanging out in uniform. As I give him the peace sign, wheeling the moped into the elevator, Juan comes out from behind the front desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey Victor, did you talk to Joel Wilkenfeld yet?\" Juan\u0027s asking, following me. \"I mean, last week you said you would and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey baby, it\u0027s cool, Juan, it\u0027s cool,\" I say, inserting the key, unlocking the elevator, pressing the button for the top floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan presses another button, to keep the door open. \"But man, you said he\u0027d see me and also set up a meeting with-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m setting it up, buddy, it\u0027s cool,\" I stress, pressing again for the top floor. \"You\u0027re the next Markus Schenkenberg. You\u0027re the white Tyson.\" I reach over and push his hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey man, I\u0027m Hispanic-\" He keeps pressing the Door Open button. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-8.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
