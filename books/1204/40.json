{"id":29422,"no":40,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIX. THE LAST ROARING OF THE BULL.","content":"“Come,” she said, after a while, “let us go to my father!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now, the rubicon being passed, there shone a quick and alert gladness upon her face. Her feet scarcely seemed to touch the ground. The mood of sedateness had passed away, and she hummed a gay tune as we went down the stairs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alexander Gordon was coming across the yard to speak with his wife as Mary and I appeared hand in hand at the stair foot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stopped as it had been suddenly aghast when he caught sight of us.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mary!” he cried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She nodded and made him a little prim curtesy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What means this?” he said, sternly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Just that Quintin and I love one another!”{351}\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And as she spoke I saw the frown gather ominously on Alexander Gordon’s face. His wife came near and looked at him. I saw him flash a glance at her so quick, so stern, and full of meaning that the ready river of her speech froze on her lips.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “This is rank foolishness, Mary!” he cried; “go indoors this instant and get to your broidering. Let me hear no more of this!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the spirit of the Gordons was in the daughter as well as in the sire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will not,” she said; “I am of age, and though in all else I have obeyed you, in this I will not.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Glance for glance their eyes encountered, nor could I see that either pair quailed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Laird of Earlstoun turned to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And you, sir, whom I trusted as my friend, how came you here under pretext of amity, thus to lead away my daughter?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The question was fiercely spoken, the tone sullenly angry. Yet somehow both rang hollow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I was about to answer when Mary interrupted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nay, father,” she cried, looking him fearlessly in the face; “it was I that proffered my{352} love. He would not ask me, though I tried to make him. I had to tell him that I loved him, and make him ask me to marry him!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Was it fancy that the flicker of a smile passed at that moment over the grim countenance of the Bull?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His wife was again about to speak, but he turned fiercely on her and bade her be silent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And now,” he said, turning to his daughter, “what do you propose to do with your man when ye have ‘speered’ him?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He used the local country expression for a proposal of marriage. “I will marry him here and now,” she said; adding hastily, “that is, if he will have me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ye had better speer him that too!” said her father, grimly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will do better,” cried Mary Gordon. “I will acknowledge him!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And holding up my hand in hers she cried aloud: “I take you for my husband, Quintin MacClellan!” She looked up at me with a challenge in her eye.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My wife!” was all that I could utter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well,” said Sandy, “that is your bed made, my lassie. You have both said it before{353} witnesses. You must take him now, whether ye will or not!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hugh,” he cried, with a sudden roar towards the servants’ quarters. And from the haymow in the barn where he had been making a pretence of work a retainer appeared with a scared expression on his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Run over to the cot-house at the road-end and tell the minister lad that the Dumfries Presbytery deposed to come to the Earlstoun and that smartly, else I will come down and fetch him myself!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The man was already on his way ere the sentence was ended, and when the Laird roared the last words after him he fairly seemed to jump.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was out of sight among the trees a moment after.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now,” said Alexander Gordon, “Mary and you have proclaimed yourselves man and wife. Ye shall be soundly married by a minister, and then ye shall go your ways forth. Think not that I will give you the worth of a boddle either in gear or land. Ye have asked me no permission. Ye have defied me. I say not that I will disown ye. But, at least, I owe you nothing.”{354}\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Father,” said Mary, “did I ask you for aught, or did Quintin?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nay,” said he, grimly, “not even for my daughter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then,” said she, “do not refuse that for which you have not been asked!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And how may you propose to live?” her father went on triumphantly. “Ye would not look at him when he had kirk and glebe, manse and stipend. And now ye take him by force when he is no better than a beggar at the dykeback. That it is to be a woman!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She kindled at the words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And what a thing to be a man! Ye think that a woman’s love consists in goods and gear, comfortable beds and fine apparelling!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Comfortable beds are not to be lightlied,” said her father; “as ye will find, my lass, or a’ be done.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She did not heed him, but flashed on with her defiance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You, and those like you, think that the way to win a woman is to bide till ye have made all smooth, so that there be not a curl on the rose-leaves, nor yet a bitter drop in the cup. Even Quintin there thought thus, till he learned better.”{355}\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She did not so much as pause to smile, though I think her father did—but covertly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No!” she cried, “I love, and because I love I will (as you say floutingly) be ready to lie at a dykeback like a tinkler’s wench. I will follow my man through the world because he is my man—yes, all the more because he is injured, despised, one who has had little happiness and no satisfaction in life. And now I will give him these things. I—I only will make it all up to him. With my love I can do it, and I will!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her father nodded menacingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ye shall try the dykebacks this very nicht, my lass! And ye shall e’en see how ye like them, after the fine linen sheets and panelled chambers of the Earlstoun.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But her mother broke out at last.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, my bairn!” she cried. “Married or single ye shall not go forth from us thus!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hold your tongue, woman!” roared the Bull, shaking the very firmament with his voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Be not feared, my lass; ye shall have your mother’s countenance, though your father cast you off,” said Janet Gordon, nodding at us with unexpected graciousness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hold your peace, I tell you!”{356}\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye, Sandy, when I have done!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Though he turn you to the doorstep I will pray for you,” she went on; “and for company on the way I will give you a copy of my meditations, which are most meet and precious.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her husband laughed a quick, mocking laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A bundle of clean sarks wad fit them better—but here comes the minister.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I turned about somewhat shamefacedly, and there, bowing to the Laird of Earlstoun, was young Gilchrist of Dunscore, whom the Presbytery of Dumfries had lately deposed. He was about to begin a speech of congratulation, but the Bull broke through.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Marry these two!” he commanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And with his finger he pointed at Mary and myself, as if he had been ordering us for immediate execution.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But——” began the minister.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Instantly an astonishing volume of sound filled the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But me no buts! Tie them up this moment! Or, by the Lord, I will eviscerate you with my sword!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And with that he snatched his great basket-hilted{357} blade from the scabbard, where it swung on a pin by the side of the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So, with a quaking minister, my own head dazed and uncertain with the whirl of events, and Mary Gordon giving her father back defiant glance for glance, we were married decently and in order.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now,” said Alexander Gordon, so soon as the “Amen” was out, “go to your chamber with your mother, Mistress Mary! Take whatever ye can carry, but no more, and get you gone out of this house with the man you have chosen. I will teach you to be fond of dykebacks and of throwing yourself away upon beggarly, broken men!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he frowned down upon her, as with head erect and scornful carriage she swept past him—her mother trotting behind like a frightened child.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I think Alexander Gordon greatly desired to say something to me while he and I stood waiting for her return. For he kept shifting his weight from one foot to the other, now turning to the window, anon humming half a tune and breaking off short in the midst. But ever as he came towards me with obvious intent to speak, he checked himself, shaking his{358} head sagely, and so resumed again his restless marching to and fro.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently my lass came down with a proud high look on her face, her mother following after, all beblubbered with tears and wringing her hands silently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I bid you farewell, father!” Mary said; “till now you have ever been a kind father to me. And some day you will forgive this seeming disobedience!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then it was that her father made a strange speech.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Quintin MacClellan has muckle to thank me for. For had it not been for the roaring of the Bull, he had not so easily gotten away the dainty quey!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So side by side, and presently when we got to the wood’s edge hand in hand, Mary Gordon and I went out into the world together.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Final Addition and Conclusion by Hob MacClellan.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus my brother left the writing which has fallen into my hand. In a word I must finish what I cannot alter or amend.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His marriage with Mary Gordon was most happy and gracious, though I have ever heard{359} that she retained throughout her life her high proud nature and hasty speech.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her father relented his anger after the great renovation of the Covenants at Auchensaugh. Indeed, I question whether in driving them forth from Earlstoun, as hath been told, Alexander Gordon was not acting a part. For when he came to see my wife, Alexander-Jonita, after our little Quintin was born, he said, “Heard ye aught of your brother and his wife?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I told him that they were well and hearty, full of honour, work, and the happiness of children.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye,” said he, after a pause of reflection, “Quintin has indeed muckle to thank me for. I took the only way with our Mary, to make her ten times fonder o’ him than she was.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he chuckled a little deep laugh in his throat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But,” he said, “I wad gie a year’s rent to ken how she liked the dykeback the night she left the Earlstoun.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe End\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1651/48780.html","bookId":1204,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:32:32 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:32:32 AM"}
