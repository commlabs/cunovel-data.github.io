Only she and Genevieve had heard Penelope\u0027s confession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027re free now,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the sun rose, Dracula dissolved. Torches were hurriedly touched to the bier. Flames rose and licked around the coffin. The corpse writhed as if galvanised. Decay, staved off for so many years, thrived in the Prince\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrincess Asa was restrained from throwing herself into the pyre like an Indian widow. Penelope took a broad black hat out of her bag and set it on the Princess\u0027s head, shielding her from the dawnlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate watched Dracula\u0027s coffin burn and felt no triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a burst from the heart of the fire and a column of ashes and sparks rose from the pyre. The body caught light and burned up entirely. There was now only wood to burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate felt the heat of the fire and the chill of the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope passed Asa to Klove and turned away from the fire. Genevieve had walked down to the water\u0027s edge. Kate linked arms with Penny and walked with her, treading carefully on the wet sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Orthodox priest\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;representing Vlad\u0027s original faith\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;droned a prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcello, hidden behind his dark glasses, walked back toward the cliffs. Her desperate love was burned away, but she had no ill-will for him. He was as lost as everyone else. She understood he\u0027d given up journalism and become a publicity agent for all the new Malenkas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles, Dracula, Marcello. All gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate was dizzyingly free of all but the ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three women stood by the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m on a flight back to London this afternoon,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027I\u0027m not sorry to go. Things will have piled up. And I need to earn some money. The Guardian wants to pack me off to Cuba, to cast an eye over this Castro fellow and see what I make of him.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m going to Greece,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027Then, maybe Australia. I thought I\u0027d look into this rocketry business. I\u0027ve been staying put these last few years. It\u0027s time to travel again.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnspoken between them was that they all thought it best to stay away from Rome. If they met any vampires, elders or not, they\u0027d advise them gently to give the eternal city a wide berth. There was someone there quite old enough, and jealous of her position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope paddled, letting the water into her shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027d like to visit Pamela\u0027s grave,\u0027 Penelope said. \u0027It\u0027s in the hill country, in India. My cousin was important to me. I realise now how I have deliberately veered between trying to be exactly like her and trying to be nothing like her.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope explained as if asking permission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate didn\u0027t know what to do. She ought to break the story. Penelope would be a heroine to many. Funds were already being raised for the defence of her fall guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had only just forgiven Penelope for everything else that was between them. This latest addition to the load would take some coping with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll never tell,\u0027 Genevieve said. She still croaked a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope thanked Genevieve and shook her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula\u0027s smoke poured out over the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Me neither,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027Probably.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope smiled coldly and kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I only said \"probably\".\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know what you mean. I\u0027ve always known what you meant. And remember that, despite everything I have told you and everything we have been through together, I am still Penny and you are still Katie.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate saw the frost in Penny\u0027s eyes. She was changing again, emerging from another cast-off snakeskin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tag,\u0027 Penny said, \u0027you\u0027re it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenelope tapped her shoulder solemnly and ran off toward some rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve didn\u0027t understand at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s a game, Gene,\u0027 Kate explained. \u0027We were children together, remember?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elder vampire looked solemn and seemed younger than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tag, You\u0027re It?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 Kate said, tapping Genevieve\u0027s chest. And now you\u0027re it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran away, not very fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve caught on, and by the time Kate reached the rocks, her friend was waiting for her, to tag her back. Laughing, Kate feinted towards Genevieve\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;who eluded her with the fleetness of a vampire elder and the cunning of a sixteen-year-old French girl\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and leaped across a pool to tag Penny, who fell over, splashing, and reached out to find Kate had darted away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tag, you\u0027re it,\u0027 Kate said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran past the still-burning pyre, skipping through the ashy sand, dodging between the undertaker and the attendants, furiously pursued by Penelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll get you yet, Katie Reed,\u0027 Penny shouted, without malice. \u0027Just you wait...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate ran along the beach, away from the fire. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-37.html","bookId":2295,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:16 PM"}
