A slight knot from when his face had kissed the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender, security guard, and busboy who\u0027d gang-piled him had been persuaded not to call the police by a fistful of Professor Dan\u0027s money. It wasn\u0027t out of kindness. Dan didn\u0027t want to be taken downtown for disturbing the peace and destruction of property. He\u0027d given Conner one last warning to stay away from Tyranny before he left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyranny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner couldn\u0027t sort through all the jumbled feelings in his gut. All he could do was sit there and hang his head and feel like a world-class sucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdding insult to injury was the Captain Kirk costume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner\u0027s shirt and jeans had been soaked with beer during his fight with Dan, a big rip in the shirt too. He\u0027d reluctantly agreed to change into the dry Kirk costume. What did it matter now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandy entered the lounge, sat at the table with Conner. Randy lifted his hand, spread his fingers in Vulcan salute. \"Live long and prosper, Captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too late,\" Conner said. \"And don\u0027t call me Captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just trying to cheer you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In case you haven\u0027t noticed,\" Conner said, \"I\u0027m having a shitty day. So I\u0027m not really in the mood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandy looked away, drummed his fingers on the table. Finally, he said, \"Let me tell you your problem, Conner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your problem is that you fail to comprehend some universal truths. Truths that are so true they\u0027re clich¨¦ but true nonetheless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this going to take long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want a ride back to Pensacola, shut up and listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here are a few examples,\" Randy said. \"What goes around comes around. The pot calling the kettle black. Takes one to know one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forgot Be Kind Rewind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandy went on like Conner hadn\u0027t said anything. \"I see how you look at me, how you look at all these people around here. We\u0027re big dorks, right? Geeks. Let me tell you something. I wake up every day just fine with who I am. I don\u0027t have to apologize to the cool people. What you don\u0027t seem to realize is that you\u0027re getting the same treatment. Professor Dan thinks you\u0027re nobody. He thinks less of you than you think of me. You\u0027re just shit he\u0027s trying to scrape off his shoe. If you want to live in a world where everybody has to look down on somebody else to feel good, then that\u0027s your world. That\u0027s where you live. Count me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner didn\u0027t say anything, closed his eyes, held the ice tighter against his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s another thing,\" Randy said. \"I fell in love with Tyranny too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner\u0027s eyes popped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s one of those people with a magic light around her. And she doesn\u0027t treat me like a comic-book geek. You\u0027re lucky to even know her. But you\u0027re not grateful. You think you\u0027ve been slighted. You think you\u0027ve been robbed. You\u0027re one of the lucky ones, and you don\u0027t even know it because you\u0027re so good at being a sarcastic, miserable bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandy stood. \"By the way, I arranged for Jerry to come out and talk to you on his dinner break. Oh, and you\u0027re welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner watched Randy leave. At first, he was angry at the kid. What did he know about anything? What did Comic Book Boy know about Conner Samson? But Randy\u0027s Universal Truths echoed between Conner\u0027s ears for the rest of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hotel restaurant, Jerry ordered a cheeseburger (hold the lettuce, pickle, onion, or anything resembling a vegetable), a double order of fries, and a Dr Pepper. Conner sat across from him, sipped a cup of black coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry was tall, skeletal thin, hunched over, blond hair thinning and brushy. Nose like a beak. He mistakenly believed he was growing a beard, but to Conner it looked like patchy blond fungus under his lip and along his jaw. Jerry ate like a condemned man, smacking lips. Little noises of desperate enjoyment. Occasionally, Jerry even chewed once or twice before swallowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner let him eat, waited until Jerry was ready to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry belched, shoved fries into his cheek like he was a chipmunk storing up for winter. \"You wanted to know about Teddy Folger\u0027s Joe DiMaggio card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re lucky I\u0027m talking to you,\" Jerry said. \"I\u0027m an expert. I know everything there is about baseball collectibles. I have special knowledge. Don\u0027t people with special knowledge get a consulting fee or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m paying for your cheeseburger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry shrugged. \"Well, you\u0027re a pal of Randy\u0027s, so I\u0027ll help you out. What do you want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I know is that it\u0027s an autographed card,\" Conner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was. It got destroyed in a fire, so if you were thinking about buying it, you\u0027re out of luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just curious why it\u0027s worth twenty thousand dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry scoffed, looked at Conner like he\u0027d taken stupid to a new level. \"More than that! Try a hundred thousand smackers. At least that\u0027s the insurance amount.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner blinked, realized his mouth was hanging open. \"It\u0027s a fucking baseball card! I put them in the spokes of my bike when I was a kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s your dumb luck, isn\u0027t it?\" Jerry gulped Dr Pepper, burped again. \"If you\u0027d archived them properly, they might be worth something now. Like I said, a hundred thousand is just the insured amount. Any collectible is really only worth what somebody is willing to pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" Conner shook his head. He was still in shock. \"So if I went back in time, bought twenty cards, found Mr. DiMaggio, and made him sign them all, they\u0027d each be worth a hundred thousand dollars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry barked laughter, bits of half-chewed french fry flying halfway across the table. \"Jesus, no offense, but that\u0027s a dumb thing to say. You don\u0027t know how this works at all, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027ll explain it to me.\" Asshole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rarity is always a consideration with something like this. If there\u0027s a million of something, then they won\u0027t be worth so much. One of a kind, worth more. It\u0027s just common sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner actually did feel a little dumb not realizing this. It was obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not just the DiMaggio autograph. Lots of those around,\" Jerry said. \"It\u0027s the other signatures that make it worth so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What other signatures?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry rolled his eyes. If he was about to call Conner dumb again, he mercifully changed his mind. \"You really are at square one with this card, huh? Marilyn Monroe and Billy Wilder also signed the card. It\u0027s a famous damn card. You didn\u0027t know? It\u0027s like one of the Holy Grails of collectibles. Sports collectors and film buffs would both kill for it. It\u0027s like if you found an ancient autographed picture of Moses, and Charlton Heston and Cecil B. DeMille had signed it too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner was beginning to understand. It still seemed an outrageous amount of money, but he was getting the idea now that collectors took this kind of thing very seriously. He remembered that DiMaggio and Monroe had been married. Right before she was married to the playwright. Or was that after?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner asked Jerry who would buy such a card, how would somebody find them. Jerry told him collectors came from all walks of life. There were trade magazines and Web sites that put collectors in contact with each other. And conventions. Lots of conventions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the way, I brought you this book.\" Jerry picked his backpack off the floor, found a thick hardcover book, and slid it across the table to Conner. \"If you\u0027re interested in Monroe and DiMaggio, this is the best one. It\u0027s half pop culture analysis and half biography.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner took the book, read the cover. The King and Queen of America by Adam Oppenheimer, Ph.D. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s thirty bucks.\" Jerry held out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner almost threw the book back in the jerk\u0027s face but decided he was curious. He kept the book, gave the money to Jerry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see why you\u0027re this curious,\" Jerry said. \"It\u0027s pointless now. The card burned up with Folger\u0027s shop. Damn shame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ever see the card?\" Conner asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, lots of times. He had it hanging behind the counter in his shop. I\u0027d see it anytime I went over to trade some cards. It was about so big.\" Jerry spread his arms up then down to indicate poster size. \"It was all framed up along with Monroe \u0027s letter. Shit, I almost forgot about the letter. He had a personal, handwritten letter from Monroe too. It was all set up just beautiful. Before he put it in the frame, he used to take it out of the safe to show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Safe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Folger had a safe built into the floor, hidden behind a secret panel under the register. I think he thought it was cool or something. But I guess he was too proud of the card to lock it away and liked to have it on display instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner only half listened. He thought about Joellen Becker. She either didn\u0027t know the card\u0027s actual worth, or she was taking him for a ride. And Conner Samson was getting a little sick of being pushed around and lied to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry had demolished his burger and fries. He looked around the table in case he\u0027d missed something. \"Say, how about some dessert here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner stood, dropped a twenty on the table. He didn\u0027t know if that would cover dessert or not. \"Thanks, Jerry. You were helpful. I have to get going.\" He walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry called after him. \"I can get you a signed DiMaggio in mint condition for a good price. It won\u0027t have the other signatures, but it\u0027s a good card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner didn\u0027t even look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they\u0027d arranged, Conner met Randy at the Geo. Randy had a pair of shopping bags with him and looked pretty pleased with his purchases. They got in the car, headed south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner stared out the window, plans coming together in his mind. It didn\u0027t take him long to decide what he was going to do. It was clear, so very clear and obvious. He wondered if this was what people meant when they talked about inspiration or the muse. As soon as he returned to Pensacola, he\u0027d get started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis new copy of The King and Queen of America wasn\u0027t an easy read. He flipped to a spot in the middle, had to read it twice to get anything out of it. The author talked about Jacques Lacan and some kind of fake persona Marilyn Monroe put out for the public and how deep inside there was the \"real\" Marilyn that maybe got lost somehow. Conner wondered which persona DiMaggio loved, if he\u0027d ever caught a glimpse of the girl who\u0027d been Norma Jean. He closed the book, put it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided he needed to say something to Randy. \"You were right.\" He cleared his throat. \"All that stuff you said about my attitude and everything. You were right. I was out of line, and I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandy didn\u0027t say anything for long seconds. Finally, a sly smile spread slowly from ear to pointy ear. \"You can\u0027t help it. You illogical Earthlings are all governed by your human emotions.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/suicide-squeeze/page-17.html","bookId":2245,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:32 PM"}
