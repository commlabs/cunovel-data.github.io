James and Justine would arrive soon and together they’d escort her to the waterfront park where Jack, his family and Charlotte waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will Jack think so?” Olivia asked, knowing how insecure she sounded. After all these years of living as a single woman, she’d never expected to fall in love again, in love to the point that she was willing to share her home and her life with another man. Until Jack Griffin had come along…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s so touching that Jack asked Pastor Flemming to perform the ceremony,” Grace said, digging for a tissue in the bottom of her purse. “I just know I’m going to ruin everything and cry through the entire thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t,” Olivia assured her, although she wasn’t nearly as confident about herself. Every time she thought of Jack and how much she loved him, she felt like weeping with joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Mom!” Justine said, dashing into the bedroom. She brought her hands together in a gesture of reverence. “You look absolutely gorgeous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia blushed, then kissed her daughter on the cheek. “Thank you, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready?” Justine asked. “The limo’s arrived.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia looked at Grace, and her best friend threw her a bright smile and a thumb’s-up. Exhaling unsteadily, Olivia whispered, “As ready as I’ll ever be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“James was over at Jack’s place, and he’s a nervous wreck,” Justine informed her as they walked out to the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jack?” A few hours earlier, he’d sounded completely under control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eric, Shelly and the boys got here,” Justine went on to explain, “and pandemonium broke out. One of the babies spit up on Jack’s tuxedo. Eric came unglued, but then Shelly calmly cleaned it off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So everything’s right with the world once more,” Olivia murmured. It’d been crazy at her house, too. Seth had picked up James, Selina and Isabella at the Seattle airport, and within an hour of their arrival, Selina had announced she was pregnant again. That was when the celebrating had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your coach awaits you,” Justine said with a little bow as they reached the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she did feel a bit like Cinderella going to the ball. Today marked one of the most significant changes in her life. It was only a matter of weeks since she and Jack had made the decision to marry, but neither was content to delay the wedding. They wanted to be together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe liveried driver stood outside the limousine, ready to help everyone inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope to do something like this for Maryellen and Jon,” Grace said as she stepped into the car with Olivia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have they set the date yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace nodded. “The first Saturday in June.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wonderful,” Olivia said. Weddings seemed to be in the air. Grace’s daughter and Jon Bowman had decided to marry; Olivia knew Grace was both delighted and relieved that Katie’s mother and father would soon be united.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another Saturday you’ll have to give up your stint at the Humane Society,” Olivia teased, knowing how much Grace enjoyed her volunteer work with the agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon and Maryellen’s engagement wasn’t the only news of a wedding that had reached Olivia. The controversial divorce decree she’d made last year, which had caused such a stir at the courthouse, had turned out rather well. She’d heard from Otto Benson, one of the attorneys involved in the case, that the Coxes were planning to remarry. Olivia was pleased, and wished the couple well. Everything at 311 Pelican Court seemed to be in good shape—a refreshing change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the limousine made its way down Lighthouse Road, Olivia looked out the side window at the cove. She loved this beautiful place, this town that was home. She glanced at Grace and smiled. Her friend was adjusting to life as a widow. Maneuvering in unfamiliar territory was never easy; Grace was bound to take a few wrong steps, but Olivia felt confident that all was well at 204 Rosewood Lane, especially now that Grace had found a cause to support. Olivia still hoped Cliff would reappear in Grace’s life, but only time would tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limo pulled into the parking lot at the waterfront park. The driver rushed around and opened the door for Olivia, then offered her his hand, helping her out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn’t have been a more perfect day for a wedding. A day of bright sun and fresh spring breezes. The sparkling blue water of the cove sent shafts of reflected sunlight toward the gazebo where Jack stood waiting. Roses, lilies, irises and a dozen other flowers filled huge white baskets, carefully arranged to create a border around the white-painted gazebo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother was with her friend, Ben Rhodes. Ever since her arrest, Charlotte had been unusually quiet. Olivia was convinced this newfound respect for the law would be short-lived, however. When Charlotte wanted something badly enough, she generally found a way to get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia blamed Ben Rhodes for the fact that she’d had to bail her own mother out of the county jail. She was determined to keep a careful eye on him. Olivia wasn’t sure the elderly gentleman was a good influence on her mother. Nor did she think it was such a good idea for the two of them to be spending so much time together. She intended to learn what she could about Ben Rhodes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stepped forward and took Olivia’s hand. “I don’t know what I ever did that persuaded you to marry me,” he said as he bent close to kiss her cheek, “but whatever it was, I can only say I’m grateful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Jack, that’s so sweet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned and glanced sheepishly at his best man, Bob Beldon. “Bob suggested I say that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia rolled her eyes. She should have known. Jack was no romantic, but he made up for his lack of finesse in a dozen wonderful ways. She was pleased to see Bob and his wife, Peggy. She didn’t know them well, but since Bob was Jack’s best friend, she assumed they’d be seeing more of the couple who owned the local B and B.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’d been some concern about Bob, she remembered, something to do with that dead guy. Jack had been rather vague about it, and for a time he’d seemed uncertain whether his friend would be available for the ceremony. Apparently whatever it was had been resolved, although from the barely restrained tension she felt in the other man, Olivia wondered. Things didn’t seem to be quite as they should at 44 Cranberry Point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guests gathered in a close circle around Olivia and Jack. Pastor Flemming opened his Bible and smiled up at the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dearly beloved,” he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack squeezed Olivia’s hand, and she returned the gesture. Jack Griffin, newsman and recovering alcoholic, was indeed her beloved, and she was his. Like so many before him, Jack had found new life and purpose in Cedar Cove. She smiled up at this man who would soon be her husband. They were the keepers of each other’s secrets…and of each other’s heart. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/311-pelican-court-cedar-cove-3/page-54.html","bookId":1943,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:11 AM"}
