Couples passed, whispering in the evening shadows. A dog howled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour nights, five nights?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid sat by me reading me the manuscript of my story word for word, all I had said, as he remembered this, stopping over and over again, to ask if this was correct, if these were the very words I\u0027d used, if this was the image. And she would answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom her place in the corner, she would say, \"Yes, that is what he saw, that is what he told you. That is what I see in his mind. Those are his words. That is what he felt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it must have been after a week, she stood over me and asked if I thirsted for blood. I said, \"I will never drink it again. I will dry up like something hard made of limestone. They will throw me into a kiln.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night Louis came, with the quiet ease of a chaplain into a jail, immune to the rules yet presenting no threat to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, he sat down beside me and folded his legs, and looked off as though it was not polite to stare at me, the prisoner, wrapped in chains and rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laid his fingers on my shoulder. His hair had a reasonable and fashionable look to it\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;that is, it was clipped and combed and not full of dust. His clothes were clean and new, too, as if he had perhaps dressed for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled to myself at that, his dressing for me. But from time to time he did, and when I saw that the shirt had antique buttons of gold and pearl, I knew that he had, and I accepted that the way a sick man accepts a cool cloth on his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers pressed me just a little harder, and I liked this too. But I didn\u0027t have the slightest interest in saying so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been reading Wynken\u0027s books,\" he said. \"You know, I picked them up. I went back for them. We\u0027d left them in the chapel.\" And now, he did glance at me very respectfully and simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, thank you for that,\" I said. \"I dropped the books in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped them when I reached for the eye, or did she take my hand?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Whatever, I let the sacks fall with the books. I can\u0027t budge these chains. I can\u0027t move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve taken the books home to our place in the Rue Royale. They\u0027re there, like so many jewels strewn out for us to gaze at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Have you looked at the tiny pictures, I mean, really looked?\" I asked. \"I\u0027ve never really looked. I just ... it was all happening so quickly, and I didn\u0027t really open the books. But if you could have seen his ghost in the bar and heard the way he described them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are glorious. They are magnificent. You will love them. You have years of pleasure ahead with them and the light at your side. I\u0027ve only begun to look at them and to read. With a magnifying glass. But you won\u0027t need the glass. Your eyes are stronger than mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can read them perhaps... you and I... together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes... all his twelve books,\" he said. He talked softly of many miraculous little images, of tiny humans, and beasts and flowers, and the lion lying down with the lamb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes. I was grateful. I was content. He knew I didn\u0027t want to talk anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be down there, in our rooms,\" he said, \"waiting for you. They can\u0027t keep you here much longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is longer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed the weather grew warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid might have come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I shut my eyes and my ears and I refused to listen to any sound that was deliberately directed to me. I heard the cicadas singing when the sky was red still from the sun, and other vampires were asleep. I heard the birds swooping down on the limbs or oaks on Napoleon Avenue. I heard the children!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children did come. Singing. And sometimes some one or two speaking in a rapid whisper, as if exchanging confidences beneath a tent made from a sheet. And feet on the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then from beyond the walls, the blaring, amplified noise of the electric night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne evening I opened my eyes and the chains were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was alone and the door was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy clothes were in tatters, but I didn\u0027t care. I stood up, creakily, achingly, and for the first time in a fortnight, perhaps, I put my hand to my eye and felt it secure there, though of course I\u0027d always seen through it. And I\u0027d stopped thinking about it long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked out of the orphanage, through the old courtyard. For one moment I thought I saw a set of iron swings, the kind they made for children on old playgrounds. I saw the A-frames at each end, the crossbar, and the swings themselves, and the children swinging, little girls with blowing hair, and I could hear them laughing. I looked up, dazed, at the stained-glass windows of the chapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children were gone. The courtyard was empty. My palace now. She\u0027d cut all ties. She was long gone to her great, great victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked a long time down St. Charles Avenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked under oaks I knew, on old pavements and stretches of brick, past houses new and old, and on across Jackson Avenue into the curious mix of taverns and neon signs, of boarded-up buildings and ruined houses and fancy shops, the garish waste that stretches to downtown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came to an empty store that had once sold expensive automobiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor fifty years, they\u0027d sold those fancy cars in this place, and now it was a big, hollow room with glass walls. I could see my reflection perfectly in the glass. My preternatural vision was mine again, flawless, with both blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I saw myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want you to see me now. I want you to look at me, as I present myself, and as I swear to this tale, as I swear on every word of it, from my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am the Vampire Lestat. This is what I saw. This is what I heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what I know! This is all I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelieve in me, in my words, in what I have said and what has been written down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am here, still, the hero of my own dreams, and let me please keep my place in yours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am the Vampire Lestat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me pass now from fiction into legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE END\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:43 February 28, 1994\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdieu, mon amour \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-27.html","bookId":2213,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:37 PM"}
