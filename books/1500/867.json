He also became silent.

Helen carried Snow, fixed her clothes, but didn’t deliberately speed up her movements, nor did she fear that Su would see anything extra. In reality, the moment Snow was held in Su’s hands, Helen already ceased all movements that might cause misunderstandings, including her her own perception defense. Even now, she still didn’t restore it.

The expression on her face immediately changed, but her many years of habit made her immediately enter an ice-cold and machine-like state.

However, before it was placed in the breeding tank, Snow reached out its head, saying, “However, now, I don’t seem to be that scared of father anymore.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHelen stared blankly for a moment.

This personified motion had previously left it quite confused.

If she was modified any further, she would break through the critical point she had set up so painstakingly. At that time, Snow’s evolution would become an irreversible process. Snow would become incomparably powerful, but the ultra life form instincts that woke up would also completely change it. Even if a lion was raised within a herd of sheep, it would still be a lion. At a certain point, the lion’s instincts would topple all cognition of it being a sheep. Meanwhile, the instincts of an ultra life form were powerful to the point of being almost impossible to resist.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eOnly Helen could suppress the instinctive reactions of an ultra life form, making Snow its current self.
