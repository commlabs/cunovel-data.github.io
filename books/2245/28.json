Oh, forget it.\" He hung up the phone hard, crossed through the garage\u0027s number in the Yellow Pages with a red pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No luck?\" Sid put another draft beer in front of Conner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I called everyplace. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to see my car again.\" Conner glanced at the TV over the bar, saw the score, and winced. The Marlins were getting shellacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buy a new car with the insurance money,\" suggested Sid. \"The Plymouth was falling apart anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a vintage automobile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSid shook his head. \"Whatever you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" Conner said, \"I need to make that money stretch. I\u0027m not exactly working right now.\" Conner still wasn\u0027t quite sure what had happened, who the buyer was supposed to be or how to find out, so he\u0027d ended up taking the Joe DiMaggio card to Teddy Folger\u0027s insurance company. They\u0027d wanted to know how he ended up in possession of the card. Conner had resorted to the truth. It had been aboard the Electric Jenny when he\u0027d repossessed her. Fortunately, nobody had asked him about the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe insurance company had paid him a recovery fee of ten grand. Some of the money had gone to get Conner back on good terms with his apartment complex. He caught up on his other bills too. He even had a little left over. Still, in his gut, Conner didn\u0027t exactly feel he\u0027d come out ahead. He was more or less back at square one, minus a Plymouth Fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your girlfriend?\" Sid asked. \"I never seen nobody get their skull cracked with a cricket bat before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyranny had called once a few days after the globe-room shoot-out. She was fine and had started seeing Dr. Goldblatt three times a week. She didn\u0027t say anything about her and Conner getting together. And when Conner made hints in that direction, Tyranny squashed them in a hurry. The message was clear. She needed space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner wanted to change the subject. \"Who\u0027s the new girl?\" He pointed at the pretty blonde rinsing glasses at the far end of the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I decided I needed some help around here,\" Sid said. \"It would be nice to take a night off once in a while, see the grandkids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got grandkids? I never knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never asked. What, you think you\u0027re the only one around here with a life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner watched the ball game. The Marlins\u0027 relief pitcher started serving up grapefruits. Conner couldn\u0027t watch anymore, grabbed the remote, and turned it to ESPN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blonde finally made it to his end of the bar. \"Another draft?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. What\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Misty.\" A smile like sunshine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Conner. Sid said you used to work at one of the beach places.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"The tips were good, but too many tourists. Creeps. Some of them think you\u0027re there to serve more than drinks. I like it here. Quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner said, \"Anyone ever mention you look almost exactly like Marilyn Monroe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile vanished. Her eyes narrowed to ferocious slits. \"Did somebody put you up to saying that? Is that some kind of joke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa. Hey, I was just saying-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, watch it, buddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, fine. Whatever.\" He took out a cigar, struck a match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t light that in here,\" Misty snapped. \"Are you trying to kill everybody?\" She stormed away, nose in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner sulked. He took out a pad of paper, started calculating what he might do with his leftover insurance money, but he lost interest and sank into his beer. He didn\u0027t have enough cash. There was never enough. The thought of calling Ed Odeski for repo work made Conner\u0027s heart sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall guy walked into the bar, big hook of a nose, pale. Khakis and a red polo shirt. He grabbed a stool next to Conner. \"You\u0027re Samson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner froze. \"Who\u0027s asking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Devon Haywood. You\u0027re Conner Samson, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a friend of Jasper Dybek\u0027s. Jasper told me you... uh... helped him with a little problem a short while back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner raised an eyebrow. \"Oh, yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I\u0027m going to be straight with you,\" Haywood said. \"My last sculpture sold for six figures. But that was two years ago. The bank\u0027s going to repossess my house. Frankly, I was hoping you could do for me what you did for Jasper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world had gone crazy. \"I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sculptures are insured.\" He pulled out a business card, put it on the bar next to Conner. \"Just say you\u0027ll think about it and call me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner said he would think about it, and Haywood left, looking panicked and desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner\u0027s thoughts drifted again to Tyranny. He couldn\u0027t help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unfolded a letter he\u0027d been carrying around the last few days. He\u0027d found it jammed into the depths of his pants pocket when he\u0027d finally broken down to do a load of laundry. The letter from Marilyn Monroe to Teddy Folger had a dozen new folds and wrinkles from being smashed into his pocket, but the plastic bag had protected it when he\u0027d been tossed into the Gulf of Mexico. The insurance company hadn\u0027t asked about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe read again the part he liked best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople are funny. They all want us and expect us to be a certain way. Sometimes people never know the real us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust maybe, in a letter to a fourteen-year-old kid she barely knew, Norma Jean had shown herself, had won out over her starlet persona and was just a regular girl with fears and loves and worries like everyone else. Had DiMaggio loved Norma Jean or Marilyn?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Conner knew the Tyranny he loved, every inch, the good and the bad. He\u0027d wait her out, win her over. He didn\u0027t know how. He might even fail. But he was sure about one thing. Conner Samson would not go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, Conner considered Devon Haywood\u0027s business card. He reached across the bar, grabbed the phone, hesitated only a moment, and dialed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/suicide-squeeze/page-28.html","bookId":2245,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:32 PM"}
