Brother Huo, Nephew Lin’s ranking has finally moved?” A cyan robed old man with a pair of dragon horns and a long beard slowly spoke, a smile spreading on his face. He was an Elder from the Ancient Dragon Clan, and Huo Violentstone had a nickname for him – Laughing Dragon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen the four God Beast Clans joined up, and when fully united, they surpassed even an ordinary World King Holy Land. But between the four clans was also an extremely fierce competition, each one hoping that their own people would tower over the other three clans. However, for so many years, every time the four clans competed, the one that always held the upper hand was the Ancient Dragon Clan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Huo Violentstone saw Lin Ming join the Divine Realm First Martial Meeting, as well as Xiao Ping and Yan Littlemoon, old man Huo was proud and elated. He felt the time for the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s true rising moment of glory had arrived. He even begun to brag and boast in front of Laughing Dragon with great gusto.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut the result was that there was nothing to brag about, at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Huo Violentstone burst into anger, Laughing Dragon was all smiles. He looked at Lin Ming’s score, his words clearly containing ridicule in them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe had also guessed Lin Ming didn’t move at the start because of some reasons. But the result was this great difference that had opened up between him and everyone else. To say it in other words, if one fell down at the start, it would be far more difficult to catch up. One would need to put in a greater amount of effort and their ranking would also be lower. It would be very difficult to compare with the Ancient Dragon Clan’s new Dragon One. As for this new Dragon One, after the old Dragon One had died, Dragon Two naturally moved into his spot.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow, of the four God Beast Clans, the Ancient Dragon Clan took first place with Dragon One at the top. Dragon One was ranked 72\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003end\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e on the Crimson Light World and Yan Littlemoon was ranked next, at rank 97 of the Crimson Light World.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuo Violentstone immediately put away the divine dream jade slip. He didn’t even bother looking at Laughing Dragon as he furiously said, “Lin Ming’s results have just started, what are you speaking so soon for!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha, there’s no need to be in a hurry. There’s still over half a month left. Nephew Lin is truly patient; what a peaceful heart. But with Nephew Lin’s talent, no matter how far off he is, he can still easily pass the first round of eliminations. However, compared with Dragon One, he is very far off!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLaughing Dragon smirked as he laughed out loud. Before this, Huo Violentstone had boasted that Lin Ming would sweep away Dragon One as if he was an adult playing with little children, so Laughing Dragon certainly wanted to retaliate. He slowly took out a divine dream jade slip from his spatial ring, ignoring the gloomy and simmering stare of Huo Violentstone, and began to check up on Lin Ming’s results.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e……….\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDivine Dream World –\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhoosh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA bright ray of light flashed through the jungle. Another nightmare beast had its head chopped off by Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I’ve killed dozens of these beasts, yet the merit points are so little.

It’s not a suitable place for me. How come those merit point party sacks still haven’t arrived? I’ve been waiting for them in this low level jungle for so long.” Lin Ming frowned. At this time, he cast out his divine sense again and felt the fluctuation of energy he was waiting for. His lips curved up into a smile; they had finally arrived.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe had made so many enemies within Immemorial Imperial City; just which ones had come for him?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Sir Zhong, he is right over there.

He sighed and said, “Who gave you two the courage to act so daringly?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe two small martial artists were shocked. How come this Lin Ming brat wasn’t surprised and scared silly? Why was he so calm?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t bother with them. He looked at Zhong Wenshu and said, “So it’s you. I thought I would only get some tiny minions; I didn’t expect I would be able to reel in such a big fish.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhong Wenshu was a bit startled. He traced his chin and thoughtfully looked at Lin Ming, “Are you saying you’ve already discovered that you were being tracked, and deliberately waited for me here?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t answer. He merely drew out the Phoenix Blood Spear; his intent was clear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe two tiny fellows’ faces turned red. They quickly said, “Sir Zhong, this boy clearly know he’s reached the end of the road! He’s just trying to make up some random arguments. If he already knew he was being tracked, why wouldn’t he run?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yeah! Against us brothers, only middle or late Divine Transformation powerhouses can see through our tracking; otherwise, it’s impossible to discover us!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhong Wenshu was disinclined to pay attention to these two nothings. He looked at Lin Ming with zest in his eyes. “It seems you really did discover them and decided to wait for me here. You have quite the confidence in yourself, enough that it surpasses my imagination. You aren’t thinking that I came here like a loot bag to deliver merit points to you, right?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s lips curved up into a sly smile. He chuckled. “I thought you were stupid, but it seems you have some sense of self-awareness. Your last few words are correct. But you shouldn’t say ‘thinking that’, because the reason you are here is to give me your merit points. I wonder just how many merit points you’ll be able to give me?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Humph!” Zhong Wenshu’s eyes turned icy cold.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhong Wenshu’s minions were immediately angered. “You really have no idea of danger or death, you damned brat! To think you can still laugh in this sort of situation, you must have some kind of mental illness! Young Master, don’t bother with his nonsense, he is nothing but an idiot!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Brothers, let’s chop off his hands and feet and see if he can still act so arrogant!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese minions were all Ninefall Divine Sea martial artists. If they were placed in a peak Holy Land, even though they couldn’t be a top disciple, they could still be a core disciple. Moreover, there were eight of them and they were all at the middle and late Divine Sea.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEight middle and late Divine Sea martial artists to deal with Lin Ming, an early Divine Sea martial artist. Even if they could see that Lin Ming’s foundation was solid and his aura was imposing, this was still a bit unreasonable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Move into the formation!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThey didn’t underestimate their opponent. They immediately set up an array on the battlefield as they were fighting against Lin Ming together!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe eight martial artists each stood on one of the eight corners of an eight trigrams, forming a yin yang array. For a time, energy erupted forth. The power of the eight people gathered together as they ruthlessly attacked Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWoosh woosh woosh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe lights of eight weapons gathered together, forming a torrent of energy that impacted toward Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is fine too. I’ll take your merit points first. You lot should have quite a bit!” Lin Ming temperately smiled. These people, although they were far from being able to compare with their lord, should still have the ability to pass the first round of eliminations. This meant they would have a reasonable amount of merit points on them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a thought touching the Heretical God Seedling, the power of thunder and fire swelled forth. A purple and red twin-colored light began to twine over the Phoenix Blood Spear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePenetrating Rainbow!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThunder and fire origin energy roiled forth, emitting a brilliant divine light. A terrifying shockwave rumbled forth. Lin Ming had originally created this as a finishing move, but now it was nothing more than a normal attack.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a terrifying explosion, a purple red spear light thrust forwards into the wave of energy formed by the eight weapons. That wave of energy was instantly torn apart as the purple red spear light continued shooting into the array formation formed by Zhong Wenshu’s minions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe eight people all paled. They stimulated the energy in their bodies to the limit, wanting to keep off Lin Ming’s spear light. However, it was useless. The battlefield was torn apart by the spear light. As Zong Wenshu saw his eight minions about to be torn to pieces, a bright light shined in his eyes. He stepped forwards, wanting to use his sword to block the spear light to save his minions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this moment, Lin Ming smiled.

Even Zhong Wenshu was unable to instantly form a barrier that was able to block the explosive shockwaves. As he slashed out with his sword light, it only cut off less than half of the energy wave. He was able to protect his own body, but his minions were in a much more miserable state. In a situation where they had lost the protection of their array formation, waves of energy smashed into their bodies. Their protective true essence shattered and their flesh and blood blew up as howls of agony filled the skies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHu – hu – hu –\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFive minions were ripped to shreds.

Moreover, this was in a situation where Zhong Wenshu had helped to resist. Otherwise, the three alive would also have died.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the two trackers responsible for following Lin Ming saw all of this occur in front of them, their eyes filled with shock and panic.
