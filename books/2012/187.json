Perception, knowledge, illusion, delusion. Faith, despair, curiosity, fear. Its weapon is the false belief in chance, in random fate.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrecious was shaking her head. ‘Listen. Chance is real. You can’t say it isn’t. And mischance, too. You said your army got caught in a fight nobody was looking for – what was that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I dread to think,’ Aranict replied. ‘But I assure you it was not blind chance. In any case, your vocabulary has improved dramatically. Your comprehension is sound—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So you can stop shoving stuff in, right?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAranict nodded. ‘Drink. Rest now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have too many questions for that, Atri-Ceda. Why is the Hold empty?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because it is home to all which cannot be possessed, cannot be owned. And so too is the throne within the Hold empty, left eternally vacant. Because the very nature of rule is itself an illusion, a conceit and the product of a grand conspiracy. To have a ruler one must choose to be ruled over, and that forces notions of inequity to the fore, until they become, well, formalized. Made central to education, made essential as a binding force in society, until everything exists to prop up those in power. The Empty Throne reminds us of all that. Well, some of us, anyway.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrecious Thimble frowned. ‘What did you mean when you said the Hold was awake once more?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Wastelands are so called because they are damaged—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know that – I can’t do a damned thing here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nor could I, until recently.’ The Atri-Ceda plucked out a stick of rolled rustleaf and quickly lit it. Smoke thickened the air in the tent. ‘Imagine a house burning down,’ she said, ‘leaving nothing but heaps of ash. That’s what happened to magic in the Wastelands. Will it ever come back? Ever heal? Maybe that’s what we’re seeing here, but the power doesn’t just show up. It grows, and I think now it has to start in a certain way. Beginning with … wandering. And then come the Holds, like plants taking root.’ Aranict gestured. ‘Much wandering in these Wastelands of late, yes? Powerful forces, so much violence, so much will .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And from Holds to warrens,’ muttered Precious, nodding to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, the Malazans speak of this, too. These warrens . If they are destined to appear here, they have yet to do so, Precious Thimble. And is there not concern that they are ill?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Malazans,’ Precious hissed. ‘You’d think they invented warrens, the way they go on. Things got sickly for a time, sure, but then that went away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Holds have always been the source of magical power on this continent,’ Aranict said, shrugging. ‘In many ways, we Letherii are very conservative, but I am beginning to think there are other reasons for why there has been no change here. The K’Chain Che’Malle remain. And the Forkrul Assail dominate the lands to the east. Even the creatures known as the T’lan Imass are among us now, and without question the Hold of Ice is in the ascendant, meaning the Jaghut have returned.’ She shook her head. ‘The Malazans speak of war among the gods. I fear that what is coming will prove more terrible than any of us can imagine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrecious licked her lips, glanced away. The tent seemed to have closed round her, like a death-shroud being drawn tight. She shivered. ‘We just want to go home.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I do not know how I can help you,’ Aranict said. ‘The Holds are not realms one willingly travels through. Even drawing upon their power invites chaos and madness. They are places of treachery, of deadly traps and pits leading down into unknown realms. Worse, the more powerful rituals demand blood.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrecious gathered herself, met the Atri-Ceda’s gaze. ‘In the east,’ she said. ‘Something’s there – I can feel it. A thing of vast power.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes,’ Aranict said, nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is where you are going, isn’t it? This army and the war to come. You are going to fight for that power, to take it for yourself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not quite, Precious Thimble. That power – we mean to set it free.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And if you do? What happens then?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-187.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
