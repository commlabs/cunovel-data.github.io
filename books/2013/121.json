She closed her eyes-then, at a ragged sigh from Varat Taun, opened them again, to see her second in command’s limbs slowly unfold, the fierce clutch of muscles on his neck visibly ease as the man, blinking, slowly lifted his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd saw her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Varat Taun.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint smile, worn with sorrow-but a natural sorrow. Atri-Preda. We made it back, then…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned, then nodded. ‘You did. And since that time, Lieutenant, the fleet has come home.’ She gestured at the room. ‘You are in the Domicile’s Annexe, in Letheras.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Letheras? What?’ He struggled to rise, pausing a moment to look wonderingly at the Cabalhii monk; then, using the wall behind him, he straightened and met Twilight’s eyes. ‘But that is impossible. We’d two entire oceans to cross, at the very least-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your escape proved a terrible ordeal, Lieutenant,’ Yan Tovis said. ‘You have lain in a coma for many, many months. I expect you are feeling weak-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grimace. ‘Exhausted, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you last recall, Lieutenant?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDread filled his wan features and his gaze fell away from hers. ‘Slaughter, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. The barbarian known as Taralack Veed survived, as did the Jhag, Icarium-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVarat Taun’s head snapped up. ‘Icarium! Yes-Atri-Preda, he-he is an abomination!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A moment!’ cried the Senior Assessor, eyes now piercing as he stared at the lieutenant. ‘Icarium, the Jhag Warrior? Icarium, Lifestealer?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly frightened, Yan Tovis said, ‘Yes, Cabalhii. He is here. Like you, he will challenge the Emperor-’ She stopped then, in shock, as the monk, eyes bulging, flung both hands to his face, streaking across the thick paint, and, teeth appearing to clench down hard on his lower lip, bit. Until blood spurted. The monk reeled back until he struck the wall beside the doorway-then, all at once, he whirled about and fled the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Errant take us,’ Varat Taun hissed, ‘what was all that about?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForbidden laughter? She shook her head. ‘I don’t know, Lieutenant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who… what…?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA healer,’ she replied in a shaky voice, forcing herself to draw a steadying breath. ‘The one who awakened you, Varat. A guest of the Emperor’s-from Uruth’s fleet.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVarat Taun licked chapped, broken lips. ‘Sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Icarium… Errant save us, he must not be awakened. Taralack knows, he was there, he saw. The Jhag… have him sent away, sir-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe approached him, boots hard on the floor. ‘The Gral’s claims are not exaggerated, then? He will bring destruction?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA whisper: ‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could not help herself then, and reached out, gloved hands grasping the front of Varat’s ragged shirt, dragging him close. ‘Tell me, damn you! Can he kill him? Can Icarium kill him?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorror swirled in the soldier’s eyes as he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErrant’s blessing, maybe this time… ‘Varat Taun. Listen to me. I am leading my company out in two days. Back to the north. You will ride with me, as far up the coast as necessary then you ride east-to Bluerose. I am assigning you to the Factor’s staff there, understood? Two days.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe released him, suddenly embarrassed at her own outburst. Yet her legs were weak as reeds beneath her still. She wiped sweat from her eyes. ‘Welcome back, Lieutenant,’ she said in a rough voice, not meeting his gaze. ‘Are you strong enough to accompany me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir. Yes, I shall try.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerging from the room, they came face to face with the Gral barbarian. Breath hissed from Varat Taun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed had halted in the corridor and was staring at the lieutenant. ‘You are… recovered. I did not think-’ He shook his head, then said, ‘I am pleased, soldier-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You warned us again and again,’ Varat Taun said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gral grimaced and seemed ready to spit, then decided otherwise. Gravely, he said, ‘I did. And yes, I was foolish enough to be an eager witness…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And next time?’ The question from Varat Taun was a snarl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You do not need to ask me that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lieutenant stared hard at the savage, then he seemed to sag, and Yan Tovis was astonished to see Taralack Veed move forward to take Varat’s weight. Ah, it is what they have shared. It is that. That.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gral glared over at her. ‘He is half dead with exhaustion!’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-121.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
