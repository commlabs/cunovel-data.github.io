Win had had to admit that Leo had a point. Of course, Merripen was far more intelligent, and educated, than her brother gave him credit for. As far as she remembered, Merripen had challenged Leo in many a philosophical discussion and had memorized more Greek and Latin than anyone else in the family except her father. But Merripen had only learned those things to fit in with the Hathaways, not because he had any real interest in obtaining an education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerripen was a man of nature; he craved the feel of earth and sky. He would never be more than half-tame. And he and Win were as different as fish from fowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian took her hand in his long, elegant one. His fingers were smooth and well tended, tapered at the tips. \"Winnifred,\" he said gently, \"now that we\u0027re away from the clinic, life won\u0027t be quite so well regulated. You must safeguard your health. Make certain you rest tonight, no matter how tempting it is to stay up all hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Doctor,\" Win said, smiling up at him. She felt a surge of affection for him, remembering the first time she had managed to climb the exercise ladder in the clinic. Julian had been behind her every step, his encouragements soft in her ear, his chest firm against her back. A little higher, Winnifred. I won\u0027t let you fall. He hadn\u0027t done any of the work for her. Only kept her safe as she climbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a bit nervous,\" Win admitted as Leo escorted her to the Hathaways\u0027 suite on the hotel\u0027s second floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. Perhaps because we\u0027ve all changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The essential things haven\u0027t changed.\" Leo gripped her elbow firmly. \"You\u0027re still the delightful girl you were. And I\u0027m still a scoundrel with a taste for spirits and lightskirts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leo,\" she said, darting a quick frown at him. \"You\u0027re not planning to go back to your old ways, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will avoid temptation,\" he replied, \"unless it happens to fall directly in my path.\" He stopped her at the middle landing. \"Do you want to pause for a moment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all.\" Win continued enthusiastically upward. \"I love stair climbing. I love doing anything I couldn\u0027t do before. And from now on I\u0027m going to live by the motto \u0027Life is to be lived to the fullest.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo grinned. \"You should know that I\u0027ve said that on many occasions in the past, and it always got me in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin glanced at her surroundings with pleasure. After living in the austere surroundings of Harrow \u0027s clinic for so long, she would enjoy a taste of luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElegant, modern, and supremely comfortable, the Rutledge was owned by the mysterious Harry Rutledge, about whom there were so many rumors that no one could even say definitively whether he was British or American. All that was known for certain was that he had lived for a time in America and had come to England to create a hotel that combined the opulence of Europe with the best of American innovations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rutledge was the first hotel to design every single bedroom en suite with its own private bathroom. And there were delights such as food service lifts, built-in cupboards in the bedrooms, private meeting rooms with atrium glass ceilings, and gardens designed as outdoor rooms. The hotel also featured a dining room that was said to be the most beautiful in England, with so many chandeliers that the ceiling had required extra reinforcements during construction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the door of the Hathaways\u0027 suite, and Leo knocked gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a few movements within. The door opened to reveal a young fair-haired maid. The maid\u0027s gaze swept over the both of them. \"May I help you, sir?\" she asked Leo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve come to see Mr. and Mrs. Rohan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beg pardon, sir, but they have just retired for the evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hour was quite late, Win thought, deflated. \"We should go our rooms and let them rest,\" she told Leo. \"We\u0027ll come back in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo stared at the housemaid with a slight smile, and asked in a soft, low voice, \"What is your name, child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brown eyes widened, and a blush crept up her cheeks. \"Abigail, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abigail,\" he repeated. \"Tell Mrs. Rohan that her sister is here and wishes to see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" The maid giggled and left them at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin gave her brother a wry glance as he helped to remove her cloak. \"Your way with women never fails to astonish me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most women have a tragic attraction to rakes,\" he said regretfully. \"I really shouldn\u0027t use it against them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone came into the receiving room. He saw Amelia\u0027s familiar form, clad in a blue dressing robe, accompanied by Cam Rohan, who was handsomely disheveled in an open-necked shirt and trousers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer blue eyes as round as saucers, Amelia stopped at the sight of her brother and sister. A white hand fluttered to Amelia\u0027s throat. \"Is it really you?\" she asked unsteadily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin tried to smile, but it was impossible when her lips were trembling with emotion. She tried to imagine how she must appear to Amelia, who had seen her last as a frail invalid. \"I\u0027m home,\" she said, a slight break in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Win! I dreamed-I so hoped-\" Amelia stopped and rushed forward, and their arms went around each other, fast and tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin closed her eyes and sighed, feeling that at last she had come home. My sister. She basked in the soft comfort of Amelia\u0027s arms. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-21.html","bookId":1786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM"}
