After a few moments he got up and walked into the dark living room and opened the peephole door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, on the lawn, the dark figures stood like silent soldiers on duty. As he watched, some of them started moving away, and he heard them muttering discontentedly among themselves. Another night was ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back to the bedroom, switched on the light, and dressed. As he was pulling on his shirt, he heard Ben Cortman cry out, \"Come out, Neville!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was all. After that, they all went away weaker, he knew, than when they had come. Unless they had attacked one of their own. They did that often. There was no union among them. Their need was their only motivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dressing, Neville sat down on his bed with a grunt and penciled his list for the day:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLathe at Sears\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck generator\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoweling (?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsual\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreakfast was hasty: a glass of orange juice, a slice of toast, and two cups of coffee. He finished it quickly, wishing he had the patience to eat slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter breakfast he threw the paper plate and cup into the trash box and brushed his teeth. At least I have one good habit, he consoled himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing he did when he went outside was look at the sky. It was clear, virtually cloudless. He could go, out today. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he crossed the porch, his shoe kicked some pieces of the mirror. Well, the damn thing broke just as I thought it would, he thought. He\u0027d clean it up later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the bodies was sprawled on the sidewalk; the other one was half concealed in the shrubbery. They were both women. They were almost always women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unlocked the garage door and backed his Willys station wagon into the early-morning crispness. Then he got out and pulled down the back gate. He put on heavy gloves and walked over to the woman on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was certainly nothing attractive about them in the daylight, he thought, as he dragged them across the lawn and threw them up on the canvas tarpaulin. There wasn\u0027t a drop left in them; both women were the color of fish out of water. He raised the gate and fastened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went around the lawn then, picking up stones and bricks and putting them into a cloth sack. He put the sack in the station wagon and then took off his gloves. He went inside the house, washed his hands, and made lunch: two sandwiches, a few cookies, and a thermos of hot coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen that was done, he went into the bedroom and got his bag of stakes. He slung this across his back and buckled on the holster that held his mallet. Then he went out of the house, locking the front door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t bother searching for Ben Cortman that morning; there were too many other things to do. For a second, he thought about the soundproofing job he\u0027d resolved to do on the house. Well, the hell with it, he thought. I\u0027ll do it tomorrow or some cloudy day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got into the station wagon and checked his list. \"Lathe at Sears\"; that was first. After he dumped the bodies, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started the car and backed quickly into the street and headed for Compton Boulevard. There he turned right and headed east. On both sides of him the houses stood silent, and against the curbs cars were parked, empty and dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Neville\u0027s eyes shifted down for a moment to the fuel gauge. There was still a half tank, but he might as well stop on Western Avenue and fill it. There was no point in using any of the gasoline stored in the garage until be had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled into the silent station and braked. He got a barrel of gasoline and siphoned it into his tank until the pale amber fluid came gushing out of the tank opening and ran down onto the cement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked the oil, water, battery water, and tires. Everything was in good condition. It usually was, because he took special care of the car. If it ever broke down so that he couldn\u0027t get back to the house by sunset...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, there was no point in even worrying about that. If it ever happened, that was the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he continued up Compton Boulevard past the tall oil derricks, through Compton, through all the silent streets. There was no one to be seen anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Robert Neville knew where they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire was always burning. As the car drew closer, he pulled on his gloves and gas mask and watched through the eyepieces the sooty pall of smoke hovering above the earth. The entire field had been excavated into one gigantic pit, that was in June 1975.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeville parked the car and jumped out, anxious to get the job over with quickly. Throwing the catch and jerking. down the rear gate, he pulled out one of the bodies and dragged it to the edge of the pit. There he stood it on its feet and shoved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe body bumped and rolled down the steep incline until it settled on the great pile of smoldering ashes at the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Neville drew in harsh breaths as he hurried back to the station wagon. He always felt as though he were strangling when he was here, even though he had the gas mask on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he dragged the second body to the brink of the pit and pushed it over. Then, after tossing the sack, of rocks down, he hurried back to the car and sped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he\u0027d driven a half mile, he skinned off the mask and gloves and tossed them into the back. His mouth opened and he drew in deep lungfuls of fresh air. He took the flask from the glove compartment and took a long drink of burning whisky. Then he lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. Sometimes he had to go to the burning pit every day for weeks at a time, and it always made him sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere down there was Kathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way to Inglewood he stopped at a market to get some bottled water. As he entered the silent store, the smell of rotted food filled his nostrils. Quickly he pushed a metal wagon up and down the silent, dust-thick aisles, the heavy smell of decay setting his teeth on edge, making him breathe through his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found the water bottles in back, and also found a door opening on a flight of stairs. After putting all the bottles into the wagon, he went up the stairs. The owner of the market might be up there; he might as well get started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two of them. In the living room, lying on a couch, was a woman about thirty years old, wearing a red housecoat. Her chest rose and fell slowly as she lay there, eyes closed, her hands clasped over her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Neville\u0027s hands fumbled on the stake and mallet. It was always hard, when they were alive; especially with women. He could feel that senseless demand returning again, tightening his muscles. He forced it down. It was insane, there was no rational argument for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made no sound except for a sudden, hoarse intake of breath. As he walked into the bedroom, he could hear a sound like the sound of water running. Well, what else can I do? he asked himself, for he still had to convince himself he was doing the right thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood in the bedroom doorway, staring at the small bed by the window, his throat moving, breath shuddering in his chest. Then, driven on, he walked to the side of the bed and looked down at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do they all look like Kathy to me? he thought, drawing out the second stake with shaking hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving slowly to Sears, he tried to forget by wondering why it was that only wooden stakes should work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned as he drove along the empty boulevard, the only sound the muted growling of the motor in his car. It seemed fantastic that it had taken him five months to start wondering about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich brought another question to mind. How was it that he always managed to hit the heart? It had to be the heart; Dr. Busch had said so. Yet he, Neville, had no anatomical knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brow furrowed. It irritated him that he should have gone through this hideous process so long without stopping once to question it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook, his head. No, I should think it over carefully, he thought, I should collect all the questions before I try to answer them. Things should be done the right way, the scientific way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, yeah, yeah, he thought, shades of old Fritz. That had been his father\u0027s name. Neville had loathed his father and fought the acquisition of his father\u0027s logic and mechanical facility every inch of the way. His father had died denying the vampire violently to the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Sears he got the lathe, loaded it into the station wagon, then searched the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were five of them in the basement, hiding in various shadowed places. One of them Neville found inside a display freezer. When he saw the man lying there in this enamel coffin, he had to laugh; it seemed such a funny place to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, he thought of what a humorless world it was when he could find amusement in such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout two o\u0027clock he parked and ate his lunch. Everything seemed to taste of garlic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that set him wondering about the effect garlic had on them. It must have been the smell that chased them off, but why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were strange, the facts about them: their staying inside by day, their avoidance of garlic, their death by stake, their reputed fear of crosses, their supposed dread of mirrors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake that last, now. According to legend, they were invisible in mirrors, but he knew that was untrue. As untrue as the belief that they transformed themselves into bats. That was a superstition that logic, plus observation had easily disposed of. It was equally foolish to believe that they could transform themselves into wolves. Without a doubt there were vampire dogs; he had seen and heard them outside his house at night. But they were only dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Neville compressed his lips suddenly. Forget it, he told himself; you\u0027re not ready, yet. The time would come when he\u0027d take a crack at it, detail for detail, but the time wasn\u0027t now. There were enough things to worry about now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter lunch, he went from house to house and used up all his stakes. He had forty-seven stakes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-am-legend/page-2.html","bookId":2455,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:13 PM"}
