Yes,\" Cecille rushed on, \"I\u0027ll tell everyone you\u0027ve slept with several men. Your reputation will be in tatters when I\u0027m done with you. Give Lyon up, Christina. He\u0027d tire of you soon anyway. Your looks are nothing in comparison to mine. Lyon will always come back to me. My beauty captivates him. You will immediately let him know you aren\u0027t interested in him. Then ignore him completely. Otherwise—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say what you will,\" Christina said. \"I don\u0027t care what your people think of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecille was infuriated by the amusement in Christina\u0027s voice. \"You are a stupid woman,\" she shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t get so bothered, Lady Cecille. It\u0027s upsetting your complexion. Why, your face is full of splotches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You… you…\" Cecille paused to take a deep, calming breath. \"You\u0027re lying. You have to care what others think. And your aunt will certainly care, I can promise you that She can\u0027t be as ignorant as you are. Ah, I see I\u0027ve finally gotten your attention. Yes, the Countess will be ruined by the scandal I\u0027m going to weave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina straightened in her chair. She frowned up at Cecille. \"Are you saying your made-up stories will upset my aunt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, you really are a simple one, aren\u0027t you? Of course she\u0027ll be upset. When I\u0027m finished, she won\u0027t be able to show her face in public. Just you wait and see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecille could smell victory. She turned her back on Christina to circle the chair as she began to detail the vile lies she would spread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon had heard enough. He turned to pull the door wide open, determined to walk into the library and end Cecille\u0027s terror tactics at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to protect his angel from the serpent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must have moved with incredible speed. Lyon had only taken his gaze off Christina for a second or two, but when he glanced back, the scene he witnessed so astonished him that he couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had trouble believing what he was seeing. Christina had Cecille pinned up against the wall. His former mistress wasn\u0027t making a sound of protest over the violation. She couldn\u0027t. Christina\u0027s left hand was anchored around the woman\u0027s neck, holding her in place. From the way Cecille\u0027s eyes were beginning to bulge, Lyon thought Christina just might be strangling her to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecille outweighed Christina by a good twenty pounds. She was much taller, too, yet Christina acted as though she was holding up a trinket for closer observation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little angel Lyon wanted to protect used only one hand to secure Cecille. She held a dagger in her other hand. The tip of the blade rested against Cecille\u0027s cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe victim had just turned victor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina slowly increased her hold on Cecille\u0027s neck, then let her see the tip of her knife. \"Do you know what my people do to vain, deceitful women?\" she asked in a soft whisper. \"They carve marks all over their faces, Cecille.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecille started whimpering. Christina pricked her skin with the tip of the knife. A drop of blood appeared on her cheek. Christina nodded with satisfaction. She had Lady Cecille\u0027s full attention now. The woman looked terrified. \"If you tell one lie, I\u0027ll hear about it. Then I\u0027m going to hunt you down, Cecille. There isn\u0027t a rock large enough for you to crawl under, nor enough men in England to see to your protection. I\u0027ll come to you during the night, when you\u0027re sleeping. And when you open your eyes, you\u0027ll see this blade again. Oh, yes, I\u0027ll get to you, I promise. And when I do,\" Christina added, pausing to dramatically drag the flat of her blade across the woman\u0027s face, \"I\u0027m going to cut your skin into ribbons. Do you understand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina let up on her hold only long enough for Cecille to gulp air and nod. Then she squeezed her up against the wall again. \"The Countess is my family. No one upsets her. And no one is going to believe you if you think to tell them I just threatened you. Now get out of here and go home. Though it is unkind of me to say so, you really do look a fright.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith those words of dismissal, Christina moved away from the disgusting woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Cecille didn\u0027t possess an ounce of dignity. She was weeping all over her gown. She had obviously believed every word of Christina\u0027s threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord, she was a silly woman. Christina had difficulty maintaining her stern expression. She wanted to laugh. She couldn\u0027t, of course, and she kept her gaze locked on the terrified woman a long moment before she took pity on her. Lady Cecille couldn\u0027t seem to move. \"You may leave now,\" Christina announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecille nodded. She slowly backed away from Christina until she reached the exit. Her hands shook when she lifted her skirt all the way up to her knobby knees, then she flung the door wide and ran with enough speed to suggest she thought demons were chasing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina let out a long, weary sigh. She replaced the dagger in the sheath above her ankle, straightened the folds of her gown, then daintily patted her hair into place. \"Such a silly woman,\" she whispered to herself before walking out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon had to sit down. He waited until Christina was out of sight before he went over to Hunt\u0027s desk and leaned against it. He tried to pour himself a drink of his host\u0027s whiskey from the cart to the side of the desk, but he quickly discarded that idea. God help him, he was laughing too hard to get the deed done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for his conclusion that Christina was just like every other woman. She certainly wasn\u0027t raised in France, either. Lyon shook his head. She gave the appearance of being helpless… or had he drawn that conclusion on his own, he wondered. It was an easy mistake to make, he realized. Christina was so feminine, so dainty, so damned innocent-looking… and she wore a knife strapped to her leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was identical to the knife he\u0027d held in his hands the night of Baker\u0027s party, the knife that had wounded Rhone. What a cunning little liar she was. Lyon remembered how he\u0027d turned to see who\u0027d thrown the weapon. Christina had looked so frightened. Hell, the woman had turned around to look behind her, too. She\u0027d gone right along with his thought that someone lurked behind them in the shadows. Then, when he was locked in conversation with the gentlemen, she\u0027d quietly snatched her weapon back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon\u0027s instincts were wide awake now. His temper began to simmer, too. Hadn\u0027t she told him the night of the robbery she was so frightened she thought she might swoon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder she\u0027d gone to Rhone to take care of his injury. Guilt, Lyon decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t laughing now. Lyon thought he just might throttle the woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has trouble telling a lie, does she?\" he muttered to himself. Oh, yes, she\u0027d looked him right in the eye when she told him that story. It was very difficult for her… yes, she\u0027d said that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to throttle her. But first he was going to have a long talk with her… his little warrior had a large amount of explaining to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon slammed his empty glass down on the tray and went in search of Christina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you enjoying yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina visibly jumped. She whirled around to confront Lyon. \"Where did you just come from?\" she asked, sounding highly suspicious. She glanced around him to look at the library door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon knew exactly what she was thinking. She looked worried. He forced himself to look calm. \"In the library.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I just came from the library, Lyon. You couldn\u0027t have been in there,\" she announced, shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost said that he wasn\u0027t the one who lied, then caught himself. \"Oh, but I was in the library, my sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis announcement gave her a start. \"Was there anyone else in there?\" she asked, trying to sound only mildly curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon knew she was testing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean to ask, sir, that is, did you happen to notice if anyone else was in the library?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his sweet time nodding. Christina decided he looked just like a mischievous devil. He was dressed like one, too. Lyon\u0027s formal attire was all of black, save for the white cravat, of course. The clothing fit him well. The man was too handsome for her peace of mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was certain Lyon hadn\u0027t seen or heard anything. He was looking down at her with such a tender expression in his eyes. Christina felt safe enough. Lyon wasn\u0027t acting the least appalled. But why had he lied to her? Christina decided he must have seen her go inside the study with Lady Cecille. The poor man was probably worried that his paramour had told Christina something he didn\u0027t want repeated. Yes, she told herself, he was just prodding for information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a plausible explanation. Still, one did need to be absolutely certain. Christina lowered her gaze to stare at his waistcoat. She forced a casual voice and asked, \"You didn\u0027t perchance overlisten to my conversation with Lady Cecille, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The word is eavesdropping, Christina, not overlistening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was strained. She thought he might be trying not to laugh at her. Christina didn\u0027t know if it was her question or her mispronunciation that had caused the change. She was too irritated with him for lying to her to take great exception, however. \"Thank you, Lyon, for instructing me. Eavesdropping, yes, I do recall that word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon wouldn\u0027t have been surprised if she\u0027d started wringing her hands. She was upset, all right, for she\u0027d just spoken to him in French. He doubted she was even aware she\u0027d slipped into the foreign language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided to answer her in kind. \"I am always happy to instruct you, love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t notice. \"But you didn\u0027t eavesdrop, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Christina, what an unkind question to put to me. Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried not to let her relief show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you know I\u0027d never lie to you, my sweet. You\u0027ve always been so open, so honest with me, haven\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I have,\" Christina returned, giving him a quick smile. \"It is the only way to be with each other, Lyon. Surely you realize that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon clasped his hands behind his back so he wouldn\u0027t be able to give in to his urge to grab her by her throat. She seemed very relaxed with him now, very sure of herself. \"Did you learn the value of honesty from the Summertons?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grip on his control intensified. \"The Summertons,\" Lyon repeated, trying to control his anger. \"Remember, love, the people who raised you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t quite look him in the eye when she answered him. He was such a good, trusting man. It was becoming a little bit of a strain to lie to him. \"Yes, the Summertons did teach me to be honest in all endeavors,\" she announced. \"I simply can\u0027t help myself. I\u0027m not any good at fabrications.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to strangle her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I hear you say you were in the study with Lady Cecille?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer guess had been right all along. Lyon was worried about the conversation. He had seen her go inside the library with Lady Cecille. Christina decided to put his fears to rest. \"I was,\" she said. \"Lady Cecille seems to be a dear woman, Lyon. She had some rather pleasing remarks to make about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he wasn\u0027t going to strangle her. He thought he\u0027d beat her first. \"I\u0027m pleased to hear it,\" Lyon said. His voice was as smooth as a soft wind. The effort made his throat ache. \"What exactly did she say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, this and that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What specific this and that?\" Lyon insisted. His hands had moved to rest on Christina\u0027s shoulders, and it was all he could do not to shake the sincerity right out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she did mention that we made a lovely couple,\" Christina said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was back to staring at his waistcoat again. While she appreciated the fact that the English tended to be somewhat naive, she was beginning to feel ashamed of herself for lying so blatantly to Lyon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she mention destiny, perchance?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t noticed the edge in his voice. \"No, I don\u0027t recall Lady Cecille mentioning destiny. That does remind me, though, of my question. Have you given my proposal consideration?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lyon, why are you speaking French to me? We\u0027re in England, and you really should speak the language of your own people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seemed appropriate,\" Lyon muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Christina said. She tried to shrug his hands away from her shoulders. They were still alone in the hallway, but there was always the chance someone could come along and see them. \"Are you going to mate with… I mean, are you going to marry me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m going to mate with you. As for marriage, I fear I will have to decline your proposal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina wasn\u0027t given time to react to Lyon\u0027s announcement. Sir Reynolds called out, interrupting them. Lyon let go of her shoulders, then pulled her around and up against his side. He trapped her with one hand wrapped around her waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lyon, I\u0027ve been looking all over this house for you. Do you approve of my taking your sister over to Kimble\u0027s do? We\u0027d stay here until dinner hour is over, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly,\" Lyon said. \"And I appreciate your taking Diana under your wing, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to do it,\" Reynolds said. \"Good evening, Princess Christina. I trust you are well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thank you,\" Christina answered. She tried to curtsy, but Lyon wouldn\u0027t let up on his hold. She settled on a smile instead. It was a puny half effort at best, for Lyon\u0027s answer had just settled in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough she told herself it didn\u0027t matter, that she\u0027d surely find someone else to marry, she knew she was lying to herself. It did matter. Lord, she felt close to weeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear,\" Sir Reynolds said, addressing Christina, \"I\u0027ve agreed to see you home. Your aunt pleaded fatigue and has taken your carriage. She explained she was leaving for the countryside tomorrow. I was given to understand you won\u0027t be going with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that is correct,\" Christina answered. \"My aunt is going to visit a friend who has taken ill. She prefers that I stay in London. I will have to wait for another opportunity to see your lovely countryside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I forget you\u0027ve only been here a very short while,\" Sir Reynolds said. \"But you\u0027re surely not on your own for an entire week, are you? Do you wish me to lend my arm Saturday eve? You do intend to go to Creston\u0027s ball, of course. Or do you already have an escort?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall not be going,\" Christina interjected, her voice firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you will,\" Lyon said. He squeezed her waist before adding, \"You promised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve changed my mind. Sir Reynolds, I\u0027m also fatigued. I\u0027d be pleased if you\u0027d—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take you home.\" Lyon\u0027s voice was hard with anger. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-s-lady-crown-s-spies-1/page-18.html","bookId":1792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:34 PM"}
