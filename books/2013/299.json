He does not spar.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then how do we know he can fight?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriban Gnol bowed again. ‘Sire, we have discussed this before. The report of Varat Taun, corroborated by Icarium’s companion, Taralack Veed. And now, I learned today, something new. Something most extraordinary.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What? Tell me!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Among the rejected champions, sire, a monk from a distant archipelago. It would appear, sire, that this monk-and indeed all of his people-worship a single god. And this god is none other than Icarium.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhulad flinched as if struck across the face. The sword’s point leapt up from the floor, then cracked down again. Marble chips clattered down the dais step. ‘I am to cross blades with a god?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chancellor shrugged. ‘Do such claims hold veracity, sire? A primitive, ignorant people, these Cabalhii. No doubt seeing in dhenrabi the soul of sea-storms and in crab carapaces the faces of the drowned. I should add, Emperor, that this monk believes his god to be insane, to which the only answer is a painted mask denoting laughter. Savages possess the strangest notions.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A god…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriban Gnol risked a glance at Hannan Mosag. The Warlock King’s expression was closed as he studied Rhulad. Something about that awakened a worm of unease in the Chancellor’s gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I shall slay a god…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There is no reason to believe otherwise,’ Triban Gnol said in a calm, confident voice. ‘It will serve timely, sire, in pronouncing your own godhood.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhulad’s eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Immortality,’ the Chancellor murmured, ‘already well established. Worshipped? Oh yes, by every citizen of this empire. Too modest, oh yes, to make the pronouncement of what is obvious to us all. But, when you stand over Icarium’s destroyed corpse, well, that will be pronouncement enough, I should imagine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Godhood. A god.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, sire. Most assuredly. I have instructed the guild of sculptors, and their finest artists have already begun work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shall announce the end of the Challenge in a most appropriate, a most glorious, manner.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are wise indeed,’ Rhulad said, slowly leaning back. ‘Yes, wise.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriban Gnol bowed, ignoring the sour grunt from Hannan Mosag. Oh, Ceda, you are mine now, and I shall use you. You and your foul Edur. Oh yes. His eyes focused on his hands, folded so serenely where they rested on the clasp of his belt. ‘Sire, orders must be delivered to our armies. The Ceda and I must discuss the disposition, of mages and K’risnan.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, of course. Leave me, all of you. Attend to your tasks.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesturing behind him, Triban Gnol backed away, head still lowered, eyes now on the floor with its chips of marble and streaks of dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear Hannan Mosag and his collection of freaks dragging their way towards the doors, like gigantic migrating toads. The simile brought a faint smile to his lips.,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the corridor, the doors shutting behind them, Triban Gnol turned to study Hannan Mosag. But the Ceda was continuing on, toads crowding his wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hannan Mosag,’ the Chancellor called out. ‘You and I have-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Save your crap for Rhulad,’ the Ceda snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He will be displeased to hear of your lack of co-operation.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Flap away with that tongue of yours, Gnol. The displeasures yet to come will overwhelm your pathetic bleatings, 1 am sure.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you mean?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hannan Mosag did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriban Gnol watched as they plunged into a side passage and were gone from sight. Yes, I will deal with you, Ceda, with great satisfaction. ‘Sirryn, assemble your entourage in the compound and be on your way within the bell. And take these mages with you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chancellor remained where he was until they too were gone, then he set off for his office, well pleased. That worm of unease was, however, reluctant to cease its gnawing deep inside him. He would have to think on that-too dangerous to just ignore such instincts, after all. But not right now. It was important to reward oneself, promptly, and so he released that flow of satisfaction. Everything was proceeding nicely-that detail about the Emperor himself being the final target of these foreigners simply sweetened the scenario. The Tiste Edur would of course stand to defend their Emperor-they would, certainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, Rhulad’s own brothers, the day of the accession. The worm writhed, forcing a twitch to his face, and he quickened his pace, eager for the sanctuary of his office. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-299.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
