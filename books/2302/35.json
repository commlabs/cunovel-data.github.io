If it was the last thing she did in this life, she would avenge her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if the Fates were on her side, maybe she could find the monster who had killed her mother, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClad in a long white dress reminiscent of the kind Cleopatra had once worn, Mara reclined on a curved settee, her gaze fixed on Kyle. She loved to watch him paint. He wielded his brushes with single-minded concentration. And after each session, he made love to her as gently and sweetly as ever a man had loved a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly, she wasn’t a woman, not in the way he thought she was. Did she dare tell him the truth? She shook the thought away. There would be plenty of time for that, later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwareness thrummed through her when he glanced her way. What was there about him that had so quickly and thoroughly captivated her? True, he was handsome, but she had met many handsome men in the course of her existence. Perhaps it was nothing more than the fact that he made her laugh. She refused to entertain the notion that she could be falling in love with him. She had resisted entanglements of any kind for centuries. She had taken lovers, she had created others of her kind, but she had never given her whole heart to any man, living or Undead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it was just being home again that made her vulnerable. It was wonderful to see the Great Sphinx again, to explore the pyramids inside and out. Walking barefooted along the banks of the Nile made her feel young and carefree; breathing the air of her native land, resting in the rich, fertile soil, renewed her in ways nothing else could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnticipation curled through her insides when Kyle laid his brush aside and walked toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s finished,” he said, his tone almost reverent. “It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finished!” Mara leapt from the settee. Thus far, he had not even let her glance at the canvas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was beautiful. Breathtaking. Being somewhat vain, she’d had her portrait painted every twenty-five years or so. The artists changed. The backgrounds changed, fashions changed, but she had always looked the same. Until now. Perhaps it was Kyle’s affection for her that made the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Surely that can’t be me,” she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman in the painting was exquisite, slender yet curvaceous. Her hair fell over her shoulders in luxurious waves, her eyes were bright with a hint of mischief and mystery, her lips were pink and slightly parted, as if awaiting love’s first kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at Kyle. “Is that how I truly look, or how you see me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s how you truly look,” he said, “but why are you so surprised? It’s the same face you see in the mirror every day. You must know how stunning you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, of course.” She looked at her image more closely. Of course she looked beautiful. She was a Vampire, with a Vampire’s inherent glamour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re displeased?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, of course not.” Rising on her tiptoes, she kissed him, and felt again that peculiar tingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I keep it for a few days? I’d like to make a copy for myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResting her forehead against his chest, she blew out a sigh. He really was a dear man. How was she ever going to leave him? Would he still love her if he knew what she was? Few mortals who learned her true nature lived to tell the tale. Dare she trust him with the truth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand moved in her hair. His touch sent a shiver of longing coursing through her. Lifting her head, she gazed up at him. Desire lurked in his eyes, the scent of musk rose from his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mara, I look at you and I want you with every fiber of my being, every beat of my heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe trailed her fingernail down his cheek. “An artist and a poet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe captured her hand in his and kissed her palm, his tongue like a flame against her cool flesh. “Only a fool in love with a goddess who dares to dream…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of what do you dream, Kyle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of making love to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come, my love.” Taking him by the hand, she led him to the settee and drew him down beside her. “And dream no more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother week went by and Savanah started to get restless. Not that she didn’t enjoy being with Rane, but she was beginning to feel like a prisoner. He had gone to her house again last night and when he got back, he had told her he didn’t want her going outside unless he was with her, which meant she couldn’t go swimming until the sun went down. When she’d started to argue, he’d kissed her until she forgot everything else. Now, she wondered what he knew that he wasn’t telling her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was anxious to go home, anxious for her life to return to normal, or as normal as it could be without her father, but Rane wouldn’t hear of it. He reminded her that Vampires and Werewolves were nothing if not patient creatures, and that just because they hadn’t seen or heard anything out of the ordinary in the last week, it didn’t mean there was nothing to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavanah knew he was probably right, but she still wanted to go home. She missed living in her own house and sleeping in her own bed. She missed going to work. She had called Mr. Van Black and asked for more time off. She had called Jolie a couple of times to see what was happening at the Chronicle, she had called the police department to see if they had turned up any leads on who had killed her father even though she knew it was unlikely. As far as she knew, there weren’t any Vampire hunters on the force. She grinned inwardly. If she lost her job at the Chronicle, maybe she could go to work for the Kelton P.D.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, she wandered from room to room on the main floor. The views from the front windows all looked like scenes from picture postcards. Lofty green pines reached upward toward the bright blue sky with the mountains standing like sentinels in the background. Moving toward the back of the house, Savanah gazed longingly at the pool. Sunlight glinted invitingly off the still water, tempting her to go outside and take a quick dip, but Rane’s warning echoed in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResigned to staying inside until he awoke, she decided to read awhile, only then remembering that she had left her book on the patio table last night. She drummed her fingertips on the window frame. It would only take a moment to run outside and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced out the window again. She could see her book lying on the table where she had left it, the pool beyond, and the high wooden fence that surrounded the backyard. There was no one in sight, and no place to hide in the pool area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing into the kitchen, Savanah unlocked the door and took a step across the threshold, only to pause when a cold chill skittered down her spine. She was about to dart back inside when a heavy hand clamped over her arm and jerked her out of the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scream erupted from her throat as her attacker dragged her out of the house. Kicking and scratching, she screamed again even though there was no one to hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me go!” She tried to scratch her attacker’s eyes, but he held her away with ease. She renewed her struggles as they neared the side gate, but it was no use. The man was close to seven feet tall, as wide as a barn door, and had a grip like iron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The books,” he said, slamming her up against the house. “Where are the books?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up at him, her insides suddenly as cold as ice. “I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you do.” Her head slammed against the wall when he shook her. Black spots danced in front of her eyes. “Where are the books?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, I don’t know…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand closed around her throat. “Don’t make me ask you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strength went out of her legs as her vision blurred. She was going to die, she thought dully, and she hadn’t even killed one Vampire. Vampire…Rane…she would never see him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, unaccountably, her attacker released her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavanah slid to the ground, her hand massaging her throat as she fought to drag air into her lungs. A scuffling sound drew her attention. With an effort, she turned her head, squinting against the bright sunlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the scant shelter of the patio, Rane was fighting her attacker. The scent of blood filled the air as they savaged each other. She could see smoke curling from the back of Rane’s T-shirt, smell his burning flesh. How much longer could he endure the sunlight before he went up in flames?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing herself to her feet, she staggered into the house and grabbed her pistol. Standing in the kitchen doorway, she pointed the gun at the intruder’s back and then, taking aim the way Rane had taught her, she gently squeezed the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn inhuman howl filled the air as her attacker grabbed his right shoulder. Bright red blood oozed between his fingers. Whirling around, he started toward her, his lips drawn back in a feral snarl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear coiled in Savanah’s stomach as she stared at the inhuman creature striding toward her. Hair sprouted from the backs of his hands; long, curved claws emerged from the ends of his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited until he was several steps away from Rane and then, taking aim at the Werewolf’s heart, she fired again, and then again, until the hammer clicked on an empty chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Werewolf dropped like a felled ox as her last shot pierced his heart, dead before he hit the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing the gun on the kitchen table, Savanah ran out the door. “Rane!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had fallen to his hands and knees. Swaying, he looked up at her. The skin on his face was red, blistered where the sun had touched him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re on fire!” Using her hands, she slapped at the flames eating through the back of his T-shirt and searing the skin beneath. “Come on!” she cried, “we’ve got to get you into the house!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing him by one arm, she dragged him inside, then sank down on the floor beside him as all the strength drained from her limbs. For a minute, she just lay there, her body shaking uncontrollably, her nostrils filled with the stink of gunpowder and the awful smell of scorched flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRane lay facedown on the floor beside her, his eyes closed, his back muscles twitching. His skin was raw and red in some places, burnt black in others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued to stare at him, afraid he would go up in smoke at any minute even as she wondered how he had survived being outside when the sun was up. Fortunately, he had only been in the sun a short time. The Werewolf’s claws had left deep furrows along Rane’s arms, down the side of his neck, and across one cheek. Thick, dark red blood oozed from the wounds. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-pleasure-children-of-the-night-4/page-35.html","bookId":2302,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:13 PM"}
