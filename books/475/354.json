It may make necessary renunciations and separations which leave one to feel a strange sense both of deprivation and loneliness. But he who will fly, as an eagle does, into the higher levels where cloudless day abides, and live in the sunshine of God, must be content to live a comparatively lonely life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo bird is so solitary as the eagle. Eagles never fly in flocks; one, or at most two, ever being seen at once. But the life that is lived unto God, however it forfeits human companionships, knows Divine fellowship.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGod seeks eagle-men. No man ever comes into a realization of the best things of God, who does not, upon the Godward side of his life, learn to walk alone with God. We find Abraham alone in Horeb upon the heights, but Lot, dwelling in Sodom. Moses, skilled in all the wisdom of Egypt must go forty years into the desert alone with God. Paul, who was filled with Greek learning and had also sat at the feet of Gamaliel, must go into Arabia and learn the desert life with God. Let God isolate us. I do not mean the isolation of a monastery. In this isolating experience He develops an independence of faith and life so that the soul needs no longer the constant help, prayer, faith or attention of his neighbor. Such assistance and inspiration from the other members are necessary and have their place in the Christian\u0027s development, but there comes a time when they act as a direct hindrance to the individual\u0027s faith and welfare. God knows how to change the circumstances in order to give us an isolating experience. We yield to God and He takes us through something, and when it is over, those about us, who are no less loved than before, are no longer depended upon. We realize that He has wrought some things in us, and that the wings of our souls have learned to beat the upper air.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe must dare to be alone. Jacob must be left alone if the Angel of God is to whisper in his ear the mystic name of Shiloh; Daniel must be left alone if he is to see celestial visions; John must be banished to Patmos if he is deeply to take and firmly to keep \"the print of heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe trod the wine-press alone. Are we prepared for a \"splendid isolation\" rather than fail Him? ━Selected\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e十二月二十日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「其实我不是独自一人，因为有父与我同在。」 （约十六:32）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e我们都知道：要跟从主，是要出重大代价的。也许要我们放弃合法的权利，也许要我们离开至亲的爱人，叫我们尝到非常的剥夺和孤独。但是我们如果像鹫鹰那样飞上高天，直穿云霄，我们就能与神同居；虽然地上的生活孤独一点，也可以叫我们知足了。 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e鹫鹰是鸟类中最喜欢独栖的。牠们从不集群而飞；每次我们看见牠们，只能看见一只，最多两只。 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e一个与神同居的人，虽然没有人的交往，定规有神的交往。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e神在寻找像鹫鹰那样的人。因为凡不与神单独同行的人，绝不能明白神最好。摩西虽然精通埃及人的一切学问，他还须在旷野与神单独亲近四十年。保罗虽然精通希腊学问，且曾在迦玛列门下受教，他还须到亚拉伯去学习去沙漠的生活。所以，信徒阿，任神隔离我们罢。不过我并不指寺院式的隔离。隔离能使我们有独立的信心和生活━使我们不再不断的依赖别人的帮助、祷告、信心和照顾。别人的帮助和激励，对于基督人的长进，是绝对必需的，但是到了一个时期，它们会成为个人信心和幸福的直接妨碍。神知道甚么时候我们的环境需要更换，甚么时候我们需要隔离生活。所以让我们把一切交给神罢，祂必带领我们过去。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e我们必须有体验单独生活勇气。神的使者，在雅各布耳边轻轻告诉他神秘地名示罗的时候，必须在他单独的时候；但以理得见天上的异象也须先要单独；约翰之得天上的启示，也先要有拔摩岛的经历。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e主独自踹酒醡。我们预备跟从祂的脚踪行呢？还是预备叫祂失望呢？━选\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5589.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:52:59 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:52:59 AM"}
