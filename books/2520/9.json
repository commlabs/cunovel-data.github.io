Well, for starters, because you’re intimidated by him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not intimidated by him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose on her tiptoes to pat the top of my head, and said, “Since you won’t admit that little truth, how about this one? Because he’s the leader of that rabid pack of animals and he’s totally dangerous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDangerous. Yeah, I got that. “You dated one of his friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spread her arms, as if I’d just made her point for her. “And look where I ended up—cheated on and brokenhearted.” The soft snick of closing doors filled the hall, and she glanced around. “Come on. Let’s finish this on the way to your class.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that the halls were deserted and I could move freely, I should have relaxed. But I felt like I’d been plugged into something. A battery, maybe. I had energy. And there was a soft buzzing sound echoing in my head. Even the lights in the hallway seemed brighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cole’s, like, the worst of the lot,” Kat said. “He speaks, and the rest of them jump to obey. They skip school a lot, and do…well, your guess is as good as mine. No, probably not as good, but close. And yeah, you’d think I’d know for sure, but Frosty was stellar at keeping secrets. Obviously. Anyway, they’re always wounded, so you know they like to throw down in the nastiest way possible. And did I mention that they’re secretive? Cole is the worst, but Frosty is second in line for the title of The Vault, I promise you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Frosty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My ex.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got that, but his name is…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A nickname, yes. He accidentally locked himself out of his house one winter. By the time he was found he was covered in ice and completely frostbitten. They nearly amputated all of his limbs. True story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” Because I hadn’t noticed anything missing, and if they’d nearly amputated all of his limbs, surely they would have taken a few of his fingers, the most vulnerable part of the hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, he only lost a toe, but frostbite is treacherous. Anyway, the only girls who get to hang with them on their private little adventures are Mackenzie Love—Cole’s ex—and Trina, who you had the misfortune to meet earlier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole still hung out with his ex? That had bad news written all over it. Not that I cared. Or wanted to, I don’t know, go on a date with him, marry him and have his babies. I just wanted answers. Really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had happened in that hallway—or rather, what had not happened—was freaking me out. I mean, I’d always had a strong imagination, as evidenced by the monster in the wedding dress I was convinced I’d seen, but this little mind-vacay of making out in the hall with a strange boy I hadn’t officially met far surpassed anything else I’d ever thought up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just a warning,” Kat said. “If you hang with them, Mackenzie will corner you and threaten your very existence. Oh, and your friends will drop you and you’ll be known as trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could handle the name Trouble. Again, not that I was considering doing anything with Cole. “Were you dropped when you dated Frosty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, only a moment, she radiated sadness. Then she flipped her hair over one shoulder, grinned and said, “I’ve always been known as big-time trouble, and though no one has yet realized, I’m more trouble now that Frosty and I— Or is it Frosty and me? I can’t ever remember. Whatevs. I’m more trouble now that we’ve spilt, but you’ll learn to appreciate that part of me, I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Already do,” I said, and I meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached a red door, and she stopped. She hitched her thumb at it and said, “This is you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peeked into the classroom through the small window on the door and wanted to run. Or vomit. No, both. Kids were everywhere, and there were no empty seats. The teacher was at the front, already lecturing. The moment I walked inside, silence would take over and every eye would find me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I’d turned green or shuddered, because Kat said, “Nervous?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but only a little…lot.” I’d always had difficulty lying. “Want to ditch?” I asked hopefully. We could start fresh for block two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I don’t want to ditch, and I’m not even going to attempt to figure out what a little lot is. I want to make an entrance in my own class. After all, the center of attention is the best place to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh, no, no it wasn’t. I backed up a step. “I’ll wait for you outside, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll be fine,” she said, merciless. “They’ll love you. And if they don’t, well, let me know who I need to punish. That’s a specialty of mine, just FYI. So is tough love.” She patted me on the butt. “Now go get ’em, baby cub.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat, wait. I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You heard the part about tough love, right? And P.S. In a few months, you might graduate to a full-on tigress, but until then…” She opened the door and gave me a push inside the room. “You’ll have to endure the growing pains.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI survived first block with only a splash of humiliation. The “teacher,” and I use the term lightly, made me stand at the front of the class and tell the students a little about myself and why I was late. Apparently there were to be no breaks for anyone. Not on the first day, and certainly not for first timers who should know how to read a map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thinking on the matter: Mr. Buttle—whom I would forever call Mr. Butthole—was on a power trip, but whatever. I got through without any internal scarring because a very cute boy with puppy dog brown eyes smiled encouragingly at me, then made the universal jerk-off sign the moment Mr. Butthole turned his back, sending everyone into peals of laughter, thereby taking the attention away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond block took place in the same hall but third was in another building. Still, I made it on time and the class proved to be a breeze. No one tried to talk to me except the short, rotund Ms. Meyers. She wore her salt-and-pepper hair in a bun. Her glasses were too big for her face and continually slid down her nose, but she wasn’t unpleasant to look at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so excited to begin a brand-new year with you,” she said, clapping, “and I know you will be too when you hear what I’ve got planned! By the way, this is Creative Writing, in case anyone accidentally wandered into the wrong room. Anyone? No? Great. On with our stories!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI propped my head on one hand, and I meant to pay attention, I really did, but my mind drifted. I’d like to say I pondered my future, ways to improve my general state of mind, something, anything useful. But, no. My brain hopped the train to Colehollandville and refused to detour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne question after another formed. What had happened out there in that hallway? Had Cole experienced anything when \u0026nbsp;he looked at me? The way he’d snapped his teeth at me, as if I’d bewildered him without saying a word…maybe. But then again, maybe that had been a gesture of irritation. I’d basically eye-raped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what if I tranced out (or whatever you wanted to call it) the next time I saw him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperate to know, I’d searched for him after both my first and second classes. I’d looked through numerous passageways, along the stairs and, okay, yes, I’d even slowed down in front of both the boys’ bathrooms I’d passed, but there’d been no hint of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was a good thing. He intimidated me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere. I’d admitted it. He was big and bad and obviously well-acquainted with violence. I’d had enough violence in my life, thanks. Besides, there were only three possible outcomes if the two of us actually spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1) He’d tell me to ~bleep~ off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2) He’d tell everyone I was ~bleeping~ insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3) He’d ask me who the ~bleep~ I thought I was because he’s positive he’s never seen me before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know him, and yet I easily imagined him cussing. A lot. Kat would so not approve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—I think you’ll find her work symbolic of—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Meyers’s voice intruded, trying to claim my attention, but my dilemma quickly returned to center stage. I sooo wanted to talk to my mom about Cole and what had happened. Because of my dad, she’d understood weird in all its varying shades and degrees. She wouldn’t have laughed at me. She wouldn’t have rushed me in for an emergency therapy session. She would have sat me down and helped me reach a conclusion that satisfied me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI missed her so much and wished, so badly, that I’d been nicer to her there at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, well. What do you know? My mind could go somewhere other than Cole Holland today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way would I mention any of this to Nana and Pops. They’d freak—not that they’d ever show me. For me, they would smile and pretend all was well, never realizing I’d once caught them whispering in their bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor thing. Therapy isn’t working. Will \u0026nbsp;she ever recover, do you think?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot sure. All I know is that I hate that \u0026nbsp;she’s hurting so badly, but there’s nothing I can do. She won’t let \u0026nbsp;me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know. I’ve never felt so \u0026nbsp;helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d tried to get me to go to the movies, ice-skating and shopping, things kids my age supposedly liked to do, but my answer was always the same: no. Each time, they had kissed me on the forehead and said, “Maybe next time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRefusing to worry them further, I’d swallowed back the words \u0026nbsp;Maybe never. I spent most of my time in my room, and that’s the way I liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a routine. I spent my mornings reading The Iron Fey series. I spent my evenings listening to the mix tapes my dad had made for my mother. (I was staying in her old room and had found her old cassette player.) I spent my nights searching for monsters. On weekdays I left the house for school and on weekends I left for church. That was it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bell rang, shattering my thoughts like a fist through a mirror, and I bolted upright. Ms. Meyers was stacking books on her desk. Kids were already filing out of the classroom. I gathered my stuff and rose to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alice Bell,” Ms. Meyers called before I could leave. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/alice-in-zombieland-white-rabbit-chronicles-1/page-9.html","bookId":2520,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM"}
