This place had at least twenty of them covering up the long driveway. I pulled my mom\u0027s fifteen- year-old Ford truck over onto the sandy grass so that I wouldn\u0027t be blocking anyone in. Dad hadn\u0027t told me that he was having a party tonight. He hadn\u0027t told me much of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also hadn\u0027t shown up for my mother\u0027s funeral. If I didn\u0027t need somewhere to live, I wouldn\u0027t be here. I\u0027d had to sell the small house that my grandmother had left us to pay off the last of mom\u0027s medical bills. All I had left was my clothes and the truck. Calling my father, after he had failed to come even once during the three years my mother had fought cancer, had been hard. It had been necessary though; he was the only family I had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the massive three-story house that sat directly on the white sand in Rosemary Beach, Florida.\u0026amp;nbsp; This was my dad\u0027s new home. His new family. I wasn\u0027t going to fit in here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy truck door was suddenly jerked open. On instinct, I reached under the seat and grabbed my nine-millimeter. I swung it up and directly at the intruder, holding it with both hands ready to pull back on the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa... I was gonna tell you that you were lost but I\u0027ll tell you whatever the hell you want me to as long as you put that thing away.\"\u0026amp;nbsp; A guy with brown shaggy hair tucked behind his ears stood on the other side of my gun with both his hands in the air and eyes wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cocked an eyebrow and held my gun steady. I still didn\u0027t know who this guy was. Jerking someone\u0027s truck door open wasn\u0027t a normal greeting for a stranger. \"No, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m lost. Is this Abraham Wynn\u0027s house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy swallowed nervously, \"Uh, I can\u0027t think with that pointed in my face. You\u0027re making me very nervous, sweetheart. Could you put it down before you have an accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccident? Really? This guy was beginning to piss me off. \"I don\u0027t know you. It\u0027s dark outside and I\u0027m in a strange place, alone. So, forgive me if I don\u0027t feel very safe at the moment. You can trust me when I tell you that there won\u0027t be an accident. I can handle a gun. Very well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy didn\u0027t appear to believe me and now that I was looking at him he didn\u0027t appear to be real threatening. Nevertheless, I wasn\u0027t ready to lower my gun just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abraham?\" he repeated slowly and started to shake his head then stopped, \"Wait, Abe is Rush\u0027s new stepdad. I met him before he and Georgiana left for Paris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParis? Rush? What? I waited for more of an explanation but the guy continued to stare at the gun and hold his breath. Keeping my eyes on him, I lowered my protection and made sure to put the safety back on before tucking it under my seat. Maybe with the gun put away the guy could focus and explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you even have a license for that thing?\" he asked incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t in the mood to talk about my right to bear arms. I needed answers.\"Abraham is in Paris?\" I asked needing confirmation. He knew I was coming today. We\u0027d just talked last week after I\u0027d sold the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy nodded slowly and his stance relaxed. \"You know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot really. I had seen him all of two times since he\u0027d walked out on my mom and me five years ago. I remembered the Dad who\u0027d come to my soccer games and grilled burgers outside for the neighborhood block parties. The Dad I\u0027d had until the day my twin sister Valerie was killed in a car accident. My father had been driving. He\u0027d changed that day. The man that didn\u0027t call me and make sure I was okay while I took care of my sick mother, I didn\u0027t know him. Not at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m his daughter, Blaire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy\u0027s eyes went wide and he threw back his head and laughed. Why was this funny? I waited for him to explain when he held out his hand. \"Come on Blaire, I have someone you need to meet. He\u0027s gonna love this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared down at his hand and reached for my purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you packing in your purse too? Should I warn everyone not to piss you off?\" The teasing lilt to his voice kept me from saying something rude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You opened my door without knocking. I was scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your instant reaction to being scared is to pull out a gun on someone? Damn girl, where are you from? Most girls I know squeal or some shit like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost girls he knew hadn\u0027t been forced to protect themselves for the past three years. I\u0027d had my mother to take care of but no one to take care of me. \"I\u0027m from Alabama,\" I replied ignoring his hand and stepping out of the truck myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea breeze hit my face and the salty smell of the beach was unmistakable. I\u0027d never seen the beach before. At least not in person. I\u0027d seen pictures and movies. But the smell, it was exactly like I expected it to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s true what they say about girls from Bama,\" he replied and I turned my attention to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes scanned down my body and back up to my face. A grin stretched slowly across his face. \"Tight jeans, tank tops, and a gun. Damn, I\u0027ve been living in the wrong fucking state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling my eyes, I reached into the back of the truck. I had a suitcase and then several boxes that I needed to drop off at the Goodwill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, let me get it.\" He stepped around me then reached into the truck bed for the large piece of luggage my mom had kept tucked away in her closet for that \"road trip\" we never got to take. She always talked about how we\u0027d drive across the country and then up the west coast one day. Then she\u0027d gotten sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking off the memories, I focused on the present. \"Thank you, uh... I don\u0027t think I got your name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy pulled the suitcase out then turned back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? You forgot to ask when you had the nine-millimeter pointed at my face?\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. Okay, maybe I\u0027d gone a little overboard with the gun but he\u0027d scared me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Grant, a, uh, friend of Rush\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rush?\" There was that name again. Who was Rush?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant\u0027s grin grew big once again. \"You don\u0027t know who Rush is?\" He was extremely amused. \"I\u0027m so fucking glad I came tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded his head toward the house, \"Come on. I\u0027ll introduce you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked beside him as he led me to the house. The music inside got louder as we got closer. If my dad wasn\u0027t here, then who was? I knew Georgiana was his new wife but that was all I knew. Was this a party her kids were having? How old were they? She did have kids, didn\u0027t she? I couldn\u0027t remember. Dad had been vague. He\u0027d said I\u0027d like my new family but he hadn\u0027t said who that family was exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, does Rush live here?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, he does, at least in the summer. He moves to his other houses according to the season.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His other houses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant chuckled, \"You don\u0027t know anything about this family your dad has married into, do you, Blaire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea. I shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quick mini lesson then before we walk inside the madness,\" he replied stopping at the top of the stairs leading to the front door and looked at me. \"Rush Finlay is your stepbrother. He\u0027s the only child of the famous drummer for Slacker Demon, Dean Finlay. His parents never married. His mother, Georgianna, was a groupie back in the day. This is his house. His mother gets to live here because he allows it.\" He stopped and looked back at the door, as it swung open. \"These are all his friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall, willowy, strawberry blonde wearing a short royal blue dress and a pair of heels that I\u0027d break my neck in if I tried to wear them stood there staring at me. I didn\u0027t miss the distaste in her scowl. I didn\u0027t know much about people like this but I did know that my department store clothing wasn\u0027t something she approved of. Either that or I had a bug crawling on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hello Nannette,\" Grant replied in an annoyed tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is she?\" the girl asked, shifting her gaze to Grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend. Wipe the snarl off your face Nan it isn\u0027t an attractive look for you,\" he replied, reaching over to grab my hand and pull me into the house behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room wasn\u0027t as full as I\u0027d assumed. As we walked past the large open foyer an arched doorway led into what I assumed was a living room. Even so, it was bigger than my entire house or what had been my house. Two glass doors were standing open with a breathtaking view of the ocean. I wanted to see that up close.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way,\" Grant instructed as he made his way over to a... bar? Really? There was a bar in the house?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over the people we passed by. They all paused for a moment and gave me a quick once over. I stood out big time.\u0026amp;nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rush, meet Blaire, I believe she might belong to you. I found her outside looking a little lost,\" Grant said and I swung my gaze from the curious people to see who this Rush was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. My.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so?\" Rush replied in a lazy drawl and leaned forward from his relaxed position on the white sofa with a beer in his hand. \"She\u0027s cute but she\u0027s young.\u0026amp;nbsp; Can\u0027t say she\u0027s mine.\"\u0026amp;nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, she\u0027s yours alright. Seeing as her daddy has run off to Paris with your momma for the next few weeks. I\u0027d say this one now belongs to you. I\u0027d gladly offer her a room at my place if you want. That is if she promises to leave her deadly weapon in the truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush narrowed his eyes and studied me closely. They were an odd color. Stunningly unusual. They weren\u0027t brown. They weren\u0027t hazel. They were a warm color with some silver laced through them. I\u0027d never seen anything like them. Could they be contacts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t make her mine,\" he finally replied and leaned back on the sofa where he\u0027d been reclining when we walked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant cleared his throat. \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush didn\u0027t reply. Instead he took a drink from the longneck bottle in his hands. His gaze had shifted to Grant\u0027s and I could see the warning there. I was going to be asked to leave. This wasn\u0027t good. I had exactly twenty dollars in my purse and I was almost out of gas. I\u0027d already sold anything of value that I possessed. When I\u0027d called my father I had explained that I just needed somewhere to stay until I could get a job and make enough money to go find a place of my own. He had quickly agreed and given me this address telling me he would love for me to come stay with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush\u0027s attention was back on me. He was waiting on me to make a move. What did he expect me to say? A smirk touched his lips and he winked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a house full of guests tonight and my bed\u0027s already full.\" He shifted his eyes to Grant. \"I think it\u0027s best if we let her go find a hotel until I can get in touch with her daddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disgust on his tongue as he said the words \"daddy\" hadn\u0027t gone unnoticed. He didn\u0027t like my father. I couldn\u0027t blame him really. This wasn\u0027t his fault. My dad had sent me here. I\u0027d wasted most of my money on gas and food driving here. Why had I trusted that man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached over and grabbed the handle on the suitcase that Grant was still holding. \"He\u0027s right. I should go. This was a very bad idea,\" I explained without looking at him. I tugged hard on the suitcase and he let go somewhat reluctantly. Tears stung my eyes as the realization that I was about to be homeless sunk in. I couldn\u0027t look at either of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, I headed for the door, keeping my eyes downcast. I heard Grant arguing with Rush but I blocked it out. I didn\u0027t want to hear what that beautiful man said about me. He didn\u0027t like me. That much was obvious. My dad was not a welcome member of the family apparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leaving so soon?\" a voice that reminded me of smooth syrup asked. I glanced up to see the delighted smile on the girl who had opened the door earlier. She hadn\u0027t wanted me here either. Was I that revolting to these people? I quickly dropped my eyes back to the floor and opened the door. I had too much pride for that mean bitch to see me cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I was safely outside I let out a sob and headed to my truck. If I hadn\u0027t been carrying my suitcase I\u0027d have run. I needed the safety of it. I belonged inside my truck, not in this ridiculous house with these uppity people. I missed home. I missed my mom. Another sob broke free and I closed the door to my truck locking it behind me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fallen-too-far-too-far-1/page-1.html","bookId":1993,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:23 AM"}
