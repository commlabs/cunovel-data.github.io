If there is food I eat it, in case there is none on the morrow.” He smiled. “Tell me, are your ravens early risers as well?”\u0026nbsp; Pycelle stroked the snowy beard that flowed down his chest. “To be sure. Shall I send for quill and ink after we have eaten?”\u0026nbsp; “No need.” Tyrion laid the letters on the table beside his porridge, twin parchments tightly rolled and sealed with wax at both ends. “Send your girl away, so we can talk.”\u0026nbsp; “Leave us, child,” Pycelle commanded. The serving girl hurried from the room. “These letters, now...”\u0026nbsp; “For the eyes of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne.” Tyrion peeled the cracked shell away from his egg and took a bite. It wanted salt. “One letter, in two copies. Send your swiftest birds. The matter is of great import.”\u0026nbsp; “I shall dispatch them as soon as we have broken our fast.”\u0026nbsp; “Dispatch them now. Stewed plums will keep. The realm may not. Lord Renly is leading his host up the roseroad, and no one can say when Lord Stannis will sail from Dragonstone.”\u0026nbsp; Pycelle blinked. “If my lord prefers-”\u0026nbsp; “He does.”\u0026nbsp; “I am here to serve.” The maester pushed himself ponderously to his feet his chain of office clinking softly. It was a heavy thing, a dozen maester’s collars threaded around and through each other and ornamented with gemstones. And it seemed to Tyrion that the gold and silver and platinum links far outnumbered those of baser metals.\u0026nbsp; Pycelle moved so slowly that Tyrion had time to finish his egg and taste the plums-overcooked and watery, to his taste-before the sound of wings prompted him to rise. He spied the raven, dark in the dawn sky, and turned briskly toward the maze of shelves at the far end of the room.\u0026nbsp; The maester’s medicines made an impressive display; dozens of pots sealed with wax, hundreds of stoppered vials, as many milkglass bottles, countless jars of dried herbs, each container neatly labeled in Pycelle’s precise hand. An orderly mind, Tyrion reflected, and indeed, once you puzzled out the arrangement, it was easy to see that every potion had its place. And such interesting things. He noted sweetsleep and nightshade, milk of the poppy, the tears of Lys, powdered greycap, wolfsbane and demon’s dance, basilisk venom, blindeye, widow’s blood...\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Standing on his toes and straining upward, he managed to pull a small dusty bottle off the high shelf. When he read the label, he smiled and slipped it up his sleeve.\u0026nbsp; He was back at the table peeling another egg when Grand Maester Pycelle came creeping down the stairs. “It is done, my lord.” The old man seated himself. “A matter like this... best done promptly, indeed,indeed... of great import, you say?”\u0026nbsp; “Oh, yes.” The porridge was too thick, Tyrion felt, and wanted butter and honey. To be sure, butter and honey were seldom seen in King’s Landing of late, though Lord Gyles kept them well supplied in the castle. Half of the food they ate these days came from his lands or Lady Tanda’s. Rosby and Stokeworth lay near the city to the north, and were yet untouched by war.\u0026nbsp; “The Prince of Dorne, himself. Might I ask.”\u0026nbsp; “Best not.”\u0026nbsp; “As you say.” Pycelle’s curiosity was so ripe that Tyrion could almost taste it. “Mayhaps... the king’s council...”\u0026nbsp; Tyrion tapped his wooden spoon against the edge of the bowl. “The council exists to advise the king, Maester.”\u0026nbsp; “Just so,” said Pycelle, “and the king-”\u0026nbsp; “-is a boy of thirteen. I speak with his voice.”\u0026nbsp; “So you do. Indeed. The King’s Own Hand. Yet... your most gracious sister, our Queen Regent, she...”\u0026nbsp; “...bears a great weight upon those lovely white shoulders of hers. I have no wish to add to her burdens. Do you?” Tyrion cocked his head and gave the Grand Maester an inquiring stare.\u0026nbsp; Pycelle dropped his gaze back to his food. Something about Tyrion’s mismatched green-and-black eyes made men squirm; knowing that, he made good use of them. “Ah,” the old man muttered into his plums. “Doubtless you have the right of it, my lord. It is most considerate of you to... spare her this... burden.”\u0026nbsp; “That’s just the sort of fellow I am.” Tyrion returned to the unsatisfactory porridge. “Considerate. Cersei is my own sweet sister, after all.”\u0026nbsp; “And a woman, to be sure,” Grand Maester Pycelle said. “A most uncommon woman, and yet... it is no small thing, to tend to all the cares of the realm, despite the frailty of her sex...”\u0026nbsp; Oh, yes, she’s a frail dove, just ask Eddard Stark. “I’m pleased you share my concern. And I thank you for the hospitality of your table. But a long day awaits.” He swung his legs out and clambered down from his chair. “Be so good as to inform me at once should we receive a reply from Dorne? “\u0026nbsp; “As you say, my lord.”\u0026nbsp; “And only me?”\u0026nbsp; “Ah... to be sure.” Pycelle’s spotted hand was clutching at his beard the way a drowning man clutches for a rope. It made Tyrion’s heart glad. One, he thought. \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1522/45498.html","bookId":1301,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:57:23 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:57:23 AM"}
