When the physical-education officer at Lowery Fieldordered everyone to fall out for calisthenics one afternoon, Yossarian, the private, reported instead at thedispensary with what he said was a pain in his right side.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Beat it,” said the doctor on duty there, who was doing a crossword puzzle.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“We can’t tell him to beat it,” said a corporal. “There’s a new directive out about abdominal complaints. Wehave to keep them under observation five days because so many of them have been dying after we make thembeat it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“All right,” grumbled the doctor. “Keep him under observation five days and then make him beat it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They took Yossarian’s clothes away and put him in a ward, where he was very happy when no one was snoringnearby. In the morning a helpful young English intern popped in to ask him about his liver.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I think it’s my appendix that’s bothering me,” Yossarian told him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Your appendix is no good,” the Englishman declared with jaunty authority. “If your appendix goes wrong, wecan take it out and have you back on active duty in almost no time at all. But come to us with a liver complaintand you can fool us for weeks. The liver, you see, is a large, ugly mystery to us. If you’ve ever eaten liver youknow what I mean. We’re pretty sure today that the liver exists and we have a fairly good idea of what it does whenever it’s doing what it’s supposed to be doing. Beyond that, we’re really in the dark. After all, what is aliver? My father, for example, died of cancer of the liver and was never sick a day of his life right up till themoment it killed him. Never felt a twinge of pain. In a way, that was too bad, since I hated my father. Lust formy mother, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What’s an English medical officer doing on duty here?” Yossarian wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The officer laughed. “I’ll tell you all about that when I see you tomorrow morning. And throw that silly ice bagaway before you die of pneumonia.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Yossarian never saw him again. That was one of the nice things about all the doctors at the hospital; he neversaw any of them a second time. They came and went and simply disappeared. In place of the English intern thenext day, there arrived a group of doctors he had never seen before to ask him about his appendix.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“There’s nothing wrong with my appendix,” Yossarian informed them. “The doctor yesterday said it was myliver.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Maybe it is his liver,” replied the white-haired officer in charge. “What does his blood count show?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“He hasn’t had a blood count.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Have one taken right away. We can’t afford to take chances with a patient in his condition. We’ve got to keepourselves covered in case he dies.” He made a notation on his clipboard and spoke to Yossarian. “In themeantime, keep that ice bag on. It’s very important.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I don’t have an ice bag on.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Well, get one. There must be an ice bag around here somewhere. And let someone know if the pain becomesunendurable.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　At the end of ten days, a new group of doctors came to Yossarian with bad news; he was in perfect health andhad to get out. He was rescued in the nick of time by a patient across the aisle who began to see everything twice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Without warning, the patient sat up in bed and shouted.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I see everything twice!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　A nurse screamed and an orderly fainted. Doctors came running up from every direction with needles, lights,tubes, rubber mallets and oscillating metal tines. They rolled up complicated instruments on wheels. There wasnot enough of the patient to go around, and specialists pushed forward in line with raw tempers and snapped attheir colleagues in front to hurry up and give somebody else a chance. A colonel with a large forehead and horn-rimmed glasses soon arrived at a diagnosis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“It’s meningitis,” he called out emphatically, waving the others back. “Although Lord knows there’s not the slightest reason for thinking so.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Then why pick meningitis?” inquired a major with a suave chuckle. “Why not, let’s say, acute nephritis?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Because I’m a meningitis man, that’s why, and not an acute-nephritis man,” retorted the colonel. “And I’m notgoing to give him up to any of you kidney birds without a struggle. I was here first.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　In the end, the doctors were all in accord. They agreed they had no idea what was wrong with the soldier whosaw everything twice, and they rolled him away into a room in the corridor and quarantined everyone else in theward for fourteen days.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Thanksgiving Day came and went without any fuss while Yossarian was still in the hospital. The only bad thingabout it was the turkey for dinner, and even that was pretty good. It was the most rational Thanksgiving he hadever spent, and he took a sacred oath to spend every future Thanksgiving Day in the cloistered shelter of ahospital. He broke his sacred oath the very next year, when he spent the holiday in a hotel room instead inintellectual conversation with Lieutenant Scheisskopf’s wife, who had Dori Duz’s dog tags on for the occasionand who henpecked Yossarian sententiously for being cynical and callous about Thanksgiving, even though shedidn’t believe in God just as much as he didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’m probably just as good an atheist as you are,” she speculated boastfully. “But even I feel that we all have agreat deal to be thankful for and that we shouldn’t be ashamed to show it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Name one thing I’ve got to be thankful for,” Yossarian challenged her without interest.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Well...” Lieutenant Scheisskopf’s wife mused and paused a moment to ponder dubiously. “Me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Oh, come on,” he scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She arched her eyebrows in surprise. “Aren’t you thankful for me?” she asked. She frowned peevishly, her pridewounded. “I don’t have to shack up with you, you know,” she told him with cold dignity. “My husband has awhole squadron full of aviation cadets who would be only too happy to shack up with their commandingofficer’s wife just for the added fillip it would give them.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Yossarian decided to change the subject. “Now you’re changing the subject,” he pointed out diplomatically. “I’llbet I can name two things to be miserable about for every one you can name to be thankful for.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Be thankful you’ve got me,” she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I am, honey. But I’m also goddam good and miserable that I can’t have Dori Duz again, too. Or the hundreds ofother girls and women I’ll see and want in my short lifetime and won’t be able to go to bed with even once.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Be thankful you’re healthy.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Be bitter you’re not going to stay that way.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Be glad you’re even alive.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Be furious you’re going to die.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Things could be much worse,” she cried.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“They could be one hell of a lot better,” he answered heatedly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You’re naming only one thing,” she protested. “You said you could name two.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“And don’t tell me God works in mysterious ways,” Yossarian continued, hurtling on over her objection.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“There’s nothing so mysterious about it. He’s not working at all. He’s playing. Or else He’s forgotten all aboutus. That’s the kind of God you people talk about—a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited,uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary toinclude such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world wasrunning through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to controltheir bowel movements? Why in the world did He ever create pain?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Pain?” Lieutenant Scheisskopf’s wife pounced upon the word victoriously. “Pain is a useful symptom. Pain is awarning to us of bodily dangers.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“And who created the dangers?” Yossarian demanded. He laughed caustically. “Oh, He was really beingcharitable to us when He gave us pain! Why couldn’t He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of Hiscelestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person’s forehead. Anyjukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn’t He?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“People would certainly look silly walking around with red neon tubes in the middle of their foreheads.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“They certainly look beautiful now writhing in agony or stupefied with morphine, don’t they? What a colossal,immortal blunderer! When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look atthe stupid, ugly little mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. It’s obvious Henever met a payroll. Why, no self-respecting businessman would hire a bungler like Him as even a shippingclerk!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Lieutenant Scheisskopf’s wife had turned ashen in disbelief and was ogling him with alarm. “You’d better nottalk that way about Him, honey,” she warned him reprovingly in a low and hostile voice. “He might punish you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Isn’t He punishing me enough?” Yossarian snorted resentfully. “You know, we mustn’t let Him get away withit. Oh, no, we certainly mustn’t let Him get away scot free for all the sorrow He’s caused us. Someday I’m goingto make Him pay. I know when. On the Judgment Day. Yes, That’s the day I’ll be close enough to reach out andgrab that little yokel by His neck and—“Stop it! Stop it!” Lieutenant Scheisskopf’s wife screamed suddenly, and began beating him ineffectually aboutthe head with both fists. “Stop it!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Yossarian ducked behind his arm for protection while she slammed away at him in feminine fury for a fewseconds, and then he caught her determinedly by the wrists and forced her gently back down on the bed. “Whatthe hell are you getting so upset about?” he asked her bewilderedly in a tone of contrite amusement. “I thoughtyou didn’t believe in God.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I don’t,” she sobbed, bursting violently into tears. “But the God I don’t believe in is a good God, a just God, amerciful God. He’s not the mean and stupid God you make Him out to be.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Yossarian laughed and turned her arms loose. “Let’s have a little more religious freedom between us,” heproposed obligingly. “You don’t believe in the God you want to, and I won’t believe in the God I want to. Is thata deal?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　That was the most illogical Thanksgiving he could ever remember spending, and his thoughts returned wishfullyto his halcyon fourteen-day quarantine in the hospital the year before; but even that idyll had ended on a tragicnote; he was still in good health when the quarantine period was over, and they told him again that he had to getout and go to war. Yossarian sat up in bed when he heard the bad news and shouted.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I see everything twice!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Pandemonium broke loose in the ward again. The specialists came running up from all directions and ringed himin a circle of scrutiny so confining that he could feel the humid breath from their various noses blowinguncomfortably upon the different sectors of his body. They went snooping into his eyes and ears with tiny beamsof light, assaulted his legs and feet with rubber hammers and vibrating forks, drew blood from his veins, heldanything handy up for him to see on the periphery of his vision.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The leader of this team of doctors was a dignified, solicitous gentleman who held one finger up directly in frontof Yossarian and demanded, “How many fingers do you see?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Two,” said Yossarian.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“How many fingers do you see now?” asked the doctor, holding up two.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Two,” said Yossarian.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“And how many now?” asked the doctor, holding up none.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Two,” said Yossarian.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The doctor’s face wreathed with a smile. “By Jove, he’s right,” he declared jubilantly. “He does see everything twice.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They rolled Yossarian away on a stretcher into the room with the other soldier who saw everything twice andquarantined everyone else in the ward for another fourteen days.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I see everything twice!” the soldier who saw everything twice shouted when they rolled Yossarian in.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I see everything twice!” Yossarian shouted back at him just as loudly, with a secret wink.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“The walls! The walls!” the other soldier cried. “Move back the walls!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“The walls! The walls!” Yossarian cried. “Move back the walls!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　One of the doctors pretended to shove the wall back. “Is that far enough?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The soldier who saw everything twice nodded weakly and sank back on his bed. Yossarian nodded weakly too,eying his talented roommate with great humility and admiration. He knew he was in the presence of a master.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　His talented roommate was obviously a person to be studied and emulated. During the night, his talentedroommate died, and Yossarian decided that he had followed him far enough.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I see everything once!” he cried quickly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　A new group of specialists came pounding up to his bedside with their instruments to find out if it was true.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“How many fingers do you see?” asked the leader, holding up one.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“One.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The doctor held up two fingers. “How many fingers do you see now?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“One.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The doctor held up ten fingers. “And how many now?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“One.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The doctor turned to the other doctors with amazement. “He does see everything once!” he exclaimed. “Wemade him all better.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“And just in time, too,” announced the doctor with whom Yossarian next found himself alone, a tall, torpedo-shaped congenial man with an unshaven growth of brown beard and a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket thathe chain-smoked insouciantly as he leaned against the wall. “There are some relatives here to see you. Oh, don’tworry,” he added with a laugh. “Not your relatives. It’s the mother, father and brother of that chap who died.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They’ve traveled all the way from New York to see a dying soldier, and you’re the handiest one we’ve got.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What are you talking about?” Yossarian asked suspiciously. “I’m not dying.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Of course you’re dying. We’re all dying. Where the devil else do you think you’re heading?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“They didn’t come to see me,” Yossarian objected. “They came to see their son.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“They’ll have to take what they can get. As far as we’re concerned, one dying boy is just as good as any other, orjust as bad. To a scientist, all dying boys are equal. I have a proposition for you. You let them come in and lookyou over for a few minutes and I won’t tell anyone you’ve been lying about your liver symptoms.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Yossarian drew back from him farther. “You know about that?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Of course I do. Give us some credit.” The doctor chuckled amiably and lit another cigarette. “How do youexpect anyone to believe you have a liver condition if you keep squeezing the nurses’ tits every time you get achance? You’re going to have to give up sex if you want to convince people you’ve got an ailing liver.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“That’s a hell of a price to pay just to keep alive. Why didn’t you turn me in if you knew I was faking?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Why the devil should I?” asked the doctor with a flicker of surprise. “We’re all in this business of illusiontogether. I’m always willing to lend a helping hand to a fellow conspirator along the road to survival if he’swilling to do the same for me. These people have come a long way, and I’d rather not disappoint them. I’msentimental about old people.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“But they came to see their son.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“They came too late. Maybe they won’t even notice the difference.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Suppose they start crying.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“They probably will start crying. That’s one of the reasons they came. I’ll listen outside the door and break it upif it starts getting tacky.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“It all sounds a bit crazy,” Yossarian reflected. “What do they want to watch their son die for, anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’ve never been able to figure that one out,” the doctor admitted, “but they always do. Well, what do you say?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　All you’ve got to do is lie there a few minutes and die a little. Is that asking so much?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“All right,” Yossarian gave in. “If it’s just for a few minutes and you promise to wait right outside.” He warmedto his role. “Say, why don’t you wrap a bandage around me for effect?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“That sounds like a splendid idea,” applauded the doctor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They wrapped a batch of bandages around Yossarian. A team of medical orderlies installed tan shades on each ofthe two windows and lowered them to douse the room in depressing shadows. Yossarian suggested flowers andthe doctor sent an orderly out to find two small bunches of fading ones with a strong and sickening smell. Wheneverything was in place, they made Yossarian get back into bed and lie down. Then they admitted the visitors.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The visitors entered uncertainly as though they felt they were intruding, tiptoeing in with stares of meek apology,first the grieving mother and father, then the brother, a glowering heavy-set sailor with a deep chest. The manand woman stepped into the room stify side by side as though right out of a familiar, though esoteric, anniversarydaguerreotype on a wall. They were both short, sere and proud. They seemed made of iron and old, darkclothing. The woman had a long, brooding oval face of burnt umber, with coarse graying black hair partedseverely in the middle and combed back austerely behind her neck without curl, wave or ornamentation. Hermouth was sullen and sad, her lined lips compressed. The father stood very rigid and quaint in a double-breastedsuit with padded shoulders that were much too tight for him. He was broad and muscular on a small scale andhad a magnificently curled silver mustache on his crinkled face. His eyes were creased and rheumy, and heappeared tragically ill at ease as he stood awkwardly with the brim of his black felt fedora held in his two brawnylaborer’s hands out in front of his wide lapels. Poverty and hard work had inflicted iniquitous damage on both.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The brother was looking for a fight. His round white cap was cocked at an insolent tilt, his hands were clenched,and he glared at everything in the room with a scowl of injured truculence.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The three creaked forward timidly, holding themselves close to each other in a stealthy, funereal group andinching forward almost in step, until they arrived at the side of the bed and stood staring down at Yossarian.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　There was a gruesome and excruciating silence that threatened to endure forever. Finally Yossarian was unableto bear it any longer and cleared his throat. The old man spoke at last.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“He looks terrible,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“He’s sick, Pa.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Giuseppe,” said the mother, who had seated herself in a chair with her veinous fingers clasped in her lap.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“My name is Yossarian,” Yossarian said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“His name is Yossarian, Ma. Yossarian, don’t you recognize me? I’m your brother John. Don’t you know who Iam?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Sure I do. You’re my brother John.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“He does recognize me! Pa, he knows who I am. Yossarian, here’s Papa. Say hello to Papa.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Hello, Papa,” said Yossarian.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Hello, Giuseppe.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“His name is Yossarian, Pa.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I can’t get over how terrible he looks,” the father said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“He’s very sick, Pa. The doctor says he’s going to die.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I didn’t know whether to believe the doctor or not,” the father said. “You know how crooked those guys are.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Giuseppe,” the mother said again, in a soft, broken chord of muted anguish.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“His name is Yossarian, Ma. She don’t remember things too good any more. How’re they treating you in here,kid? They treating you pretty good?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Pretty good,” Yossarian told him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“That’s good. Just don’t let anybody in here push you around. You’re just as good as anybody else in here eventhough you are Italian. You’ve got rights, too.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Yossarian winced and closed his eyes so that he would not have to look at his brother John. He began to feelsick.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Now see how terrible he looks,” the father observed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Giuseppe,” the mother said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Ma, his name is Yossarian,” the brother interrupted her impatiently. “Can’t you remember?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“It’s all right,” Yossarian interrupted him. “She can call me Giuseppe if she wants to.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Giuseppe,” she said to him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Don’t worry, Yossarian,” the brother said. “Everything is going to be all right.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Don’t worry, Ma,” Yossarian said. “Everything is going to be all right.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Did you have a priest?” the brother wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yes,” Yossarian lied, wincing again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“That’s good,” the brother decided. “Just as long as you’re getting everything you’ve got coming to you. Wecame all the way from New York. We were afraid we wouldn’t get here in time.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“In time for what?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“In time to see you before you died.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What difference would it make?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“We didn’t want you to die by yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What difference would it make?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“He must be getting delirious,” the brother said. “He keeps saying the same thing over and over again.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“That’s really very funny,” the old man replied. “All the time I thought his name was Giuseppe, and now I findout his name is Yossarian. That’s really very funny.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Ma, make him feel good,” the brother urged. “Say something to cheer him up.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Giuseppe.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“It’s not Giuseppe, Ma. It’s Yossarian.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What difference does it make?” the mother answered in the same mourning tone, without looking up. “He’sdying.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her tumid eyes filled with tears and she began to cry, rocking back and forth slowly in her chair with her handslying in her lap like fallen moths. Yossarian was afraid she would start wailing. The father and brother begancrying also. Yossarian remembered suddenly why they were all crying, and he began crying too. A doctorYossarian had never seen before stepped inside the room and told the visitors courteously that they had to go.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The father drew himself up formally to say goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Giuseppe,” he began.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yossarian,” corrected the son.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yossarian,” said the father.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Giuseppe,” corrected Yossarian.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Soon you’re going to die.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Yossarian began to cry again. The doctor threw him a dirty look from the rear of the room, and Yossarian madehimself stop.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The father continued solemnly with his head lowered. “When you talk to the man upstairs,” he said, “I want youto tell Him something for me. Tell Him it ain’t right for people to die when they’re young. I mean it. Tell Him ifthey got to die at all, they got to die when they’re old. I want you to tell Him that. I don’t think He knows it ain’tright, because He’s supposed to be good and it’s been going on for a long, long time. Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“And don’t let anybody up there push you around,” the brother advised. “You’ll be just as good as anybody elsein heaven, even though you are Italian.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Dress warm,” said the mother, who seemed to know.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/651/3656.html","bookId":85,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 3:41:57 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 3:41:57 AM"}
