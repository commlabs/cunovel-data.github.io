What’s mine is yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both sitting now, and Shelby was pouring fresh-squeezed lemonade into an extra glass as if she had been expecting me. The sun was setting and it was growing cooler, but it was still hot enough for a man to sweat even while seated on a porch railing. Bobby and Shelby were both wearing shorts and T-shirts. Bobby’s swore allegiance to the St. Paul Saints minor league baseball team, while Shelby’s featured the logo of Buddy Guy’s Legends, a blues club in Chicago. Bobby had taken her there in the spring while I babysat their two daughters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are the kids?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, Victoria and Katie appeared at a living room window that opened onto the porch just behind their mother’s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“McKenzie,” they called through the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’re my girls?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you bring us something?” they asked in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not this trip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both made disappointed noises, and I said, “Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it because Mom threatened your life last time?” asked Victoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to admit ten pounds of Tootsie Rolls is kind of excessive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It isn’t,” said Katie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom has been doling them out a few at a time for good behavior like we were prisoners in a Russian gulag,” Victoria said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A gulag?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know. Like where they kept Solzhenitsyn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How old are you again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s no fun,” Katie insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom. Gol, McKenzie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother was a lot of fun when I first met her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was young then,” Victoria said. “Now she’s really old.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it,” Shelby announced. “The spankings will now commence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh puhleez, mother,” Victoria said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelby’s eyes bore down hard on her daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictoria said, “I think I’ll go upstairs and read.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good idea,” Shelby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good night, all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictoria left the window. Katie followed her deep into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelby sighed significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Victoria’s almost a teenager,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you just love that?” Bobby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you ever spanked your children?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The threat of violence is usually sufficient, and when it’s not, Bobby pulls his gun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby held up his hand, three fingers curled into his palm, his index finger extended, his thumb back, and made a clicking noise with his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can see how that might keep order.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, McKenzie,” Bobby said. “I heard you were arrested the other day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Taken into custody, but not booked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Important difference.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You heard this—how?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had a conversation with an Anoka cop named Jerry Moorhead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No kidding. Why’d he call you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t. He knew a guy in the department. Moorhead asked about you, the officer knew we were tight, so I got the call. He was impressed that you had a friend who was a lieutenant in homicide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t we all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was also impressed when I told him what a sterling example of law enforcement you were until you decided to take the price for Teach-well and live a life of undeserved luxury.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean, undeserved?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wants to arrange a sit-down, Mac. Buy you a few drinks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what he said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The man made a mistake, he wants to apologize. What’s the big deal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does he want to apologize because he was wrong or because he wants to get me out of his hair?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The woman Moorhead’s deputy slapped around, they’re trying to jam her up on what looks like a bogus murder charge. I told her lawyer that I’d look into it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahh geez,” said Shelby. “Not again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you always get involved in these things?” she asked me. “If you’re bored, go shopping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’d had this conversation before, and truth be told, I always came off looking silly defending myself. I decided to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides, is Moorhead going to call Nina, apologize to her? I was supposed to take her to that damn charity ball the other night, but I couldn’t because I was in jail, so she went with some other guy and guess what? They have a date tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A date?” said Shelby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They went to dinner, la-de-da.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was over there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At Nina’s?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. At Rickie’s. He picked her up at her place of business, do you believe that? Didn’t even have the courtesy to call for her at home. The jerk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know he’s a jerk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s an architect. He wears glasses. His name is Daniel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds like a jerk to me,” said Bobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he wasn’t a nice guy, Nina wouldn’t date him,” said Shelby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I don’t know. She dates McKenzie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Way to stick up for me, Bobby,” I said. “You’re a real pal.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4/page-17.html","bookId":2222,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM"}
