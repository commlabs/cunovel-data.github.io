You\u0027re packed with the kind of useless material a rodent would admire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime for one small lesson, thought Coogan. He said, \"The pack rat, also known as the trade rat, was a rodent indigenous to this planet. It\u0027s now extinct here, but there are examples on Markeb IX and several of the Ring planets. The pack rat lived in forest land and was known for his habit of stealing small things from hunters\u0027 camps. For everything it took, the pack rat left an item from its nest, a bit of twine, a twig, a shiny piece of glass, a rock. In all of that useless material which cluttered its nest there might be one nugget of a precious metal. Since the pack rat showed no selection in its trading -- was random, so to speak -- it might leave the precious metal in a hunter\u0027s camp in exchange for a bottle top.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak got to his feet, walked across the room to the zoologist\u0027s image, passed a hand through the projection. \"Remarkable,\" he said, sarcasm filling his voice. \"This is supposed to be a nugget?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More likely a twig,\" said Coogan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak turned back, faced Coogan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else do you hide in this rat\u0027s nest? Any nuggets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan looked down at Patterson on the floor. There was a stillness about the thin old figure. \"First, may I have a hospital robot attend to Mr. Patterson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe general kept his eyes on Coogan. \"No. Answer my request.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst rule of the Code -- obey, thought Coogan. With a slow, controlled movement, he shifted a lever on the box at his belt. The Procyon zoologist vanished and the wall became a screen showing a page of a book. Here\u0027s the bait, thought Coogan, and I hope it poisons you. He said, \"This is an early account of military tactics showing some methods that succeeded and others that failed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak turned to the screen, put his hands behind him, rocked back and forth on heels and toes. \"What language?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ancient English of Terra,\" said Coogan. \"We have a scanner that\u0027ll give you an oral translation if you\u0027d like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe general kept his eyes on the screen. \"How do I know this account is accurate?\" \"The Library Code does not permit tampering with records,\" said Coogan. \"Our oath is to preserve the present for the future.\" He glanced at Pchak, back to the screen. \"We have other battle records, the tactics of every species encountered by humans. For example, we have the entire war history of the Praemir of Roman II.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan shifted his belt controls and the screen took up a history of warfare which had been assembled for a general sixteen centuries dead. Pchak watched as the record went from clubs and rocks to spears and made a side journey into bizarre weapons. Suddenly, Coogan blanked the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak\u0027s head snapped up. \"Why did you stop that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooked him, thought Coogan. He said, \"I thought you might rather view this at your leisure. If you wish, I\u0027ll set up a viewing room and show you how to order the records when there are side issues you\u0027d like to study.\" Coogan held his breath. Now we learn if he\u0027s really caught, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe general continued to study the blank screen. \"I have orders to make a thorough investigation,\" he said. \"I believe this comes under the category of investigation. Have your viewing room prepared.\" He turned, went to the door, followed by his guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s down on the sixty-ninth level,\" said Coogan. \"Viewing room A.\" He started toward Pchak. \"I\u0027ll get you all set up and --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will remain here,\" said Pchak. \"We will use Viewing Room B, instead. Send an assistant to explain things.\" He glanced back. \"You do have an assistant, do you not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll send Toris Sil-Chan,\" said Coogan and then remembered what Patterson had said about Toris leading the hotheads who wanted to do battle. He would have bitten off his tongue to retract the words, but knew he dared not change now or it would arouse Pchak\u0027s suspicions. He returned to the desk, had central-routing find Toris and send him to the viewing room. Please don\u0027t do anything rash, he prayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this assistant your successor?\" asked Pchak, looking down at Patterson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Coogan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must appoint a successor,\" said Pchak and left with his two guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan immediately summoned a hospital robot for Patterson. The scarab shape came in on silent wheels, lifted the still form on its flat pad extensors and departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunset rain was drifting along its longitudinal mark on Terra, spattering a shallow sea, dewing the grasslands, filling the cups of flowers. One wall screen of the director\u0027s office was activated to show this surface scene -- a white village in the rain, flutterings of trees. Surface copters whirred across the village, their metal gleaming in the wetness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan, his thin face wearing a look of weariness, sat at the director\u0027s desk, hands clasped in front of him. Occasionally, he glanced at the wall screen. The spire of a government star ship -- tall alabaster with a sunburst insignia on its bow -- could be seen beyond the village. Coogan sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chime sounded behind him. He turned to the control panel wall, depressed a button, spoke into a microphone. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice like wire scraped across a tin plate came out of the speaker. \"This is the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Coogan\u0027s voice showed irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Director Patterson was dead upon arrival here,\" said the wire-scraping voice. \"The robots already have disposed of his body through the GIB orifice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say anything about it yet,\" said Coogan. He removed his hand from the switch, turned back to the desk. His desk now. Director Coogan. The thought gave him no satisfaction. He kept remembering a still form sprawled on the floor. A terrible way to go, he thought. A Librarian should end at his researches, just quietly topple over in the stacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desk visor chimed. Coogan hit the palm switch and Pchak\u0027s face appeared on the screen. The general was breathing rapidly, beads of sweat on his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I help you?\" asked Coogan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I get the condemned instruction records for the Zosma language?\" demanded Pchak. \"Your machine keeps referring me to some nonsense about abstract symbolism.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door of Coogan\u0027s office opened and Sil-Chan entered, saw that a caller was on the screen, stopped just inside the door. Sil-Chan was a blocky figure who achieved fat without looking soft. His round face was dominated by upswept almond eyes characteristic of the inhabitants of the Mundial Group planets of Ruchbah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan shook his head at Sil-Chan, his mind searching through memories for an answer to Pchak\u0027s question. It came to him, tagged semantics study. \"Zosma,\" he said. \"Yes, that was a language which dealt only in secondary referents. Each phrase was two times removed from --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in Shandu is a secondary referent?\" exploded Pchak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalmly, thought Coogan. I can\u0027t afford to precipitate action yet. He said, \"Ask for the section on semantics. Did Mr. Sil-Chan show you how to get the records you need?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes,\" said Pchak. \"Semantics, eh?\" The screen went blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan closed the door, came across the office. \"I would imagine,\" he said, \"that the general is under the impression his researches will be completed in a week or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it would seem,\" said Coogan. He studied Sil-Chan. The man didn\u0027t look like a hothead, but perhaps it had taken this threat to the Library to set him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan took a chair across from Coogan. \"The general is a low alley dog,\" he said, \"but he believes in this Leader Adams. The gleam in his eyes when he talks about Adams would frighten a saint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was it down in the viewing room?\" asked Coogan. \"Pchak is busy studying destruction,\" said Sil-Chan. \"We haven\u0027t made up our minds yet whether to exterminate him. Where\u0027s Director Patterson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sixth sense warned Coogan not to reveal that the director was dead. He said, \"He isn\u0027t here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fairly obvious,\" said Sil-Chan. \"I have an ultimatum to deliver to the director. Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can deliver your ultimatum to me,\" said Coogan dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan\u0027s eyes showed little glints deep in the pupils as he stared at Coogan. \"Vince, we\u0027ve been friends a long time,\" he said, \"but you\u0027ve been away in the Hesperides Group and don\u0027t know what\u0027s been going on here. Don\u0027t take sides yet.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/direct-descent/page-3.html","bookId":1571,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:50:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:50:33 PM"}
