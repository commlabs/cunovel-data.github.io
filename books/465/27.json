STANDISH STATES HIS BUSINESS.","content":"\u0026nbsp;As Mr. Standish spoke, he slipped into the room adroitly, closed the door again, and locked it. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He looked about for a seat, and discovered a rocking-chair, which, like the chair Gerald occupied, appeared to be suffering from infirmity and old age.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Glad to see you again, Gerald!” he said urbanely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. Standish, are you responsible for this outrage?” demanded Gerald angrily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For what outrage, my dear young friend?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Did you send that boy to lure me in here?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That boy is my promising nephew, Tip Standish.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am not surprised to hear it. Was he acting under your orders?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You’ve hit it, my dear boy. He was acting under my orders, and I am proud to say that he did himself credit.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [213]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He told me a story about being in danger of a beating from his mother.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Standish laughed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “His mother is a poor weak woman weighing about ninety pounds. She isn’t strong enough to harm a fly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In other words the boy lied.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Tip has remarkable inventive powers. He may make a story-writer in time.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am quite sure he doesn’t excel you—in invention, Mr. Standish.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, dear boy. It is pleasant to be appreciated. You do me proud, you really do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Never mind compliments, Mr. Standish. Of course you had some object in luring me here. What is it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I admire the quickness with which you come to business. Really you are a very smart boy.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “With all my smartness I have fallen into a trap. Now, what do you want?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps you might have some idea—can’t you now?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can think of nothing except money. I suppose you want to rob me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My dear boy!” protested Standish, “you misjudge me. What, Samuel Standish a common thief? I am indeed mortified. I was not aware[214] that you carried a large sum of money with you,” he added, not without curiosity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t,” answered Gerald. “I have only fifteen dollars in my pocketbook.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Samuel Standish in spite of his disclaimer looked somewhat disappointed, but he kept up appearances.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Keep the money, my boy!” he said with a wave of the hand. “Keep the money! Heaven forbid that I should deprive you of it. Samuel Standish is a man of honor.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gerald gazed at him with increasing bewilderment. He had not expected such a display of honesty. Moreover, if Standish did not want money, what did he want? What could be his object in trapping him?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I have done you injustice, Mr. Standish, I apologize,” he said. “I supposed it must be money you wanted, for I could think of nothing else. Of course in confining me you are committing an illegal act. If you will release me at once I will overlook what has already passed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are a smart boy, Gerald,” said Samuel Standish jocosely. “You ought to have been a lawyer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you for the compliment.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, you are quite welcome, I am sure.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Samuel Standish leaned forward and said: “I want some papers that you are carrying about with you.”—Page 215.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [215]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I must trouble you to release me at once, as Mr. Brooke expects me back at the hotel. We had arranged to take an excursion.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shouldn’t like to interfere with any little arrangement you have made. Gerald, I am your friend, though you may not think it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, your treatment of me this morning doesn’t seem like it. Is it your custom to trap and kidnap those to whom you are friendly?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Standish laughed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not in general,” he answered, “but I wanted an interview with you for special reasons.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It was not necessary to kidnap me in order to obtain it. If you had requested an interview I would have granted it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, perhaps so, but I wanted to make sure. I wanted an interview somewhere where we were not likely to be interrupted.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “As you have your wish, will you please come to business, and let me know what you want of me?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Samuel Standish leaned forward and said significantly, “I want some papers that you are carrying about with you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2947/81002.html","bookId":465,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:29:59 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:29:59 AM"}
