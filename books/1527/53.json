The blast took out the point man, and the survivors retreated from the shattered gap in the glass staircase. They were trapped with no other way up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry, fellas. You started this war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued her maddening flight up the steps. After a few more turns, she heard screams rise from below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe used their cries to judge the distance to that drowning flood. Either the waters were rising faster, or their pace was slowing. Whichever the case, they were losing this footrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next level!” she shouted to Tucker. “Take that one. Find the shortest path to the outer windows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching that floor, Seichan raced after the handler and his dog, a silent prayer on her lips. Tucker turned into a long hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Over here!” he yelled. “A balcony at the end!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shoot out the lock!” Seichan hollered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey needed every second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sprinted, trailed by Kowalski. To the man’s credit, he kept up, even burdened by Amanda’s weight. He was a veritable draft horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunshots blasted ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached Tucker and Kane as the man hauled open the sliding glass door. A wide balcony beckoned. They all fled out onto it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan moved to the rail. The rising water churned one floor down. If they had to jump, she feared two things. If they didn’t leap far enough, the undertow caused by the plunging tower would drag them all down. And even if they cleared that danger, these rough seas had sharks—and not only the ones with fins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA patrol boat drifted to the right, not far from the park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would never be able to swim fast enough to escape it, and their splashes would likely draw the crew’s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan searched the drowning city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere are you, Gray?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:35 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC’mon, c’mon …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning out of air, Gray blindly sawed at the nylon strap with his knife. It had taken him too long to find the boat as it hung in the dark depths, still tethered to the trailer. The positive buoyancy of the vessel had locked the tie-downs tight. There was no unclipping them from their bolts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d already cut the straps at the bow. Once free, the boat’s nose rose toward the surface, hanging vertical, still anchored at the stern. Keeping one hand on the transom, he worked at that rear strap of the tie-down. Pressure built in his ears as the island sank deeper, dragging him and the boat farther underwater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his air began to give out, he sawed frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubborn piece of—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA light flared overhead, brightening the waters. A dark shadow idled into view on the surface, limned against the glow of its own lamps and accompanied by the slow putter of its engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray waited, despite the screaming burn in his lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the shadow was directly overhead, Gray cut through the last of the tie-downs. Freed, the jet boat torpedoed upward, becoming a buoyancy-propelled battering ram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:36 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan watched the speedboat drift closer, coming within fifty yards of the tower. One of the crew shouted; another pointed a rifle. Her team had been spotted. A blast echoed over the water. The round ricocheted off the balcony railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan ducked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and the others were too exposed on the balcony, but where could they go? The waters roaring up the side of the tower promised only a quick death by drowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took potshots back at the boat—then an antediluvian monster blasted out of the sea and rammed into the edge of the speedboat. The force cracked the hull and flipped the boat, tossing the crew out of their seats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, the monster settled to its carbon-fiber keel, resting on the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the yellow jet boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray popped up beside it. He had his SIG Sauer in hand and fired at the floundering men, hitting three of them. The fourth already floated facedown. Nearby, the cracked hull of the speedboat flooded and sank into the depths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gray!” Seichan shouted and waved an arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to face her—just as a second speedboat flew around the tower to the left, drawn by the gunfire. It raced under the balcony, spraying machine-gun fire up at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all flattened, but Seichan knew they weren’t the assault’s true target. The patrol was only knocking them back to pass beneath them and go after easier prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMove it, Gray!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:37 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray hauled himself over the side of the jet boat and sprawled flat on the deck, making himself a harder target. The second speedboat came shooting around the curve of the Burj Abaadi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunfire shattered the marble off the balcony façade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teammates ducked away—except for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the boat sailed under the sinking balcony, a sleek shape vaulted into view, back paws kicking off the railing for extra distance. Kane flew across the short gap and landed in the midst of the four patrolmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe effect was the same as if a grenade had been tossed into the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne man flung himself overboard in fright and got chewed up by the frothing riptide of the sinking tower. Kane latched onto the throat of another. The driver screamed, yanked the wheel, and, in a panic, drove the boat at full speed into an uprooted, floating palm tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat hit the thick trunk, shot into the air, and flipped upside down before crashing hard into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBodies floated up seconds later, lifeless or unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only survivor proved his skill at dog-paddling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore that deadly collision, a sharp whistle from Tucker had sent Kane leaping from the boat, tail high. The dog landed safely in the calmer water, but the currents were pulling him back toward the churning tide at the base of the tower. Kane fought against it, burdened by his vest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, you don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray lunged into the captain’s chair of the jet boat. He searched and found the key in the glove box and started the ignition. He feared the depths might have damaged the engine, but he also knew jet boats were built for such abuse. As he hoped, a choking burble, a spat of water from the stern jets, and the engine roared lustily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted the throttle and shot toward where Kane struggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHang on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding next to the dog, Gray lunged out and grabbed Kane by his waterproof vest. He struggled to get the sodden, sixty-pound dog into the boat. Recognizing it would take both arms, he let go of the wheel. Unpiloted, the craft got pulled closer to the tower. The churning water growled hungrily, the undertow sucking everything down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, with a heave of his body, he hauled Kane aboard. The shepherd shook his heavy pelt, tail wagging, and bumped him affectionately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks!” Tucker called over to Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, what about us?” Kowalski complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now, water flooded the lower deck of their balcony, churning hungrily. Gray’s three teammates clung to the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManning the wheel again, Gray opened the throttle and gunned his way over to the balcony. He brought the boat alongside them and worked the throttle to hold the craft steady. They climbed over the balcony and dropped on board. Tucker helped Kowalski with Amanda. She stirred enough to lift an arm and swat at the bigger of the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski pushed her arm down. “Sheesh. That’s the thanks I get for hauling your butt up ten flights of stairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith everyone settled, Gray swung away from the sinking tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jet boat was only a four-seater. With six on board, counting Kane, the boat drafted deeper than it should, making it sluggish and slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they were afloat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same could not be said for Utopia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe currents shifted under the boat, dragging the craft strongly to port. Gray corrected against that pull—but it only grew worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pierce!” Kowalski hollered, drawing his attention away from the currents to the skies above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe craned his neck in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tower of the Burj Abaadi leaned precariously over the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray searched outward. Across the rest of the island, towers and spires all canted in the same direction, as if blown over by a stiff wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, hell …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan recognized the danger, too. “The island is tipping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray jammed the throttle forward, picturing the island capsizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey needed to get to open water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff in the distance, a spire broke from its foundation. It toppled and slowly crashed into a neighboring building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloser at hand, a mighty moan vibrated through the waters. It was the deep groan of concrete and steel under stress. No one doubted the source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes turned to the Burj Abaadi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:40 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed the Eternal Tower was not living up to its name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAboard a large patrol boat, Edward bore witness to the island’s slow destruction. A quarter-mile away, Utopia upended, breaking apart, sliding back into the sea, a modern Atlantis. At its center, the Burj Abaadi toppled, the upper levels breaking and sliding off the central axis, like plates toppling from a tall stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWord had reached him that the patrols sent to the tower had gone missing. Attempts to raise them on the radio had failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be the work of the group that attacked the base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeasures would have to be taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not without guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetra stepped through a nearby hatch, carrying a satellite phone in her hand. Her eyes locked with his, warning him it wasn’t good news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held out the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted it to his ear and heard the computerized voice greet him. “IS THE CHILD SECURED?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“AND THE MOTHER?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely she had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“THEN COORDINATE ALL FORCES ON-SITE, ESTABLISH A NOOSE AROUND THAT ISLAND. HUNT FOR THOSE WHO ASSAULTED THE STATION.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if they’re found?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was given very specific instructions, ending with, “PETRA WILL TAKE MATTERS IN HAND FROM THERE. SHE KNOWS WHAT IS NEEDED.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed hard, feeling demoted—but he dared not complain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the end, maybe it was better not to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 3, 4:44 A.M.
