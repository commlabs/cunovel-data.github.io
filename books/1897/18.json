You were going apeshit over the stupidest things, like, oh my God, we missed the beat. We\u0027ll get it. We always do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t having a brain aneur-an-any--\" She laughs. I want to kill her. \"Thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Chris is worried about you,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groan. \"Shut up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He actually came to me; that\u0027s how worried he is. He\u0027s afraid to talk to you. He thinks you\u0027re fixing for a breakdown because you\u0027re, like, obsessed with perfection.\" She says this as breezily as someone relating the weather. And then: \"So I told him about the panic attacks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart stops. \"You didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leans over me. Her face blots out the sky, and a strand of long blond hair hangs in front of my face, tickling my nose. I turn my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the end of the year, Parker. Things are supposed to be winding down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe makes me tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give Becky captaining duties until the year\u0027s over,\" she continues. \"She\u0027s always wanted to do it and you can let her and say you did something nice. I\u0027ve talked to the squad; they said if you do that, they\u0027ll want you back next year--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sobers me up completely for about five seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Are you out of your mind? Becky will do the loser cheer and we\u0027ll be a laughingstock--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter! Everyone hates you right now. You\u0027re an analretentive control-freak perfectionist and they need a break and so do you. And so do I--I can\u0027t do damage control for you anymore!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They only hate me until they give the best performance of their lives thanks to me and then they love me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true and you know it,\" I mutter. Everything spins and I close my eyes. \"I\u0027m that good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and the sooner you make a mistake and learn to live with it or let them make mistakes and learn to live with it, the better. Until that actually happens, I really think you\u0027re going to give yourself a stroke. You\u0027re not responsible for everything, Parker. You can\u0027t control the way things end up. Stop trying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it\u0027s my fault either way. Me, them. Everyone knows I do everything, so if they fuck up, it\u0027s my fault, and if I fuck up, it\u0027s my fault and--\" I can barely think the words before I say them and start losing my thread. \"The way it is, that\u0027s good. I\u0027m a good person because it\u0027s the outcome that matters and I always do things that are right in the end--and that\u0027s how you get away with being a control-freak perfectionist, because in the end you\u0027re right... and there\u0027s no excuse for anything less. I am not going easy on them--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting Chris. You are so wasted it\u0027s unbelievable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she\u0027s right, but only about that. I\u0027m right about everything else. A second later, I feel her brushing a strand of hair from my face. I push her hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go, please...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Parker, I\u0027m telling you this as your best friend. You\u0027re freaking everyone out. If you don\u0027t step down, I\u0027m going to do everything I can to get you off the squad for your own sake, and Chris has agreed to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes everything, but I push myself up from the ground and pitch forward. Jessie grabs me by the elbow and helps me regain my balance, but I don\u0027t want her help. I jerk my arm from her grip and fumble sideways, reach out, rest one hand against the side of the house and wait for the world to right itself. This is cheerleading. Serious business. My reputation\u0027s on the line and, and, and they know... they know I\u0027m not--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you went behind my back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evan\u0027s cheating on you with Jenny Morse. They\u0027re fucking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slide down the side of the house until I\u0027m sitting. Jessie looks like she\u0027s underwater, wavery, discombobulated, but I can still make out her expression: openmouthed, white-faced, hurt. I didn\u0027t want to tell her like this, but she deserves it. She shakes her head, totally shocked, and marches past me so she can break up with Evan, give him hell, ask him if it\u0027s true, whatever. I don\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m only telling you this as your best friend,\" I call after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice comes as a total surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe if I stay really, really still she\u0027ll go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker, I know you\u0027re there. I can see your feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heave a colossal sigh and sit upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is unexpected, Becky,\" I say. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe marches up the aisle in an annoyingly self-assured way, a brown paper bag clutched in one hand, and sits beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chris has been going crazy trying to talk to you, but he said you\u0027re avoiding him. So I said I\u0027d talk to you because I know you won\u0027t avoid me. And we should probably talk, shouldn\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about cheerleading practice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. \"Postponed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never postponed for anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So self-sacrificing,\" I sneer. \"I bet it really turns Chris on. I bet he\u0027s thinking it won\u0027t be so bad being your boyfriend after all. Actually, I know he\u0027s thinking it. And so do you. That\u0027s the only reason you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inclines her head, like we\u0027re playing chess and I made the first move and it wasn\u0027t a bad one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really wanted to start over with you after everything happened. I thought it was possible.\" She stares at the wooden cross mounted to the wall. \"For about five minutes, I almost felt like there was this mutual respect thing going on...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. \"While you were wasting time feeling things, I was stealing your Beowulf essay and passing it off as my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clenches her jaw. \"At least after I saw Evan I didn\u0027t lose it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m disappointed. That\u0027s the best you can do?\" \"Yeah, it is.\" Becky nods. And then she nods again, like she really means it. \"You know who feels sorry for you? Chris. That\u0027s pathetic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it is pathetic that he\u0027s still in love with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolls her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you feel sorry for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s one of those questions I ask before considering whether or not I really care about the answer. Who am I kidding? It\u0027s Becky. Of course I don\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve made a choice and it\u0027s so obvious. I see it; I accept it,\" she says. \"Even if no one else can. You want to rot and I want to let you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I was feeling generous, I\u0027d congratulate her. The only person standing in the way of ultimate popularity--me--had stepped aside and she snapped up the position before anyone else even realized it was available. She probably watched me all year, waiting to see how my calculated fuckups could benefit her, and figured out my motivations in the process. That takes talent. She\u0027ll make a great sorority sister after she gets out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who would\u0027ve thought that you of all people would be smart enough to get me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, weird, huh?\" She hands me the bag. \"Consider that my contribution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peer inside of it. \"Becky, if I\u0027m drunk in school again, I\u0027m expelled. I still want to graduate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really?\" She stands and stretches. \"I\u0027d better go. Chris is waiting for me. Is there anything you want me to tell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing I wouldn\u0027t tell him myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heads back down the aisle and I stretch back out on the pew, holding the paper bag to my chest, the bottle of Jack heavy inside it. The door creaks as Becky opens it and I wait for the click, the noise that tells me it\u0027s closed and I\u0027m alone again, but it doesn\u0027t come. And then, her voice:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, it\u0027s not any harder on you than it was for the rest of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... what are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it look like I\u0027m doing?\" I ask, settling into the seat beside Jake. The driver shifts gears, the bus shakes and our shoulders bump. \"I\u0027m sitting beside you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re not. Your seat is at the front,\" he says. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I\u0027m so flattered. \"Nice try, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s weird sitting in the middle of the bus, but it\u0027s my peace offering to Jake for flaking out on him since the kiss. By \"flaking out\" I mean I may or may not be avoiding him or pretending to be deaf when he talks to me, unless it\u0027s something to do with our art project, and then I pretend to be hearing delayed and wait, like, five minutes before responding, which I decided last night wasn\u0027t very nice of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not moving,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evan--\" He clears his throat. \"Evan is Chris\u0027s best friend. He left before senior year because he had a breakdown or something. Chris told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good, Jake,\" I say, nodding slowly. \"And can you tell me why he had a nervous breakdown?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you can\u0027t tell me that, you can at least tell me what any of it has to do with me,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chris said he\u0027d tell me what everybody already knows,\" he says. There\u0027s an ungodly pause because we both know what\u0027s coming next. \"You did try to kill yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right.\" He doesn\u0027t believe me. \"That\u0027s why you meet with Grey, isn\u0027t it? And that\u0027s why no one leaves you alone and you\u0027re not popular anymore and Evan fits in there somehow. That\u0027s your big secret, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations, you figured it out. So how `bout them Mets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinks. \"What?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-18.html","bookId":1897,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM"}
