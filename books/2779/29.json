I guess we\u0027re about to finally see what a Michigan Winter really looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to face Javi. I was about to ask him something about snow tires, or plows but it slips my mind as soon as his hands grasp my face and his tongue makes its\u0027 way into my mouth. I turn my face and push against his chest with my hands. When he feels my resistance his face backs away from mine, but his body is still pressed against me, pushing me against the cold metal of his truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he smiles. \"I thought you wanted me to kiss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Javi.\" I\u0027m still pushing against him with my hands but he doesn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" he says with a smug grin on his face. \"You didn\u0027t leave your keys inside. You want this.\" His mouth encircles mine again and my pulse starts to race against my chest. It\u0027s not the same reaction I get when Will makes my pulse race. This time it\u0027s more like fight or flight mode. I try to scream at him, but his hands are pulling my face into his so hard that I can\u0027t catch a breath. I try to move but he\u0027s using his body to pin me against his truck, making it virtually impossible for me to break free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes. Think, Layken. Think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I\u0027m about to bite down on his lip, Javi pulls away from me. But he keeps going backward. Someone is dragging him away from me. He falls to the ground and Will straddles him, grabs hold of his shirt and sends a blow straight to Javi\u0027s jaw. Javi falls back to the ground but turns over and pushes off against it, causing Will to stumble backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" I scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill is knocked to the ground when Javi returns the punch. I\u0027m afraid Javi is going to hit him again, so I throw myself between them just as Javi swings a punch intended for Will-straight into my back. I fall forward and land on Will. I try to catch a breath, but I have none. I can\u0027t inhale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lake,\" Will says as he rolls me onto the ground next to him. His worry is fleeting, however, as rage fills his eyes. He grabs the door handle of the car next to us and starts to pull himself up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean to hit you,\" Javi says as he walks toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m on the ground so I don\u0027t see what happens next, but I hear a smack and I can see Javi\u0027s feet are no longer planted on the ground. I look up just as Will leans over Javi and delivers another punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will, get off him!\" Gavin yells. Gavin is pulling Will back and they both fall to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie rushes to my side and pulls me upright. \"Layken, what happened?\" She has her arms around me and I\u0027m clutching my chest. I know I was hit in the back, but it feels like my lungs are concrete. I\u0027m gasping for air, but I can\u0027t answer her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill rustles out of Gavin\u0027s grip and stands up. He walks to me and takes my hand as Eddie scoots out of his way. He pulls me up and puts my arm around his shoulder, wraps his other arm around my waist and starts walking me forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking you home,\" is all he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Eddie yells as she circles to the front of us. \"I found your purse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach out and take it from her and attempt to smile. Her hand goes up to her ear in the shape of a phone and she mouths \u0027call me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill assists me into his car as I gently lean back against the seat. My lungs have refilled with air, but every breath I take feels like I\u0027ve got a knife protruding from my back. I close my eyes and focus on inhaling and exhaling through my nose as we drive away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither one of us speaks. Me, because I can\u0027t. Will because-I don\u0027t know why. We drive in silence until we\u0027re almost to the Ypsilanti city limits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill jerks the car to the side of the road and throws it in park. He punches the steering wheel before he gets out of the car and slams the door. His figure is illuminated by the headlights of the car as he walks away from the vehicle, sporadically kicking at the ground and cursing obscenities. He finally stops and I watch as he stands loosely with his hands on his hips. His head is leaned back and he\u0027s looking at the sky, letting the snow fall on his face. He stands like this for a while until he makes his way back to the car, sits down, and calmly shuts his door. He puts the car into gear and we continue to drive in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m able to walk, my breathing has returned to normal, and the knife in my back feels more like a lump now. Regardless, he still assists me as we walk into his house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lay down on the couch, I\u0027ll get some ice,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do as he says. I ease myself stomach first onto the couch and close my eyes, wondering what in the world just happened to tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel his hand on the couch as he kneels down next to me. \"Will!\" I gasp as I open my eyes and actually see his face. \"Your eye.\" There\u0027s a trail of blood running down his neck from a gash above his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine. I\u0027ll be fine,\" he says as he leans over me. \"Do you mind?\" he asks as his hands grasp the bottom of my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls my shirt up over my back and I feel something cold compress against my skin. He places the ice pack on top of the injury. He stands and opens the front door, shutting it behind him as he leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left. He just left without saying a word. I lay there for a few more minutes, expecting him to return right away, but he doesn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll onto my side and let the pack of ice fall onto the couch. I ease my shirt back down and prepare myself to stand up just as the door bursts open and my mother runs in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lake? Sweetie, are you okay?\" She throws her arms around me. Will walks in behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom,\" I say weakly as I return her hug and cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine Mom, really,\" I say as she\u0027s tucking me into my bed, asking me how my back feels for the one hundredth time in the ten minutes that I\u0027ve been home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles and strokes my hair. That\u0027s what I\u0027m going to miss the most about her. The way she strokes my hair as she looks at me with so much love in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will says you got hit in the back. Who hit you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince as I try to push myself up against my pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Javi. He\u0027s in my class. He was trying to punch Will but I got in the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why was he trying to punch Will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Will punched him. Javi walked me to my jeep when I left the club. He thought I wanted him to kiss me. I was trying to push him off of me-I couldn\u0027t get him to stop. The next thing I know Will\u0027s on top of him, punching him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s awful, Lake. I\u0027m so sorry,\" she says as she leans forward and kisses my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine, Mom. I\u0027m fine. I just need some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strokes my head again before she stands up and flicks the lights off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Will? What\u0027s he going to do?\" she asks before she closes the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I reply. Because at first, I think her question is referring to what he\u0027s going to do about Javi. But after she shuts the door, I realize she\u0027s asking what he\u0027s going to do about his job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie awake for hours after that, dissecting the situation. We weren\u0027t on school grounds. He was defending me. Maybe Javi won\u0027t say anything. Will did throw the first punch, though. And the third. And the fourth. And probably would have thrown the fifth if Gavin wouldn\u0027t have walked up when he did. I try to recall every small detail of the entire night, in case I\u0027m asked to defend his actions tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, I wake up to find Caulder in my kitchen with Kel eating cereal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey. My brother can\u0027t take us today. Says he has something he has to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does he have to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaulder shrugs. \"I dunno. He brought your jeep home this morning. Then he left again.\" A spoonful of fruit loops goes into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can barely sit through my first two classes. Eddie and I spend second period writing notes back and forth. I told her everything that happened last night. Everything except for Will\u0027s poem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I\u0027m floating as we walk to third period. Almost like in my dreams when I\u0027m hovering above myself, watching myself walk. I feel like I\u0027m not in control of my actions, I\u0027m just observing them as they are carried out. Eddie opens the door and walks in first. I follow slowly behind her as I make my way through the classroom door. Will isn\u0027t here yet. Neither is Javi. I inhale as I take my seat. The bustling of the conversation among the other classmates is briefly interrupted by a crackling over the intercom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Layken Cohen, please report to administration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately swing around and look at Eddie. She gives me a half-hearted smile and a thumbs up. She\u0027s just as nervous as I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are several people in the office when I walk in. I recognize the principal, Mr. Murphy, speaking with two men I don\u0027t recognize. When he notices me walk in, he nods and motions for me to follow him through the door. When I enter the room, Will is seated with his arms folded at the table. He doesn\u0027t look up at me. This doesn\u0027t look good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Cohen, please take a seat,\" Mr. Murphy says to me as he seats himself at the other head, opposite Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choose the chair closest to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Mr. Chorizo, Javier\u0027s father,\" says Mr. Murphy, motioning toward the man I didn\u0027t recognize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Chorizo is sitting across from me. He stands slightly and reaches across the table and shakes my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Officer Venturelli,\" he says of the other man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe follows suit and leans across the table, shaking my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you know why you\u0027re here. It is our understanding that there was an incident involving Mr. Cooper that occurred off of school grounds,\" he says, pausing in case I need to object. I don\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would appreciate it if you could tell us your version of events.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance toward Will and he gives me an ever so slight nod, letting me know he wants me to tell the truth. So I do. For fifteen minutes I explain in honest detail everything that happened last night. Everything except for Will\u0027s poem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027m finished with the details and the questions have all been asked, I’m released to return to class. As I get up to leave, Mr. Chorizo calls after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Cohen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to say I\u0027m sorry. I apologize for my son\u0027s behavior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I say. I turn and make my way back to the classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA substitute is filling in for Will. She\u0027s an older lady who I\u0027ve seen in the halls before, so she must also be a teacher here. I quietly take my seat. I can\u0027t think about anything other than Will, and if I\u0027m about to be the reason he loses his job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the bell rings, the class begins to file out and I turn to Eddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tell her what happened, and that I still don\u0027t know anything. I linger outside the classroom door for a while, waiting for Will to return but he never does. During fourth period, I realize I\u0027m not in the state of mind to learn anything, so I give myself the rest of the day off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turn onto our street, Will\u0027s car is in his driveway. I pull my jeep up to the curb and don\u0027t even bother pulling into the driveway. I throw it in park and quickly run across the street. As soon as I\u0027m about to knock on the door, it swings open and Will is standing there with his satchel slung across his shoulder and his jacket on. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slammed-slammed-1/page-29.html","bookId":2779,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:11 PM"}
