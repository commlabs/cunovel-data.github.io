It tum.bled and pitched, and oneof the I-beams solidly welded to the hull bucked and snapped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Spartans of Blue Team were strapped to the hull in quick-release harnesses. No one,however, gave any thought to the red quick-release button in the center of their chests.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were all hanging on for their lives.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The forward monitor was black because there was nothing for them to see in Slipspace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The only light inside the dropship came from chemical light sticks activated and tossedinside before they departed. Those plastic sticks had cracked, and their lumi.nous contents had balled into a million microscopic blobs in the zero gee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Although the hydrostatic gel inside his MJOLNIR armor had been pressurized to itsmaximum safe value, John\u0027s bones still felt as if they were being shaken apart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This violent ride started when they had cleared Ascendant Justice\u0027s launch bay andentered the inky void of Slipspace. This \"normal\" Slipspace was nothing like John hadexperienced before. Without the smoothing effect\u0026nbsp; of Dr. Halsey\u0027s alien crystal—this ridewas a thousand times worse.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Radiation levels spiked and dipped... but so far the dosages getting into the lead-lineddropship were survivable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now I know,\" Linda said, \"why only big ships travel through Slipspace.\"296HALO: FIRST STRIKE\"You know those SS probes?\" Fred asked. \"They\u0027re almost solid Titanium-A.\"The Master Chief checked his team\u0027s biosigns: erratic but still within normal operationalparameters. Grace\u0027s heart skipped a beat or two, but then returned to a normal strong rhythm. No broken bones or signs of internal\u0026nbsp; bleeding yet, either. It was also a good sign that Blue Team were reasonably calm about their dire situation. The Chief knew it was allthey could do until they cleared the Slipspace field generated by Ascendant Justice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He ran a diagnostic on his MJOLNIR shields. They still re.charged faster than they were drained by the ambient radiation that stormed invisibly around them. He wished the realCortana were with him. She would have said\u0026nbsp; something to distract him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Status?\" John asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Four blue acknowledgment lights winked on, and four Spar.tans gave him thumbs-up signals.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fred chimed in, \"This isn\u0027t so bad. The last insertion I made, we hit the ground before thedropship. Now, that was a rough ride. We were—\"The dropship lurched violently and cut off Fred\u0027s story.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cracks appeared along the armor welded to the port wall. Molten lead oozed from therupture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Despite the hydrostatic gel and the padding, a jolt slammed the Master Chief\u0027s headagainst the front of his helmet with force enough to make black stars explode in his eyes.Another jolt slammed his head into the back of\u0026nbsp; his helmet. The inside of the dropshipwent entirely dark.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Chief? Chief?\" Cortana\u0027s voice whispered through his hel.met speaker. \"Chief, respondplease.\"John\u0027s vision came into focus. His biosigns sluggishly pulsed on his heads-up dis lay.Beyond the display, it was completely dark. He activated his external lights and pppointedhis head along the interior of the dropship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His Spartans hung limp in their harnesses. Aside from spheres of lead that had meltedunder the hull armor, resolidified, and now floated like champagne bubbles in the interiorof the vessel, there was no other discernible\u0026nbsp; motion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We made it?\"ERIC NYLUND 297\"Affirmative,\" the cloned Cortana answered. \"I\u0027m picking up a tremendous volume ofCovenant COM traffic on the F-through K-bands. They\u0027ve pinged us three times alreadyfor a response, Chief. Awaiting orders.\"\"How can you pick up any signal inside this lead-lined hull?\"\"The hull is breached in many sections, Chief. The COM traf.fic is also unusually strong,indicating extremely close proximity of Covenant forces.\"\"Stand by,\" he told her. He hit the quick release on his harness and floated free. He calledup Blue Team\u0027s biosigns and found them all unconscious, but alive. He grabbed a first-aidkit, in.jected them each with a mild\u0026nbsp; stimulant, and released them from their safetyrestraints.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are we?\" Will asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief looked instinctively to the forward moni.tors, but they were dead.\"There\u0027s only one way to find out,\" he replied. \"I\u0027ll take the portside hatch. Fred, you\u0027re onthe starboard.\"\"Roger, Blue-One,\" Fred replied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Chief rotated the manual release of the hatch and it eased open. Beyond was thevelvet black of space, filled with stars that shone yellow and amber and red. He clipped atether onto his suit and then onto the hull\u0026nbsp; and leaned out the hatch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Cortana had indicated, there were Covenant forces in close proximity. A cruiser glidedsilently past them three hundred me.ters away. All John could see was its silver-blue hull,its plasma turrets with their lateral lines aglow with fire, and the flare of its engine cones as it passed... and then John saw the rest of\u0026nbsp; them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were Covenant cruisers and larger carriers; there were even bigger vessels withfive bulbous sections that were two kilometers stem to stern and had a dozen deadlyenergy projec.tors. Motes of dust swirled\u0026nbsp; between the numerous ships: Seraph fighters,dropships, and tentacled Engineer pods.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How many ships,\" he asked Cortana, \"are we looking at?\"\"Two hundred forty-seven warships,\" she replied. \"Estima.tion of the total population based on the sampling from your lim.ited field of vision puts that total number at more than five hundred Covenant warships.\"For the first time the Chief froze; his gauntlets locked onto the298HALO: FIRST STRIKEedge of the hatch, and his arms failed to respond. Five hundred ships? There was more firepower here than he had ever seen be.fore. This fleet would easily overwhelm any UNSC defensive force—whether or not the\u0026nbsp; Admiral got through with his warn.ing. Theiropening salvo would be a tidal wave of plasma, and it would obliterate Earth\u0027s orbitalfortresses before they could fire a shot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A thousand kilometers below, space rippled, parted, and seven more cruisers appeared innormal space. They maneuvered to join the rest of the pack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John realized he had seen this magnitude of destructive power: Halo. The ring was a weapon designed to kill all sentient life for dozens of light-years in every direction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he had stopped that threat. He could stop this one, too. He had to.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His plan called for the infiltration and destruction of their command-and-control station.But how would that stop this gathering offeree? It wouldn\u0027t... but it might buy Earthenough time to come up with a plan to counter\u0026nbsp; this seemingly invincible armada.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You said they\u0027ve pinged us three times?\" John asked Cortana.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Affirmative. They\u0027ve been curious about our status, but not as much as you might expect.There\u0027s a tremendous amount of COM traffic. They\u0027re probably only interested in us as a naviga.tion hazard.\"\"Send a signal and explain that our engines are crippled and we\u0027ll need assistance tomove. Let\u0027s see if we can get them to take us to this central station for repairs.\"\"Sending message now.\"The Master Chief piped what he was seeing to Blue Team. \"Time to wake up,\" he said.\"Armor and weapons check on the double.\"There was a pause of several seconds before Blue Team\u0027s ac.knowledgment lights pulsedin his HUD. He knew they were having the same reaction of fear, and then drawing thesame con.clusion as he had about their\u0026nbsp; mission. They couldn\u0027t fail: The fate of humanitylay in their hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John angled his head around to take a look at the dropship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The majority of the dropship\u0027s hull had peeled away, and leadERIC NYLUND299and titanium plates underneath showed through. Without their reinforcements, the craftwould have disintegrated on the rough ride through Slipspace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Covenant C \u0026amp; C responding to our request,\" the copied Cor-tana informed him. \"Ferry en route to take us in for repairs. They were a little confused about which warship we belong to, but I simulated static to cover our\u0026nbsp; ship\u0027s registration ID. They\u0027re too busy to take too close a look at us.\"The Master Chief returned inside the dropship. \"We\u0027re get.ting towed,\" he told Blue Team.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Linda came up to him and made a circle in the air with her in.dex finger. John noddedand turned around so she could visually inspect his MJOLNIR suit. Computer diagnostics were fine, but his Spartans didn\u0027t take any\u0026nbsp; chances with their armor. Especially not in an evacuated environment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re good,\" she told him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John then returned the favor and examined her suit. Fred and Will had done an excellent job integrating the replacement parts into Linda\u0027s armor. Aside from their pristinecondition, they were a perfect match.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He patted her on the shoulder and gave her a thumbs-up to in.dicate that her armor was in working order.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ordnance load out,\" Grace said and unraveled the duffel bags they had tied to the hull.The packages had been wrapped with lead foil, layers of thermal padding, and then alayer of utility tape. \"Heavy or \"light?she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We go in heavy,\" John said. \"Except Linda.\"Linda started to object, but he explained, \"We\u0027ll need you to hang back and cover us withyour sniper rifle. I want you fast and deadly. Take a close-range weapon, extra ammo, and whatever you need to keep your\u0026nbsp; sniper rifle working in the field.\"\"Roger,\" Linda said. Her voice was cold, hard, and brittle. This was the voice John hadheard as she reported in while snip.ing targets around the team. John sometimes found ita little too cold... but he knew this was a\u0026nbsp; good sign. Linda was preparing to do what shedid best: kill with a single shot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The rest of us will take whatever we can carry. Once we\u0027re in I have a feeling we won\u0027t beable to come back. If we have to, we can always lighten our load.\"300HALO: FIRST STRIKEThe Chief grabbed a battle rifle and, for close use, a pair of submachine guns. He took apair of silencers for the SMGs and hip holsters for the smaller weapons. He picked up a dozen frag grenades in their plastic ring carrier\u0026nbsp; and slotted that into the left thigh section of his armor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He\u0027d need ammunition, a lot of it, if things got hot. So he took extra clips for the SMGs and the battle rifle and taped them onto his chest, arms, and right thigh. More clips went into a back.pack, along with two Lotus\u0026nbsp; antitank mines, a few cans of C-7 ex.plosive,detonators, timers, two field first-aid kits, and a fiber-optic probe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While the rest of Blue Team got their gear together, John told them, \"Stay off the COM from now on.\"They all nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lead lining or not, they were close to too many listening Covenant ears to take any more chances with the COM.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He moved to the still-open port hatch, slid the fiber-optic probe outside, and plugged itinto his helmet. Grainy images ap.peared on his heads-up display.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hundreds of Covenant ships swarmed into view. In their midst a speck glowed and grew larger until the Master Chief saw it was a ship of similar design to their own: two U-shaped hulls, each the size of their dropship, sat\u0026nbsp; on top of one another. This shipaccelerated toward them and separated—one part moved to their dropship\u0027s stern and the other drifted to the nose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The clanging of metal on metal reverberated through the hull, and the Master Chief felt agentle motion in the pit of his stomach.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked back and passed on a thumbs-up to Fred, indicating that their tow had arrived,and Fred passed this signal on to the rest of the team.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the fiber-optic feed the Master Chief saw that the Covenant tug maneuvered them through the fleet, up, over, and around ships a hundred times their size. There was a moment when they dived and there was\u0026nbsp; nothing on screen save the stars and black ofspace. The Master Chief got a glimpse of the gold-colored star on his heads-up display,and then the video feed moved over to a planet of ocher smeared with clouds of sulfur\u0026nbsp; dioxide and an or.biting moon of silver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ERIC NYLUND301The tug turned to face a new ship in the distance. This vessel looked like two teardrop-shaped Covenant ships that had collided, giving the result an overall elongated figure-eight geometry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They moved toward this ship, and the Master Chief made out more details. Spokes radiated from the narrow midpoint of the vessel and connected to a slender ring that hehadn\u0027t seen before because they had\u0026nbsp; approached facing it edge-on. Featherlike tubes extended from either bulbous section and moved slowly over that central wheel. Johnsquinted to make out more details on this unusual ship, but he was already at\u0026nbsp; maximum resolution.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It had a ring? Was it rotating? But the Covenant had gravita.tional technology. They didn\u0027t need rotating sections to simulate gravity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he saw something recognizable on the structure: tiny ships docked to that ring.Covenant cruisers and carriers. There must have been sixty connected to the central hub.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The titanic perspective of this structure clicked into place. The carriers looked like toys.The twin teardrop shapes had to be thirty kilometers end to end. This could only be theCovenant command-and-control center, the\u0026nbsp; Unyielding Hierophant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The tug moved directly toward the station. It was precisely where they had to go, so itwas a lucky break... but ironically, it was also the last place the Master Chief wanted to be.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was no telling what kind of sensors the Unyielding Hiero-phanthad, but they couldn\u0027t take chances. John retreated into the dropship and eased the hatch shut.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He moved deeper into the ship and waited with the rest of Blue Team.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Three minutes ticked by on his mission clock; John tried to control his breathing andfocus his mind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gravity settled his stomach, and there was a series of metallic clatters along the hull.Atmosphere hissed in though the cracks of their breached ship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John pointed at Fred and Grace and then to the starboard hatch. They leveled their rifles and moved. He pointed to Linda and himself, then the port hatch, and they also movedinto position.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John wasn\u0027t sure what kind of reception waited for them on the other side of those hatches, but one thing was certain—they\u0027dr302HALO: FIRST STRIKEhave to face it head-on. There was nowhere to hide inside the re.inforced and too-cramped interior of their dropship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The port hatch cracked and squeaked open.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Linda and John aimed their rifles.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997/30072.html","bookId":221,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:14:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:14:45 AM"}
