I don’t need to rob someone of her boyfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a girlfriend,” Liz says. “It’s some random girl he’s flirting with. I saw her last night at the casino with a whole other group. She’ll be history by dinner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think?” I ask hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promise,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all split up in the late afternoon: Hailey claims she needs a nap, Liz hits the gym, and I check out the spa. We all meet for dinner and a little YMCAing at the disco. Later we find James Bond back at the casino bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good news: Liz was right—the girl from the afternoon is nowhere to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bad news: He’s with two new girls. He’s smiling at both of them, his teeth gleaming against his pale skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next,” Hailey whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he’s so perfect,” I say. “Look at him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kristin, you can’t just hook up with someone who’s already hooked up with two people in as many days,” she says, shaking her head. “That’s skanky. No offense, Liz.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None taken,” Liz says cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not like I want a deep, meaningful relationship,” I mumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he’s a creep. What happened to the girl in the hot tub? Has he forgotten all about her already?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arm is gently brushing against the back of one of the girls, the one in a pink halter top. The other girl, wearing her hair in a tight bun, is twirling on a bar stool, looking bored and annoyed. She whispers something to Miss Pink Halter Top and then takes off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great. Now the lovebirds are on their own.” I throw my hands in the air. “I give up!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go get ice cream sundaes,” Hailey suggests. “They’re giving them out in the dining room. I bet there are better guys there. Ones that aren’t so cocky looking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I like cocky guys,” I say sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe step back out into the lobby. “You two go ahead,” Liz says. “I have someone I need to talk to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your friend from last night?” Hailey asks knowingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz winks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe go for ice cream. Hailey takes two bowls: one for her and one for her alleged mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not that she’ll eat it,” Hailey says. “It’ll probably just melt into a pile of gunk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has she not left her room?” That is so weird. Could that even be true? How could we not have seen her at least once?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think she has a few times. But only at night. She sleeps all day. It’s ridiculous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want me to come check on her with you?” I ask. To see if she really exists. Maybe she’s the vampire. Ha-ha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh no. Don’t worry about it. She’d hate it if I brought someone back to the room. Wanna go to yours and hang out? I can meet you there after I drop this off. Don’t you have a balcony?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do, but…” Not a good idea. “My roomie might have a friend there. And we don’t want to…ruin the mood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is it,” Liz says the next day at the pool. “Our last full day. Are you ready to make your move, sweetie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been ready for three days.” Kind of. Hopefully. I scan the pool area for his gorgeousness. “He’s not even here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He will be,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you really want to make it happen, I think you may need to choose someone else,” Hailey says. “You’re practically out of time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he’s my dream man,” I say. “I just need to get him alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I doubt you will any time soon,” Hailey says, pointing with a toe across the pool. “Look who’s over there by herself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl with the bun from last night, the friend of Pink Halter Top girl, is talking to one of the waiters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh great,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her friend is probably all cuddled-up with your boy. Time for you to move on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl sees us staring and hurries over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What could she want?” Hailey wonders aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she reaches our chairs, she says, “Hey, sorry to bother you guys. But you were at the casino last night, right?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacations-from-hell/page-7.html","bookId":2716,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM"}
