A single cell of the bacterium E. coli would, under ideal circumstances, divide every twenty minutes. That is not particularly disturbing until you think about it, but the fact is that bacteria multiply geometrically: one becomes two, two become four, four become eight, and so on. In this way, it can be shown that in a single day, one cell of E. coli could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;produce a super-colony equal in size and weight to the entire planet earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This never happens, for a perfectly simple reason: growth cannot continue indefinitely under \"ideal circumstances.\" Food runs out.

As nearly as anyone could determine, the chimp brain was as complex as the human brain. There were minor differences in structure, but the major difference was size-- the human brain was larger, with more cells, more interconnections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And that, in some subtle way, made the human brain different.

Officer Willis had frequently visited the diner in the past. After eating, he stated that he had a severe headache and that \"his ulcer was acting up.\" Miss Conover gave him two aspirin and a tablespoon of bicarbonate of soda.

All parties should be informed that the penalty for outside recording of a classified government communication is a minimum of five years\u0027 prison sentence. If the recording is continued this connection will automatically be broken. This is a recording. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was a long silence. Hall could imagine the surprise Smithson was feeling; he felt it himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"What the hell kind of a place are you calling from, anyhow?\" Smithson said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Turn it off,\" Hall said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was a pause, a click, then: \"All right. It\u0027s off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"I am calling from a classified government installation,\" Hall said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Well, look here, mister--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Let me be perfectly plain,\" Hall said. \"This is a matter of considerable importance and it concerns Officer Willis. No doubt there\u0027s a court inquiry pending on him, and no doubt You\u0027ll be involved. We may be able to demonstrate that Officer Willis was not responsible for his actions, that he was suffering from a purely medical problem. But we can\u0027t do that unless you tell us what you know about his medical status. And if you don\u0027t tell us, Dr. Smithson, and tell us damned fast, we can have you locked away for twelve years for obstructing an official, government inquiry. I don\u0027t care whether you believe that or not. I\u0027m telling you, and you\u0027d better believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was a very long pause, and finally the drawl: \"No need to get excited, Doctor. Naturally, now that I understand the situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Did Willis have an ulcer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Ulcer? No. That was just what he said, or was reported to have said. He never had an ulcer that I know of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Did he have any medical problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Diabetes,\" Smithson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Diabetes? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yeah. And he was pretty casual about it. We diagnosed him five, six years ago, at the age of thirty. Had a pretty severe case. We put him on insulin, fifty units a day, but he was casual, like I said. Showed up in the hospital once or twice in coma, because he wouldn\u0027t take his insulin. Said he hated the needles. We almost put him off the force, because we were afraid to let him drive a car-- thought he\u0027d go into acidosis at the wheel and conk out. We scared him plenty and he promised to go straight. That was three years ago, and as far as I know, he took his insulin regularly from then on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"You\u0027re sure of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Well, I think so. But the waitress at that restaurant, Sally Conover, told one of our investigators that she figured Willis had been drinking, because she could smell liquor on his breath. And I know for a fact that Willis never touched a drop in his life. He was one of these real religious fellows. Never smoked and never drank. Always led a clean life. That was why his diabetes bothered him so: he felt he didn\u0027t deserve it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Hall relaxed in his chair. He was getting near now, coming closer. The answer was within reach; the final answer, the key to it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"One last question,\" Hall said. \"Did Willis go through Piedmont on the night of his death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yes. He radioed in. He was a little behind schedule, but he passed through. Why? Is it something about the government tests being held there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"No,\" Hall said, but he was sure Smithson didn\u0027t believe him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Well, listen, we\u0027re stuck here with a bad case, and if you have any information which would--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"We will be in touch,\" Hall promised him, and clicked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The girl at the switchboard came back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Is your call completed, Dr. Hall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yes. But I need information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"What kind of information?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"I want to know if I have the authority to arrest someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"I will check, Sir. What is the charge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"No charge. Just to hold someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was a moment while she looked over at her computer console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Dr. Hall, you may authorize an official Army interview with anyone involved in project business. This interview may last up to forty-eight hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"All right, \" Hall said. \"Arrange it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yes sir. Who is the person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Dr. Smithson,\" Hall said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The girl nodded and the screen went blank. Hall felt sorry for Smithson, but not very sorry; the man would have a few hours of sweating, but nothing more serious than that. And it was essential to halt rumors about Piedmont.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He sat back in his chair and thought about what he had learned.
