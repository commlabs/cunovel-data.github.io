Fezzik and Inigo followed him through the darkness in the direction of the wheelbarrow. There was no denying the fact that there was a certain excitement in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtercup, for her part, felt no excitement whatsoever. She had, in fact, never remembered such a wonderful feeling of calm. Her Westley was coming; that was her world. Ever since the Prince had dragged her to her room she had spent the intervening hours thinking of ways to make Westley happy. There was no way he could miss stopping her wedding. That was the only thought that could survive the trip across her conscious mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo when she heard the wedding was to be moved up, she wasn’t the least upset. Westley was always prepared for contingencies, and if he could rescue her at six, he could just as happily rescue her at half past five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, Prince Humperdinck got things going even faster than he had hoped. It was 5:23 when he and his bride-to-be were kneeling before the aged Archdean of Florin. It was 5:24 when the Archdean started to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd 5:25 when the screaming started outside the main gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButtercup only smiled softly. Here comes my Westley now, was all she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not, in point of fact, her Westley that was causing the commotion out front. Westley was doing all he could to simply walk straight down the incline toward the main gate without help. Ahead of him, Inigo struggled with the heavy wheelbarrow. The reason for its weight was that Fezzik stood in it, arms wide, eyes blazing, voice booming in terrible rage: “I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS AND THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.” He Said that over and over, his voice echoing and reverberating as his rage increased. He was, standing there, gliding down through the darkness, quite an imposing figure, seeming, all in all, probably close to ten feet tall, with voice to match. But even that was not the cause of the screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYellin, from his position by the gate, was reasonably upset at the roaring giant gliding down toward them through the darkness. Not that he doubted his hundred men could dispatch the giant; the upsetting thing was that, of course, the giant would be aware of that too, and logically there must somewhere in the dimness out there be any number of giant helpers. Other pirates, anything. Who could tell? Still, his men held together remarkably staunchly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only when the giant got halfway down the incline that he suddenly, happily, burst into flame and continued his trip saying, “NO SURVIVORS, NO SURVIVORS!” in a manner that could only indicate deadly sincerity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was seeing him happily burning and advancing that started the Brute Squad to screaming. And once that happened, why, everybody panicked and ran…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoneymoon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the panic was well under way, Yellin realized he had next to no chance of bringing things immediately under control. Besides, the giant was terribly close now, and the roar of “NO SURVIVORS” made it very hard to do any solid thinking, but fortunately he had the sense to grab the one and only key to the castle and hide it on his person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately too, Westley had the sense to look for such behavior. “Give me the key,” Westley said to Yellin, once Inigo had his sword securely pressuring Yellin’s Adam’s apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have no key,” Yellin replied. “I swear on the grave of my parents; may my mother’s soul forever sizzle in torment if I am lying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tear his arms off,” Westley said to Fezzik, who was sizzling a bit himself now, because there was a limit as to just how long a holocaust cloak was really good for, and he wanted to strip a bit, but before he did that, he reached for Yellin’s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This key you mean?” Yellin said, and he dropped it, and after Inigo had taken his sword, they let him run away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-123.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
