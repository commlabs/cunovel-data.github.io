It was so warm it was hot, like the blood that ran through its veins went faster than the blood of any average man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this was true, it wouldn’t surprise me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes and it was dark. It was always dark when he visited me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a moment like every moment I had when he showed. A moment of sanity. A moment where my mind said to close my eyes and open my mouth and tell him to go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if I did, I knew he would. He wouldn’t say a word. As silently as he came, he’d leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he’d never come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this was the right thing to do. The smart thing to do. The sane thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was thinking of doing it, honest to God, I was. I thought about doing it every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I felt his weight hit the bed, his body stretching out beside mine, he turned me into him, I opened my mouth to speak and before I could do the sane thing, his mouth was on mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for the next two hours, I didn’t think at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I felt. I felt a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all of it was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was still dark when his shadow moved in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay in bed and watched him move. He didn’t make a noise. It was weird. There was a rustle of clothes but other than that, silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as a shadow, I saw he had masculine grace. Powerful masculine grace. That was weird too. Just my mystery man putting on clothes was like watching a badass, macho dance if there was such a thing. Of course, there wasn’t except in my bedroom when he came to visit. No, when he was getting ready to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so fascinating I should sell tickets. But if I did, I’d have to share. I probably already shared with half of Denver, all of them getting their own private show. That already messed with my head enough, that and the fact that he came at all, I let him come, then he made me come after which he came. Then, often, like tonight, repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t real hot on sharing any more than I already likely did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved to the bed and I watched that too. He bent low, I felt the heat of his hand on my knee, his fingers curling around the back and he lightly kissed my hip, his lips skimming across my skin, making it tingle. Then he slid the covers up my body to my waist where he dropped them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was mostly on my belly, partly on my side, my arm crooked, hand tucked under my face on the pillow. His body moved in that direction, his fingers slid under my hair, pulling it gently back and his lips came to my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Later, babe,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Later,” I whispered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head moved infinitesimally and his lips skimmed the skin at the back of my ear then his tongue touched there. That made my skin tingle too, so much my whole body shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the covers up to my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned and he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo noise, not even the door opening and closing. He was just gone. Like he’d never even been there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFreaking crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at my bedroom door awhile. My body felt warm, sated and tired. My mind did not feel the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to my back, tucked the covers around my na**d body and I stared at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t even know his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God,” I whispered, “I am such a slut.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eD-e-a-d, Dead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning I was sitting at my computer in my home office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have been working. I had three deadlines the next two weeks and I’d barely begun on the work. I was a freelance editor. I got paid by the hour and if I didn’t work that hour, I didn’t get paid. I had a mouth to feed, my own. I had a body to clothe, a body that liked all sorts of clothes, it craved them so I had to feed the habit or things could get nasty. I had a cosmopolitan addiction and cosmos didn’t come cheap. And I had a house I was fixing up. Therefore, I needed to get paid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, that wasn’t strictly true. I wasn’t fixing up my house. My Dad did some of the work. My friend Troy did other work. So, I should say that I had a house I was guilting, begging and emotionally blackmailing others into fixing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still, it needed fixing up and cabinets and tile didn’t march from Cabinet and Tile Land into my house and say, “We want to live with you, Gwendolyn Kidd, fix us to your walls!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat only happened in my dreams, of which I had many, most of them daydreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike right then, sitting at my computer, one heel to the seat, my chin to my knee, my eyes staring out the window, I was thinking about my Mystery Man, the Great MM. I was daydreaming about changing our first meeting. Being smarter, funnier, more mysterious, alluring, interesting, hooking him instantly with my rapier wit, my flair for conversation, my ability to discuss politics and world events intelligently, my humble stories of expansive charity work all wrapped up with enticing looks that promised a lifetime of mind-blowing orgasms, making him declare his undying love for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr at least tell me his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I was drunk and definitely not any of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard my doorbell go, a chime then a clunk and I started out of my elaborate daydream which was beginning to get good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I got up and walked through my office into the upstairs hall making a mental note, again, to call Troy and see if he’d fix my doorbell for a six pack and a homemade pizza. This might mean he’d bring his annoying, whiny, constantly bitching new girlfriend though, so I changed my mind and decided to call my Dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to the bottom of my stairs and walked through my wide living room, ignoring the state of it, which was decorated in Fix Up Chic, in other words dust rags, paint brushes, power tools, not-so-power-tools, cans and tubes of practically everything, all of it jumbled and covered in a layer of dust. I made it through the area without my hands going to my head, fingers clenching my hair and mouth screaming, which I counted as progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to the entryway which was delineated by two narrow walls both fit with gorgeous stained glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo years ago, that stained glass was my undoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo years ago, approximately six months and two weeks prior to meeting my Mystery Man, I’d walked one single step into this ramble and wreck of a house, saw that stained glass, turned to the realtor and announced, “I’ll take it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe realtor’s face had lit up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father, who hadn’t even made it into the house yet, turned his eyes to the heavens. His prayer lasted a long time. His lecture longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still bought the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs usual, I should have listened to my Dad. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mystery-man-dream-man-1/page-1.html","bookId":1850,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM"}
