{"id":43014,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII","content":"For a long while, Samuel stood motionless, hearing the swish of the rain and the crashing of the thunder as an echo of the storm in his own soul. It was as if a chasm had yawned beneath his feet, and all the castles of his dreams had come down in ruins. He stood there, stunned and horrified, staring at the wreckage of everything he had believed.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then suddenly he crossed the drawing-room and opened one of the French windows which led to the piazza. The rain was driving underneath the shelter of the roof; but he faced it, and ran toward the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e The girl was lying in front of it, and above the noise of the wind and rain he heard her sobbing wildly. He stood for a minute, hesitating; then he bent down and touched her.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Lady,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e She started. “Who are you?” she cried.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I\u0027m just one of the servants, ma\u0027am.”\n\u003cbr\u003e She caught her breath. “Did he send you?” she demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” said he, “I came to help you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I don\u0027t need any help. Let me be.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “But you can\u0027t stay here in the rain,” he protested. “You\u0027ll catch your death.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I want to die!” she answered. “What have I to live for?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel stood for a moment, perplexed. Then, as he touched her wet clothing again, common sense asserted itself. “You mustn\u0027t stay here,” he said. “You mustn\u0027t.”\n\u003cbr\u003e But she only went on weeping. “He\u0027s cast me off!” she exclaimed. “My God, what shall I do?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel turned and ran into the house again and got an umbrella in the hall. Then he took the girl by the arm and half lifted her. “Come,” he said. “Please.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “But where shall I go?” she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I know some one in the town who\u0027ll help you,” he said. “You can\u0027t stay here—you\u0027ll catch cold.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “What\u0027s there left for me?” she moaned. “What am I good for? He\u0027s thrown me over—and I can\u0027t live without him!”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel got the umbrella up and held it with one hand; then with his other arm about the girl\u0027s waist, he half carried her down the piazza steps. “That she-devil was after him!” she was saying. “And it was Jack Holliday set her at it, damn his soul! I\u0027ll pay him for it!”\n\u003cbr\u003e She poured forth a stream of wild invective.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Please stop,” pleaded Samuel. “People will hear you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “What do I care if they do hear me? Let them put me in jail—that\u0027s all I\u0027m fit for. I\u0027m drunk, and I\u0027m good for nothing—and he\u0027s tired of me!”\n\u003cbr\u003e So she rushed on, all the way toward town. Then, as they came to the bridge, she stopped and looked about. “Where are you taking me?” she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e “To a friend\u0027s house,” he said, having in mind the Stedmans.\n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” she replied. “I don\u0027t want to see anyone. Take me to some hotel, can\u0027t you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “There\u0027s one down the street here,” he said. “I don\u0027t know anything about it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I don\u0027t care. Any place.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The rain had slackened and she stopped and gathered up her wet and straggled hair.\n\u003cbr\u003e There was a bar underneath the hotel, and a flight of stairs led up to the office. They went up, and a man sitting behind the desk stared at them.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I want to get a room for this lady,” said Samuel. “She\u0027s been caught in the rain.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Is she your wife?” asked the man.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Mercy, no,” said he startled.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Do you want a room, too?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “No, no, I\u0027m going away.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh!” said the man, and took down a key. “Register, please.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel took the pen, and then turned to the girl. “I beg pardon,” he said, “but I don\u0027t know your name.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Mary Smith,” she answered, and Samuel stared at her in surprise. “Mary Smith,” she repeated, and he wrote it down obediently.\n\u003cbr\u003e The man took them upstairs; and Samuel, after helping the girl to a chair, shut the door and stood waiting. And she flung herself down upon the bed and burst into a paroxysm of weeping. Samuel had never even heard the word hysterics, and it was terrifying to him to see her—he could not have believed that so frail and slender a human body could survive so frightful a storm of emotion.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, please, please stop!” he cried wildly.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I can\u0027t live without him!” she wailed again and again. “I can\u0027t live without him! What am I going to do?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel\u0027s heart was wrung. He went to the girl, and put his hand upon her arm. “Listen to me,” he said earnestly. “Let me try to help you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “What can you do?” she demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I\u0027ll go and see him. I\u0027ll plead with him—perhaps he\u0027ll listen to me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “All right!” she cried. “Anything! Tell him I\u0027ll kill myself! I\u0027ll kill him and Dolly both, before I\u0027ll ever let her have him! Yes, I mean it! He swore to me he\u0027d never leave me! And I believed him—I trusted him!”\n\u003cbr\u003e And Samuel clenched his hands with sudden resolution. “I\u0027ll see him about it,” he said. “I\u0027ll see him to-night.”\n\u003cbr\u003e And leaving the other still shaking with sobs, he turned and left the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e He stopped in the office to tell the man that he was going. But there was nobody there; and after hesitating a moment he went on.\n\u003cbr\u003e The storm was over and the moon was out, with scud of clouds flying past. Samuel strode back to “Fairview,” with his hands gripped tightly, and a blaze of resolution in his soul.\n\u003cbr\u003e He was just in time to see the automobile at the door, and the company taking their departure. They passed him, singing hilariously; and then he found himself confronting his young master.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Who\u0027s that?” exclaimed Bertie, startled.\n\u003cbr\u003e “It\u0027s me, sir,” said Samuel.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh! Samuel! What are you doing here?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I\u0027ve been with the young lady, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh! So that\u0027s what became of her!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I took her to a hotel, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Humph!” said Bertie. “I\u0027m obliged to you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The piazza lights were turned up, and by them Samuel could see the other\u0027s face, flushed with drink, and his hair and clothing in disarray. He swayed slightly as he stood there.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Master Albert,” said Samuel very gravely, “May I have a few words with you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Sure,” said Bertie. He looked about him for a chair and sank into it. “What is it?” he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e “It\u0027s the young lady, Master Albert.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “What about her?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “She\u0027s very much distressed, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I dare say. She\u0027ll get over it, Samuel.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Master Albert,” exclaimed the boy, “you\u0027ve not treated her fairly.”\n\u003cbr\u003e The other stared at him. “The devil!” he exclaimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e “You must not desert her, sir! It would be a terrible thing to have on your conscience. You have ruined and betrayed her.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “WHAT!” cried the other, and gazed at him in amazement. “Did she give you that kind of a jolly?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “She didn\u0027t go into particulars”—said the boy.\n\u003cbr\u003e “My dear fellow!” laughed Bertie. “Why, I\u0027ve been the making of that girl. She was an eighteen-dollar-a-week chorus girl when I took her up.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “That might be, Master Albert. But if she was an honest girl—”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Nonsense, Samuel—forget it. She\u0027d had three or four lovers before she ever laid eyes on me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e There was a pause, while the boy strove to get these facts into his mind. “Even so,” he said, “you can\u0027t desert her and let her starve, Master Albert.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, stuff!” said the other. “What put that into your head? I\u0027ll give her all the money she needs, if that\u0027s what\u0027s troubling her. Did she say that?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “N—no,” admitted Samuel disconcerted. “But, Master Albert, she loves you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, I know,” said Bertie, “and that\u0027s where the trouble comes in. She wants to keep me in a glass case, and I\u0027ve got tired of it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e He paused for a moment; and then a sudden idea flashed over him. “Samuel!” he exclaimed “Why don\u0027t you marry her?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel started in amazement. “What!” he gasped.\n\u003cbr\u003e “It\u0027s the very thing!” cried Bertie. “I\u0027ll set you up in a little business, and you can have an easy time.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Master Albert!” panted the boy shocked to the depths of his soul.\n\u003cbr\u003e “She\u0027s beautiful, Samuel—you know she is. And she\u0027s a fine girl, too—only a little wild. I believe you\u0027d be just the man to hold her in.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Bertie paused a moment, and then, seeing that the other was unconvinced, he added with a laugh, “Wait till you\u0027ve known her a bit. Maybe you\u0027ll fall in love with her.”\n\u003cbr\u003e But Samuel only shook his head. “Master Albert,” he said, in a low voice, “I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ve not understood the reason I\u0027ve come to you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “How do you mean?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “This—all this business, sir—it\u0027s shocked me more than I can tell you. I came here to serve you, sir. You don\u0027t know how I felt about it. I was ready to do anything—I was so grateful for a chance to be near you! You were rich and great, and everything about you was so beautiful—I thought you must be noble and good, to have deserved so much. And now, instead, I find you are a wicked man!”\n\u003cbr\u003e The other sat up. “The dickens!” he exclaimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e “And it\u0027s a terrible thing to me,” went on Samuel. “I don\u0027t know just what to make of it—\n\u003cbr\u003e “See here, Samuel!” demanded the other angrily. “Who sent you here to lecture me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I don\u0027t see how it can be!” the boy exclaimed. “You are one of the fit people, as Professor Stewart explained it to me; and yet I know some who are better than you, and who have nothing at all.”\n\u003cbr\u003e And Bertie Lockman, after another stare into the boy\u0027s solemn eyes, sank back in his chair and burst into laughter. “Look here, Samuel!” he exclaimed. “You aren\u0027t playing the game!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “How do you mean, sir?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “If I\u0027m one of the fit ones, what right have you got to preach at me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel was startled. “Why sir—” he stammered.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Just look!” went on Bertie. “I\u0027m the master, and you\u0027re the servant. I have breeding and culture—everything—and you\u0027re just a country bumpkin. And yet you presume to set your ideas up against mine! You presume to judge me, and tell me what I ought to do!”\n\u003cbr\u003e Samuel was taken aback by this. He could not think what to reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Don\u0027t you see?” went on Bertie, following up his advantage. “If you really believe what you say, you ought to submit yourself to me. If I say a thing\u0027s right, that makes it right. If I had to come to you to have you approve it, wouldn\u0027t that make you the master and me the servant?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “No, no—Master Albert!” protested Samuel. “I didn\u0027t mean quite that!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why, I might just as well give you my money and be done with it,” insisted the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Then you could fix everything up to suit yourself.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “That isn\u0027t what I mean at all!” cried the boy in great distress. “I don\u0027t know how to answer you, sir—but there\u0027s a wrong in it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “But where? How?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Master Albert,” blurted Samuel—“it can\u0027t be right for you to get drunk!”\n\u003cbr\u003e Bertie\u0027s face clouded.\n\u003cbr\u003e “It can\u0027t be right, sir!” repeated Samuel.\n\u003cbr\u003e And suddenly the other sat forward in his chair. “All right,” he said—“Maybe it isn\u0027t. But what are you going to do about it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e There was anger in his voice, and Samuel was frightened into silence. There was a pause while they stared at each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I\u0027m on top!” exclaimed Bertie. “I\u0027m on top, and I\u0027m going to stay on top—don\u0027t you see? The game\u0027s in my hands; and if I please to get drunk, I get drunk. And you will take your orders and mind your own business. And what have you to say to that?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I presume, sir,” said Samuel, his voice almost a whisper, “I can leave your service.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” said the other—“and then either you\u0027ll starve, or else you\u0027ll go to somebody else who has money, and ask him to give you a job. And then you\u0027ll take your orders from him, and keep your opinions to yourself. Don\u0027t you see?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” said Samuel, lowering his eyes—“I see.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “All right,” said Bertie; and he rose unsteadily to his feet. “Now, if you please,” said he, “you\u0027ll go back to Belle, wherever you\u0027ve left her, and take her a message for me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir,” said Samuel.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Tell her I\u0027m through with her, and I don\u0027t want to see her again. I\u0027ll have a couple of hundred dollars a month sent to her so long as she lets me alone. If she writes to me or bothers me in any way, she\u0027ll get nothing. And that\u0027s all.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir,” said Samuel.\n\u003cbr\u003e “And as for you, this was all right for a joke, but it wouldn\u0027t bear repeating. From now on, you\u0027re the gardener\u0027s boy, and you\u0027ll not forget your place again.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir,” said Samuel once more, and stood watching while his young master went into the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then he turned and went down the road, half dazed.\n\u003cbr\u003e Those had been sledge-hammer blows, and they had landed full and hard. They had left him without a shred of all his illusions. His work, that he had been so proud of—he hated it, and everything associated with it. And he was overwhelmed with perplexity and pain—just as before when he had found himself in jail, and it had dawned upon him that the Law, an institution which he had revered, might be no such august thing at all, but an instrument of injustice and oppression.\n\u003cbr\u003e In that mood he came to the hotel. Again there was no one in the office, so he went directly to the room and knocked. There was no answer; he knocked again, more heavily.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I wonder if she\u0027s gone,” he thought, and looked again at the number, to make sure he was at the right room. Then, timidly, he tried the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e It opened. “Lady,” he said, and then louder, “Lady.”\n\u003cbr\u003e There was no response, and he went in. Could she be asleep? he thought. No—that was not likely. He listened for her breathing. There was not a sound.\n\u003cbr\u003e And finally he went to the bed, and put his hand upon it. Then he started back with a cry of terror. He had touched something warm and moist and sticky.\n\u003cbr\u003e He rushed out into the hall, and as he looked at his hand he nearly fainted. It was a mass of blood!\n\u003cbr\u003e “Help! Help!” the boy screamed; and he turned and rushed down the stairs into the office.\n\u003cbr\u003e The proprietor came running in. “Look!” shouted Samuel. “Look what she\u0027s done!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Good God!” cried the man. And he rushed upstairs, the other following.\n\u003cbr\u003e With trembling fingers the man lit the gas; and Samuel took one look, and then turned away and caught at a table, sick with horror. The girl was lying in the midst of a pool of blood; and across her throat, from ear to ear, was a great gaping slit.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh! oh!” gasped Samuel, and then—“I can\u0027t stand it!” And holding out one hand from him, he hid his face with the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e Meantime the proprietor was staring at him. “See here, young fellow,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “What is it?” asked Samuel.\n\u003cbr\u003e “When did you find out about this?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why, just now. When I came in.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “You\u0027ve been out?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why of course. I went out just after we came.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I didn\u0027t see you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “No. I stopped in the office, but you weren\u0027t there.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Humph!” said the man, “maybe you did and maybe you didn\u0027t. You can tell it to the police.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “The police!” echoed Samuel; and then in sudden horror—“Do you think I did it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I don\u0027t know anything about it,” replied the other. “I only know you brought her here, and that you\u0027ll stay here till the police come.”\n\u003cbr\u003e By this time several people had come into the room, awakened by the noise. Samuel, without a word more, went and sank down into a chair and waited. And half an hour later he was on his way to the station house again—this time with a policeman on either side of him, and gripping him very tightly. And now the charge against him was murder!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3245/88935.html","bookId":642,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:26:05 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:26:05 AM"}
