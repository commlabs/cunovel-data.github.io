A chemically induced migratory impulse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s so, then maybe she\u0027s mistaken about the necessity to go there. It might just be a blind drive. There\u0027s no reason to risk going there yourselves. Not until things quiet down. Let Gray play out his game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa was not convinced. \"I think you\u0027re right about an underlying biological drive. And in a lower life-form, like a crab, it might be nothing more than blind instinct. Crabs, like all arthropods, have only rudimentary—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped talking. Painter feared he\u0027d lost the connection. But sometimes Lisa did that when she had a sudden insight. She would just switch off, using her full faculties to pursue some angle of thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lisa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took another moment for her to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan could be right,\" she mumbled—then louder, firmer: \"I have to get her there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter spoke rapidly, knowing that they were about to lose the connection. He heard the resolve in Lisa\u0027s voice and feared he would not have time to dissuade her. If she was going to Angkor, he wanted her somewhere out of harm\u0027s way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then land at the large lake near the ruins,\" he said. \"Tonle Sap Lake. There\u0027s a floating village there. Find a phone, contact me again, but stay hidden there. I have a campaign being organized in the area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe barely made out her next words, something about doing her best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter attempted one last exchange. \"Lisa, what did you figure out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words cut in and out. \"Not sure . . . liver flukes. . . virus must—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the call fully died away. Painter called out a few more times, but he failed to raise her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock at his door drew his eyes up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat rushed in, eyes sparkling, cheeks bright. \"I heard! About Dr. Cummings! Is it true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter stared up at Kat. He read the question in Kat\u0027s expression, in her whole body, a yearning to know. Lisa had told him. First thing. She had spoken in a rush, needing to unburden herself. Afterward, Painter had compartmentalized it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut confronted by Kat, by her hope, by her love, the truth struck him hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and stepped around the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat saw it in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe backed away from him, as if she could escape what was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no . . .\" She grabbed a chair arm, but it failed to hold her. She went down to a knee, then collapsed to the other, covering her face with her hands. \"No . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter joined her on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no words to offer her, only his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled her against him, wondering how many more would die before this was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8:55 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were running out of places to retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet waited for her husband at the foot of the stairs that led up to the top floor. She stood in the stairwell doorway. Jack had gone out to leave more false trails for the hunting dogs. She had already stripped her husband\u0027s shirt and helped him hide pieces of it across the lower two floors: tossed into boarded-up offices, shoved into piles of refuse, hung from the metal drawer in a maze of secretarial cubicles. They did their best to confound the pursuers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack had been hunting all his life. Duck, pheasant, quail, deer. He\u0027d had his share of retrievers before the oil-rig accident required amputating his leg below the knee. He knew dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he still had three rounds left in the pistol he had stolen from the guard. Harriet sought any measure of hope. But she heard the dogs barking below. Annishen had been systematically clearing each level. She knew they were up here, periodically calling out to them, taunting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the exits were well guarded. Even the fire escapes. No neighboring buildings were close enough to reach. And the entire district looked long abandoned. Not a light shone, except far off in the distance. There was no one to hear a call for help. They\u0027d tried a few dusty wall phones, but they were all dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the desperate fleeing a high-rise fire, they had nowhere to go but up. And only one last floor remained. That and the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet heard a scuffle, and her husband appeared out of the gloom, dressed only in his boxers, carrying the pistol. He limped up to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you still doing here?\" he whispered in a hard voice. His face shone with sweat. She recognized his angry tone only masked his fear for her. \"I told you to get up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed and hooked an arm around her. \"Then let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed up to the top floor, using one of the narrow back stairs. Below them in the stairwell, a waste-management Dumpster had been shoved down the steps long ago, blocking the way up from lower levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should have been safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low growl dismissed this conceit. A scuffling sounded on the lower landing, from beyond the Dumpster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatchu smell in there, girl?\" a voice barked. Footsteps entered the lower stairwell. A flashlight\u0027s glow flowed up to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet and Jack edged to the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snarling grew more intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get up there now. Go on. Squeeze on through there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack pushed Harriet up the stairs. They moved quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow, the snarling had softened to a heavy snuffling, along with a frantic scrabbling of claws on tile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go,\" the voice said. \"Flush \u0027em out. I\u0027ll go on around.\" The voice headed out of the lower stairwell, plainly seeking another way up. A crackle of radio trailed after him along with some mumbling as he reported in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were sending the dogs up to the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Harriet and Jack fled up toward the door at the next landing, a sharp bark echoed to them, half triumphant, half savage. Something large pounded up the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run, Harriet,\" Jack urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fled ahead and reached the next landing. The door to the top floor lay a yard away, closed. Behind her, Jack missed his footing in the dark and fell. He crashed two steps below. The pistol skated across the landing to Harriet\u0027s toes. She quickly gathered it up. As she straightened, lights through the tiny window in the stairwell door caught her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlashlights bobbled across the dark top floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnishen called out. \"We\u0027ll search through here and work down. Squeeze them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet turned. Jack scrabbled up toward her. Beyond his form, a dark shape rounded the lower stairs and bounded toward her husband. A thick growl flowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarriet lifted her pistol. If she fired, Annishen would hear the shot. Their captors would know where they were hiding and swarm here in seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnarling savagely, the massive dog leaped at her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7:58 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngkor Thom\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan stood a step away as Gray circled the central altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had taken them almost twenty minutes of backtracking and searching to discover the route up to the central sanctuary of the Bayon\u0027s third level. The ten-acre complex was a veritable maze of dark galleries, sudden sunlit courtyards, stooped passages, and precipitous drops. The low ceilings scraped heads, some walkways had to be traversed in single file, shuffling sideways, and many corridors merely dead-ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time they reached the small inner sanctuary, they were all dusty, covered in sweat. The morning had rapidly warmed, and humidity weighted the air down. But they had reached their destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s here,\" Nasser said sourly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan recognized his attitude, read the hard stance to his posture. She doubted his patience would last until noon. Unless there was some real progress soon, she expected he would end things in the next hour. Order Gray\u0027s parents killed. Execute all of them here. And move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver practical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo damn imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made him a dull lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, Gray circled the altar a third time. He was drawn thin, covered in dust and dirt, black hair plastered to his forehead, sticking out in damp tufts. Dried blood caked at his collar, where he\u0027d been pistol-whipped behind the ear by one of Nasser\u0027s men back at the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still refused to look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made her angry, mostly because it hurt, and she hated that even more. She sought that place of cold dispassion where she once easily lived, a dispassion that allowed her to sleep with Nasser to get what she needed, as she\u0027d been trained to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan turned her attention to the guards, going practical, strategizing some way out of here. The guards were mostly locals, including many former Khmer Rouge soldiers, long recruited by the Guild, gathered after the fall of the genocidal dictator Pol Pot. They would be fierce fighters. They guarded the four exits to the chamber, heading off in each cardinal direction. More men had taken posts throughout the ruins, discouraging tourists from disturbing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to what I read about this place, a giant statue of Buddha once rested here,\" the monsignor announced, pacing Gray around the altar. Vigor waved an arm across the two rectangular slabs, stair-stepped one atop the other. \"But when the religion changed to Hinduism, the Buddha was torn down and tossed into that large well we passed coming up here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only other bits of decoration in the stone room were four more shadowy faces of the bodhisattva Lokesvara. Only these were all gazing inward, toward the altar and its missing Buddha. Kowalski leaned against one face, staring upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe great central tower of the Bayon rose above the altar, climbing forty meters. Cored through its center like a chimney, a square shaft cut straight up to the sky above. It was the only source of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has to be the place,\" Gray said, finally stopping. \"There has to be a way down from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down to where?\" Nasser asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray lifted a hand toward the monsignor. \"Vigor mentioned how the foundations of this tower were buried underground. Deep. We need to find some access to those lower rooms. And I wager under the altar would be a good place to look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stepped next to him. \"Why do you think it\u0027s important?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray swiped the hair from his brow, plainly weighing how much to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser also read the man\u0027s hesitation. \"We\u0027re past another hour mark.\" He tapped a finger on his wristwatch. \"Tick tock, Commander.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-70.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
