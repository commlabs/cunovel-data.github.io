Apples too green for him to eat with relish, seeing that he had thought fit to waste one by throwing it on the stage.

Anybody might be a Scotland Yard \u0027tec with such a straight-forward clue to work on. Every Merry Man became a sleuth from that moment. After meals, when it was the custom of the school to throng into the common room for fifteen minutes or so before restarting work, they watched the Squirms out of the corners of their eyes, noting with what kind of apple each of them supplemented his diet. The cores of several varieties of both eating and cooking apples, and even those of sour crab apples, were picked clean and cast into the fire, but never once was a Squirm detected in the act of eating a russet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No good,\" declared Robin; \"it\u0027s \u0027nix\u0027, as the Yankees say.

The only way to \"buy him off\" was with food and sweetmeats, he being so greedily fond of both that he seemed, like some animals, to be always chewing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One half-holiday, passing through an empty class-room, he saw by the other door a paper-bag, through a slit in which a biscuit peeped.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hello!\" he muttered. \"Some clumsy idiot\u0027s dropped a bagful of fodder.\" Picking it up he opened the bag. \"Half-a-pound of mixed biscuits, mostly chocolate ones!
