It was reasonable that Lin Ming’s Samsara martial intent originated from the Buddhist belief. When Lin Ming first stepped onto the road of martial arts, the Samsara martial intent had played an extremely important role. However, afterwards, Lin Ming had used it less and less. This was because the Samsara martial intent was unable to follow his rapid rise in strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter all, the Sorcerer of the Southern Wilderness was only an ordinary powerhouse of the Divine Realm. The martial arts inheritances they left behind were naturally eliminated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd now, from Hang Chi, Lin Ming could see an even deeper level of the Samsara martial intent. In fact, it might even be a small portion of this transcendent divine might, the Wheel of Samsara!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf this were true then there was a tremendous amount of space for the Samsara martial intent to improve. Domain type skills were already extremely rare, and the Samsara martial intent was also related in many ways to the soul forging system. If Lin Ming could combine the two together, his soul forging system cultivation could reach a new level.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming was thinking this, on the arena stage, Xiao Moxian and Hang Chi’s battle had already reached a superheated phase.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo use the Samsara Domain to contend against the Heaven Absorbing Demon Art!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the skies, two massive vortexes tore at each other, energy recklessly surging outwards. The images of a gilded golden Buddha and a dark flaming phoenix appeared, dividing the world, struggling against each other! This fight was even more intense than the battle between Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Moxian’s Heaven Absorbing Demon Art failed to shake Hang Chi’s foundation in the end.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot to mention that Hang Chi had the Wheel of Samsara stabilizing his inner world, his thoughts and mind were extremely steadfast and unwavering.

From start to finish, Hang Chi had never attacked her. He had only countered Xiao Moxian’s attacks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, in such an intense collision of attacks, it was inevitable that there would be a backlash.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I don’t want to fight, I don’t want to fight anymore!” Xiao Moxian released her phoenix true form and pursed her mouth, saying, “If you aren’t going to let me hit you then at least pretend to be injured!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHang Chi faintly smiled. He folded his hands together, saying, “Junior-apprentice Sister Xiao Moxian’s moves are simply too strong. This poor monk is older than junior-apprentice sister by 12 years and is just around half over your age. Even so, my strength only barely surpasses yours. If I don’t try my best in battle and pretend to be injured, then I fear that I won’t be able to control it well enough and I will be severely beaten to the point of spitting out blood. I will really have failed then.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What a liar. Haven’t you already cultivated your incorruptible diamond Vajra body? How can I possibly wound you with one strike?” Xiao Moxian curled her lips, as if all of this was too funny.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut as the audience heard this exchange, all of them were shocked. Xiao Moxian had just admitted defeat like this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough the fight had been intense, the truth was that Hang Chi had maintained the upper hand from the start. It could be said that even though he was going easy on Xiao Moxian, he never used any of his true attack techniques.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMoreover, listening to Xiao Moxian’s meaning, Hang Chi’s defensive capabilities were also terrifying.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat diamond Vajra body must be some sort of secret Buddhist technique.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I’m speechless. He is too abnormal! His Laws are strong, his body is strong, his foundation is solid, and even his defense is amazing. Just who can defeat him?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Even the might of Hang Chi’s attacks are horrible.

It’s possible that Hang Chi might not be any worse than Frost Dream!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It looks like the first three rankings have already been settled. First and second place should belong to Frost Dream and Hang Chi. As for Lin Ming, he’s third! After that, I think that Xiao Moxian should be forth. As for fifth and sixth place, it will depend on the victor between Dragon Fang and Jun Bluemoon.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hang Chi is 38 years old! While he was cultivating for 38 years, do you really think he just wasted his time? Just look at Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian for instance and imagine what degree they’ll reach once they are 38 years old!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe First Martial Meeting was not absolutely fair.

Besides the unknown factor of Frost Dream, out of all the heroic young elites present, Hang Chi didn’t have the greatest talent but he was the strongest. Even someone as fierce as Xiao Moxian had been suppressed by him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I understand… two years from now, Dragon Fang will likely be the same as Hang Chi. If I did not train for two years and fought Dragon Fang again, then I would lose without a doubt.” In terms of talent within this First Martial Meeting, Xiao Moxian was the undisputed number one. Because Lin Ming had displayed the Concept of the 33 Layered Heavens, he had been listed as second. Frost Dream was an unknown, and Hang Chi, Jun Bluemoon, and Dragon Fang all had talent listed around third to sixth place.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMo Eversnow said, “There’s no need to hurry, you still have time.

To be first place on the Earth Proclamation was already a result to be proud of. He could only try his best for the Heaven Proclamation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter this round of matches concluded, Vast Cosmos announced the next round.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe first match was – Lin Ming against Hang Chi!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe second match was Xiao Moxian against Frost Dream.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe third match was Jun Bluemoon against Dragon Fang.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis time, the most tense match was between Jun Bluemoon and Dragon Fang. Vast Universe Heavenly Palace had specifically opened up a separate gambling bet for this match.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for Lin Ming against Hang Chi, or Xiao Moxian against Frost Dream, there was no separate bet set up for these two matches because there simply wasn’t anything worth gambling for. Although there was a slight chance that someone would cause an upset, the hope of that happening was too small. Even if Hang Chi’s compensation rates were extremely low, most people would likely still bet on him and Vast Universe Heavenly Palace would suffer a great loss.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It seems I really am fighting Hang Chi.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming took a deep breath. Without a doubt, this would be a difficult battle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFour hours of resting time later, the new round of matches officially began.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming opened his eyes from meditation and stepped onto the arena stage. As he walked on, he could see a young, bald monk wearing linen robes and straw sandals already standing on stage, smiling at him. Hang Chi had already been waiting on the arena stage for the last two hours, where he had been deep in meditation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Hang Chi saw Lin Ming walk on stage, he began to walk forwards until he was 1000 feet away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Benefactor Lin, this poor monk greets you.” Hang Chi pressed his palms together and bowed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming greeted him back with common martial arts courtesy. His impression towards Hang Chi wasn’t bad at all. This young monk held no earthly desires and was pure in heart and mind, only wishing to wholeheartedly cultivate. This sort of person wouldn’t have a poor moral character.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the audience saw the two people on the arena stage, all of them widened their eyes lest they miss the least bit of action.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany people believed that Hang Chi had the capability of fighting with Frost Dream. As for Lin Ming, his strength was evident to all. Although Lin Ming was inferior to Hang Chi, he should still be able to force out some of Hang Chi’s cards. This would surely be an intense battle!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Match, begin!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eVast Cosmos loudly proclaimed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith Vast Cosmos’s announcement, Hang Chi took out a long staff.

But now, his aura was solemn and dignified, deep and profound, his entire body containing a dreadful slumbering strength, just like a mountain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis monk robes fluttered about him. With any simple movement, there wasn’t the slightest flaw in his stance.

Lin Ming wasn’t polite – he immediately thrust out his spear. On the Phoenix Blood Spear, purple flames lit up. The first four level Concepts of Fire fused together, fusing onto the spear shaft along with the fifth level Concept.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eVirtual Disintegration!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming used the fifth level Laws from the start.

He brought his staff smashing down. With a brilliant light, the phantom of a bright Buddha appeared behind Hang Chi!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn fighting Lin Ming, Hang Chi didn’t use the Arhat Staff or other simple techniques like Leopard Climbing the Wall. He immediately summoned his Laws and Buddhist strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, those simple techniques weren’t useless at all, because they were already deeply ingrained into Hang Chi’s bones!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEvery single motion and movement of Hang Chi’s stemmed from the myriad 10 million senior supreme elders of Mount Potala; they were the total summary of their life experiences, all of them containing exquisite truths! In truth, the direct disciples of Mount Potala, from the very time they began to cultivate, whether it was using their fists, staffs, practicing movement techniques, or even drawing water, sweeping the floor, walking, eating, sleeping – every single thing they did had the mystery of martial skills fused within it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese simple moves couldn’t create an Empyrean, but when fighting someone at the same level, they would always give an advantage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHang Chi was in such a situation.

As someone that followed the Buddhist principles, Hang Chi had long severed himself from worldly sins and emotions like jealousy and hate, thus this virtual fire had nearly no influence on him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Benefactor Lin’s age is so low and yet your attainments in the Laws have reached such heights.
