Their memory is just as long, you see. And they do see their cause as being just.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, Precious spoke in a dark, gleeful tone. ‘You’re using them! The Malazans and all their pathetic arrogance! You K’Chain Che’Malle – you’re using them! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Destriant turned. ‘Does it seem that way, sorceress? I taste in you the pleasure of that thought.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why not? It’s all they deserve.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If it is all that they deserve, then it is all that we deserve.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just use them, Destriant. Use them up!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, Faint was no longer interested in entering the tent. She nodded towards it. ‘What’s going on in there, Destriant?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Krughava, once Mortal Sword of the Perish Grey Helms, speaks to Prince Brys Beddict. She warns him of betrayal. The Perish vowed to serve the Adjunct Tavore. Instead, they will draw swords against us. They will fight under the banner of the Forkrul Assail.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gods below – why would they do that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Precious was laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalyth sighed. ‘The truth is this: the standard of justice can be raised by many, and each may lay rightful claim to it. How are these claims weighed? Gesler would answer quickly enough. They are weighed on the field of battle. But … I am not so sure. The Perish claim to worship ancient war gods, and these—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Which war gods?’ Faint demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They are called Fanderay and Togg, the Wolves of Winter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaint turned, stared up at Precious, and then back at Kalyth. ‘And Krughava was the Mortal Sword. Who now commands?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Shield Anvil, Tanakalian.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And the Destriant? There should be a Destriant among them, right?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He died on the voyage, I am told. The position is still vacant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No it isn’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Leave it, Faint,’ said Precious. ‘You don’t know. You can’t be certain—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t be an idiot. You saw her eyes – those were a wolf’s eyes. And all her talk about the ghosts, and the old crimes, and all the rest.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalyth spoke. ‘I do not understand. Of whom do you speak?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit . Faint turned back to the tent. ‘Seems I need to go in there after all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The forgiving embrace must be earned,’ Shield Anvil Tanakalian said. ‘Am I of such little worth that the cowards and fools among you can demand my blessing?’ He scanned the faces before him, saw their exhaustion, and was disgusted. ‘You come to me again and again. You ask, is this not the time to elect a new Mortal Sword? A new Destriant? Perhaps it is. Perhaps I am but waiting … for one of you to rise above the others, to show us all your worthiness. Alas, I am still waiting.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes regarding him from beneath the rims of the helms were bleak, beaten down. The camp behind these officers had lost its orderliness. Discipline had given way to bestial indifference, the torrid pace of the march their only excuse. They had crossed the border into Central Kolanse two days past, trudged down a road already overgrown, through towns little more than burned stains. This was a land returning to the wild, yet it stank of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It must be,’ said Tanakalian, ‘that for now one man shall suffer the burden of all three titles. I did not ask for this. I do not welcome it. Ambition is a poison – we all saw what it did to Krughava. Must we now invite a return to that madness? I am not—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped then, as a sudden breath of ice flowed past him. He saw the officers facing him recoil, saw a stirring ripple through the ranks assembled behind them. Mists lifted from the ground, curled and roiled on all sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is this? Who has come among us? He started – something caught in the corner of his eye. A flash of movement. Then another. Low, the whisper of fur, a lurid glint from burning eyes. Sudden shouts from the Perish, the ranks losing formation, weapons hissing from scabbards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanakalian could feel the buffeting tide sweeping past him. Invisible forms slid past his legs, pushed him off balance. He spun round, glared into the darkness. ‘Show yourselves!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure, coming up from beyond the road’s berm. A girl, wearing rags. But he could see the flowing shapes now, the ethereal forms surrounding her. Wolves. She comes in a sea of wolves . But they were not real. Not living. Not breathing. These beasts were long dead. They bore wounds. Stains in the fur, gashes in the hide. The glow from their eyes was otherworldly, like holes burned through a wall – and what lay beyond was rage. Incandescent rage . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-277.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
