Gray stone columns soared up to a vaulted ceiling. Endless rows of wooden pews faced the altar, and stained glass windows glinted in the dim light of prayer candles. Their footsteps echoed on the stone tiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There!\" Dan yelled. A door stood open on their left -- a steep flight of stairs leading up. Amy latched the door behind them, but she knew it wouldn\u0027t hold the Holts for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey scrambled up the stairs. Dan started wheezing. Amy put her arm around him and half carried him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp, up, up. She hadn\u0027t realized the bell tower could be so high. Finally, she found a trapdoor and threw it open. Rain poured down on her face. They climbed into the belfry, which was open to the storm on all sides. A bronze bell the size of a file cabinet sat in one corner. It looked like it hadn\u0027t been rung in centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me!\" Amy cried. She could hardly move the bell, but together, they managed to drag it on top of the trapdoor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That-should-hold,\" Dan wheezed. \"Little-while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy leaned out the side of the tower, into the rain and darkness. The graveyard looked impossibly far below. The cars on the street looked like the Matchbox toys Dan used to play with. Amy groped along the stone wall outside the window. Her fingers closed around a cold metal bar. A tiny set of rungs was embedded in the side of the tower, leading up to the steeple, about ten feet above her. If she fell...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay here,\" she ordered Dan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Sis, you can\u0027t -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to. Here, take this.\" She gave him the paper that had been wrapped around the vial. \"Keep that dry and hidden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan stuffed it into his pants. \"Sis ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked terrified. Amy realized more than ever how alone they were in the world. All they had was each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed his shoulder. \"I\u0027ll make it back, Dan. Don\u0027t worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bell shuddered as someone underneath, someone very strong, slammed into the trapdoor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy slipped the glass vial into her pocket and swung one leg out the window, into open darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could barely hang on. Rain stung her eyes. She didn\u0027t dare look down. She concentrated on the next rung of the ladder, and slowly, she pulled herself up onto the slanted tile roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she was at the peak. An old iron lightning rod pointed into the sky. At its base was a metal ring like a tiny basketball hoop, and below that a grounding wire, just like Franklin had recommended in his early experiments. Amy lashed the wire around her wrist, then took out the vial. It was so slippery she almost lost it. Carefully, she slipped it into the iron ring -- a perfect fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inched back down the roof. \"Please,\" she thought, holding on tight to the rungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have to wait long. The hair stood up on the back of her neck. She smelled something like burning aluminum foil, and then,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCRACCCCK!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky exploded. Sparks rained down all around her, hissing on the wet tiles. Dazed, she lost her balance and skittered down the roof. She grabbed frantically and caught a rung so hard pain shot up her wrist. But she held on and began to climb back to the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass vial was glowing. The green liquid inside was no longer murky and slimy. It seemed to be made of pure green light, trapped in glass. Carefully, Amy touched it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no shock. It wasn\u0027t even warm. She slipped the vial out of its brace and put it back in her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs thou charge this, so I charge thee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hardest part was still to come. She had to get away safely and figure out what she\u0027d just created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dan! I did it!\" She climbed back into the bell tower, but her smile melted. Dan was lying on the floor, bound and gagged. Standing over him, in black combat fatigues, was Ian Kabra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, cousin.\" Ian held out a plastic syringe. \"I\u0027ll trade you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MMMM!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan struggled and tried to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MMMM! MMMM!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let -- let him go!\" Amy stammered. She was sure her face was bright red. She hated that she was stuttering again. Why did Ian Kabra turn her tongue to lead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bronze bell shuddered. The Holts were still pounding away below, trying to get through the trapdoor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You only have a few seconds before they come up,\" Ian warned. \"Besides, your brother needs the antidote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy\u0027s stomach clenched. \"Wh-what have you done to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing that can\u0027t be reversed if you act in the next minute or so.\" Ian dangled the antidote. \"Give me Franklin\u0027s vial. It\u0027s a fair trade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MMM!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan shook his head violently, but Amy couldn\u0027t risk losing him. Nothing was worth that. Not a clue. Not a treasure. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held out the glowing green vial. Ian took it and she snatched the antidote out of his hand. She knelt next to Dan and started tugging at the gag in his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan chuckled. \"Nice doing business with you, cousin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll -- you\u0027ll never make it out of the tower. You\u0027re trapped up here the same as -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something occurred to her. How had Ian gotten up here in the first place? She noticed straps running across his chest, like a climbing harness. At his feet lay a bundle of metal poles and black silk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another thing Franklin loved.\" Ian picked up his bundle and began fastening the black silk to the metal frame. \"Kites. He pulled himself across the Charles River with one, did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t have -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes I did.\" He pointed to the glowing dome of the larger church at the top of the hill. \"I sailed right down from Sacr√©-Coeur. And now I\u0027m going to sail right out again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a thief,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIan hooked his harness to the huge black kite. \"Not a thief, Amy. A Lucian, the same as Benjamin Franklin. Whatever is in this vial, it belongs to the Lucians. I think old Ben would appreciate the irony of this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, Ian jumped out of the belfry. The wind took him. The kite must\u0027ve been specially designed to support a human\u0027s weight, because Ian sailed smoothly down over the graveyard and fence and landed at a controlled run on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere out in the storm, police sirens screamed. The bell shuddered as the Holt family pounded against the trapdoor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MMMM!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dan!\" Amy had completely forgotten him. She ripped off his gag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow!\" he complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just hold still. I\u0027ve got the antidote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ian was bluffing!\" Dan groaned. \"I was trying to tell you. He didn\u0027t give me anything!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not poisoned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Positive! That stuff he gave you is useless. Or maybe it\u0027s poison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgusted with herself for being so stupid, Amy threw down the syringe. She untied Dan and helped him stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bronze bell shuddered once more and lurched aside. The trapdoor burst open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEisenhower Holt climbed into the belfry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re too late,\" Dan told him. \"Ian took it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed toward the street. A cab had just pulled up with Natalie Kabra in back. Ian climbed in and they took off through the streets of Montmartre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Holt growled. \"I\u0027ll make you both pay for this. I\u0027ll-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSirens wailed louder. The first police car appeared around the corner, blue lights flashing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad!\" Reagan\u0027s voice called up from the stairs. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second police car appeared, racing toward the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re leaving,\" Eisenhower decided. He shouted down to his family: \"Everybody, about face!\" He took one last look at Amy and Dan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let the threat hang in the air and left Amy and Dan alone in the tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy looked out into the rain. She spotted Uncle Alistair hobbling away down a side street, a Fudgesicle stuck to the back of his cherry-red suit. Irina Spasky 212\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estaggered out the front of the church, saw the police, and broke into a run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arretez!\" a policeman cried, and two of them started after her. Nellie was standing on the sidewalk with a few more officers. She was yelling frantically in French, pointing to the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite all the chaos, Amy felt strangely calm. Dan was alive. They\u0027d survived the night. She\u0027d done exactly what she needed to do. A smile crept over her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you so happy?\" Dan complained. \"We lost the second big clue. We\u0027ve failed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Amy said. \"We haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan stared at her. \"Did that lightning fry your brain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dan, the vial wasn\u0027t the clue,\" she said. \"That was just... well, I\u0027m not sure what it was. A gift from Benjamin Franklin. Something to help in the search. But the real clue is that piece of paper you stuffed in your pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan was thrilled that the second clue had been safely smuggled out of the church in his pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, really, I saved the day,\" he decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I climbed onto the roof in the middle of a thunderstorm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but the clue was in my pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy rolled her eyes. \"You\u0027re right, Dan. You are the real hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNellie cracked a smile. \"You both did pretty good, if you ask me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were sitting together at a caf√© on the Champs-√©lys√©es, watching the pedestrians and enjoying more pain au chocolat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the morning after the storm. The sky was blue. They\u0027d already packed their bags and checked out of the Maison des Gordons. All things considered, Dan felt lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still had some doubts about what they\u0027d gone through. In particular, he didn\u0027t like that Ian and Natalie had gotten away. He\u0027d hated being tied up, and he wanted to get back at Ian. But it could\u0027ve been worse. At least they hadn\u0027t gotten lost forever in the Catacombs or slammed in the face with a box of ice cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still want to know what was in that vial, though,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy twirled her hair thoughtfully. \"Whatever it is, it\u0027s supposed to give one team an advantage freeing the truth -- that has to mean the final treasure of the contest. Since Ian and Natalie have the vial ... well, I\u0027ve got a bad feeling we\u0027ll find out what it does pretty quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If these Lucian dudes created it,\" Nellie said, chewing on her croissant, \"maybe it\u0027s like some special kind of poison. They seem to love poisons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Dan said, though the answer felt wrong. He still didn\u0027t like the idea that Ben Franklin was related to Ian and Natalie. He\u0027d started to admire Franklin -- what with the fart essays and the lightning and all. Now he wasn\u0027t sure if old Ben was a good guy or a bad guy. \"But what would poison have to do with a piece of sheet music?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy took the parchment out of her backpack and spread it on the table. Dan had already studied it a dozen times. He knew it was an exact copy of the song they\u0027d seen engraved on the stone pedestal in the secret room, but he didn\u0027t know why it was important. When he\u0027d woken up that morning, Amy had already been researching on his laptop. Usually she didn\u0027t like the Internet. For some weird reason, she said books were better, so Dan knew she must\u0027ve been really desperate for information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found it online,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" Dan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did a search for Benjamin Franklin plus music. It came up right away. That\u0027s an adagio for armonica.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-maze-of-bones-the-39-clues-1/page-23.html","bookId":1546,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:27 PM"}
