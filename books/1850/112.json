Then I turned my head and put my lips to Hawk’s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think you could make a call so the Feds don’t do a cavity search on Troy?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawk lifted his head and looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he answered, his lips twitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think, before Ginger goes back to the Feds, Dad and Meredith can visit with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes warmed and he repeated, “Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I nodded, relaxing into him. “Now do you think, since you’ve been close enough to touch for at least five minutes and you’re safe and healthy enough to get pissed at me, you could finally kiss me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes got warmer and he added intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand slid up to cup his head. “Then kiss me, baby,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared into my eyes then his head slanted and, just like Hawk, he gave me what I wanted most in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpilogue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive Me the Dimples\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCabe Delgado waited while the garage door opened then he pulled his Camaro in beside Gwen’s Mustang. He parked, grabbed his workout bag from the seat beside him and folded out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked in front of the Mustang and saw the Expedition sitting on the other side of the ‘Stang. Gwen called it the “station wagon” and hated driving it because it was so huge. However Hawk had a rule. She had their boys in the car with her, she was in the Expedition. She was off on her own, she could take the Mustang. She gave him lip, told him he was too damned bossy but only because that was what she did. She knew the Expedition was safer and Gwen would do anything to keep her boys safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked in front of the Expedition, through the door that led into the house and dumped his bag in the utility room on his way to the huge, open plan kitchen. She’d left the under the counter lights on for him. He moved through the space and turned off the lights, heading to the wide, carpeted staircase that had a nightlight lit in an outlet halfway up. He didn’t need her to light his way but she did it anyway partially because, if one of the boys got up, she wanted them to have light and partially because, when her man got home she wanted him to know she was thinking about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d lied to Gwen although he didn’t know it at the time. He needed space. Or, more accurately, he needed a Hawk and Gwen zone, he needed to give his boys their zones and they all needed a family zone. So he’d moved his family from Gwen’s farmhouse to this five bedroom, three car garage “monstrosity” as Gwen called it. She only allowed the move because it came with Janine cleaning it. She said she had a life rule and that rule was that she refused to live in a house that it took longer than two hours to clean. Now she lived in a house that took longer than two hours to clean, Hawk just made it so she didn’t have to clean it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe silently climbed the staircase, turned right and moved through the large open space at the top, one of the many family zones. He didn’t see the pictures but he knew they were there. Gwen decorated in photos. She wasn’t a knick knack sort of woman, thank f**k.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawk liked the way his wife decorated. There were pictures everywhere, on every surface, on all the walls, hell, you could barely see the fridge for the photos tacked to it. There were pictures of her, of him, of their two boys, their families, their friends – alone, in pairs, in huddles, all candid, nothing posed, nearly every photo everyone was smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there were pictures of Simone and Sophie. Gwen had conspired with his mother and made certain Simone and Sophie had their places amongst her décor and his woman decorated in family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took awhile to get used to this, it took awhile for the pain of seeing them every day to dull. Then it dulled. Then he saw what was in the photos instead of felt the loss of it. And what was in the photos were memories. Those memories were bittersweet but, with time, and with Gwen’s guidance, the sweet outweighed the bitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawk turned right again at the first door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked in and saw Asher asleep in his bed on his belly wearing loose shorts and a t-shirt, his black hair a mess, his limbs splayed, taking up more space than any four year old kid should in a double bed. The covers had been kicked off. Even as a baby, he’d kicked off his covers. Ash liked to be free. No restraints. Even in sleep. Hawk’s Mom said he’d done the same thing and Hawk learned not to be surprised at this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsher was his boy in more ways than one. Ash was intense, always had been from nearly the instant he left Gwen’s womb. And if Hawk was home, Asher was with him. From the second he could crawl, when Hawk opened the door to the house, Asher would be sitting on his ass, staring at the door, waiting for his Dad to walk in. It wasn’t clingy. Even as an infant, Asher had been able to entertain himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just liked to do it close to his Dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawk walked to him and bent, doing what he did frequently, in fact every night he got home when his boys were asleep. He rested his hand light on the heat of his son’s back and felt him breathe. Once his son’s life communicated itself through Hawk’s hand, he lifted that hand and slid it over Asher’s thick hair. Then he left the room, crossed the hall and entered another door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruno was on his back, one arm thrown wide, one knee up and dropped, the other leg straight, hand on his belly. Covers half-on, half-off. The stuffed bear with an ill-fitting Broncos t-shirt had fallen from his outstretched hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruno sat quietly on his Granddad’s lap during every Broncos home game. It was f**king uncanny but Hawk could swear his two year old son’s study of the game was more intense than Bax’s. Even if a game was on TV, Bruno would stop, sit his ass down and stare at it. If he was awake, he was wearing a football helmet and if Hawk or Gwen tried to take it off him, the kid pitched one helluva fit. So they let him wear it everywhere but to the dinner table and to bed. This was a good call considering when Bruno wasn’t eating, watching football on television or wrestling with his brother, he was tackling shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawk bent, his hand going to Bruno’s chest, resting lightly and his eyes roamed his son’s face as his hand felt his son’s heartbeat. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mystery-man-dream-man-1/page-112.html","bookId":1850,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM"}
