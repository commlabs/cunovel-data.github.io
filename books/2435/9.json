She was thrown back, in one instant, to the moment when she and Tom and the others had been sucked into the Game, dragged into the Shadow World. She felt the same riptide dragging at her now, the same dark fog overcoming her senses. The same mindless, helpless terror. She was falling into the emptiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t faint. She wished she could, but she didn\u0027t. She hung in his arms, barely supporting her own weight, feeling darkness all around her, and remained conscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to kill her. He was the voice on the phone. He\u0027d sent the Shadow Wolf after her and Audrey, he\u0027d sent the snake after her in computer class. He\u0027d killed Gordie Wilson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could still hear the distorted, malign whisper in her head: \"Famished...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny sobbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheer terror gave her the strength to take her own weight again, to try and get free again. To her astonishment, he let her. She reeled backward two steps and came up against the balcony railing. Then she just stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer first thought was that she should have been more prepared-but there was no way to prepare for Julian. He was always a shock to the senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes behind the black mask were like liquid cobalt. His entire face was shadowed. His hair shone in the dimness, as white as moonlight on water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t like a human. He was sharper, fiercer, brighter than any human could be. More real-which was strange, since this was supposed to be the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in her world now, not even in some halfway place like the More Games store which seemed to exist between the worlds. He was here, walking around, capable of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just now he radiated menace. Danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s heart was beating so hard and erratically that she thought she might shatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yellow roses mean infidelity, you know,\" he said casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered his voice now. Once away from it, she\u0027d forgotten. She\u0027d only remembered what she\u0027d thought about it, which was that it was musical and elemental, like water running over rock, but that didn\u0027t really give any sense of its beauty-or its coldness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put a hand to the cluster of miniature roses at her shoulder. The lovely pale flowers with their golden sheen. In her mind she saw Brian blinking at the sight of them, heard him saying, \"The florist must have screwed up... . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sent them,\" she said. Her voice came out oddly-choked and so openly frightened that she was ashamed. She wanted to tear the roses off, but her hands were shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Didn\u0027t you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should have known, but she\u0027d been too stupid, All night she\u0027d been too stupid. She had gone off with a boy in a mask because he didn\u0027t look like Julian, forgetting that Julian could look like anyone he wanted. Or had she forgotten? Maybe some part of her had known, and had wanted to get it over with, She\u0027d been so frightened for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith good reason. The last time she\u0027d been with Julian, she\u0027d betrayed him. She\u0027d lied to him, made him believe her-maybe even trust her. And then she\u0027d slammed a door on him, meaning to trap him behind it forever. She\u0027d left him imprisoned like a genie in a bottle. She could only imagine what he must have felt when he realized what she\u0027d done. Now he\u0027d come for his revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you just do it?\" she said. She was more pleased with her voice this time; it was clear, if not quite steady. She\u0027d die with dignity. \"Go ahead and kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tilted his silvery-blond head slightly. \"Is that what I want to do?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what you did to Gordie son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled-oh, God, she\u0027d forgotten that smile, Wolf-hungry. The sort of smile to send you running and screaming-or to make you collapse in a heap on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not personally,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s what you brought me here for, isn\u0027t it?\" Jenny glanced back at the drop behind her. Her fragile composure was splintering. Hysteria was bubbling up inside her, and she couldn\u0027t stop it. If he wasn\u0027t going to throw her over, then maybe she ought to jump, because dying fast would be better than whatever he was going to do with her... . \"Just go ahead and do it. Just get it over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said, and kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d thought she remembered how it was with Julian, how it felt to be kissed by him. Her memories had lied. Or maybe this kind of thing was too strong for memory to be anything but a shadow of it. In one instant she was transported back to the paper house, back to the shock she\u0027d felt at his first touch. When Tom held her-back in the old days, when Tom still loved her-his arms had made her feel safe. Comforted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian didn\u0027t make her feel safe at all. She was trembling instantly. Falling. Soaring. The electricity he carried around with him flooding into her, tingling in every nerve ending. Sweet shocks that sent her mind reeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, I can\u0027t-it\u0027s wrong. It\u0027s wrong, he\u0027s evil. I can\u0027t feel anything for him. I told Tom I didn\u0027t feel anything... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body didn\u0027t listen to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants to kill me... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was kissing her as softly as twilight, tiny sweet kisses and long ones that turned wild. As if they were lovers reunited, instead of hunter and prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jenny was kissing him back. Her arms were around his neck. He changed the pressure of his lips on hers and light flashed through her. She opened her eyes in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny,\" Julian said, not moving away, speaking with his lips brushing hers. He sounded glad-exalted. Full of discovery. \"You see how it is with us? You can\u0027t fight it any more than I can. You\u0027ve tried; you\u0027ve done everything you can to kill it. But you can\u0027t kill my love for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jenny whispered. His face was so close, the mask making him look more dangerous than ever. He was terrifying-and beautiful. She couldn\u0027t look away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were meant to be together. It\u0027s our destiny. You\u0027ve put up a good fight, but it\u0027s over now. Give in, Jenny. Let me love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" With sudden strength she pushed him-hard. Shoving him away. The force sent her backward against the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFury swept over his face. Then it ebbed and he sighed deeply. \"You\u0027re going to fight to the end, aren\u0027t you? All right. You\u0027re exciting when you\u0027re angry, and personally I\u0027m starved for the sight of you. In fact, you might say I\u0027m famished-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like the dress,\" he continued, as if she hadn\u0027t spoken. \"In a purely aesthetic sense, of course. And I like your hair like that. It makes you look wild and beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrifyingly, Jenny felt wild and beautiful. Felt desirable. It wasn\u0027t right, but his eyes on her made her feel as if no one had ever been as beautiful as she was, since the beginning of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she never stopped feeling frightened, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand. She felt-not saw, because she couldn\u0027t take her eyes from his-something slip onto her finger. A cold circlet. A ring. She felt the chill of it all around her as if she\u0027d been banded with ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gold ring she\u0027d thrown away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian said, as if quoting:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This ring, the symbol of my oath, Will hold me to the words I speak: All I refuse and thee I choose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny shut her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you remember? I told you the promise was irrevocable. You are sworn mine, Jenny. Now and forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Darkness had taken on a face and a voice, if the powers of night had gathered themselves together and formed themselves into a human being, they would have made something like Julian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike some horrible old movie, yes. Bride of the Devil. She\u0027d promised herself to him, and now she had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr at least some part of her believed that. A part of her she hadn\u0027t even known existed before she\u0027d met Julian. A part that had changed her recently, so that people noticed. The wild part, a part that craved risks. Like the thing in Dee that loved danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was this part that responded to him, that found the rest of the world tame by comparison. The part that made her heart pound and her stomach melt. Her knees literally felt weak-the way they had after the last big earthquake in L.A., when the ground did things solid ground wasn\u0027t supposed to do, when she\u0027d thought she was going to die. Afterward, her legs had actually felt like wax. The way they did now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve only come to claim what\u0027s mine. You cast your own fate, Jenny, you doomed yourself. That\u0027s the way it works with runes and oaths. You spoke the words, you let them be written, and that\u0027s it. Didn\u0027t you ever think you\u0027d have to make good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny didn\u0027t know what she\u0027d thought. She\u0027d done it to save Tom and the others-she would have done anything to save them at that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was-I couldn\u0027t-it wasn\u0027t fair,\" she said, fumbling. She was at a disadvantage; she couldn\u0027t think properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair-let\u0027s not get on that again. Life isn\u0027t fair. That\u0027s not the point. You promised yourself to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny opened her mouth to explain, but she couldn\u0027t seem to summon up any words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the terrible thing was that he was right, There was no real way to justify what she\u0027d done. She\u0027d given him her word. She\u0027d sworn the oath, knowing it would bind her forever. And she supposed the shameful truth was that she\u0027d hoped to get rid of Julian so that he couldn\u0027t collect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one finger Julian sketched some lines in the air, a shape like a vase turned on its side. \"That\u0027s Perthro, the rune of gambling and divination. It\u0027s the cup that holds the runes or dice when they\u0027re cast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really?\" Jenny said weakly, not having the first idea what he was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you something interesting about the people who discovered those runes. They loved gambling. Crazy about it. They would bet everything -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eincluding their freedom-on one throw of the dice. And if they lost, they\u0027d go into slavery cheerfully, because they had made a promise and they always played by the rules. Honor meant more than anything to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked away, hugging her own arms. She felt very cold. She wished there were somewhere to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to keep your promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could she say? That it was a promise she never should have had to make? Julian had forced her to play the Game in the beginning-but Jenny had come to him looking for a game. Looking for something scary and sexy, something to provide excitement at a party. Julian had just given her what she\u0027d asked for. It was her own fault for meddling with forbidden things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t-she couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeeth sunk into her lower lip, she looked at Julian. She could hardly meet his eyes, but she did. She shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere. Now it was out. She didn\u0027t have any excuses, but she wasn\u0027t going to keep her word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I could just make you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. It was what she expected. But at least she wouldn\u0027t have gone to him willingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to look down at the ocean, and Jenny waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you say we play another game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no,\" Jenny whispered, but he was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could just force you-but I\u0027ll give you a sporting chance. One throw of the dice, Jenny. One more game. If you win, you\u0027re free of the promise. If you lose, you keep it.\" He turned back to look at her, and in the eyeholes of the mask she could see midnight blue. \"Do you want to play, or do we just resolve this here and now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t panic-think. It\u0027s your only chance. It\u0027s better than no chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the wild part in her was responding to his j challenge, surging to meet it. Danger. Risk. Excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One throw of the dice,\" she said softly. \"I\u0027ll play.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed her the wolfish smile. \"No holds barred, then. No quarter asked or given-for any of the players.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny froze. \"Wait a minute-\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you think I was going to fool around? This game is deadly serious-like the last one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s between us,\" Jenny said desperately. \"Just you and me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" The eyes behind the mask were narrow. \"This is a game for the original players, for everyone who was in the paper house. No more and no less. On my side, myself and the Creeper and the Lurker. On your side-everyone who helped trick me and betray me. I\u0027m going to catch them one by one, starting with Little Red Riding-Hood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wo, \"Jenny said, in terror. Oh, God, what had she done? Summer had died in the last Game....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And it starts now. Ready or not, here I come. Find my base and you can stop me from taking them to the Shadow World.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taking who-?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your friends. Find them after I take them and you all go free. If not\"-he smiled-\"I keep them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny didn\u0027t understand. Panic was rioting inside her. She wasn\u0027t ready-she didn\u0027t know the rules. She didn\u0027t even know what game they were playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julian-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick as a cat, quick as a striking snake, he kissed her. A hard kiss, and Jenny was responding before she knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was over, he held her tightly to his chest a moment. She could hear his heart beating-just like a human heart, she thought dizzily. Then he whispered in her ear, \"The new game is lambs and monsters.\" And he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGone from the balcony, just like that. The warmth dissolved from Jenny\u0027s arms, and she was standing alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hear the music again. It might all have been a dream, but she could still feel Julian\u0027s hard kiss on her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadows on the balcony had lightened in his absence. Jenny looked around fearfully. Julian had said that the Game would start now. Julian didn\u0027t say things he didn\u0027t mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t see anything unusual. The dance was going on inside the ballroom. Jenny turned and gripped the railing of the balcony, looking over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpotlights softly lit the beach below. One of them caught the glint of copper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey! That was Audrey down there, and the dark-haired figure beside her must be Eric. They were yards away from the other people on the sand, walking hand in hand down the beach. Into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Game starts now.... I\u0027m going to catch them one by one, starting with Little Red Riding-Hood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed-like Audrey\u0027s hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Audrey! Audrey!\" Jenny screamed. Her voice disappeared into the background of music without even a ripple. She could feel how small and faint it was compared to the roaring of the ocean. Jenny looked around wildly; there was no way from the balcony down to the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey and Eric were walking out of the range of the lights now, heading into the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Audrey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey didn\u0027t hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about dances always went to Audrey\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, she didn\u0027t really like Eric, the boy she was presently kissing. She just couldn\u0027t help it-something about dances got to her. All the lights-and the dark corners. The sparkly dresses and the compliments and the music. It was better than shopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Eric was a pretty good kisser, for an American boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot as good as Michael, though. Michael Cohen was a world-class kisser, although you\u0027d never think it to look at him. It was one of the best-kept secrets at Vista Grande High, and Audrey meant it to remain that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a slight twinge of guilt, thinking of Michael. Well, but she\u0027d told him she didn\u0027t care about Eric. She was doing it to help Jenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was up in the hotel trying to deal with Brian and his unwanted attentions. Maybe it was time Audrey did something about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric,\" she said, detaching herself and neatening her hair. \"We\u0027d better get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to protest, but Audrey was already turning. She hadn\u0027t realized how far they\u0027d walked away from the lights of the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" she said uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had only taken a few steps when she caught movement out of the corner of her eye. It was on her left, on the land side. Something in the shadows, a quick bright flicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe just some small animal or bird. \"Eric, come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sulking. \"You go, if you want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, fine. She began walking as quickly as she could. Her bare feet sank with each step into the soft, crumbly, faintly damp sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hotel spotlights seemed miles away. The ocean stretched out to her right, unimaginably vast. To her left darkness blanketed a slope covered with ice plant. Between the darkness and the sea, Audrey felt small and vulnerable in comparison. It was a bad feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned suddenly and looked into the darkness. She couldn\u0027t see anything now. Maybe nothing was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she heard a cry behind her. Audrey whirled, straining to see in the darkness. Something was going on back there-some kind of activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric? Eric!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother cry. And, louder, a terrible sound that Audrey could hear over the ocean. A guttural, vibrating snarl. A bestial noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSand was spraying. Audrey could see some kind of thrashing. \"Eric! Eric, what\u0027s happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thrashing had stopped. Audrey took an uncertain step forward. \"Eric?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething glimmered, coming toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot Eric. Something blue and shining. Like an optical illusion, there and then gone. Audrey tried to make her eyes focus-and the lost time was fatal. By the time she saw it clearly it was almost on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God-it was unbelievable. In the Shadow World the wolf had looked like a wolf. Huge, massive, but just a wolf. This thing ... was a phantom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike something painted with luminous paint on the air. Nothing in between the brush strokes. Not exactly a skeleton-something worse. A specter. A wraith-wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe growling was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey turned and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was right behind her. She could hear its growling over the roar of the ocean, over her own sobbing breath. Her legs were beginning to ache already. The thick sand sucked at her, dragging her down. It was like running in slow motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was closer to the lights. If she could just get there-but it was too far. She would never make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground opened up in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was what it looked like. A hole, black against the gray sand. Black with flickering electric-blue edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sand that had been her enemy helped her now, allowed her to catch herself and fall to her knees. She fell right on the brink of the hole, staring down in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod-God. It was like nothing she had ever seen. Endless blackness forever. Down at the very bottom there might have been the shimmer of a blue flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey didn\u0027t want to see any more. She staggered to her feet and ran toward the slope on her left. If she could climb up through the ice plant-maybe she could lose herself there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was fast. It came up on her left side, cutting her off, forcing her to swerve. It turned with her, forcing her to swerve again. To circle back toward the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey stumbled again and heard a snarl right behind her. Hot breath on her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have the breath to scream, although there was a screaming in her brain. She clawed her way up and was running again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way it wanted her to go. She realized that too late. The hole was in front of her, almost beneath her feet. She couldn\u0027t stop herself this time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-chase-the-forbidden-game-2/page-9.html","bookId":2435,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:26 PM"}
