He glanced down the beach. While collecting samples, he and Graff had traveled past a spit of land. Their Zodiac lay beached beyond the rocky point, out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk shaded his eyes. Was their Aussie pilot moving the boat closer to them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff joined him. \"It\u0027s too early to go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spat of rifle fire echoed over the water as a blue-hulled, scarred speedboat shot around the point. Monk spotted seven men in the rear, their heads wrapped in scarves. Sun glinted off assault rifles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff gasped, backing into him. \"Pirates. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk shook his head. Oh, that\u0027s just great. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat turned toward them and skimmed through the chop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk grabbed Graff by the collar and tugged him off the sunlit beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePiracy was on the rise worldwide, but the Indonesian waters had always been rife with such cutthroats. The many islands and small atolls, the thousand secret ports, the thick jungles. All of it created the perfect breeding ground. And after the recent tsunami in the region, the number of local pirates had boomed, taking advantage of the chaos and the thin stretch of policing resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed this current tragedy proved no different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperate times bred desperate men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut who was desperate enough to risk these waters? Monk noted the gunmen were wrapped from head to toe in their own makeshift bio-suits. Had they heard the toxic levels were dropping here and decided to risk an assault?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Monk retreated from the water\u0027s edge, he glanced in the direction of their beached boat. Among the islands, their Zodiac boat would fetch a pretty penny on the black market, not to mention all their expensive research equipment. Monk also noted the lack of return fire by their Zodiac\u0027s pilot. Caught by surprise, the Australian sailor must have been taken out in the first assault. He also had their only radio. Cut off, they were on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk pictured Lisa aboard the cruise ship. The Australian Coast Guard cutter patrolled the waters around the tiny port. At least she should be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliffs cut off any retreat. To either side, empty beaches stretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk dragged Graff behind a tumbled boulder, the only shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speedboat aimed toward them. Gunfire chattered, pocking the sand in an arrow toward their hiding place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk pulled them lower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for that lazy day at the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:42 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Lisa Cummings smeared the anesthetic cream across the back of the crying girl. Her mother held her hand. The woman was Malaysian and spoke in soft whispers, her almond eyes pinched in worry. The combination of lido-caine and prilocaine quickly soothed the burn across the child\u0027s back, dissolving the girl\u0027s pained cries into sobs and tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She should be fine,\" Lisa said, knowing the mother was employed as a waitress at one of the local hotels and spoke English. \"Make sure she takes the antibiotics three times a day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman bowed her head. \"Terima kasih. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa nodded her toward a group of men and women in blue-and-white uniforms, the staff of the Mistress of the Seas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the crew will find a cabin for you and your daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother bow of her head, but Lisa was already turning away, stripping off her gloves with a snap. The dining room on the Lido Deck of the Mistress of the Seas had become the major triage point for the entire ship. Each evacuee from the island was examined and divided into critical and noncritical cases. Lisa, with the least experience in crisis medicine, had been assigned to first aid. To assist her, she was given a nursing student from Sydney, a skinny young man named Jesspal of Indian descent, a volunteer from the WHO medical staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made an odd couple: one blond and pale, the other dark-haired and coffee-skinned. But they operated like an experienced team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessie, how are we doing on the cephalexin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should last, Dr. Lisa.\" He shook the large bottle of antibiotics with one hand while filling out paperwork with the other. The young man knew how to multitask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnugging the green scrub pants higher on her hips, Lisa glanced around her. No one waited for immediate care. The rest of the dining room remained in a state of subdued chaos, punctuated by cries and occasional shouts, but for the moment, their station was an island of calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the bulk of the islanders have been evacuated,\" Jessie said. \"I heard the last two tenders from the docks arrived only half full. I think we\u0027re seeing the dribs and drabs from the smaller outlying villages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had treated over a hundred and fifty patients during the course of the interminable morning, cases of burns, blisters, racking coughs, dysentery, nausea, a wrist sprain from a fall at the docks. Yet she had only seen a fraction of all the cases. The cruise ship had arrived at the island last night, and the evacuation had been well under way by the time she arrived at daybreak, flown in by helicopter. It required her to hit the ground running. The tiny, remote island had held over two thousand inhabitants. Though quarters were tight, the ship should accommodate the entire populace, especially as the number of dead had tragically climbed past four hundred . . . and was still rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood for a moment, hugging her arms around herself, wishing it were Painter\u0027s strong arms instead, embracing her from behind, his cheek, rough with stubble at her neck. She closed her eyes, tired. Even though he was absent, she borrowed a bit of his steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile laboring, case after case, it had been easy to turn clinical, to detach, to simply treat and move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, in this moment of calm, the enormity of the disaster struck her. Over the past two weeks, the illnesses here had started small, a few burns from immediate exposure. Then in just two days, the seas had churned up a toxic cloud, erupting in a final volcanic expulsion of blistering gas that killed a fifth of the population and injured the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd though the toxic cloud had blown itself out, secondary illnesses and infections had begun afflicting the sick: flus, burning fevers, meningitis, blindness. The rapidity was disturbing. The entire third deck had been designated a quarantine area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was she doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen this medical crisis first arose, Lisa had petitioned Painter for this assignment, stating her case. Besides her medical degree, she held a PhD in human physiology, but more importantly, she had extensive field experience, especially in marine sciences. She had labored for half a decade aboard a salvage ship, the Deep Fathom, doing physiological research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she had a sound argument for her inclusion here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was not the only one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the past year Lisa had been land-bound in Washington and found herself slowly being consumed by Painter\u0027s life. And while a part of her enjoyed the intimacy, the two becoming one, she also knew she needed this chance away, both for herself and for her relationship, a bit of distance to evaluate her life, out of Painter\u0027s shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe this was too much distance. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sharp scream drew her attention toward the double doors into the dining room. Two sailors hauled in a man atop a stretcher. He writhed and cried, skin weeping, red as a lobster shell. It looked as if his entire body had been parboiled. His bearers rushed him toward the critical care station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReflexively, she ran the treatment through her head, going clinical again. Diazepam and a morphine drip. Still, deeper inside, she knew the truth. They all did. The suffering man\u0027s treatment would be merely palliative, to make him comfortable. The man on the stretcher was already dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here comes trouble,\" Jessie mumbled behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa turned and spotted Dr. Gene Lindholm striding toward her, an ostrich of a man, all legs and neck, with a shock of feathered white hair. The head of the WHO team nodded at her, indicating she was indeed his target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t particularly care for the Harvard-trained clinician. He came with an ego to match. Upon arriving, rather than helping here, he had sequestered himself with the owner of the cruise line, maverick Australian billionaire Ryder Blunt. The billionaire, notorious for his hands-on approach to business, had been aboard the ship for its maiden cruise. And while he could have left when the ship was commandeered, the billionaire had remained on-site, turning the rescue event into a marketing opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Lindholm cooperated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, such cooperation did not extend to Monk and Lisa. The WHO leader resented the strings that were pulled to include the pair on his team. Hut he\u0027d had no choice but to acquiesce—still, that didn\u0027t mean he had to be pleasant about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Cummings, I\u0027m glad to find you here idling with nothing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa bit back a retort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindholm glanced to the nursing student as if he\u0027d been unaware of the man\u0027s presence—then just as quickly dismissed him and returned his focus to Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was instructed to include you and your partner in any findings related to the epidemiology for this disaster. And as Dr. Kokkalis is out in the field, I I thought I should bring this to your attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thrust out a thick medical folder. She recognized the logo for the small hospital that served Christmas Island. Staffed with only on-call doctors and a pair of full-time nurses, the hospital had been quickly swamped, requiring the more severe cases to be airlifted to Perth. But that became impractical after the full brunt of the biological meltdown struck the island. Once the cruise ship had arrived, the hospital had been the first to be evacuated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa flipped open the folder and saw the patient\u0027s name listed as John Doe. She quickly scanned the history, the little that there was. The patient, man in his late sixties, had been found five weeks ago wandering naked through the rain forest, clearly suffering from dementia and exposure. He could not speak and was severely dehydrated. He subsequently slipped into an infantile state, unable to care for himself, eating only if fed by hand. They sought to identify him by fingerprint and by searching through missing person records, but nothing had turned up. He remained a John Doe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa glanced up. \"1 don\u0027t understand . . . what does this have to do with what happened here?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-8.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
