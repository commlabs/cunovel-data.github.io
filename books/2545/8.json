Air resounded with the bleating of revelers and there was a noise of sounding brass spinning out a cloud of music-1987 music, a frenzy of twisted dissonances.

As they passed by a murky lighted table, a hand she didn\u0027t see felt at her leg. She twitched and bumped against a hard knee across the narrow aisle. As she stumbled and lurched through the hot and smoky, thick-aired room, she felt a dozen eyes disrobing her, abusing her. Bud jerked her along and she felt her lips trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, how about that!\" Bud exulted as they sat. \"Right by the stage!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom cigarette mists, the waiter plunged and hovered, pencil poised, beside their table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027ll it be!\" His questioning shout cut through cacophony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whiskey-water!\" Bud and Len paralleled orders, then turned to their dates. \"What\u0027ll it be!\" the waiter\u0027s request echoed from their lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Green Swamp!\" Barbara said and, \"Green Swamp here!\" Len passed it along.

Above all, don\u0027t drink when you\u0027re out on a date. Promise us that, darling, you must promise us that. She tried to push away instructions etched in brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How you like this place, honey?

The word scalpeled at her mind. Loopy, loopy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stage was five yards deep at the radius of its wooden semicircle. A waist-high rail girdled the circumference, two pale purple spotlights, unlit, hung at each rail end. Purple on white-the thought came. Darling, isn\u0027t Sykesville Business College good enough? No! I don\u0027t want to take a business course, I want to major in art at the University!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drinks were brought and Peggy watched the disembodied waiter\u0027s arm thud down a high, green-looking glass before her.

It passed unnoticed as three Youths of America with Whom the Future Rested gurgled down their liquor thirstily.

The drummer applied the coup de grace to what had been, in ancient times, a lover\u0027s waltz.

She jerked away and then the purple spots went on and a mottle-faced Bud drew back, gurgling, \"I fights to the finish,\" and reaching for his drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, the loopy now, the loopy!\" Len said eagerly, releasing exploratory hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy\u0027s heart jolted and she thought she was going to cry out and run thrashing through the dark, smoke-filled room.

Peggy\u0027s breath was labored, she felt thin lines of Green Swamp water filtering hotly through her chest and stomach. It made her blink dizzily. Mother. The word escaped cells of the mind and trembled into conscious freedom. Mother, take me home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you know, the act you are about to see is not for the faint of heart, the weak of will.\" The man plodded through the words like a cow enmired. \"Let me caution those of you whose nerves are not what they ought to be-leave now.

A crenel in the postwar law allowed the L.U.P. performance if it was orally prefaced as an exposition of science. Through this legal chink had poured so much abusing of the law that few cared any longer. A feeble government was grateful to contain infractions of the law at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen hoots and shoutings had evaporated in the smoke-clogged air, the man, his arms upraised in patient benediction, spoke again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy watched the studied movement of his lips, her heart swelling, then contracting in slow, spasmodic beats. An iciness was creeping up her legs. She felt it rising toward the threadlike fires in her body and her fingers twitched around the chilly moisture of the glass. I want to go, please take me home-Will-spent words were in her mind again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" the man concluded, \"brace yourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gong sounded its hollow, shivering resonance, the man\u0027s voice thickened and slowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The L.U. Phenomenon!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was gone; the microphone had risen and was gone. Music began; a moaning brassiness, all muted. A jazzman\u0027s conception of the palpable obscure mounted on a pulse of thumping drum. A dolor of saxophone, a menace of trombone, a harnessed bleating of trumpet-they raped the air with stridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy felt a shudder plaiting down her back and her gaze dropped quickly to the murky whiteness of the table. Smoke and darkness, dissonance and heat surrounded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout meaning to, but driven by an impulse of nervous fear, she raised the glass and drank. The glacial trickle in her throat sent another shudder rippling through her. Then further shoots of liquored heat budded in her veins and a numbness settled in her temples. Through parted lips, she forced out a shaking breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow a restless, murmuring movement started through the room, the sound of it like willows in a sloughing wind. Peggy dared not lift her gaze to the purpled silence of the stage. She stared down at the shifting glimmer of her drink, feeling muscle strands draw tightly in her stomach, feeling the hollow thumping of her heart. I\u0027d like to leave, please let\u0027s leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music labored toward a rasping dissonant climax, its brass components struggling, in vain, for unity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand stroked once at Peggy\u0027s leg and it was the hand of Popeye, the sailor man, who muttered roupily, \"Olive Oyl, you is my goil.\" She barely felt or heard. Automatonlike, she raised the cold and sweating glass again and felt the chilling in her throat and then the flaring network of warmth inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSWISH!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe curtain swept open with such a rush, she almost dropped her glass. It thumped down heavily on the table, swamp water cascading up its sides and raining on her hand. The music exploded shrapnel of ear-cutting cacophony and her body jerked. On the tablecloth, her hands twitched white on white while claws on uncontrollable demand pulled up her frightened eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music fled, frothing behind a wake of swelling drum rolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nightclub was a wordless crypt, all breathing checked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCobwebs of smoke drifted in the purple light across the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sound except the muffled, rolling drum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy\u0027s body was a petrifaction in its chair, smitten to rock around her leaping heart, while, through the wavering haze of smoke and liquored dizziness, she looked up in horror to where it stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair was black, a framing of snarled ebony for the tallow mask that was her face. Her shadow-rimmed eyes were closed behind lids as smooth and white as ivory. Her mouth, a lipless and unmoving line, stood like a clotted sword wound beneath her nose. Her throat, her shoulders and her arms were white, were motionless. At her sides, protruding from the sleeve ends of the green transparency she wore, hung alabaster hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross this marble statue, the spotlights coated purple shimmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill paralyzed, Peggy stared up at its motionless features, her fingers knitted in a bloodless tangle on her lap. The pulse of drumbeats in the air seemed to fill her body, its rhythm altering her heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the black emptiness behind her, she heard Len muttering, \"I love my wife but, oh, you corpse,\" and heard the wheeze of helpless snickers that escaped from Bud and Barbara. The cold still rose in her, a silent tidal dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in the smoke-fogged darkness, a man cleared viscid nervousness from his throat and a murmur of appreciative relief strained through the audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill no motion on the stage, no sound but the sluggish cadence of the drum, thumping at the silence like someone seeking entrance at a far-off door. The thing that was a nameless victim of the plague stood palely rigid while the distillation sluiced through its blood-clogged veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the drum throbs hastened like the pulsebeat of a rising panic. Peggy felt the chill begin to swallow her. Her throat started tightening, her breathing was a string of lip-parted gasps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loopy\u0027s eyelid twitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrupt, black, straining silence webbed the room. Even the breath choked off in Peggy\u0027s throat when she saw the pale eyes flutter open. Something creaked in the stillness; her body pressed back unconsciously against the chair. Her eyes were wide, unblinking circles that sucked into her brain the sight of the thing that had been a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic again; a brass-throated moaning from the dark, like some animal made of welded horns mewling its derangement in a midnight alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the right arm of the loopy jerked at its side, the tendons suddenly contracted. The left arm twitched alike, snapped out, then fell back and thudded in purple-white limpness against the thigh. The right arm out, the left arm out, the right, the left-right-left-right-like marionette arms twitching from an amateur\u0027s dangling strings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music caught the time, drum brushes scratching out a rhythm for the convulsions of the loopy\u0027s muscles. Peggy pressed back further, her body numbed and cold, her face a livid, staring mask in the fringes of the stage light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loopy\u0027s right foot moved now, jerking up inflexibly as the distillation constricted muscles in its leg. A second and a third contraction caused the leg to twitch, the left leg flung out in a violent spasm and then the woman\u0027s body lurched stiffly forward, filming the transparent silk to its light and shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy heard the sudden hiss of breath that passed the clenching teeth of Bud and Len and a wave of nausea sprayed foaming sickness up her stomach walls. Before her eyes, the stage abruptly undulated with a watery glitter and it seemed as if the flailing loopy was headed straight for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasping dizzily, she pressed back in horror, unable to take her eyes from its now agitated face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the mouth jerk to a gaping cavity, then a twisted scar that split into a wound again. She saw the dark nostrils twitching, saw writhing flesh beneath the ivory cheeks, saw furrows dug and undug in the purple whiteness of the forehead. She saw one lifeless eye wink monstrously and heard the gasp of startled laughter in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile music blared into a fit of grating noise, the woman\u0027s arms and legs kept jerking with convulsive cramps that threw her body around the purpled stage like a full-sized rag doll given spastic life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nightmare in an endless sleep. Peggy shivered in helpless terror as she watched the loopy\u0027s twisting, leaping dance. The blood in her had turned to ice; there was no life in her but the endless, pounding stagger of her heart. Her eyes were frozen spheres staring at the woman\u0027s body writhing white and flaccid underneath the clinging silk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, something went wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp till then, its muscular seizures had bound the loopy to an area of several yards before the amber flat which was the background for its paroxysmal dance. Now its erratic surging drove the loopy toward the stage-encircling rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy heard the thump and creaking stain of wood as the loopy\u0027s hip collided with the rail. She cringed into a shuddering knot, her eyes still raised fixedly to the purple-splashed face whose every feature was deformed by throes of warping convulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loopy staggered back and Peggy saw and heard its leprous hands slapping with a fitful rhythm at its silk-scaled thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain it sprang forward like a maniac marionette and the woman\u0027s stomach thudded sickeningly into the railing wood. The dark mouth gaped, clamped shut and then the loopy twisted through a jerking revolution and crashed back against the rail again, almost above the table where Peggy sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy couldn\u0027t breathe. She sat rooted to the chair, her lips a trembling circle of stricken dread, a pounding of blood at her temples as she watched the loopy spin again, its arms a blur of flailing white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lurid bleaching of its face dropped toward Peggy as the loopy crashed into the waist-high rail again and bent across its top. The mask of lavender-rained whiteness hung above her, dark eyes twitching open into a hideous stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy felt the floor begin to move and the livid face was blurred with darkness, then reappeared in a burst of luminosity. Sound fled on brass-shoed feet, then plunged into her brain again-a smearing discord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loopy kept on jerking forward, driving itself against the rail as though it meant to scale it. With every spastic lurch, the diaphanous silk fluttered like a film about its body and every savage collision with the railing tautened the green transparency across its swollen flesh. Peggy looked up in rigid muteness at the loopy\u0027s fierce attack on the railing, her eyes unable to escape the wild distortion of the woman\u0027s face with its black frame of tangled, snapping hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened then happened in a blurring passage of seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grim-faced man came rushing across the purple-lighted stage; the thing that had been a woman went crashing, twitching, flailing at the rail, doubling over it, the spasmodic hitching flinging up its muscle-knotted legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA clawing fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy lurched back in her chair and the scream that started in her throat was forced back into a strangled gag as the loopy came crashing down onto the table, its limbs a thrash of naked whiteness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbara screamed, the audience gasped and Peggy saw, on the fringe of vision, Bud jumping up, his face a twist of stunned surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loopy flopped and twisted on the table like a new-caught fish. The music stopped, grinding into silence; a rush of agitated murmur filled the room and blackness swept in brain-submerging waves across Peggy\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the cold white hand slapped across her mouth, the dark eyes stared at her in purple light and Peggy felt the darkness flooding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horror-smoked room went turning on its side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsciousness. It flickered in her brain like gauze-veiled candlelight. A murmuring of sound, a blur of shadow before her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreath dripped like syrup from her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, Peg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard Bud\u0027s voice and felt the chilly metal of a flask neck pressed against her lips. She swallowed, twisting slightly at the trickle of fire in her throat and stomach, then coughed and pushed away the flask with deadened fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her, a rustling movement. \"Hey, she\u0027s back,\" Len said. \"Ol\u0027 Olive Oyl is back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel all right?\" asked Barbara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt all right. Her heart was like a drum hanging from piano wire in her chest, slowly, slowly beaten. Her hands and feet were numb, not with cold but with a sultry torpor. Thoughts moved with a tranquil lethargy, her brain a leisurely machine imbedded in swaths of woolly packing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy looked across the night with sleepy eyes. They were on a hilltop, the braked convertible crouching on a jutting edge. Far below, the country slept, a carpet of light and shadow beneath the chalky moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arm snake moved around her waist. \"Where are we?\" she asked him in a languid voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Few miles outside school,\" Bud said. \"How d\u0027ya feel, honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stretched, her body a delicious strain of muscles. She sagged back, limp, against his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful,\" she murmured with a dizzy smile and scratched the tiny itching bump on her left shoulder. Warmth radiated through her flesh; the night was a sabled glow. There seemed somewhere to be a memory, but it crouched in secret behind folds of thick content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Woman, you were out,\" laughed Bud; and Barbara added and Len added, \"Were you!\" and \"Olive Oyl went plunko!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out?\" Her casual murmur went unheard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flask went around and Peggy drank again, relaxing further as the liquor needled fire through her veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, I never saw a loopy dance like that!\" Len said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA momentary chill across her back, then warmth again. \"Oh,\" said Peggy, \"that\u0027s right. I forgot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was what I calls a grand finale!\" Len said, dragging back his willing date, who murmured, \"Lenny boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"L.U.P.,\" Bud muttered, nuzzling at Peggy\u0027s hair. \"Son of a gun.\" He reached out idly for the radio knob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eL.U.P.

The particular germ spray responsible was later distilled and is now used in carefully controlled experiments which are conducted only under the strictest of legal license and supervision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic surrounded them, its melancholy fingers touching at their hearts. Peggy leaned against her date and felt no need to curb exploring hands. Somewhere, deep within the jellied layers of her mind, there was something trying to escape.
