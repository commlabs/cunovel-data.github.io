I wish the world could under-stand, could believe.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis book will help that. You are helping that. So you are playing a role, you are doing your part, in raising the Collective Consciousness. That is what all must do.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCan we move to a new subject now? I think it’s important that we talk about this attitude—this idea of things—which You said a while back that You wanted to fairly present.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe attitude to which I am referring is this attitude, held by many people, that the poor have been given enough; that we must stop taxing the rich—penalizing them, in effect, for working hard and “making it”—to provide even more for the poor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThese people believe that the poor are poor basically be-cause they want to be. Many don’t even attempt to pull themselves up. They would rather suckle at the government teat than assume responsibility for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are many people who believe that redistribution of the wealth—sharing—is a socialistic evil. They cite the Com-munist Manifesto—”from each according to his ability, to each according to his need”—as evidence of the satanic origin of the idea of ensuring the basic human dignity of all through the efforts of everyone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThese people believe in “every man for himself.” If they are told that this concept is cold and heartless, they take refuge in the statement that opportunity knocks at the door of everyone equally; they claim that no man operates under an inherent disadvantage; that if they could “make it,” everybody can—and if someone doesn’t, “it’s his own damn fault.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou feel that is an arrogant thought, rooted in ungratefulness.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes. But what do You feel?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have no judgment in the matter. It is simply a thought. There is only one question of any relevance regarding this or any other thought. Does it serve you to hold that? In terms of Who You Are and Who You seek to Be, does that thought serve you?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the world, that is the question people have to ask. Does it serve us to hold this thought?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI observe this: There are people—indeed, entire groups of people—who have been born into what you call disadvantage. This is observably true.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is also true that at a very high metaphysical level, no one is “disadvantaged,” for each soul creates for itself the exact people, events, and circumstances needed to accomplish what It wishes to accomplish.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou choose everything. Your parents. Your country of birth. All the circumstances surrounding your re-entry.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, throughout the days and times of your life you continue to choose and to create people, events, and circumstances designed to bring you the exact, right, and perfect opportunities you now desire in order to know yourself as you truly are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, no one is “disadvantaged,” given what the soul wishes to accomplish. For example, the soul may wish to work with a handicapped body or in a repressive society or under enormous political or economic constraints, in order to produce the condi-tions needed to accomplish what it has set out to do.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo we see that people do face “disadvantages” in the physical sense, but that these are actually the right and perfect conditions metaphysically.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs a practical matter, what does that mean to us? Should we offer help to the “disadvantaged,” or simply see that, in truth, they are just where they want to be and thus allow them to “work out their own Karma”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a very good—and a very important—ques-tion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRemember first that everything you think, say, and do is a reflection of what you’ve decided about yourself; a statement of Who You Are; an act of creation in your deciding who you want to be. I keep returning to that, because that is the only thing you are doing here; that is what you are up to. There is nothing else going on, no other agenda for the soul. You are seeking to be and to experience Who You Really Are—and to create that. You are creating yourself anew in every moment of Now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, within that context, when you come across a person who appears, in relative terms as observed within your world, to be disadvantaged, the first ques-tion you have to ask is: Who am I and who do I choose to be, in relationship to that?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, the first question when you encoun-ter another in any circumstance should always be: What do I want here?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDid you hear that? Your first question, always, must be: What do I want here?—not: What does the other person want here?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat’s the most fascinating insight I have ever received about the way to proceed in human relationships. It also runs against everything I’ve ever been taught.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI know. But the reason your relationships are in such a mess is that you’re always trying to figure out what the other person wants and what other people want—in-stead of what you truly want. Then you have to decide whether to give it to them. And here is how you decide:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou decide by taking a look at what you may want from them. If there’s nothing you think you’ll want from them, your first reason for giving them what they want disappears, and so you very seldom do. If, on the other hand, you see that there is something you want or may want from them, then your self-survival mode kicks in, and you try to give them what they want.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen you resent it—especially if the other person doesn’t eventually give you what you want.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn this game of I’ll Trade You, you set up a very delicate balance. You meet my needs and I’ll meet yours.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet the purpose of all human relationships—rela-tionships between nations as well as relationships be-tween individuals—has nothing to do with any of this. The purpose of your Holy Relationship with every other person, place, or thing is not to figure out what they want or need, but what you require or desire now in order to grow, in order to be Who you want to Be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is why I created Relationship to other things. If it weren’t for this, you could have continued to live in a vacuum, a void, the Eternal Allness whence you came.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet in the Allness you simply are and cannot expe-rience your “awareness”- as anything in particular be-cause, in the Allness, there is nothing you are not.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo I devised a way for you to create anew, and Know, Who You Are in your experience. I did this by providing you with:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e1. Relativity—a system wherein you could exist as a thing in relationship to something else.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e2. Forgetfulness—a process by which you willingly submit to total amnesia, so that you can not know that relativity is merely a trick, and that you are All of It.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e3. Consciousness—a state of Being in which you grow until you reach full awareness, then becoming a True and Living God, creating and experiencing your own reality, expanding and exploring that reality, changing and re-creating that reality as you stretch your consciousness to new limits—or shall we say, to no limit.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn this paradigm, Consciousness is everything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eConsciousness—that of which you are truly aware—is the basis of all truth and thus of all true spirituality.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut what is the point of it all? First You make us forget Who We Are, so that we can remember Who We Are?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot quite. So that you can create Who You Are and Who You Want to Be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the act of God being God. It is Me being Me—through. you!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the point of all life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThrough you, I experience being Who and What I Am.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWithout you, I could know it, but not experience it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eKnowing and experiencing are two different things. I’ll choose experiencing every time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, I do. Through you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI seem to have lost the original question here.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, it’s hard to keep God on one subject. I’m kind of expansive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLet’s see if we can get back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes—what to do about the less fortunate.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFirst, decide Who and What You Are in Relationship to them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSecond, if you decide you wish to experience your-self as being Succor, as being Help, as being Love and Compassion and Caring, then look to see how you can best be those things.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd notice that your ability to be those things has nothing to do with what others are being or doing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSometimes the best way to love someone, and the most help you can give, is to leave them alone or empower them to help themselves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is like a feast. Life is a smorgasbord, and you can give them a big helping of themselves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRemember that the greatest help you can give a person is to wake them up, to remind them of Who They Really Are. There are many ways to do this. Sometimes with a little bit of help; a push, a shove, a nudge ... and sometimes with a decision to let them run their course, follow their path, walk their walk, without any interference or intervention from you. (All parents know about this choice and agonize over it daily.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat you have the opportunity to do for the less fortunate is to re-mind them. That is, cause them to be of a New Mind about themselves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd you, too, have to be of a New Mind about them, for if you see them as unfortunate, they will.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJesus’ great gift was that he saw everyone as who they truly are. He refused to accept appearances; he refused to believe what others believed of themselves. He always had a higher thought, and he always invited others to it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet he also honored where others chose to be. He did not require them to accept his higher idea, merely held it out as an invitation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe dealt, too, with compassion—and if others chose to see themselves as Beings needing assistance, he did not reject them for their faulty assessment, but allowed them to love their Reality—and lovingly assisted them in playing out their choice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor Jesus knew that for some the fastest path to Who They Are was the path through Who They Are Not.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe did not call this an imperfect path and thus con-demn it. Rather he saw this, too, as “perfect”—and thus supported everyone in being just who they wanted to be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnyone, therefore, who asked Jesus for help re-ceived it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe denied no one—but was always careful to see that the help he gave supported a person’s full and honest desire.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf others genuinely sought enlightenment, hon-estly expressing readiness to move to the next level, Jesus gave them the strength, the courage, the wis-dom to do so. He held himself out—and rightly so—as an example and encouraged people, if they could do nothing else, to have faith in him. He would not, he said, lead them astray.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMany did put their faith in him—and to this day he helps those who call upon his name. For his soul is committed to waking up those who seek to be fully awake and fully alive in Me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet Christ had mercy on those who did not. He therefore rejected self-righteousness and—as does his Father in heaven—made no judgments, ever.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJesus’ idea of Perfect Love was to grant all persons exactly the help they requested, after telling them the kind of help they could get.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe never refused to help anyone, and least of all would he do so out of a thought that “you made your bed, now lie in it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJesus knew that if he gave people the help they asked for, rather than merely the help he wanted to give, that he was empowering them at the level at which they were ready to receive empowerment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the way of all great masters. Those who have walked your planet in the past, and those who are walking it now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow I am confused. When is it disempowering to offer help? When does it work against, rather than for, another’s growth?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen your help is offered in such a way that it creates continued dependence, rather than rapid inde-pendence.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen you allow another, in the name of compas-sion, to begin to rely on you rather than rely on them-selves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is not compassion, that is compulsion. You have a power compulsion. Because that sort of helping is really power-tripping. Now this distinction can be very subtle here, and sometimes you don’t even know you are power-tripping. You really believe you are simply doing your best to help another.., yet be careful that you are not simply seeking to create your own self-worth. For to the extent that you allow other per-sons to make you responsible for them, to that extent you have allowed them to make you powerful. And that, of course, makes you feel worthy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet this kind of help is an aphrodisiac which seduces the weak.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe goal is to help the weak grow strong, not to let the weak become weaker.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the problem with many government assis-tance programs, for they often do the latter, rather than the former. Government programs can be self-per-petuating. Their objective can be every bit as much to justify their existence as to help those they are meant to assist.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf there were a limit to all government assistance, people would be helped when they genuinely need help but could not become addicted to that help, substituting it for their own self-reliance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGovernments understand that help is power. That is why governments offer as much help to as many people as they can get away with—for the more people government helps, the more people help the govern-ment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhom the government supports, supports the gov-ernment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen there should be no redistribution of wealth. The Communist Manifesto is satanic.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, there is no Satan, but I understand your meaning.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe idea behind the statement “From each accord-ing to his ability, to each according to his need” is not evil, it is beautiful. It is simply another way of saying you are your brother’s keeper. It is the implementation of this beautiful idea that can become ugly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSharing must be a way of life, not an edict imposed by government. Sharing should be voluntary, not\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eforced.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut—here we go again!—at its best, government is the people, and its programs are simply mechanisms by which the people share with many others, as a “way of life.” And I would argue that people, collectively through their political systems, have chosen to do so because people have observed, and history has shown, that the “haves” do not share with the “have-nots.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Russian peasant could have waited until hell froze over for the Russian nobility to share its wealth—which was usually gained and enlarged through the hard work of peasants. The peasants were given just enough to subsist on, as the “incentive” to keep working the land—and make the land barons richer. Talk about a dependency relationship! This was an I’ll-help -you-only-if-you-help-me arrangement more exploitive and more obscene than anything ever invented by government!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was this obscenity against which the Russian peasants revolted. A government which ensured that all people were treated equally was born out of the people’s frustration that the “haves” would not give to the “have-nots” of their own accord.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was as Marie Antoinette said of the starving masses clamoring beneath her window in rags, while she lounged in a gold inlaid tub on a bejeweled pedestal, munching imported grapes: “Let them eat cake!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the attitude against which the downtrodden have railed. This is the condition causing revolution and creating governments of so-called oppression.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGovernments which take from the rich and give to the poor are called oppressive, while governments which do nothing while the rich exploit the poor are repressive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAsk the peasants of Mexico even today. It is said that twenty or thirty families—the rich and powerful elite—literally run Mexico (principally because they own it!), while twenty or thirty million live in utter deprivation. So the peasants in 1993-94 undertook a revolt, seeking to force the elitist govern-ment to recognize its duty to help the people provide the means for a life of at least meager dignity. There is a difference between elistist governments and governments “of, by, and for the people.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAre not people’s governments created by angry people frustrated over the basic selfishness of human nature? Are not government programs created as a remedy for man’s unwill-ingness to provide a remedy himself?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIs this not the genesis of fair housing laws, child labor statutes, support programs for mothers with dependent children?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWasn’t Social Security government’s attempt to provide for older people something that their own families would not or could not provide?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow do we reconcile our hatred of government control with our tack of willingness to do anything we don’t have to do when there are no controls?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is said that some coal miners worked under horrible conditions before governments required the filthy rich mine owners to clean up their filthy mines. Why didn’t the owners do so themselves? Because it would have cut into their profits! And the rich didn’t care how many of the poor died in unsafe mines to keep the profits flowing—and growing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBusinesses paid slave wages to beginning workers before governments imposed minimum wage requirements. Those who favor going back to the “good old days” say, “So what? They provided jobs, didn’t they? And who’s taking the risk, anyway? The worker? No! The investor, the owner, takes all the risks! So to him should go the biggest reward!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who thinks that the workers on whose labors the owners depend should be treated with dignity is called a communist.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who thinks that a person should not be denied housing because of skin color is called a socialist.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who thinks that a woman should not be denied employment opportunities or promotion simply because she’s the wrong sex is called a radical feminist.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd when governments, through their elected repre-sentatives, move to solve these problems that people of power in society steadfastly refuse to solve themselves, those govern-ments are called oppressive! (Never by the people they help, incidentally. Only by the people who refuse to provide the help themselves.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNowhere is this more evident than in health care. In 1992 an American President and his wife decided it was unfair and inappropriate for millions of Americans to have no access to preventative health care; that notion started a health care debate which catapulted even the medical profession and the insurance industry into the fray.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe real question is not whose solution was better: the plan proposed by the Administration or the plan proposed by private industry. The real question is: Why didn’t private industry propose its own solution long ago?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI’ll tell you why. Because it didn’t have to. No one was complaining. And the industry was driven by profits.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eProfits, profits, profits.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMy point, therefore, is this. We can rail and cry and com-plain all we want. The plain truth is, governments provide solutions when the private sector won’t.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe can also claim that governments are doing what they are doing against the wishes of the people, but so long as people control the government—as they do to a large extent in the United States—the government will continue to pro-duce and require solutions to social ills because the majority of the people are not rich and powerful, and therefore legislate for themselves what society will not give them voluntarily.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnly in countries where the majority of the people do not control the government does government do little or nothing about inequities.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo, then, the problem: How much government is too much government? And how much is too little? And where and how do we strike the balance?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhew! I’ve never seen you go on like this!

It just is what it is, and I have no preferences regarding that. I am merely describing here what is observable; what anyone can plainly see.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOkay, You have no solution and You have no preference.

Yet there is only one place where goodness is born, and that is in the human heart. There is only one place where fairness can be conceptualized, and that is in the human mind. There is only one place where love can be experienced truly, and that is in the human soul. Because the human soul is love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou cannot legislate morality. You cannot pass a law saying “love each other.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe are now going around in circles, as we have covered all of this before. Still, the discussion is good, so keep plugging away at it. Even if we cover the same ground twice or three times, that is okay.

Aren’t all laws simply man’s attempt to codify moral concepts? Is not “legislation” simply our combined agreement as to what is “right” and “wrong”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes. And certain civil laws—rules and regula-tions—are required in your primitive society. (You un-derstand that in nonprimitive societies such laws are unnecessary. All beings regulate themselves.) In your society, you are still confronted with some very elemen-tary questions. Shall you stop at the street corner before proceeding? Shall you buy and sell according to certain terms? Will there be any restrictions on how you behave with one another?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut truly, even these basic laws—prohibitions against murdering, damaging, cheating, or even run-ning a red light—shouldn’t be needed and wouldn’t be needed if all people everywhere simply followed the Laws of Love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is, God’s Law.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat is needed is a growth in consciousness, not a growth of government.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou mean if we just followed the Ten Commandments we’d be all right!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no such thing as the Ten Commandments.

And no, I do not observe that anarchy—the absence of govern-ance, rules, regulations, or limitations of any kind—would work. Such an arrangement is only prac-tical with advanced beings, which I do not observe human beings to be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo some level of governance is going to be required until your race evolves to the point where you naturally do what is naturally right.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are very wise to govern yourselves in the in-terim.
