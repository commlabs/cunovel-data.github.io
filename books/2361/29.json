He froze for a single instant, then moved as he had never moved in his life. He raced toward the mouth of the cave and burst through the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dim light he saw the huge, gray shape leaping toward Graciela. Instinctively, he reached for his pistol and fired. The wolf let out a yelp of pain and turned toward Ricardo. He felt the sharp fangs of the wounded beast tearing at his clothing and smelled the animal\u0027s fetid breath. The wolf was stronger than he had expected, heavily muscled and powerful. Ricardo tried to fight free, but it was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt himself begin to lose consciousness. He was dimly aware of Graciela coming toward him and he yelled, \"Get away!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw Graciela\u0027s hand raised above bis head, and as it started to descend toward him, he glimpsed a huge rock in it and thought: She\u0027s going to kill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn instant later the rock swept past him and smashed into the wolf\u0027s skull. There was a last savage gasp and the animal lay still on the ground. Ricardo was huddled on the floor, fighting for breath. Graciela knelt at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Her voice was trembling with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe managed to nod. He heard a whimpering sound behind him and turned to see the cubs huddled in a corner. He lay there, gathering his strength. Then he rose with difficulty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey staggered out into the clean mountain air, shaken. Ricardo stood there, taking deep, lung-filling breaths until his head cleared. The physical and emotional shock of their close brush with death had taken a severe toll on both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get away from this place. They may come looking for us here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraciela shuddered at the reminder of how much danger they were still in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey traveled along the steep mountain path for the next hour, and when they finally reached a small stream, Ricardo said, \"Let\u0027s stop here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith no bandages or antiseptic, they cleaned the scratches as best they could, bathing them in the clean, cold spring water. Ricardo\u0027s arm was so stiff, he had trouble moving it. To his surprise, Graciela said, \"Let me do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was even more surprised by the gentleness with which she performed the task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, without warning, Graciela began to tremble violently in the aftermath of shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" Ricardo said. \"It\u0027s all over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could not stop shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her in his arms and said soothingly, \"Shh. It\u0027s dead. There\u0027s nothing more to fear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was holding her closely, and he could feel her thighs pressing against his body, and her soft lips were on his, and she was holding him close, whispering things he could not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as though he had known Graciela always. And yet he knew nothing about her. Except that she\u0027s God\u0027s miracle, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraciela was also thinking of God. Thank You, God, for this joy. Thank You for finally letting me feel what love is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was experiencing emotions for which she had no words, beyond anything she had ever imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicardo was watching her, and her beauty still took his breath away. She belongs to me now, he thought. She doesn\u0027t have to go back to a convent. We\u0027ll get married and have beautiful children - strong sons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll never let you go, Graciela.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ricardo - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darling, I want to marry you. Will you marry me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd without even thinking, Graciela said, \"Yes. Oh, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was in his arms again, and she thought: This is what I wanted and thought I would never have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicardo was saying, \"We\u0027ll live in France for a while, where we\u0027ll be safe. This fight will be over soon, and we\u0027ll return to Spain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that she would go anywhere with this man, and that if there was danger, she wanted to share it with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked of so many things. Ricardo told her of how he had first become involved with Jaime Miro, and of the broken engagement, and of his father\u0027s displeasure. But when Ricardo waited for Graciela to speak about her past, she was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him and thought: I can\u0027t tell him. He\u0027ll hate me. \"Hold me,\" Graciela begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey slept and woke up at dawn to watch the sun creep over the ridge of the mountain, bathing the hills in a warm red glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicardo said, \"We\u0027ll be safer biding out here today. We\u0027ll start traveling when it gets dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate from the sack of food that the gypsies had given them, and planned their future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are wonderful opportunities here in Spain,\" Ricardo said. \"Or there will be when we have peace. I have dozens of ideas. We\u0027ll own our own business. We\u0027ll buy a beautiful home and raise handsome sons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And beautiful daughters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And beautiful daughters.\" He smiled. \"I never knew I could be so happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor I, Ricardo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be in Logrono in two days and meet the others,\" Ricardo said. He took her hand. \"We\u0027ll tell them you won\u0027t be returning to the convent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder if they\u0027ll understand.\" Then she laughed. \"I don\u0027t really care. God understands. I loved my life in the convent,\" she said softly, \"but - \" She leaned over and kissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicardo said, \"I have so much to make up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was puzzled. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those years you were in the convent, shut away from the world. Tell me, darling - does it bother you that you\u0027ve lost all those years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she make him see? \"Ricardo - I didn\u0027t lose anything. Have I really missed so much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about it, not knowing where to begin. He realized that events he thought of as important would not really have mattered to the nuns in their isolation. Wars, like the Arab-Israeli war? The Berlin Wall? Assassinations of political leaders such as the American President John Kennedy and his brother, Robert Kennedy? And of Martin Luther King, Jr., the great black leader of the nonviolence movement for black equality? Famines? Floods? Earthquakes? Strikes and demonstrations protesting man\u0027s inhumanity to man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, how deeply would any of those things have affected her personal life? Or the personal lives of the majority of people on this earth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Ricardo said, \"In one sense, you haven\u0027t missed much. But in another sense, yes. Something important has been going on. Life. While you were shut away all those years, babies have been born and have grown up, lovers have married, people have suffered and been happy, people have died, and all of us out here were a part of that, a part of the living.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think I never was?\" Graciela asked. And the words came tumbling out before she could stop them. \"I was once a part of that life you are talking about, and it was a living hell. My mother was a whore, and every night I had a different uncle. When I was fourteen years old I gave my body to a man because I was attracted to him and jealous of my mother and what she was doing.\" The words were coming in a torrent now. \"I would have become a whore too if I had stayed there to be part of the life you think is so precious. No, I don\u0027t believe I ran away from anything. I ran to something. I found a safe world that is peaceful and good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicardo was staring at her, horrified. \"I - I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sobbing now, and he took her in his arms and said, \"Shh! It\u0027s all right. That\u0027s over. You were a child. I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was as though Ricardo had given her absolution. She had told him about the awful things she had done in the past, and still he forgave her. And - wonder of wonders - loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her very close. \"There is a poem by Federico Garcia Lorca:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night does not wish to come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso that you cannot come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand I cannot go...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you will come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith your tongue burned by the salt rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day does not wish to come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso that you cannot come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand I cannot go...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you will come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough the muddy sewers of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither night nor day wishes to come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso that I may die for you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly she thought of the soldiers who were hunting them and she wondered if she and her beloved Ricardo were going to live long enough to have a future together. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-29.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
