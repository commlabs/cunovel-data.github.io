Robert Young played a pilot disfigured in World War II and Dorothy McGuire portrayed a plain shy spinster. They find sanctuary and happily-ever-after love in a cottage just like mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this is not the 1940s and films are no longer made in black and white-unless the director is trying to be retro or pretentious or both. And nobody knows who Robert Young and Dorothy McGuire were except film buffs like me and my new boss, Hector Nightwine, producer of the internationally franchised CSI V forensic TV shows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a number of reasons, my life in the Las Vegas of 2013 isn\u0027t worth a five-dollar chip from Cesar Cicereau\u0027s Gehenna Hotel and Casino. Fortunately, though, I\u0027m worth a lot to Hector. So, here I am in a pseudo-quaint cottage on the grounds of Nightwine\u0027s Fort-Knox-secure Sunset Road estate, surrounded by Hobbity English charm mixed with high-tech convenience. I am tucked under an eiderdown comforter in a high four-poster bed with gargoyles carved onto the posts while a Jacuzzi tub in the adjoining bathroom softly gurgles me to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely none of my half-vampire bullyboy nightmares will come home to roost in this place. It\u0027s as safe as fairy tales and Nightwine\u0027s state-of-the-art security technology can make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, I was not quite sleeping, just snuggling into the thousand-thread-count sheets, when I heard a scratching at my second-story casement windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFruit trees and blossom-bearing vines grow around my Enchanted Cottage as thick as Sleeping Beauty\u0027s thorny forest. A stray vine was probably blowing against the window glass. I opened my eyes to stare up at the peaked white-plaster ceiling. A small shifting shadow danced there in rhythm with the exterior scratching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad a cat climbed the vines and was now trying to get in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was warmer than a toasted English muffin from my formerly cold feet to the top of my brunet head. This may be Las Vegas, but I\u0027m cold-natured. My feet and hands never seem to get warm enough at night. Now, though, they finally were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I didn\u0027t want to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the stairs came the faint whiff of dinner\u0027s garlic chicken. I seldom saw the kitchen witch who came with the property, along with the yard troll and the garden pixies and who knew what else, but she could bake fragrant loaves of crusty bread in the wood stove as readily as she could nuke a frozen Weight Watchers entree in the microwave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t crazy about the garlic odor from that night\u0027s homemade dish, but I was comforted to hear my awesomely large wolfhound-wolf-cross dog wheezing in sleep from one of the downstairs rooms. This was not one of Quicksilver\u0027s frequent solo nights out on the town that never shuts down. I figure adopting him doesn\u0027t give me a lock on his nocturnal need to patrol and rock and roll with his kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wriggled deeper into the warm covers, but the insinuating snare-drum rhythm of that exterior scratching kept me from sliding into sleep. It could be a kitten caught up a tree, clinging there, helpless...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing myself to sit up, I shivered at an inrush of air-conditioned air and put my bare feet to the icy wooden floor. My sleep-T hem snarled in the covers as I got out of bed, almost tripping me. I moved toward the pair of windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Rorschach blot of black was indeed pressed to the window glass. It was as big as my spread hand, with four clinging limbs and a bigger head. It looked like a starfish shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumbled nearer and squinted to make it out in the dark. Surely, a young kitten-but why wasn\u0027t it mewing up a storm as cats do when trapped up so high? Only when a squeal revealed rows of tiny fangs did I realize that my visitor was a bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, I squealed a bit too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMind you, I\u0027m a former TV news reporter, an intrepid investigator of rural phenomena like cattle mutilations. One midsummer night\u0027s window-clinging bat shouldn\u0027t set me screeching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reminded myself that bats were enormously useful consumers of insects and other pests and returned to bed, shuddering as my floor-cooled feet found the sheets already chilly. Even the slim silver chain on my wrist felt icy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuggled stomach-down, curled up, and waited for sleep to find me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I heard the rustling. And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me, filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn! Why was my subconscious quoting Edgar Allan- Poe\u0027s \"The Raven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe because the rustling sounded like curtains and there weren\u0027t any curtains on my dormer windows. Or maybe because the rustling sounded like a big bird\u0027s wings...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tis the wind and nothing morel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that mantra had worked for Poe\u0027s uneasy scholar it would work for me. I pulled the covers farther over my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raven-size wing rustling increased to a California condor-size woosh, with a wingspread of, say, ten freaking feet. Only an idiot would ignore that kind of indoor tempest. This was no little lost bat or even a misplaced sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up, turning the covers half down, and faced the windows. \"All right!\" I challenged the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot all right, baby girl, whispered my internal invisible friend since childhood, Irma. We are getting called on by more than Big Bird. We\u0027re not on Sesame Street anymore, Delilah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. The room\u0027s temperature had dropped to meat-freezer cold and I was instantly afraid I was the meat. Post-Millennium Las Vegas teemed with things that went bump, stump, hump and slurp in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was appalled to see that the small shadow from the windowpane had moved inside to become a pillar of darkness draped in black, severe and funereal. I was almost getting used to seeing apparitions in the tall hall mirror, but not in thin air. Slowly, the head of the entity moved, lifted and the cloaked sides spread their wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwe mated with my fear, and both held me frozen. A pale white face came into partial focus. Only cruel, slanting dark eyebrows and a gray grinning mouth were fully visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black fell back, revealing an ash-gray satin lining framing a man\u0027s black evening suit of elegant antique cut. The vintage clothing collector in me couldn\u0027t help but admire the tailoring even as goose bumps ran races up and down my arms. The figure had no color at all, not even red around the eye whites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I recognized my visitor from his many collectible photographs and posters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was beholding the most commercially potent incarnation of Dracula of all time: 1932\u0027s Bela Lugosi, slithering onscreen with Eastern Euro-trash swagger and Art Deco decadence. I recalled a few pre-adolescent longings to someday meet a classic vampire: suave, smooth and deliriously sinister. I hankered for any one of a dozen pop culture reinventions of the father of all vampires as a sex symbol. Bela Lugosi had a certain predatory hunger, but he wasn\u0027t the hunky anti-hero women would willingly welcome, swooning for his seductive suction action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLugosi was nasty. Not as nasty as the ancient devouring vamp in Bram Stoker\u0027s novel, but far from the lounge lizard, oral-sex fiend Frank Langella\u0027s portrayal had made women go crazy over a few decades back. Why do women always go for the bad boys? I sure hadn\u0027t liked the variety I fought off in the group homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could think clearly, but sat paralyzed-just like all those passive silver-screen victims-my fingers curled into the sheets. At least this wasn\u0027t a debased half-vamp from the group homes. He was the reel thing, although not a Gollum-gaunt creature of the night like Nosferatu from the days of silent films. That scrawny, long-clawed leech and lech was all too reminiscent of the real-life crackpot Howard Hughes in his current undead state to conjure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Bela Lugosi\u0027s slo-mo sinister diction may seem hokey today, but in person, gliding to your bedside, he was mesmerizing. He leaned in and down, showed only the tips of his pointed canine teeth, and lowered his gaze to drink in the sight of my bare neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now my silver chain bracelet had subtly shimmied up my arm. Even as he ogled my throat, it looped itself into a solid wide dog collar around my neck, blocking all ports of entry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah,\" Dracula said, recoiling. \"Cheesy silver trinket! I only wanted to take a tiny symbolic taste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad taste is never symbolic,\" I said, my fingers tracing the smooth, defensive form my silver familiar had taken. It never failed to surprise-and defend-me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My master wants you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that Renfield\u0027s line?\" I didn\u0027t mean to be a smart-mouth; I was just surprised that Dracula would admit to a master. He was \"the Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Renfield\u0027s words may, regrettably, live on, but the bug-eater ended with that blasted film. The message I bear remains: You must come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now?\" I couldn\u0027t believe I was asking that question, like I might consider it some other day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Never,\" I corrected myself. \"We know all about you these days. You can\u0027t reverse your surname and pretend to be some Transylvanian nobleman, \u0027Count Alucard\u0027! This is not sleepy old England between the World Wars of the last century. This is post-Millennium Revelation America. We\u0027re all on to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps, Miss Street, but you have tried to trick my master. He\u0027s had time to discover your name and profession. He could choose to crush you like one of that pathetic Renfield\u0027s bugs. Instead, he is magnanimous. He wishes to employ you. You call yourself a paranormal investigator, do you not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barely. I just phoned the Yellow Pages today to order the ad. It\u0027ll take ages to show up. How would your master, whoever he is, know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We... he knows many things through many means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how\u0027d you know where to find me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All my kind know Hector Nightwine and his Sunset Road estate. You are becoming known as his creature,\" Dracula announced with loathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His part-time private investigator! I\u0027m nobody\u0027s creature. What have you got against Hector?\" I was puzzled, because Nightwine was a known admirer of CinSims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has leased all three of my brides.\" Dracula positively hissed the last word through his fangs. \"I am denied all... access.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to admit that the trio of willowy train-dragging thirties femmes fatales made a pretty good girl back-up group for Drac. They were the only vampire chick role models I aspired to. I made the height requirement, being five-eight flat-footed, but not the weight one. Lean and hungry (i.e., anorexic) is definitely not my look. I\u0027m a substantial girl, more hourglass than swizzle stick. Still, it\u0027d be fun to slink around in fangs and furbelows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough chitchat. Come with me.\" He extended a graceful gray hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, adolescent me had wanted to meet a gentleman vampire of the old school and now here I had one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t go, Irma urged. You don\u0027t know where that walking corpse has been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not be afraid,\" Dracula said in slow formal tones, noting my hesitancy. \"These days I only drink from those who pay for the privilege. I am the resident attraction at the Love in Vein Social Club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what are you doing here tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My master occasionally needs me mobile. The night has always been mine. Sometimes what he wants from me is what I also want for myself... a beautiful but shaken young woman, a midnight mission, an opportunity to stretch my wings and my reach, as of old. To be powerful. To be irresistible. You will come with me, Miss Delilah Street, because you must.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned nearer. I inhaled the stale scent of cigar smoke and raw meat and old blood. Then he withdrew. I wondered if the chicken garlic on my breath was slapping him in the undead kisser. Good! But I had a feeling this was an offer I shouldn\u0027t refuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so fast,\" I told him. \"Not in this outfit do I go anywhere. Turn your back while I change clothes if you want me to go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Irma was kicking up an internal storm. You don\u0027t know where and you don\u0027t know who. You can\u0027t go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrma was my alter ego, the psychological crutch of a lonely kid, I figured, but she could get bossy. I didn\u0027t feel the need to heed her at the moment. The King Vampire in this town had called on me for help, no matter how rudely he had put it or how seedy his operation. I had to live up to my new business card: Delilah Street, P.I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of paranormal investigator would flinch from a CinSim vampire? Underneath all the props and persona, even Dracula was just an animated zombie these days. A lot of classic horror film creatures had been resurrected by the Immortality Mob to entertain the tourists. At least Mothra hadn\u0027t been sent to pick me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Quicksilver asleep below as I pulled a black knit turtleneck down over my black yoga pants. Old Drac must have some spell to put animals asleep, even big supernaturally strong wolfhound-wolf crossbreeds. Otherwise, he\u0027d be at the vampire\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thrust my feet into a pair of black cowboy boot mules and grabbed the slim Baggalini uptown messenger bag I\u0027d found so handy during my incarnation as a TV reporter. I slung it across my body and stuffed my cell phone. ID and some cash inside so my hands would be free in an emergency. Unfortunately, it had no space for wooden stakes or garlic garlands. But if someone found my body, I\u0027d at least have a chance to be properly identified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, if I wound up dead, I hoped somebody would make sure I wasn\u0027t resurrected-even if my future as a Lilith stand-in was worth a fortune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCouldn\u0027t count on Hector Nightwine for the job; he had an addictive profit motive. I\u0027d need my new beau, Ric Montoya, to make sure I was dead and buried and kept that way. Ric had his unusual ways with the dead, but our relationship is anything but lifeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBela was waiting, polite, his caped back to me, bare gray hand still extended. The other wore a white glove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my own pale hand into that dead, ashen flesh. Icy. Icky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula turned slowly to face me, his arms lifting his cloak into black wings again. With those \"wings,\" he clasped me to the formal front of his evening dress, the starched white shirt. His cloak curled around me, enclosing me in the scent of mothballs, must and cold decay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a swoop and a whoosh, I felt us break the \"ground barrier\" and fly through the window to soar into the warm night air. His arms remained around me, but the cloak folds unfurled, fanning out like giant wings as we sped through the night sky. I eyed the gorgeous glitter of Las Vegas a hundred and fifty stories below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing in Dracula\u0027s arms felt like waltzing with a marble pillar; his skin and bones formed one hardened, heartless surface. It was odd to fly vertically, as if we stood on an invisible floor, but it certainly eased my horizontal phobia, if not the acrophobia any human being with a brain would feel in this situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind chilled my ears. I curled my toes to keep my mules from falling off and braining some unlucky tourist below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI distracted myself during the terrifying flight by wondering who could send Dracula as an errand boy. Certainly not mobster Cesar Cicereau of the Gehenna Hotel-Casino and werewolf syndicate. I wasn\u0027t sure from our last encounter whether he now preferred to forget me instead of tearing my throat out, but I was pretty sure he\u0027d never want to hire me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Strip lights below had dimmed. We were dropping toward a square black blot in the lightscape. I squinched my eyes shut, sure we would smack hard into that rectilinear bull\u0027s-eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead my soles touched roof, the dangling heels first, then the toes. Note to self: Never wear mules for night flights with the dead. Nun-like lace-up oxfords would have been better. At least Drac and I were once more on solid ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut whose solid ground?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula slowly loosened his custody, but kept his hands on me, now both gloved-how did he do that?-in a waltz position. Did every supernatural in Vegas want to cha-cha-cha with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListen, pal, Irma tried to tell him, these Irish gams only do jigs, not waltzes with weirdoes. She was wrong about that; I\u0027d waltzed with Snow, weird only in the ancient demonic definition of word. He was the sexy longhaired rock-star owner of the Inferno Hotel and purveyor of the \"Brimstone Kiss,\" an after-show perk he bestowed on groupies who became enslaved at one touch of his ice-white lips. Rumor had it he was an albino vampire, the obverse of my current partner. Both of them were deeply unwanted on my dance card, even though Snow\u0027s lock of white hair-turned-silver-familiar was still guarding my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula swept me into a stately gliding circle. \"A little movement warms the blood after a chilling night flight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat line was almost worse than his classic \"I do not drrrink...vine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not dressed for the Creature Feature Cotillion,\" I told him. \"Let\u0027s go see the Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is not so civil... and dashing as Dracula.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he is the Master, right? You don\u0027t want to cut him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDracula\u0027s face gleamed with anticipation. Then the calculated look faded. \"I live only to serve. For now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster, whoever he was, had better watch his front, especially the carotid arteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the probable danger, this outing was fascinating to an investigator. I considered CinSims as animated movie posters, in a way, able to walk and talk, but that was it. If I\u0027d thought about it, they could do a lot more or they\u0027d never be in demand at brothels. Although I\u0027d heard that some human sex partners could be pretty lifeless...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, I\u0027d lost my virginity right here in Sin City, with a guy who could tease an orgasm out of a corpse. I was only slightly harder to win over. During those literally magical minutes, Ric and I had accidentally tapped the borrowed emotions of the Sunset Park lovers killed during their most ecstatic moments. A little paranormal passion by proxy had not hurt one bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t know that CinSims could freaking fly! And with me along. Apparently, if the CinSim was gifted with paranormal skills in the originating film, those abilities carried over to the zombie reincarnation. That made the rumors of a brewing CinSim insurrection pretty scary. I mean, think: Godzilla loose on the Strip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must leave you,\" Dracula announced dramatically, bowing to kiss my hand. \"My task is done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that he walked to the end of the flat roof and jumped off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" I ran to the edge, seeing mostly dead black below, with a smattering of streetlights and signs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I spotted the large humped figure rushing straight down like a beetle, just as Jonathan Harker described his host\u0027s creepy manner of egress from his Transylvanian castle in Bram Stoker\u0027s classic novel. I watched Dracula\u0027s form become one with the dark street below. And where, pray, was I to go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe usual answer to that in an uncaring world was, \"To Hell!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in post-Millennium Revelation Las Vegas, it was all too often the literal truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/brimstone-kiss-delilah-street-2/page-1.html","bookId":2114,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:55:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:55:35 PM"}
