Pageant officials not big on the jokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER SEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the muddy waters receded, Jennifer found herself in a part of the jungle where nothing was familiar anymore. Far overhead was a small clearing of blue sky bordered by the wizened branches of thick-trunked trees whose gnarled roots clutched the earth like the talons of some primeval bird frozen midgrip by a sorcerer’s curse. She called out for the others, but there was no response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing alone didn’t scare Jennifer. She’d been alone since she was ten, when she begged her mom to stop sending her to stay with Grandma Huberman, the religious nut, who told her God could see into her wicked, wicked heart. While saying this, she’d waved the copy of Women’s Basketball Weekly she’d found under Jen’s bed, the one in which Jen had drawn a heart around the picture of star point guard Monica Mathers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God doesn’t like lesbians,” Grandma Huberman hissed, throwing the magazine in the trash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer knew what lesbian meant, and she knew she probably was one. But she couldn’t understand why God would hold that against her or against Monica Mathers, who’d never started a war or killed anybody, and whose deadeye three-pointers were straight-up amazing. After all, hadn’t God made both of them? But people were like that, she’d noticed. They’d invoke Godly privilege at the weirdest of times and for the most stupid of reasons. Jen decided that if God wasn’t putting any faith in her, she wasn’t putting her faith in Him. And so, now, alone in the jungle, she did not call out for special favors. As far as she was concerned, that would be cheating. Jennifer played rough sometimes, but she always played fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long rope of root formed an almost-bench above the mossy ground, and after testing its solidity, she sat on it to think. It was only moments later that she heard off-key humming and saw a girl marching between the trees, a spear in one hand. The girl had a strawberry blond bob and an impish face. The remnants of her sash read Miss Illin, and for a moment, Jennifer thought of her as being from a very cool hip-hop state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi. Uh, hello,” Jennifer said. “I’m Jennifer Huberman. Miss Michigan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl didn’t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” Jennifer waved her arms. “Over here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl looked up. Startled, she dropped the spear, which stuck fast in a fat tree root. A flock of shrieking black birds spiraled skyward as the giant, gnarled tree seemed to uncoil, and Jennifer saw that it was not a mass of roots looped about the trunk but a freakishly big snake the length of a custom RV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer leapt to her feet. “Holy {bleep bleep}12! Get your {bleep}13 out of the way!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late, the girl looked up just as the snake opened wide and swallowed her down in a giant gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“{Bleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep}14!” Jennifer said many, many times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snake, with its girl-size, midthroat bulge, turned to Jennifer with a strangled hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey say in near-death experiences that one’s life plays out before one’s eyes. Jennifer’s brain went to scan, flitting from one random image to the next: her mom coming home from the factory, bone-weary, angry, and utterly defeated, the bills sitting untouched on the chipped, Rent-A-Racket dinette set. Tommy, her little brother, riding around the crappy, one-bedroom apartment on a dumpster-dive Big Wheel till Jennifer thought she would scream from the constant whine of it. The days of ditching school to hang out at Galaxy Comics and talk mutants and Watchmen with Mohammed and Akilah, who ran the place and sometimes paid her in old comics if she’d help them stock. Getting busted for stealing a pack of Ho Hos from a Gas-It-N-Go and landing in juvie. The counselor who saw Jen as the perfect do-gooder project on her resume, offering her a chance at beauty pageant redemption meant to save them both. The crash. The island. The snake. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-queens/page-19.html","bookId":2717,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
