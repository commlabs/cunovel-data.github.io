Mirror, show me this Elle girl that Prince Severin is in love with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin held back a scoff at the description of Elle, but he was at Angelique’s side in a second when the glass swirled before displaying a disheartening image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Elle, clutching the leg she had broken and leaning against a bare tree. She turned to peer around it, buffeted by snow and wind, before darting to take cover beneath a bush. She reached into a small pouch tied to her belt and took out bandages, wrapping a nasty looking wound on her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that her?” Angelique asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Severin tightly said. “But how can I find her? She could be anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny frown spread on Angelique’s lips. “You mean you don’t know how to use this?” she asked, gesturing at the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I apologize, I don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngelique turned back to the mirror. “Mirror, show me the area this Elle girl that Prince Severin is in love with is in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image zoomed out, as if they were watching through the eyes of a bird who suddenly took flight. It showed craggy mountains smoothing into white plains before hitting a thick woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah-hah. I recognize that area. It’s in Verglas, a dozen or so miles from your border. That mountain on the horizon is called Gelus. She’s heading for Frigus Forest,” Angelique said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin was already placing folded clothes in a pack by the time Angelique finished identifying the landscape. He moved swiftly, wasting no movements but remaining controlled and tidy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are going after her?” Angelique asked, watching Severin select two waterproof maps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Severin said, opening a chest on the far side of the room to unearth a crossbow, three hand axes, and a rolled cloth case of daggers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bring clothes for her as well,” the enchantress suggested, smoothing the shimmering skirt of her dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin nodded and opened the door to tell Burke, “Send for Emele, and have Fidele and a spare mount of similar build and temperament saddled. Also ask Bernadine to make up a saddle pack with provisions to last two people a week.” Severin shut the door before his valet could bow. “Will you remain here long?” he asked Angelique as he strapped his saddle pack shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will be here when you return,” the enchantress said. “I am interested in meeting this Elle girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will inform a steward who will have a room cleaned out for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No need, I have friends in the area I wish to stay with. I would appreciate it if you did not alert your family of my arrival,” Angelique said, a pained expression briefly flickering across her lovely face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin paused for a moment. “Lucien recited poetry about you for some time after you left,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucien is a toad. Or he will be if you tell him I am here,” Angelique promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin cracked a half smile before hanging the pack over his shoulder and picking up his weapons. “Then I apologize for my abrupt exit. I cannot thank you enough for your help. Is there any way to repay you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seeing you with Elle will be enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin bowed. “If you need anything seek out Burke. He is discreet and will grant you whatever you desire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, and take care, Your Highness. I look forward to your return.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, for everything, My Lady,” Severin said before leaving his room. He stalked to Lucien’s study, moving with a feline grace he hadn’t lost with his transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guards outside Lucien’s study eyed Severin but made no move to stop him when the obviously displeased prince threw the door open without knocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucien looked up from the couch he was dramatically sprawled across. “Oh, Severin, it’s you. Perfect timing. Mumsy just sent me a note that father is intending to hold another ball this week. Since you did nothing but stand in a corner at the last four I thought you might want to escape it and run off to—.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucien.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Are you going somewhere?” the golden haired prince asked, finally noticing Severin’s pack and accessories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I’m going after Elle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ranger Seventy Eight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Elle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I fail to see the difference, they’re the same thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, they aren’t. Elle is a person, not a numbered, faceless servant. When she returns she will no longer be subject to your fits of fancy,” Severin said, resting the butt of the crossbow on the back of a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that. You paid off her contract,” Lucien frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Also we will not be going to war with Arcainia. It will ruin our foreign alliances, place undue stress on our citizens, and sacrifice soldiers who did not join our army for the purpose of getting you another toy. It’s a foolish idea. I won’t support it, and I will fight it with every piece of power and influence I possess,” Severin vowed, his eyes almost glowing with anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucien briefly pursed his lips. “Okay,” he agreed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-and-the-beast-timeless-fairy-tales-1/page-67.html","bookId":1808,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:06 PM"}
