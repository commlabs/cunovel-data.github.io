However, I wasn’t the slightest bit happy as Hai Shui had died because of me! The God King had also said that he didn’t have the power to revive the dead. This was to say that Hai Shui wouldn’t be able to return to my side. Why? Why did this happen? Hai Shui was such a kind hearted girl. Why did she had to die? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe God King said, “Child, you had accomplished such an ordeal task. I’m really happy for that. Currently, the human race already thinks that you have already passed on. Why don’t you stay in the God race then? Since you have inherited Mi Jie Lie’s position, you’ll become the new battle angel’s leader, the new Radiant God. In this God realm, you’ll have endless life.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“No!!!” I yelled in sadness. “No, I don’t want eternal life. I don’t want anything.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe God King seemed to be stunned for a moment. “My child, you should think it through carefully. A lot of people have dreamed to be able to become a god!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI shook my head with sadness. “No, God King, I don’t want to become a god nor do I want to have eternal life. I just want to be with my family and friends. You’re the God King. Are you really out of alternatives in helping me revive my friends? It’s just a tiny request from me. Please grant me this wish of mine.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe God King sighed. “Child, I understand your current feelings, but I had mentioned it previously that that is out of my powers! I’ll agree to any of your request, except that.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI dejectedly knelt to the ground as I looked at the divine instruments, staying silent for a long time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Child, please don’t be like this. Your contribution to the world, to all of the races, and to our God race has given rise to the survival of both worlds. Where there’s a gain, there’s also loss. Please state your request.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI took in a deep breath. “God King, I hope that you’ll withdraw all of the divine instruments and allow me to return to the human realm. I also don’t want eternal life. I just want to be an ordinary human and finish a not too long journey with my family and friends.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe God King exclaimed., “What?! You also don’t want to have eternal life?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI seriously nodded. “Eternal life doesn’t mean much to me. If my family and friends all died before me, what is the use of living on? Please grant me my wish.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter a moment, the God King replied, “Alright, since you have made up your mind, I won’t continue to force you. Zhang Gong, you’ll forever be a friend to our God race.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter a light flashed, my entire body was so warm and was in indescribable comfort. It was like taking a bath in a sea of light. “Zhang Gong, I’ve withdrawn the six divine weapons from your body, but still left you with the Radiant God’s powers. Your life force has already completely recovered. Return and do as you wish. I’ve got something to tell you. The spirit of the girl that was possessed by the Monster King hasn’t dissipated. You will still have the opportunity to meet her again in the future.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI was shocked and just as I wanted to ask him, my body was enveloped in intense light rays. With a flash of light, everything before me turned white and everything disappeared.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e　　…………\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven though the Monster race had been eradicated, the entire \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eStröm Fortress was in despair as the Child of Light, Zhang Gong Wei, who had saved the world, had sacrificed his young life for the world’s peace and harmony.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLao Lun Di caressed Mu ZI and Xiao Rou’s head with tears in his eyes. “Good children, stop crying. When a person passes on, they won’t be able to return. Zhang Gong is my one and only disciple but was also my pride. He had sacrificed his life to save everyone. Hi\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003es death carries a heavy weight.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLao Lun Di’s consolation didn’t stop everyone from crying, but made everyone wail instead. Zhang Gong had managed to kill the Monster King by unhesitantly burning his life force. His action had greatly touched everyone’s heart. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Report!!” A dispatched solver hurriedly entered the Commander’s division. “Reporting, there’s a peculiar phenomenon happening in the sky.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEveryone were alarmed and Chuan Song Zhen asked, “What phenomenon? Quickly describe it!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“There was a patch of coloured clouds that suddenly appeared in the sky and had stopped above the fort.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEveryone looked at each other before Zhan Hu said, “Let’s head out and check it out.” Everyone from the God Protector Domain and the leaders of the armies from the three kingdoms simultaneously headed out of the Commander’s division. It was as what the soldier had reported. There was a patch of coloured cloud in the sky. It looked exceptionally mesmerising under the sunlight.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eChuan Song Zhen ordered heavily, “Pass down my order that every troop should be on standby and to be on alert.” The appearance of the Monster race had already made everyone easily fearful.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I don’t think that’s necessary Teacher Zhen. It can’t be that you don’t want me to return right?” A voice that everyone couldn’t be more familiar with was heard. A gold light ray shone from the coloured cloud and moved before everyone like lightning.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Zhang Gong!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen I looked at the tears covered faces of the crowd, I said smilingly, “I’ve made everyone worried. I’ve returned.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu ZI and Xiao Rou jumped into my embrace and Mu Zi shouted crying, “Where did you go? You made me worried to death.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI caressed Mu Zi’s long hair and smiled, “Silly girl, everything has passed. I just went to tour the God realm. The only pitiful thing is that Hai Shui…...”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“God realm!” Everyone instantly exclaimed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-12-chapter-29\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-12-chapter-31\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-12-chapter-30","bookId":1498,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:31:03 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:31:03 AM"}
