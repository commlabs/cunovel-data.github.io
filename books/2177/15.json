Bill-E and I hurry after him. \"Shouldn\u0027t we have tied Davida up or knocked her out?\" I pant, running fast to catch up with Dervish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No time,\" he barks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe race through the mostly deserted streets of Slawter. Dervish spots a group of people making their way to the assembly point. He roars, \"Get out! Go back!\" They stop and stare at him oddly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s been an explosion!\" Bill-E yells, lurching up behind us. \"They think it\u0027s a gas leak. The entire gas system\u0027s been compromised. There could be further detonations anywhere within town. We have to get out. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good one,\" I compliment him as the panicked group turns and heads west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to think about this logically,\" he gasps, face red from running. \"If we tell people that demons are going to kill them, they\u0027ll think we\u0027re mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we make it a gas leak instead,\" I nod. \"Get them moving away from the danger zone. You hear that, Dervish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" he grunts. \"But in another few minutes we won\u0027t have to tell them anything- they\u0027ll see the demons themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe round a corner and approach the gigantic D warehouse. A huge crowd has gathered outside. Most of the people are at the southern end, but some spill around the east and west wings of the building. There are cameras everywhere, on tripods and cranes, in the hands of cameramen mingling with the crowd, a couple on top of the warehouse roof. I guess the cameramen are part of Davida\u0027s inner circle, wise to the Demonata, otherwise she couldn\u0027t trust them to man their posts when the chaos erupts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral of the crew have megaphones and are directing the crowd. Dervish storms over to the nearest one-a young man with a ponytail-grabs the megaphone and shouts into it, \"Gas leak! There have been explosions! Everybody out! We have to evacuate now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncertain mutterings among the crowd. People stop talking and stare at Dervish. He\u0027s running up and down, repeating his message, gesturing in all directions, telling people they have to make for the outskirts of town immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore anyone can move, a large man steps forward with a megaphone of his own. It\u0027s Tump Kooniart. \"Ignore that lunatic!\" Tump roars. \"It\u0027s Dervish Grady. We fired him last week. He\u0027s trying to disrupt proceedings to get his own back. Guards-seize him! The boys too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity guards move forward. Dervish curses and tosses his megaphone aside. \"Enough of this gas-leak crap,\" he mutters. \"Time to open their eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish says something magical and points at the guards closing in on him. They float up several metres into the air with yells of alarm and fear. All around us, jaws drop. Eyes fix on the floating guards, then on Dervish, who looks like a man charged full of electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish touches a couple of fingers to his throat and addresses the crowd, his voice far louder than it was with the aid of the megaphone. \"You\u0027re all going to die. Davida Haym has struck a deal with demons. Real demons. They\u0027re going to break out of the warehouse in a couple of minutes and kill everyone. Unless you flee now, you\u0027re doomed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ignore him!\" Tump Kooniart screams. \"He\u0027s lost his mind!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see Bo and Abe close behind their father. They look worried, scared, incredulous, like most of the people around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Real demons?\" Tump snorts. \"Madness! He\u0027s trying to wreck the shoot. He-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTump Kooniart chokes, drops the megaphone, falls to his knees, face purple, hands clawing at his throat and mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t kill him,\" I whisper in Dervish\u0027s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He deserves to die,\" Dervish snarls, looking completely unlike the gentle man I\u0027ve lived with all these months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I say, voice trembling. \"But we don\u0027t have the right to kill people. We\u0027re trying to save them, even those who don\u0027t deserve it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish snorts, but breaks the spell. Tump Kooniart breathes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to us,\" I shout, using magic to amplify my voice. \"I know it\u0027s hard to believe, but you can see the guards floating overhead. You can hear our voices, even though we\u0027re not using any equipment. Your lives are in danger. You have to run now or else-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough!\" Davida Haym screams, her voice even louder than mine or Dervish\u0027s. The guards fall back to earth, some injuring themselves badly. Davida\u0027s standing behind us, a groggy Chuda Sool by her side. Her eyes are blazing. \"You\u0027re not going to ruin my movie! Cameramen-are you ready?\" Dozens nod and shout that they are. \"Sound?\" Davida cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish raises a hand to stop her. Before he can, he\u0027s spun aside by a magical force. It\u0027s not Davida\u0027s work. Doesn\u0027t look like Chuda\u0027s doing it either. There must be a powerful, hidden mage somewhere in the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sound?\" Davida shouts again and this time there\u0027s an answering bellow. \"All right. Let\u0027s dispense with the countdown and cut to the chase. You lot inside the warehouse-it\u0027s time to make your grand entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Action!\" she roars, and the hounds of hell are unleashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant door in the middle of the southern wall of the warehouse explodes outwards. Those nearest it are caught by flying splinters, some as long as my arm. Most go down screaming, though a few are torn apart and killed instantly by the shrapnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned silence from those not struck by the debris of the blast. Everybody\u0027s staring at the wounded and dead. Wondering if this is real or part of the movie. They live in a make-believe world where anything can happen and nobody is ever really hurt. Their senses tell them this is different, it\u0027s not part of a script, they should run. But the movie-making part of their brain is trying to figure out how the explosion was arranged and how the scattering of the splinters was timed so as not to harm anybody-struggling to convince themselves that those on the ground are acting, the blood isn\u0027t real, it can\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish is back up on his feet. Staring at the hole in the wall like the rest of us. The explosion created clouds of dust around the doorway. As they clear, a figure glides forward from within the warehouse. Pale red skin, lumpen, no heart, eight arms-who else but the ringmaster himself, Lord Loss?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alas,\" he sighs, looking around sadly. \"Here we all are. Bound by chains of blood and death. No way out. Doomed. Dervish tried to warn you, to save you, but he failed. Here you are trapped. Here you will die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the cameramen moves in for a close-up. \"Yes,\" I hear Davida murmur. I glance back. She\u0027s speaking into a microphone, directing the cameraman. \"His face first, then pan down to the hole in his chest. I want to see those snakes slithering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Loss gazes without much interest into the camera. He smiles slightly, then runs his eyes over the crowd, judging their mood, taking in their expressions, most more confused than terrified. \"Ah,\" he notes. \"You do not believe. You think this is part of the film. That I am a movie prop.\" He chuckles. \"It is time to burst that bubble of misperception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moves to one side. I glimpse other shapes behind him. Eyes. Tendrils. Teeth. Claws. Fangs. \"Now, my darlings,\" Lord Loss whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demons spill out in their dozens, each one more misshapen and nightmarish than the last. A variety of vile monsters, spitting bile, oozing pus and blood, screeching and howling with malicious glee. They collide with the shocked members of the cast and crew closest to the building. Cut into and through them, severing limbs and heads, disembowelling, biting and clawing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealisation hits the masses swift and hard. A single scream rings out. Then a volley of them. Panic sweeps the crowd. A stampede develops, everyone wanting to get away from the demons, trampling over one another, the weak going down in the crush, dying beneath the feet of their workmates. Anarchy at its most destructive and terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Loss laughs and his laughter carries over the sounds of the screams. I\u0027m rooted to the spot, unable to react, heart jackhammering, not wanting this to be happening, wishing I could be anywhere in the world but here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the cameraman who moved forward turning away to capture the scenes of mayhem. \"Not yet!\" Davida snaps. \"Stay on the hole. Give me a close up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cameraman steps right up to Lord Loss\u0027 chest, manoeuvring his camera to within a few centimetres of the writhing, hissing snakes. He moves his head from behind the camera to check something-and one of the snakes strikes. It lashes out from within the hole where Lord Loss\u0027 heart should be. Sinks its tiny fangs into the cameraman\u0027s left cheek. He yelps, drops his camera and tries to pull away. But the snake has a firm hold. It yanks him closer so his face plunges into the hole. And now all the snakes are biting. The cameraman\u0027s arms and legs thrash wildly, then go still. He falls away a few seconds later, his face a blood-red map of bites and rips, skin flailed, bone cracked, brains dribbling down his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Davida gasps. \"He hadn\u0027t finished the shot! They shouldn\u0027t have...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops and studies the demons tearing into the humans. They\u0027re drawing no distinction between the intended victims and the collaborators, dragging down cameramen and other technicians as well as the unsuspecting members of the cast and crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Davida screeches. \"We had a deal!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Loss looks at her sneeringly. \"I do not make deals with fools. I promised you chaos, which you and your underlings could film, but I never said I would spare any of you. You simply assumed-and assumed wrong.\" He smiles at me. \"Greetings, Grubitsch. Such a pleasure to see you again. I will take much satisfaction from your long, slow, painful death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not today!\" Dervish bellows and suddenly he\u0027s by my side, right hand raised. He fires off a bolt of energy at Lord Loss. The demon master deflects it, but is knocked sideways. \"Come on!\" Dervish snaps at me and Bill-E. \"We have to get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about...?\" I gesture at the fleeing people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll summon them when-if-we blast a way out,\" Dervish says. \"The best thing they can do for now is flee. That will delay the demons and buy us some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\" Bill-E begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No arguments!\" Dervish barks. \"Follow me now or, so help me, I\u0027ll leave you for the bloody Demonata!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that he turns and flees south, sidestepping the stunned, frozen Davida Haym. There\u0027s no sign of Chuda, who must have deserted her when he realised they were going to perish along with those they\u0027d planned to sacrifice. I\u0027m not sure where he thinks he can run to or hide, but he fled anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavida can\u0027t move. She\u0027s weeping, seeing all her dreams of immortality go up in flames. I\u0027d like to say I feel sorry for her, but I don\u0027t. All I can think right now is, \"Serves you right, you mad old cow!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Bill-E and I are past the desolate producer, following Dervish through the warren of streets and alleys of Slawter, the screams of the dying and yowls of the demons rising all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisting and turning, Dervish in the lead, no apparent route in mind. He stops in the middle of a street. There are doors on either side of us. Handy for a getaway if we\u0027re attacked. \"Are you OK?\" he asks us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any reason we should be?\" I reply calmly, hiding my terror as best I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E says nothing. He looks like a shell-shocked soldier. As awful as I feel, I think Bill-E feels a hell of a lot worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy?\" Dervish says softly. \"Are you with us? Are all the lights on in there?\" He taps the side of Bill-E\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They killed them,\" Bill-E wheezes, his lazy left eyelid snapping open and shut at great speed. \"I saw a thing with... it looked like a tiger... but bits and pieces sticking out... it killed Salit. He tried to stop it. He didn\u0027t know it was real. He was acting his movie part, where he was a big hero. But it cut him down the middle and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have time for hysterics,\" Dervish growls. \"Be a man and help us fight, or go and babble somewhere until the demons find and kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate him for saying that, but I know he\u0027s only doing it for Bill-E\u0027s sake. Cruel to be kind and all that guff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E glares at Dervish, anger driving the fear away. \"I\u0027m not hysterical,\" he says stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to hear it,\" Dervish says. \"Now listen and listen good. Lord Loss is the only demon master. The rest are his familiars or others Davida roped in. Some are stronger than us but most aren\u0027t. We need to capture one of the weaker demons and use it to get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the other people?\" I ask quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take as many as we can,\" Dervish promises. \"If we\u0027re successful, I\u0027ll send a telepathic signal and let all the survivors know where we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not do that now?\" I ask. \"Arrange a meeting place and tell them to go there. It would give them more time, a better chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish shakes his head. \"Those who were working for the Demonata would receive the message too. They\u0027d go running to Lord Loss-try to save their own foul lives by selling out the rest of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" I mutter. \"So how do we catch a demon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish scratches his left cheek nervously. \"Bait,\" he says softly. And his gaze settles on Bill-E.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t like it. Hell, I hate it! But it\u0027s the quickest, easiest way. We\u0027re up to our eyeballs in trouble. We have to take risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe leave Bill-E standing in the middle of the street, twisting his hands, face crumpled with fear. He trusts us but he\u0027s terrified. I would be too in his shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If anything happens to him...\" I whisper to Dervish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t,\" Dervish says solidly. \"Now don\u0027t talk-watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute passes. Two. Screams fill the air, a chorus of agony and anguish. Every hair on my body is standing upright. I have to keep my teeth parted, afraid I\u0027ll grind down to the gums if I don\u0027t take care. Part of me wants to run, make for the barrier, force a way through, forget everybody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSave your own skin, it whispers. Dervish and Bill-E are the only ones who matter. Convince them to leave with you. Let the others look after themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore the treasonous, selfish voice-but only with an effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovement at the end of the street. Several figures come racing around a corner. Dervish and I tense, ready to unleash a burst of magic, then hold it back when we see that the figures are children. Bo Kooniart, Vanalee Metcalf, three others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run!\" Bo screams at Bill-E. \"We\u0027re being chased! Get the hell out of here, you moron, before-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bo!\" I yell. \"Over here.\" She stops, panting, eyes wide with terror. \"Quick!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there\u0027s-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Trust us. We can stop it. But you have to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here it comes,\" Dervish interrupts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look left. A demon with the body of a giant bee is humming through the air after Bo and the others. As it gets closer I see that it has a semi-human face, except with bee eyes and more teeth than any human I\u0027ve ever seen. Magic flares within me. I stretch out a hand in the direction of the bee demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" Dervish says. \"Let it get closer... closer... Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether we channel magic and unleash it. Twin bolts of energy strike the demon sharply, knocking it across the street, away from the children. It smashes into the wall on the opposite side. As it slumps to the ground, Dervish runs towards it. I follow, caught up in the moment, acting instinctively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bee shakes its head and starts to rise, buzzing angrily. Dervish grabs a wing before it gets out of reach. Yanks it down. The bee lashes out at him with a stinger the size of a large kitchen knife. He ducks. I scream and smash an elbow into the bee\u0027s semi-human face. Its teeth bite deep into my forearm, but I jerk my arm free before it can do serious damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I grab the bee with my uninjured arm, I feel Dervish\u0027s magic burn into the demon. It makes wild buzzing sounds. Thrashes, trying to break free, snapping its teeth, stabbing at him with its stinger. He holds on tight. I do too. I head-butt the bee, letting magic shoot through my forehead, intent on sizzling the demon\u0027s brains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not too much!\" Dervish pants as the demon goes slack. \"We want it alive.\" He stands, sliding both arms around the bee. \"Let\u0027s keep it like this and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monster!\" a voice screams and suddenly there\u0027s someone beside us. A hand shoots by my head. A fist buries itself deep in the demon\u0027s chest, then comes ripping out, dragging guts and yellow blood with it. Stunned, I fix on the face of the assailant-and my heart leaps joyfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Juni!\" I yell, releasing the bee\u0027s head, throwing my arms around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuni Swan hugs me hard, then steps away, staring at the demon, then her fist. \"How did I do that?\" she croaks. \"I felt something inside me. It was power, but I don\u0027t know where...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" Dervish says quietly, letting the dead demon drop to the floor. He smiles crookedly, then slips his arms around Juni and buries his face in her neck. \"We thought you were dead,\" he half sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was... dreaming, I think,\" she says. \"Bill-E was kidnapped. We rescued him. Then we were attacked by ninjas and had to go to a mountain in search of their lair.\" She shakes her head. \"I woke up in a small room. I came out and saw demons. I fled. Then I saw you. I thought the bee was going to kill you. Something exploded inside me. Before I knew it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares at her fist again, a look of astonishment on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems you have a talent for magic after all,\" Dervish chuckles, then sighs. \"But you timed it badly. We wanted this one alive.\" He quickly explains his plan to her and the children, who\u0027ve crept across. Bo seems to be less shaken than the others. She\u0027s trembling fiercely and her face is white with fear, but she\u0027s in control of her senses and listens intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI use magic to heal my wounded arm and watch Bo cautiously. Her father was one of the collaborators but that\u0027s not her fault. I\u0027m pretty sure she didn\u0027t know about his pact with the Demonata. Bo was never anything worse than a spoilt brat. You don\u0027t deserve to be killed for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish finishes outlining his plan. \"So Grubbs, Juni and I will pull back, leave you kids here, wait for another demon to come along, then... kablooey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kablooey?\" Juni repeats, raising an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I liked comics when I was a kid,\" Dervish says with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are we going to get the demon to the barrier?\" Bo asks, and though her teeth chatter, her voice sounds normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grubbs and I will drag it there,\" Dervish says. \"Juni can help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here she goes,\" Bill-E groans. \"Always has to have her say!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, shrimp-breath!\" Bo snaps, then appeals to Dervish. \"I don\u0027t want to be a troublemaker. I just want to get out of this alive. But it\u0027s what you said about how you were going to alert everybody and tell them where to come.\" She pauses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" Dervish says kindly, though if I was in charge, I\u0027d tell her to put a sock in it. She\u0027s being a drama queen, trying to grab the attention. Typical Bo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Bo says hesitantly, \"if you\u0027re able to use telepathy, I was wondering... can demons do the same?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish stares at Bo, then nods slowly. \"Some can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Bo continues, \"if you catch a demon and it realises you\u0027re dragging it off to the edge of town to kill it, won\u0027t it call for help? And bring a load of other demons down on top of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish scowls. \"She\u0027s right. It\u0027ll take several minutes to get to the barrier from here. If the demon summoned help, we\u0027d never make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t we knock it unconscious?\" Juni asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps. But if it gets out a shout...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe falls silent. Bo looks at me smugly, but I\u0027m too impressed to bear her any ill feelings. She\u0027s not entirely brainless, I\u0027m reluctantly forced to admit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a suggestion,\" Bo says. She\u0027s stopped trembling. Confident. On a roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all ears,\" Dervish says with a wry smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we lure a demon to the barrier before you go messing with it? Trick it into chasing after us. It wouldn\u0027t call for help if it didn\u0027t know its life was in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a genius in our midst,\" Dervish says, smile widening. Bo beams like an angel. Despite myself, I have to laugh. She\u0027ll be more unbearable than ever after this, but right now that doesn\u0027t seem like such a bad thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s only one problem with your proposal,\" Dervish says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Problem?\" Bo frowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Running\u0027s dangerous. If there\u0027s a demon hot on your heels, you can\u0027t concentrate on what lies ahead. Very easy to run into another demon, or a pack of them. We can\u0027t control the situation if we do what you suggest. And control is vital. Grubbs and I must reach the barrier. If we don\u0027t, everybody dies. We can\u0027t risk running into a trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBo mulls that over, starts to speak, goes silent, then says very quietly, \"What if the rest of us did the running? What if you and Grubbs went to the barrier and we tried to lure a demon to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink, astonished. I never thought I\u0027d hear the spoilt Bo Kooniart make a suggestion like that. What she\u0027s proposing is close to self-sacrifice. Without us, she and the others won\u0027t stand much of a chance against the demons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what you\u0027re saying?\" Dervish\u0027s voice is grave. \"You know the risk you\u0027d be taking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. But it doesn\u0027t seem like we have much of an option, does it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not doing it!\" Vanalee protests, bursting into tears. \"I want to come with you, Mr. Grady! Please don\u0027t make me go after demons!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t make anybody do anything,\" Dervish says. He looks at the other children. \"Bo\u0027s risking a great deal for us. Will anyone volunteer to help her or does she have to face the demons by herself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three children look at one another. Two raise shaky hands. The third hangs his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Dervish says. \"Now all we have to do is arrange a meeting place, so you know where-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go too,\" Bill-E interrupts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to.\" He smiles thinly. \"I\u0027m not magical like you and Dervish. There\u0027s no benefit in me coming with you. I can do more good with Bo and the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right,\" Dervish says. I look at my uncle, unable to believe he\u0027d let Bill-E go like this. But his eyes are dark and firm. This isn\u0027t easy for him but he\u0027s going to let Bill-E go anyway. I start to protest, but then I realise why Dervish is doing this-it wouldn\u0027t be fair to let Bo and the others volunteer and not put forward one of our own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go,\" I whisper. \"You take Bill-E.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dervish says. \"I need you at the barrier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"You can kill a demon without me. And you have Juni to help. The others will stand a better chance if I go with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish hesitates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can both go,\" Bill-E says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You\u0027re sticking with Dervish, no arguing.\" I lower my voice so only Bill-E can hear. \"I don\u0027t want him to lose us both. And you\u0027re his son-you\u0027re more important to him than I am.\" I hate lying to Bill-E, but if it saves his life, it will be worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Bill-E says miserably, after a moment of tormented consideration. \"But I\u0027ll kill you if you don\u0027t come back alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Dervish says. \"We\u0027re wasting time and we don\u0027t have much of it. Grubbs can go with the others. Now, you know the old hat store we passed when we tried to drive out of here?\" I nod. \"Make your way to that, then head due west. We\u0027ll be waiting. Come as fast as you can.\" He looks at Juni. \"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think I should go with the children?\" Juni says nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They\u0027re as safe with Grubbs as they would be with you. Safer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... I don\u0027t like it... but if you think that\u0027s best...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is.\" Dervish looks at me steadily. \"See you soon-and that\u0027s an order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he, Juni, Bill-E, Vanalee and the boy head west to safety. Dervish is the only one who keeps his sights set firmly ahead. The others all look back, faces dark with doubt. They think they won\u0027t ever see us again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to call after Bill-E and tell him we\u0027re brothers. I don\u0027t want to die without telling him the truth. But my mouth\u0027s dry. My throat\u0027s tight. I can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at Bo and the others. One\u0027s a boy a year or two older than me. The second\u0027s a girl a few years younger. I don\u0027t know either of them. I think about asking their names, then decide it\u0027s better not to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready?\" Bo asks, taking control, even though I\u0027m the one who should be in charge. We nod silently and turn towards the sounds of bloodshed and mayhem. Pause a terrified moment. Then silently jog back into the death den of the Demonata. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slawter-the-demonata-3/page-15.html","bookId":2177,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:44:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:44:34 PM"}
