Currently, the leaders of the various factions in the Heaven Wind Sea Region all felt a chill over their bodies. In fact, the experts from the Wei clan all had ashen faces, and Wei Zhen’s body was even trembling. With fear in his eyes, he stared at Lin Dong. After all, never did he imagine that this famous little fellow from before, was actually so frightening now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith his current strength, it was likely that he could exterminate the entire Wei clan with the flip of his palm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, Lin Dong merely glanced at him and it seemed like he had no plans to make life difficult for them.

Suppressing the waves in his heart, he smiled towards Lin Dong. In fact, when he saw that Lin Dong had greeted Gu Mengqi and Gu Yan, instead of feeling displeased in his heart, he felt great joy.

However, they chose not to question him further as they simply nodded their heads gently. After which, they turned to look at Ying Huanhuan and Qingtan, who were standing behind Lin Dong. Both of them were gorgeous ladies. One was icy cold and perfect, while the other was pretty and cute. Moreover, their demeanors were extraordinary.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This is Ying Huanhuan, my martial junior from Dao Sect.

After which, he turned his attention towards the leaders of the various factions of the Heaven Wind Sea Region, before he said, “All of you should be aware of the current situation in the Martial Gathering Island. You will all have to listen to me if you wish to keep your lives. Are there any objections?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThere were a huge number of Yimo outside the Martial Gathering Island.

Finally, he turned his head and uttered those words to Ying Huanhuan and Qingtan. Although the Gu clan was one of the five big clans, they were not the strongest faction in the Heaven Wind Sea Region.

Then, she clenched her small hand before her huge Darkness Saint Scythe appeared. Following which, she swung her scythe before everyone saw a huge spatial crack appearing in the sky.
