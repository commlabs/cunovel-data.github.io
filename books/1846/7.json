This is Melanie. We met in the diner last week?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hi!\" I said, waving bye to Maggie as I walked toward the door. \"Yes, of course I remember you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie smiled and waved back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh good!\" she said. \"Well I hope I didn\u0027t catch you at a bad time, but me and Liza are going out tonight, and we wanted to see if you\u0027d like to join us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped outside into the muggy afternoon sunshine and started walking toward my car. I remembered my thought about trying to be a normal girl again, do normal girl stuff. \"Um, well, yeah, okay, that sounds good. Sure, I\u0027d love to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, great! We\u0027ll pick you up. Nine okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s good. I\u0027ll be ready.\" I gave her my address and she knew right where it was, and so we said goodbye and hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I was putting the key in my lock, I noticed a group of boys about ten or twelve years old on the other side of the street, laughing uproariously. The bigger of the boys was pushing a smaller kid who was wearing glasses and had an arm full of books. As the big kid gave the smaller boy a particularly hard shove, the boy lurched forward, his books scattering on the sidewalk. The other boys laughed some more and walked off, one of them calling behind him, \"Nice one, freak!\" Even from across the street, I could see the embarrassment that washed over the small boy\u0027s face right before he squatted down to pick up his books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle jerks. God, I hated bullies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed across the street to help the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got there, he looked up at me cautiously, his chin quivering slightly. I noticed that he had a light scar where he must have had surgery to fix a cleft palate. \"Hey,\" I said quietly, smiling a small smile at him and bending down to help him pick up the books. \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said quietly, his eyes darting to me and then away as his cheeks colored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a reader, huh?\" I asked, tilting my head toward the books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, still looking shy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the title in my hand. \"Harry Potter… hmm. This is a good one. Do you know why I like this one so much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes found mine and he shook his head no, but didn\u0027t look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s about an underdog who no one at all believed in–this funny looking kid in glasses who lived under his aunt and uncle\u0027s stairs. But guess what? He ends up doing some pretty cool stuff despite everything he has going against him. There\u0027s nothing better than watching someone no one expects to win, come out ahead, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little boy\u0027s eyes grew wide and he nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up and so did he. As I handed him the books I had collected, I said, \"Keep up the reading. Girls love it.\" I winked at him and his face broke into a huge grin, beaming at me. I smiled back and turned to walk away when I noticed Archer Hale standing in a doorway just a few stores away, watching us, an intense, unreadable expression on his face. I smiled at him, tilting my head, and something seemed to pass between us again. I blinked and Archer looked away, turning to walk down the street. He looked back at me once as he moved away, but when I caught his eye, he immediately turned again and kept walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there for a couple seconds, watching Archer walk in one direction, and then turned my head to see the little boy walking in the opposite direction. I huffed out a breath and turned around and walked back across the street to my car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped at the local nursery on the way out of downtown and picked up some flowers and soil and a couple plastic planters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got home, I changed into shorts and a t-shirt and spent a couple hours re-potting the flowers, placing them on my porch and doing a general yard clean-up, including weeding and sweeping off the front stairs. One of them was loose, and getting looser, but I was a disaster when it came to home improvement projects. I\u0027d have to call George Connick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I stood back to admire all my work, I couldn\u0027t help smiling at my little cottage. It was adorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went inside and took a long shower, scrubbing the dirt from under my nails and shaving everywhere. Then I turned on the small radio that was in the cottage and listened to a local music station and took some extra time doing my hair, drying it, and curling it with a curling iron so that it was long and wavy. I put on my make-up carefully and then lotioned my legs up so that they would look nice in my stretch knit, dark silver dress with the scoop back. It was casual yet sexy and I hoped it would work for where we were going tonight. I made it even slightly more casual with my slip on black sandals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I had worn this dress was a graduation party my dorm threw. I had drunk my fair share of keg beer, laughed with the other girls on my floor, and made out with a guy I had always thought was cute, but hadn\u0027t spoken to until that night. He wasn\u0027t a very good kisser, but I was just drunk enough not to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stood there remembering, thinking about the girl I was, I missed her. I missed my old self. I hadn\u0027t been a girl unmarked by tragedy. I wasn\u0027t na?ve to the ways of the world. I knew that you weren\u0027t guaranteed anything and that life wasn\u0027t always fair. But my father and I had survived the tragedy of my mother\u0027s illness together and we were strong. I had never once considered that he would be snatched from me in an instant, in a senseless moment that left me alone and reeling. And that I wouldn\u0027t get to say goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps this road trip that I was on wasn\u0027t the answer I had hoped it was. It hadn\u0027t really been a conscious choice though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything in Ohio had reminded me of my dad, my grief, my fear and my loneliness. Several numb months after that night, I had packed a small suitcase, put Phoebe in her dog carrier, got in my car and drove off. It felt like the only option. The sadness was suffocating, claustrophobic. I needed to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself to snap out of it before I sunk too far down into fear and melancholy. It was Saturday night, the weekend. And on the weekend, normal girls went out with their girlfriends and had some fun. I deserved a little bit of that, didn’t I… didn\u0027t I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie and Liza pulled up in front of my cottage a few minutes after nine and when I saw their headlights, I went outside, locking up behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the small Honda swung open and Justin Timberlake blared out, breaking the silence of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned as I pulled the back door open and got in to Melanie and Liza saying warmly, \"Hey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look hot!\" Liza offered, looking back over her shoulder as Melanie pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I smiled. \"You too!\" They were both wearing skirts and tank tops and I felt relieved that I had chosen a similar outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we drove the thirty minutes to the other side of the lake, we chatted casually about my job at the diner and how I liked Pelion so far, and Melanie and Liza told me a little bit about their summer life-guarding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pulled up in front of a bar called The Bitter End Lakeside Saloon, a small, wooden structure by the side of the road with a parking lot out front. As we got out of Melanie\u0027s car, I could see that the front was decorated with fishing poles, lobster cages, boating signs, tackle boxes, and other things lake related.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked inside to the smell of beer and popcorn, the sounds of laughter, loud talk, and pool balls hitting each other. The bar looked a lot bigger on the inside than the outside had indicated. It felt simultaneously dive-like and trendy, with more fishing items and signs adorning the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe showed our ID\u0027s to the bouncer and took a seat at a table by the bar. By the time we got our first round of drinks, there was already a line forming at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spent the first twenty minutes or so laughing and chatting. Melanie and Liza were scoping out the guys they thought were cute and trying not to make it obvious. Melanie noticed someone almost immediately and went about the business of catching his eye. It worked and after a few minutes, he came over and asked her to dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed him away from our table, looking back and winking as Liza and I shook our heads, laughing. We signaled the waitress for another round. I was already having fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I tipped back my beer, a man just walking in caught my eye. His head was turned, but I could see his broad shoulders and long, muscular legs encased in a pair of well-worn looking jeans. Oh, wow. Just the sheer size of him, his build, and his wavy brown hair made me blink and train my eyes his way as he began to turn. He turned toward me, laughing at something the guy next to him said and our eyes met. Travis Hale. His eyes flared slightly, and his smile grew larger as he made a beeline for our table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo girls trailing along behind him stopped and looked dejected when they saw where he was headed. They turned to the group behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bree Prescott,\" he said, his eyes lowering to my breasts for a flash before returning to my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Travis Hale,\" I answered, smiling and taking another pull on my beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at me. \"I didn\u0027t know you\u0027d be here tonight.\" He glanced over at Liza and said simply, \"Liza.\" She took a sip of her drink and said, \"Hey, Trav.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiza stood up and said, \"I\u0027m gonna go to the ladies room. I\u0027ll be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, okay, do you want me to go with you?\" I asked, starting to stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis put his hand on my arm. \"I\u0027m sure she can manage,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m good,\" Liza said, her eyes lingering on Travis\u0027s hand on my arm. \"I\u0027ll be back in a few.\" And with that, she turned and walked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis looked back at me. \"So I thought I was the one who was supposed to give you the welcome tour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and then shrugged, looking up at him through my lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned again. He had a really nice grin. Somewhat predatory, I supposed, but was that a bad thing? I supposed it depended. But I had two drinks in me, and so for right then it felt good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis leaned in. \"So, Bree, this road trip you\u0027re on… when\u0027s it going to end?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered his question. \"I don\u0027t really have a specific plan, Travis. I suppose I\u0027ll turn around and go home eventually.\" I took a drink of my beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Think you\u0027ll stick around here for a while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"Depends,\" I said, frowning slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On if I keep feeling safe here,\" I blurted out. I didn\u0027t necessarily mean to say it, but the beer was hitting my empty stomach and my bloodstream like a truth serum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and peeled up the edge of the label on my beer bottle suddenly feeling exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis studied me for a couple beats and then smiled a slow grin. \"Well, that\u0027s good then because as it turns out, safety is my specialty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my eyes to his face and couldn\u0027t help laughing at his cocky expression. \"Oh, I have a feeling that you\u0027re anything but safe, Officer Hale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe faked hurt and slid his body into the seat that Liza had vacated a few minutes before. \"Well that hurts me deeply, Bree. Why would you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"Well, for one,\" I leaned forward, \"if those blondes who came in with you could shoot poison arrows with their eyes, I would have been dead about fifteen minutes ago. And the redhead to my left, she hasn\u0027t taken her eyes off of you for one second since you got here. I even think I saw her wipe a little drool off of her lip. I have a feeling they all have plans for you tonight.\" I raised one eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his eyes trained on me, not glancing at any of them. He leaned back in his chair, cocking his head and bringing one arm over the back. \"I can\u0027t help the ideas other people get in their heads. And anyway, what if my plans are different? What if my plans involve you?\" He smiled lazily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, this guy was good. All cool charm and self-confidence. But it felt good to harmlessly flirt with someone–I was glad I hadn\u0027t completely forgotten how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back at him and took a sip of my beer, keeping my eyes on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed in on my lips around the neck of the bottle and flared slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you play pool?\" I asked after a minute, changing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do anything you want me to do,\" he said easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"Okay then, impress me with your geometry skills,\" I said, starting to stand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely,\" he said back, taking my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe moved over to the pool tables and Travis ordered us another round as we waited for our turn. After a little while, Melanie and Liza, and the guys Melanie had met all came over, too, and we spent the rest of the night laughing and playing pool. Travis was way too good at pool and won every game easily, clearly taking pleasure in showing off his skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiza had switched to water early on so that she could drive us home, and I did as well close to midnight. I didn\u0027t want the next day, which was my day off, to be spent recovering in bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the lights flashed indicating the bar would be closing, Travis pulled me in to his body and said, \"God, Bree, you\u0027re the most beautiful girl I\u0027ve ever seen.\" His voice was like silk. \"Let me take you out to dinner this week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drinks I had had earlier were wearing off, and I suddenly felt slightly uncomfortable by Travis\u0027s smooth moves and forward flirting. \"Um…\" I hedged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiza interrupted us suddenly saying, \"Ready, Bree?\" and Travis gave her an annoyed look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone has to eat,\" Travis offered, looking back at me and smiling charmingly. I laughed and hesitantly wrote my number down on a napkin for Travis, making a mental note to buy more minutes. I had left my cell phone back in Cincinnati when I left and had picked up one of those toss-away cell phones. It worked for me, but I just kept forgetting to keep it stocked with minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said goodnight to everyone, and Liza, Melanie, and I left, laughing all the way to the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we got on the road, Melanie said, \"Travis Hale, Bree? Geez, you went straight to the Pelion dating big leagues, didn\u0027t you? Hell, the state of Maine big leagues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"Is that what Travis Hale is considered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yeah. I mean, he gets around, but I don\u0027t blame him. Girls usually throw themselves at him–trying to pin him down. Maybe you\u0027ll be the one that finally does it.\" She winked back at me and Liza laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you girls…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, no,\" they both said simultaneously. Then Liza continued. \"Too many of our friends hooked up with him and then thought they were in love. We\u0027ve seen the destruction he leaves in his wake. Just be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, but didn\u0027t say anything. Careful was my middle name these days. However, despite the fact that Travis\u0027s flirting had made me feel slightly uncomfortable at the end of the night, I was proud of myself for taking a few steps in that direction at all. And I\u0027d had a fun time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe chatted a little more about the other guys they had met and before I knew it, we were pulling up in front of my cottage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed out, whispering, \"Bye! Thank you so much!\" not wanting to wake any of the neighbors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll call you!\" they called, waving back and then driving away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI washed my face and brushed my teeth and that night, I went to bed smiling, thinking, hoping, maybe I\u0027d wake up smiling too. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/archer-s-voice/page-7.html","bookId":1846,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:56 PM"}
