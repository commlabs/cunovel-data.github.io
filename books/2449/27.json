Too tight a balance and you get oscillatory inaction, but that balancing act rides the wave of consciousness. All creatures display it in some form, but the sophisticated, symbol-juggling form displayed by humans has to be related to the kind of consciousness-answer we seek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Morgan Hempstead, Lectures at Moonbase\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRUDENCE WIPED PERSPIRATION from her cheek, returned her attention to the big board. For almost half an hour now she had been dividing her attention between the board and Bickel. It drained her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBickel, working in the shop with Timberlake, obviously was caught in unspoken indecision, skirting all around it. Something had happened... something which Bickel refused to share with the rest of the crew. He went through the motions of refining that Ox-monstrosity, but something was making him fearful beyond any normal caution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA telltale on the board flickered into the red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve just lost another sensor,\" Prudence said, reading the telltale. \"....t 4CtB5K2.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Second pi, fourth ring and in behind number five shielding layer,\" Timberlake said. \"That\u0027s damn close to the hyb tanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll check it,\" Flattery said, unlocking the bottom of his couch. He swung his feet to the deck, slipped his helmet forward, but left it unsealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a robox-R in that area?\" Bickel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the difference?\" Flattery asked. \"By the time we found one and traced out the control sequence -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going to check that sensor or aren\u0027t we?\" Timberlake demanded. He glared into the screen at Flattery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on my way,\" Flattery said. I mustn\u0027t let Tim preempt this job, he thought. I need the excuse to go past quarters for a quick check on what Bickel\u0027s done. It\u0027s something violent and dangerous. He has himself under very thin control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raj,\" Prudence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned at the hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That... thing down there in the shop could reproduce itself with no help from us. Every machine tool, every robox monkey, every muscle and sensor is programmed through the computer. Once the last tie-in is made...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery wet his lips with his tongue, ducked out through the hatch without answering her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy\u0027n hell did she bring that up now? Bickel wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That goddamn slowpoke,\" Timberlake said. \"I should\u0027ve gone myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrudence shifted a corner of her board to monitor Flattery\u0027s progress. She glanced up at the screen. Bickel was staring back past her at the hatch where Flattery had gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaj was depressed at the thought of reproduction being linked to consciousness, Bickel thought. What Prudence told him should\u0027ve lifted some of that depression. It didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sense of foreboding poured through Bickel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgrammed for destruction equals a need for destruction, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat am I afraid of? he wondered. What new thing? The fact that the Ox could reproduce itself by using the tool tapes and mechanical muscles of the ship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prue, do you have a fix on Raj?\" Bickel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a prime repair dolly and he\u0027ll be at the trouble spot in another minute or so,\" she said. \"I ran a continuity check on the...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No sense in that,\" Bickel said. \"The trouble\u0027s in the sensor itself. The continuity net has hundreds of backups and alternate circuits. What failed, a heat sensor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Multiple,\" she said. \"Heat-sound-visual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That thing\u0027s down near the temperature-control shutters in the baffle to the hyb tanks,\" Timberlake muttered. \"Too goddamn close to them. You getting any heat shifts on the other sensors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing significant,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrudence flicked a switch, watching the shifting factors of temperature-weight-sound on her board, the telltales moving with Flattery. She hit another switch: \"Raj, how much longer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery\u0027s voice came out of the overhead command vocoder: \"Another minute or so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited in silence, listening to the sounds of Flattery\u0027s progress through the open command vocoder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrudence activated a guide beam to the dead sensor as Flattery passed the water baffles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baffles secure,\" she said, reading her board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All secure,\" Flattery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dogged that last hatch, knowing the action would register in front of Prudence in Com-central. The action sent a faint fear response through him. He had symbolically cut himself off from the core of the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll fix this sensor and get back to quarters as soon as I can, he told himself. It\u0027ll seem natural for me to stop off there on my way back. I have to find out what Bickel\u0027s done, but I can\u0027t make him suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery turned, studied his surroundings. He stood in the bulb lock that served as a hub for outer-hull communications tubes in this sector. It was an oval for strength, about six meters across its short diameter, and seven meters deep. He oriented himself by the faint pull of ship gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nonfunctioning sensor was up a tube that curved off at two o\u0027clock on his right. Tube eight, ring K. The number checked. The failure would be at the five-line. He stared into the pale gray metal gap illuminated by cold light. A green guide beam beckoned in the tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrue remembered to set the guide beam, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the repair dolly in his left hand, made the low-grav leap across to the tube and caught its access rung. He pushed the dolly in ahead of him, setting its sensors on the printed track, fed it low power to pull him into the tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe autolock\u0027s sphincter closed behind him: He suddenly remembered Anderson strangled in a rogue sphincter... but of course that was no problem now... with all the OMCs dead. The fact that one of the crew had to come out here and make this repair meant the dangers were of another sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something wrong?\" Prudence asked, her voice filling his helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the telltales stop here, Flattery thought. It gave him a feeling of reassurance that she was so alert to his movements - or lack of movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing wrong; just being cautious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want Tim to come out and back you up?\" Prudence asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need anyone to hold my hand!\" Flattery snapped, and he wondered at the sudden anger he\u0027d thrown into that rejection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re at Station Two,\" Prudence said. \"There\u0027s video on Two. Check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery glanced up at the ring of sensors on the tube, saw the one circled with yellow for video, waved at it as he passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robox-R\u0027s imprinted track curved up the tube side to clear the base bulge for the next automatic lock. He went through, looked back as the transparent shutters squeezed closed behind him. The ship\u0027s core felt so far away back there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked forward, letting the robox unit tow him with its faint hissing growl, letting the loneliness seep through him. With an OMC in control, an automatic robox repair unit could have been sent on this little chore. Mobility, that was the problem. Where there were fixed automatic repair units - along the outer hull and at the major bulkhead locks, at the baffles and core-integrity barriers - the ship took care of itself with only a little help from its crew. But let a little thing like this come up - where you needed mobility and a decision factor - then one of the crew had to risk himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery cursed the Tin Egg\u0027s designers then. Hate poured out of him. He knew why they had done this - the \"planned increment of frustration\" they called it. That was fine - as long as one of the ship\u0027s designers didn\u0027t have to experience the frustration... or the deadliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was at Station Four now, coming up on Five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Station Five coming up,\" he said. \"Hey!\" He cut the power on the robox, braked himself against the station\u0027s ring, stared up at the overhead arc of sensors. A neat, shiny hole plugged with gray foam-coagulant occupied the position where the multi-sensor had been. The yellow-green-red code rings on the tube around the hole had not been touched. He swung his gaze around the tube and the other sensors. All appeared to be functioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery thought then of the island on Puget Sound - sensors missing mysteriously... personnel missing. He felt cold sweat around his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrudence\u0027s voice filled his helmet: \"Anything to report?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered the volume. \"The multisensor seems to\u0027ve been cut out in some way. It\u0027s gone. The hole\u0027s been plugged with foam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No foam automatics in that area,\" Prudence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing\u0027s been plugged with foam anyway!\" Flattery was unable to hide the angry irritation in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrudence suddenly said, \"John, I\u0027m getting a demand drain on the computer. Is it something you\u0027re doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Bickel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery turned his head in the helmet. Bickel\u0027s voice had come in faintly as a pickup through Com-central. Action in the computer! Flattery forced himself to act calmly, removed a replacement sensor from his robox unit\u0027s parts compartment, checked it. The thing was about three inches in diameter, containing a warp-type thermal detector, standard vid-eye pickups like tiny jewels on its face, and three gridded ducts leading into the membrane of the audio unit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of one eye, Flattery detected movement up the tube. He jerked upright, banged his head against the helmet liner, stared up toward Station Six.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA robox-R with its tool extensors clamped tightly to its sides was moving along the tape track toward him. The thing acted sick - speeding and slowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis first thought was that Prudence had traced the robox remote controls for a unit in this area and was maneuvering the thing from her board. The crudity of Com-central\u0027s controls over the robox series would account for the unit\u0027s erratic behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bringing another robox in here, Prue?\" Flattery asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s another robox-R coming down on this station,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he watched, the thing lost the tape track, relocated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There can\u0027t be! Nothing at all shows on my board.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing stopped across the sensor ring from Flattery. An auger extension jerked away from its side, reached toward the foam-plugged hole, withdrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s controlling that thing?\" Flattery demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not from here,\" Prudence said. \"And I can see both Tim and John. They\u0027re not controlling it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still getting drain on the computer?\" Flattery whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is the... Ox active?\" Flattery asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only the original circuits,\" Bickel said. \"Through the AAT bypass. The new doubled units haven\u0027t been connected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There can\u0027t be another robox in that area,\" Prudence insisted. \"We haven\u0027t put any of the damn things on automatic. There\u0027s nothing showing on my board. The remotes would take a day and a half at least to -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s right in front of me,\" Flattery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched it, fascinated. A tool arm extended with an empty sensor socket, reached toward the foam-plugged hole, retreated. A claw arm came up next. It probed the foam, drew back with a swiftness that startled Flattery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s it doing?\" Prudence asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. It seems to be looking over the damage. Its vid-eyes are turned toward the hole. It acts like it can\u0027t decide which tool to use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can\u0027t decide?\" That was Timberlake, his voice faint over the Com-central relay from the shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try fixing the sensor yourself,\" Bickel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery swallowed in a dry throat. He lifted a feeler with a guide eye from the tool pouch on his own robox, probed into the foam plug looking for the leads from the conduit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, a whiplike extension shot out of the other robox, trapped his arm, jerked it away. The pain in his arm where the thing had clamped on it was sharp and shocking. He dropped the tool, yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" Prudence demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whiplike extension slowly unwound, released his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing grabbed me,\" Flattery said. His voice was shaky with pain and surprise. \"It used its circuit probe... grabbed my arm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t let you make the repair?\" That was Bickel, his voice coming in loud over the helmet system, indicating he\u0027d plugged into the command circuit from the shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t look like it,\" Flattery said. And he wondered: Why doesn\u0027t one of us say what this thing has to be? Why\u0027re we avoiding the obvious?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an abrupt sense of purpose, the other robox reached out a claw arm, lifted the replacement sensor from Flattery\u0027s left hand, matched sensor and socket. Another claw arm recovered the feeler guide, fitted it to the connections of its own circuit probe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s it doing now?\" Bickel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Making the repair itself,\" Flattery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeler came out of the hole pulling the leads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John, what\u0027s showing on your meters?\" Prudence asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A slight pulse from the servo banks,\" Bickel answered. \"Very faint. It\u0027s like the cycling echo of a test pulse. Are you still showing current drain in there? I don\u0027t have it here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drain from the mains into the computer. You should be registering it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Negative,\" Bickel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just fitted the new socket and sensor into the hole,\" Flattery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It brought the correct spare parts?\" Bickel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It took the sensor I brought,\" Flattery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just took it from you?\" Prudence asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prue, that test pulse is stronger,\" Bickel said. \"Are you sure nothing on your board is doing it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scanned her console. \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Job\u0027s finished,\" Flattery said. \"What\u0027s the big board show, Prue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sensor in service,\" she said. \"I can see you... and it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try touching that new sensor, Raj,\" Bickel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing damn near took my arm out the last time I tried that,\" Flattery objected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use a tool,\" Bickel said. \"Something long. You\u0027ve got a telescoping radiation probe there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery looked into his robox unit, removed the telescoping probe. He extended it to its limit, reached toward the sensor, touched it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whip-arm flashed out of the other robox. There came a jolting shock and Flattery stared wide-eyed at the stump of the probe in his hand. The severed end drifted upward along the tube, tumbling from the force of the blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keee-rist!\" That was Timberlake, proving they had the shop\u0027s screen switched to this circuit and were watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery swallowed, spoke in a muffled voice: \"If that\u0027d been my arm...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the other robox. It sat there, quiescent, its vid-eyes pointed toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re playing with fire, Flattery thought. We don\u0027t know what\u0027s guiding that robox. It could be a repair program we\u0027ve accidentally activated. It could be something the Tin Egg\u0027s designers built into the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better get out of there, Raj,\" Prudence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, wait!\" Bickel said. \"Raj, don\u0027t move. You hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you,\" Flattery said. He stared at the robox, realizing the thing could cut him in half with one blow from that whipping circuit probe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of distant activity came through the helmet phones to Flattery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have the full computer showing here,\" Bickel said, \"but I can\u0027t find that damn robox anywhere on my board. There\u0027s not even pulse resonance in any of the loops to hint at the source of control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stay out here forever,\" Flattery whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s showing on the meters, Prue?\" Bickel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still getting computer drain... and that pulse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raj has been outside the shields for sixteen minutes,\" Timberlake said. \"Prue, what\u0027s the radiation tolerance level for his area?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed the comparison lines against the time gauge on her main board scope, read the difference. \"He should be back inside the shield lock within thirty-eight minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovement up the tube caught Flattery\u0027s attention. The end of the radiation probe. It had reached the top of its energy curve, was beginning to fall back down toward the grav-center in the core of the ship. As the severed end of the tool neared the other robox, the tip of one of its sensor arms - just the tip - turned to track the passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat minimal activity, that watchfulness, filled Flattery with greater dread than if the robox had attacked the length of tool and torn it apart. There was a sense of waiting about the thing - of waiting and gathering information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raj.\" It was Bickel\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there any information in the computer - even a hint - that you might destroy it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he send me out here to trap me into answering that question? Flattery asked himself. But the fear in Bickel\u0027s voice ruled out that suggestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Flattery asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBickel cleared his throat, told about the programmed violence against the cow embryo and the destructive experiment. \"It was programmed to fill in the blanks in its information, Raj, and I put no limiting factor on that. The violence proves it\u0027ll stop at nothing to maintain its own integrity. If you pose any threat at all...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying it\u0027s conscious?\" Prue asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the way we\u0027re conscious,\" Bickel said. \"Like an animal - aware... and with at least one drive we can recognize: self-preservation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raj, answer the question,\" Prudence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knows the answer, Flattery thought. He could hear the awareness in her voice. Why doesn\u0027t she answer it for me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The computer may well have such information in it,\" Flattery said. And he thought: I\u0027m trapped! I must get back to quarters, destroy this thing... it\u0027s already out of hand. But if I move, it\u0027ll kill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the robox. There was the thing that gave the computer mobility - the thousands of special-function utility robox units throughout the ship - even the one under his hands - if it were shifted to automatic and keyed for program control... and if a consciousness directed it. These were what gave the Ox-cum-computer its gonads and ovaries - these and the computer-linked tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would... it react with violence if Raj tried to move?\" Prudence asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about it, Bick?\" Timberlake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very likely,\" Bickel said. \"You saw the violence it used when he tried to touch that sensor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you do if someone poked a finger in your eye?\" Timberlake asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s approaching me,\" Flattery said, and he felt a flicker of pride at how calm his voice sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay put,\" Bickel said. \"Tim! Take a cutting torch and -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on my way,\" Timberlake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raj... I think your only hope\u0027s to play dead... remain absolutely still,\" Bickel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sensor tip was in front of Flattery\u0027s eyes now and he found himself staring for a second into a baleful red and yellow glow. The tip retracted, and the robox backed off half a meter, clearing the repair unit by a hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go of your own robox,\" Bickel whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery saw his own knuckles white with the force of their grip on the robox control bar. He relaxed the hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gravity will set you drifting presently back down the tube,\" Bickel whispered. \"Just let it happen. Stay limp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motion was barely perceptible at first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The locks are part of the central system.\" That was Prue\u0027s voice. \"What if they don\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t finish the question, but it was obvious she, too, remembered how the rogue sphincter lock had crushed the life out of Anderson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Flattery could see he definitely was drifting back. The two robox units receded up the tube. And that sensor tip remained pointed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first lock passed his eyes. It had opened!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the lock\u0027s transparent leaves remained open after his passage and that ambulant robox was following, hesitantly at first, then faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AAT klaxon blared in Flattery\u0027s helmet, transmitted through the open net from Com-central.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jesus!\" That was Prudence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was the transceiver open?\" That was Bickel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The message is already into the system,\" Prudence said. \"We left it on automatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tim, where are you?\" Bickel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the hub lock,\" Timberlake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the message, Prue,\" Bickel said. \"Visio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelays clicked as she shunted the AAT to Com-central. Presently, she said: \"Short and sweet. Hempstead tells us to cease ignoring communications. We are ordered to turn back and make no mistake about it. Odd choice of words: \u0027This is an arbitrary turn-back command.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows what he can do with his arbitrary turn-back command,\" Bickel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sound of Prudence\u0027s voice, Flattery had gone cold. The chill of ice water gripped his chest. \"Arbitrary turn-back command.\" It was the coded order he had both dreaded and almost longed for - the \"kill-ship\" command. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/destination-void-destination-void-1/page-27.html","bookId":2449,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:22:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:22:21 PM"}
