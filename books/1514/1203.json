His body suddenly transformed into many afterimages as he quickly retreated. However, right after he moved, his surrounding space became distorted. After which, four black holes appeared out of nowhere and surrounded him, before four streams of Devouring Power erupted. Then, a frightening tearing force directly tore the surrounding space into pieces!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe black holes rotated violently. Suddenly, a moan was emitted from within. Soon after, waves of frightening Yuan Power erupted, before the prison formed by those black holes was brutally smashed apart. Then, Lu Feng staggered out. Although this black hole distortion technique that Lin Dong had learnt from the Devouring Master was very powerful, Lu Feng was no ordinary individual. As such, even though he suffered injuries, he was not killed by Lin Dong in a single strike.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You indeed possess the Devouring Ancestral Symbol!” At this moment, Lu Feng was finally certain of this fact.

Unlike before, there was no longer a need for him to conceal the fact that he owned an Ancestral Symbol. After all, his formidable strength ensured that he had the ability to protect himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“So what if you possess the Devouring Ancestral Symbol?

Meanwhile, the black glow in his eyes grew increasingly intense, while brutal evilness covered his face. Suddenly, he took a step forward before demonic aura rose and transformed into a ten thousand feet large devil figure behind him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Heaven Yuan Devil Fist!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA low roar was released from Lu Feng’s throat. Currently, it was obvious that he had unleashed his strength to the limit. After all, he detected the rich scent of danger from Lin Dong’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLu Feng’s body withdrew before he directly leapt into that huge devil figure. Subsequently, two scarlet red lights erupted. Then, that devil figure swung its huge hand before a fist, which contained a terrifying force that could destroy the world, swung furiously towards Lin Dong.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBang bang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBefore the attack landed on the ground, the frightening fist wind had already shook the space until it became distorted. In fact, the floating island that they were on, trembled until it began to collapse. As it was falling rapidly, everyone was greatly startled when they saw this scene.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong lifted his head. His pupils were reflecting that huge devil fist, which was approaching rapidly. Then, he slowly extended his right arm. Immediately, black light and lightning glow flashed. Soon after, his right arm actually began to liquefy. Meanwhile, black light and lightning arcs continuously danced on his arm, and one could vaguely spot two ancient symbols floating within his liquidized arm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the past, Lin Dong was only able to use the two Ancestral Symbols to liquify his fingers. However, after his strength increased, he was now able to turn his entire arm into that state. Of course, this meant that his attack was far more lethal than before.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I will begin to settle the score with Yuan Gate starting from you, old dog…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong’s feet suddenly stomped on the ground. Then, his body directly transformed into a ray of light. It turns out that he was actually charging head on towards that devil fist and he showed no signs of dodging.
