We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle Shaker perked up when she heard Matt\u0027s voice through the cell phone. The sound wasn\u0027t great, but she could make out enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please open up, Talley. I just want to talk to you, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reply was muffled. Too muffled to make out. Cingle tried to clear her head and concentrate. Her car sat double-parked by the front entrance. It was late. Nobody would bother her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe debated heading inside now. That would be the smart play. Matt was on the fifth floor. If something went wrong, it would take her a while to get up there. But Matt had been fairly adamant. He felt his best chance was to brace this Talley guy alone. If she was spotted before they talked, that would only complicate matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now that there was a muffled voice, Cingle could be reasonably sure that Talley was not in the lobby. In fact, from her vantage point, nobody was in the lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to head in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurveillance was far from Cingle\u0027s forte. She was simply too noticeable. She had never been a Rockette or dancer of any sort- yes, she\u0027d heard all the rumors- but she had given up trying to dress herself down years ago. Cingle had started developing at a young age. By twelve, she could pass for eighteen. Boys loved her, girls hated her. With all the years of enlightenment, that was pretty much the norm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither one of those attitudes bothered her much. What did bother her, especially at that young age, were the looks of older men, even relatives, even men she trusted and loved. No, nothing ever happened. But you learn at a young age how longing and lust can twist a mind. It is rarely pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle was just about in the lobby when, through the phone, she heard a strange sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell was that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lobby\u0027s glass doors slid open. A little bell dinged. Cingle kept the phone pressed against her ear. Nothing. There was no sound, no talking at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat couldn\u0027t be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden crashing sound came through the earpiece, startling her. Cingle picked up her pace, ran for the elevator bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy behind the desk waddled out, saw Cingle, pulled in his gut and smiled. \"May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed the call button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was still no talking coming from the phone. She felt a chill on her neck. She had to risk it. Cingle put the phone to her mouth. \"Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, she\u0027d put on the mute button. She\u0027d forgotten about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet another strange sound- a grunt maybe. Only more muffled. More choked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the hell was that damn elevator?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where the hell was that mute button?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle found the mute button first. It was on the bottom right-hand corner. Her thumb fumbled before touching down. The little mute icon disappeared. She put the phone to her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt?\" she shouted. \"Matt, are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother strangled cry. Then a voice- not Matt\u0027s- said, \"Who the hell...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind her, the night man asked, \"Is something wrong, miss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle kept pressing the elevator call button. Come on, come on...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto the phone: \"Matt, are you there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick. Silence now. Absolute silence. Cingle\u0027s heart beat as though trying to break free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat should she do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss, I really have to ask you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator door opened. She jumped inside. The night man stuck his arm out and stopped the door from closing. Cingle\u0027s gun was in her shoulder holster. For the first time ever in the line of duty, she pulled it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go of that door,\" she said to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obeyed, taking his hand away like it didn\u0027t belong to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call the police,\" she said. \"Tell them you have an emergency on the fifth floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors slid closed. She pressed the five button. Matt might not be happy about that, about getting the police involved, but it was her call now. The elevator groaned and started ascending. It seemed to move one foot up, two feet down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle held the gun in her right hand. With her finger off the trigger, she repeatedly pushed the five button on the elevator console. Like that would help. Like the elevator would see that she was in a hurry and pick up speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell phone was in her left hand. She quickly redialed Matt\u0027s cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo ring, just his recorded voice: \"I\u0027m not available right now-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle cursed, pressed the end button. She positioned her body directly in front of the crack in the door so as to get out of the elevator in mid-opening and as soon as humanly possible. The elevator buzzed with each floor, a signal for the blind, and finally came to a halt with a ding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hunched over like a sprinter starting in the standing position. When the doors started sliding open, Cingle pried them apart with both hands and pulled herself through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in the corridor now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle could only hear the footsteps, not see anyone. It sounded like someone running the other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Halt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever it was did not let up. Neither did she. Cingle ran down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long? How long since she\u0027d lost contact with Matt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom down the corridor Cingle heard a heavy door bang open. Emergency door, she bet. To the stairwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle was counting off the room numbers as she ran. When she reached Room 511, she could see far enough up ahead to see that the door to Room 515- two doors ahead of her- was wide open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe debated what to do- follow whoever was running down the stairs or check in Room 515- but only briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle hurried, turned the corner, gun drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt was flat on his back, his eyes closed. He was not moving. But that wasn\u0027t the really shocking thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe really shocking thing was who was with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle almost dropped her gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment she just stood there and stared in disbelief. Then she stepped fully into the room. Matt had still not moved. Blood was pooling behind his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle\u0027s gaze stayed locked on the other person in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe person kneeling next to Matt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face was tearstained. The eyes were red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCingle recognized the woman right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Olivia.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-30.html","bookId":1557,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM"}
