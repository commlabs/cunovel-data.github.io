She was near hysteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t go through with this. I can\u0027t! Tell them to leave me alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ashley, it\u0027s going to be all right. We\u0027re going to face them, and we\u0027re going to win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know - You don\u0027t know what this is like. I feel as though I\u0027m in some kind of hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to get you out of it. This is the first step.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was trembling. \"I\u0027m afraid they\u0027re - they\u0027re going to do something terrible to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t let them,\" David said firmly. \"I want you to believe in me. Just remember, you\u0027re not responsible for what happened. You haven\u0027t done anything wrong. They\u0027re waiting for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath. \"All right. I\u0027m going to be fine. I\u0027m going to be fine. I\u0027m going to be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated in the spectators\u0027 section was Dr. Steven Patter-son. He had responded to the barrage of reporters\u0027 questions outside the courtroom with one answer: \"My daughter is innocent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral rows away were Jesse and Emily Quiller, there for moral support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the prosecutor\u0027s table were Mickey Brennan and two associates, Susan Freeman and Eleanor Tucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra and Ashley were seated at the defendant\u0027s table, with David between them. The two women had met the previous week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David, you can look at Ashley and know she\u0027s innocent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sandra, you can look at the evidence she left on her victims and know she killed them. But killing them and being guilty are two different things. Now all I have to do is convince the jury.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Williams entered the courtroom and moved to the bench. The court clerk announced, \"All rise. Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Tessa Williams presiding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Williams said, \"You may be seated. This is the case of The People of the State of California Versus Ashley Patterson. Let\u0027s get started.\" Judge Williams looked at Brennan. \"Would the prosecutor like to make an opening statement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMickey Brennan rose. \"Yes, Your Honor.\" He turned to the jury and moved toward them. \"Good morning. As you know, ladies and gentlemen, the defendant is on trial, accused of committing three bloody murders. Murderers come in many disguises.\" He nodded toward Ashley. \"Her disguise is that of an innocent, vulnerable young woman. But the state will prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant willfully and knowingly murdered and mutilated three innocent men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She used an alias to commit one of these murders, hoping not to get caught. She knew exactly what she was doing. We\u0027re talking calculated, cold-blooded murder. As the trial goes on, I will show you all the strands, one by one, that tie this case to the defendant sitting there. Thank you.\" He returned to his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Williams looked at David. \"Does the defense have an opening statement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Your Honor.\" David stood and faced the jury. He took a deep breath. \"Ladies and gentlemen, in the course of this trial, I will prove to you that Ashley Patterson is not responsible for what happened. She had no motive for any of the murders, nor any knowledge of them. My client is a victim. She is a victim of MPD -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;multiple personality disorder, which in the course of this trial will be explained to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at Judge Williams and said firmly, \"MPD is an established medical fact. It means that there are other personalities, or alters, that take over their hosts and control their actions. MPD has a long history. Benjamin Rush, a physician and signer of the Declaration of Independence, discussed case histories of MPD in his lectures. Many incidents of MPD were reported through-out the nineteenth century and in this century of people taken over by alters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan was listening to David, a cynical smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will prove to you that it was an alter who took command and committed the murders that Ashley Patterson had absolutely no reason to commit None. She had no control over what happened, and therefore is not responsible for what happened. During the course of the trial, I will bring in eminent doctors who will explain in greater detail about MPD. Fortunately, it is curable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked into the faces of the jurors. \"Ashley Patterson had no control over what she did, and in the name of justice, we ask that Ashley Patterson not be convicted of crimes for which she is not responsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid took his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Williams looked at Brennan. \"Is the state ready to proceed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan rose. \"Yes, Your Honor.\" He flashed a smile at his associates and moved in front of the jury box. Brennan stood there a moment and deliberately let out a loud burp. The jurors were staring at him, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan looked at them a moment as though puzzled and then his face cleared. \"Oh, I see. You were waiting for me to say \u0027excuse me.\u0027 Well, I didn\u0027t say it because I didn\u0027t do that. My alter ego, Pete, did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was on his feet, furious. \"Objection. Your Honor, this is the most outrageous - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sustained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the damage had already been done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan gave David a patronizing smile and then turned back to the jury. \"Well, I guess there hasn\u0027t been a defense like this since the Salem witch trials three hundred years ago.\" He turned to look at Ashley. \"I didn\u0027t do it. No, sir. The devil made me do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was on his feet again. \"Objection. The - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Overruled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid slammed back into his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan stepped closer to the jury box. \"I promised you that I was going to prove that the defendant willfully and cold-bloodedly murdered and mutilated three men -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Dennis Tibble, Richard Melton and deputy Samuel Blake. Three men! In spite of what the defense says\" -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he turned and pointed to Ashley again - \"there\u0027s only one defendant sitting there, and she\u0027s the one who committed the murders. What did Mr. Singer call it? Multiple personality disorder? Well, I\u0027m going to bring some prominent doctors here who will tell you, under oath, that there is no such thing! But first, let\u0027s hear from some experts who are going to tie the defendant to the crimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan turned to Judge Williams. \"I would like to call my first witness. Special Agent Vincent Jordan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short bald man stood up and moved toward the witness box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk said, \"Please state your full name and spell it for the record.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Special Agent Vincent Jordan, J-o-r-d-a-n.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan waited until he was sworn in and took a seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D.C.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do you do with the FBI, Special Agent Jordan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in charge of the fingerprints section.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you had that job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifteen years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifteen years.

Fingerprints are unique. They\u0027re formed before birth and last throughout one\u0027s life. Barring accidental or intentional mutilation, no two patterns are alike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Special Agent Jordan, you were sent the fingerprints found at the scenes of the three victims who the defendant is accused of murdering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.

If we took a profile of DNA strands and assigned it a frequency based on collected databases, only one in five hundred billion unrelated Caucasians would have the same DNA profile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan looked impressed. \"One in five hundred billion. Mr. Clarke, how do you obtain DNA from a crime scene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of ways.

Good things happen to good people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he thought about Helen Woodman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian Hill was sitting in the witness box after being sworn in. Mickey Brennan gave him a friendly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you tell us what you do, Mr. Hill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. I\u0027m a guard at the De Young Museum in San Francisco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That must be an interesting job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is, if you like art. I\u0027m a frustrated painter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you worked there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do a lot of the same people visit the museum? That is, do people come again and again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. Some people do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I suppose that over a period of time, they would become familiar to you, or at least they would be familiar faces?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m told that artists are permitted to come in to copy some of the museum\u0027s paintings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. We have a lot of artists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ever meet any of them, Mr. Hill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we - You kind of become friendly after a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ever meet a man named Richard Melton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian Hill sighed. \"Yes. He was very talented.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So talented, in fact that you asked him to teach you to paint?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid got to his feet. \"Your Honor, this is fascinating, but I don\u0027t see what it has to do with the trial. If Mr. Brennan - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s relevant, Your Honor. I\u0027m establishing that Mr. Hill could identify the victim by sight and by name and tell us who the victim associated with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Objection overruled. You may go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did he teach you to paint?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he did, when he had time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Mr. Melton was at the museum, did you ever see him with any young ladies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, not in the beginning. But then he met somebody he was kind of interested in, and I used to see him with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was her name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alette Peters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan looked puzzled. \"Alette Peters? Are you sure you have the right name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. That\u0027s the way he introduced her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t happen to see her in this courtroom right now, do you, Mr. Hill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" He pointed to Ashley. \"That\u0027s her sitting there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan said, \"But that\u0027s not Alette Peters. That\u0027s the defendant, Ashley Patterson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was on his feet. \"Your Honor, we have already said that Alette Peters is a part of this trial. She is one of the alters who controls Ashley Patterson and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re getting ahead of yourself, Mr. Singer. Mr. Brennan, please continue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Mr. Hill, you\u0027re sure that the defendant, who\u0027s here under the name of Ashley Patterson, was known to Richard Melton as Alette Peters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s no doubt that this is the same woman?\" Brian Hill hesitated. \"Well... Yeah, it\u0027s the same woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you saw her with Richard Melton the day that Melton was murdered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Brennan turned to David. \"Your witness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid got up and slowly walked over to the witness box. \"Mr. Hill, I would think it\u0027s a big responsibility being a guard in a place where so many hundreds of millions of dollars\u0027 worth of art was being exhibited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. It is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And to be a good guard, you have to be on the alert all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to be aware of what\u0027s going on all the me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you say that you\u0027re a trained observer, Mr. Hill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ask that because I noticed when Mr. Brennan asked you if you had any doubts about whether Ashley Patterson was the woman who was with Richard Melton, you hesitated. Weren\u0027t you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a momentary pause. \"Well, she looks a lot like the same woman, but in a way she seems different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what way, Mr. Hill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alette Peters was more Italian, and she had an Italian accent... and she seemed younger than the defendant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s exactly right, Mr. Hill. The person you saw in San Francisco was an alter of Ashley Patterson. She was born in Rome, she was eight years younger - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrennan was on his feet, furious. \"Objection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid turned to Judge Williams. \"Your Honor, was - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will counsel approach the bench, please?\" David and Brennan walked over to Judge Williams. \"I don\u0027t want to have to tell you this again, Mr. Singer. The defense will have its chance when the prosecution rests. Until then, stop pleading your case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernice Jenkins was on the stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you tell us your occupation.

Those things happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure they do. And then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we became like brother and sister.
