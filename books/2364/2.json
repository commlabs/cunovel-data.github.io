My alarm didn\u0027t go off and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a busy day. Let\u0027s get started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did stretches for half an hour and then switched to energetic aerobics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s got the body of a twenty-one-year-old, Ken thought. I\u0027d sure love to get that into my bed. He enjoyed coming here every morning just to look at her, to be near her. People constantly asked him what Lara Cameron was like. He would answer, \"The lady\u0027s a ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara went through the strenuous routine easily, but her mind was not on it this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the session was finally over, Ken said, \"I\u0027m going to watch you on Good Morning America.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" For a moment Lara had forgotten about it. She had been thinking about the meeting with the Japanese bankers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you tomorrow, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be late again, Ken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara showered and changed and had breakfast alone on the terrace of the penthouse, a breakfast of grapefruit, cereal, and green tea. When she had finished, she went into her study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara buzzed her secretary. \"I\u0027ll do the overseas calls from the office,\" Lara said. \"I have to be at ABC at seven. Have Max bring the car around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe segment on Good Morning America went well. Joan Lunden did the interview and was gracious, as always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last time you were on this program,\" Joan Lunden said, \"you had just broken ground for the tallest skyscraper in the world. That was almost four years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara nodded. \"That\u0027s right. Cameron Towers will be finished next year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does it feel to be in your position - to have accomplished all the incredible things you\u0027ve done and to still be so young and beautiful? You\u0027re a role model for so many women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re very flattering,\" Lara laughed. \"I don\u0027t have time to think about myself as a role model. I\u0027m much too busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re one of the most successful real estate developers in a business that\u0027s usually considered a man\u0027s domain. How do you operate? How do you decide, for instance, where to put up a building?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t choose the site,\" Lara said. \"The site chooses me. I\u0027ll be driving along and I\u0027ll pass a vacant field - but that\u0027s not what I see. I see a beautiful office building or a lovely apartment building filled with people living comfortably in a nice atmosphere. I dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you make those dreams come true. We\u0027ll be right back after this commercial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Japanese bankers were due at seven forty-five. They had arrived from Tokyo the evening before, and Lara had arranged the meeting at that early-morning hour so they would still be jet-lagged after their twelve-hour and ten-minute flight. When they had protested, Lara had said, \"I\u0027m so sorry, gentlemen, but I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s the only time I have. I\u0027m leaving for South America immediately after our meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they had reluctantly agreed. There were four of them, diminutive and polite, with minds as sharp as the edges of samurai swords. In an earlier decade the financial community had wildly underestimated the Japanese. It no longer made that mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meeting was held at Cameron Center on Avenue of the Americas. The men were there to invest a hundred million dollars in a new hotel complex Lara was developing. They were ushered into the large conference room. Each of the men carried a gift. Lara thanked them and in turn gave each of them a gift. She had instructed her secretary to make certain the presents were wrapped in plain brown or gray paper. White, to the Japanese, represented death, and gaudy wrapping paper was unacceptable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara\u0027s assistant, Tricia, brought in tea for the Japanese and coffee for Lara. The Japanese would have preferred coffee, but they were too polite to say so. When they had finished their tea, Lara made sure their cups were replenished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller, Lara\u0027s associate, came into the room. He was in his fifties, pale and thin, with sandy hair, wearing a rumpled suit and managing to look as though he had just gotten out of bed. Lara made the introductions. Keller passed around copies of the investment proposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you can see, gentlemen,\" Lara said, \"we already have a first mortgage commitment. The complex will contain seven hundred and twenty guest units, approximately thirty thousand square feet of meeting space, and a one-thousand-car parking garage....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara\u0027s voice was charged with energy. The Japanese bankers were studying the investment proposal, fighting to stay awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meeting was over in less than two hours, and it was a complete success. Lara had learned long ago that it was easier to make a hundred-million-dollar deal than it was to try to borrow fifty thousand dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the Japanese delegation left, Lara had her meeting with Jerry Townsend. The tall, hyper ex-Hollywood publicity man was in charge of public relations for Cameron Enterprises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a great interview on Good Morning America this morning. I\u0027ve been getting a lot of calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Forbes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All set. People has you on the cover next week. Did you see The New Yorker article on you? Wasn\u0027t it great?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara walked over to her desk. \"Not bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Fortune interview is set for this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I changed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked surprised. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m having their reporter here for lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soften him up a little?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara pressed down the intercom button. \"Come in, Kathy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA disembodied voice said, \"Yes, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara Cameron looked up. \"That\u0027s all, Jerry. I want you and your staff to concentrate on Cameron Towers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re already doing...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do more. I want it written about in every newspaper and magazine there is. For God\u0027s sake, it\u0027s going to be the tallest building in the world. In the world! I want people talking about it. By the time we open, I want people to be begging to get into those apartments and shops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry Townsend got to his feet. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKathy, Lara\u0027s executive assistant, came into the office. She was an attractive, neatly dressed black woman in her early thirties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you find out what he likes to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man\u0027s a gourmet. He likes French food. I called Le Cirque and asked Sirio to cater a lunch here for two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. We\u0027ll eat in my private dining room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know how long the interview will take? You have a two-thirty with the Metropolitan bankers downtown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Push it to three o\u0027clock, and have them come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKathy made a note. \"Do you want me to read you your messages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Children\u0027s Foundation wants you to be their guest of honor on the twenty-eighth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Tell them I\u0027m flattered. Send them a check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your meeting has been arranged in Tulsa for Tuesday at...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cancel it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re invited to a luncheon next Friday for a Manhattan Women\u0027s Group.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. If they\u0027re asking for money, send them a check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Coalition for Literacy would like you to speak at a luncheon on the fourth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See if we can work it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s an invitation to be guest of honor at a fund raiser for muscular dystrophy, but there\u0027s a conflict in dates. You\u0027ll be in San Francisco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send them a check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Srbs are giving a dinner party next Saturday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try to make that,\" Lara said. Kristian and Deborah Srb were amusing, and good friends, and she enjoyed being with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kathy, how many of me do you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a good look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKathy looked at her. \"One of you, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. There\u0027s only one of me. How did you expect me to meet with the bankers from Metropolitan at two-thirty today, the City Planning Commission at four, then meet with the mayor at five, the architects at six-fifteen, the Housing Department at six-thirty, have a cocktail party at seven-thirty and my birthday dinner at eight? The next time you make up a schedule, try using your brain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. You wanted me to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted you to think. I don\u0027t need stupid people around me. Reschedule the appointments with the architects and the Housing Department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Kathy said stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s the baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question caught the secretary by surprise. \"David? He\u0027s...he\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must be getting big by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s almost two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you thought about a school for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. It\u0027s too early to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong. If you want to get him into a decent school in New York, you start before he\u0027s born.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara made a note on a desk pad. \"I know the principal at Dalton. I\u0027ll arrange to have David registered there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara did not bother to look up. \"That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" Kathy walked out of the office not knowing whether to love her boss or hate her. When Kathy had first come to work at Cameron Enterprises, she had been warned about Lara Cameron. \"The Iron Butterfly is a bitch on wheels,\" she had been told. \"Her secretaries don\u0027t figure their employment there by the calendar- - they use stopwatches. She\u0027ll eat you alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKathy remembered her first interview with her. She had seen pictures of Lara Cameron in half a dozen magazines, but none of them had done her justice. In person, the woman was breathtakingly beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara Cameron had been reading Kathy\u0027s resume. She looked up and said, \"Sit down, Kathy.\" Her voice was husky and vibrant. There was an energy about her that was almost overpowering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is quite a resume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much of it is real?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most of the ones that come across my desk are fiction. Are you good at what you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very good at what I do, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two of my secretaries just quit. Everything\u0027s snowballing around here. Can you handle pressure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a guessing contest. Can you handle pressure or can\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment Kathy was not sure she wanted the job. \"Yes, I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. You\u0027re on a one-week trial. You\u0027ll have to sign a form saying that at no time will you discuss me or your work here at Cameron Enterprises. That means no interviews, no books, nothing. Everything that happens here is confidential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was how it had begun five years earlier. During that time Kathy had learned to love, hate, admire, and despise her boss. In the beginning Kathy\u0027s husband had asked, \"What is the legend like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a difficult question. \"She\u0027s larger than life,\" Kathy had said. \"She\u0027s drop-dead beautiful. She works harder than anyone I\u0027ve ever known. God only knows when she sleeps. She\u0027s a perfectionist, so she makes everyone around her miserable. In her own way, she\u0027s a genius. She can be petty and vengeful and incredibly generous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband had smiled. \"In other words, she\u0027s a woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKathy had looked at him and said, unsmiling, \"I don\u0027t know what she is. Sometimes she scares me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, honey, you\u0027re exaggerating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I honestly believe that if someone stood in Lara Cameron\u0027s way...she would kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lara finished with the faxes and overseas calls, she buzzed Charlie Hunter, an ambitious young man in charge of accounting. \"Come in, Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later he entered her office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Miss Cameron?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read the interview you gave in The New York Times this morning,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brightened. \"I haven\u0027t seen it yet. How was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You talked about Cameron Enterprises and about some of the problems we\u0027re having.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"Well, you know, that reporter fellow probably misquoted some of my...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re fired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Why? I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you were hired, you signed a paper agreeing not to give any interviews. I\u0027ll expect you out of here this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...you can\u0027t do that. Who would take my place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already arranged that,\" Lara told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe luncheon was almost over. The Fortune reporter, Hugh Thompson, was an intense, intellectual-looking man with sharp brown eyes behind black horn-rimmed glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a great lunch,\" he said. \"All my favorite dishes. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you enjoyed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really didn\u0027t have to go to all that trouble for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No trouble at all.\" Lara smiled. \"My father always told me that the way to a man\u0027s heart was through his stomach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you wanted to get to my heart before we started the interview?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara smiled. \"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much trouble is your company really in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara\u0027s smile faded. \"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on. You can\u0027t keep a thing like that quiet. The word on the street is that some of your properties are on the verge of collapse because of the principal payments due on your junk bonds. You\u0027ve done a lot of leveraging, and with the market down, Cameron Enterprises has to be pretty overextended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara laughed. \"Is that what the street says? Believe me, Mr. Thompson, you\u0027d be wise not to listen to silly rumors. I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll send you a copy of my financials to set the record straight. Fair enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough. By the way, I didn\u0027t see your husband at the opening of the new hotel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara sighed. \"Philip wanted so much to be there, but unfortunately he had to be away on a concert tour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to one of his recitals once about three years ago. He\u0027s brilliant. You have been married a year now, haven\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The happiest year of my life. I\u0027m a very lucky woman. I travel a lot, and so does Philip, but when I\u0027m away from him, I can listen to his recordings wherever I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThompson smiled. \"And he can see your buildings wherever he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara laughed. \"You flatter me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s pretty true, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027ve put up buildings all over this fair country of ours. You own apartment buildings, office buildings, a hotel chain...How do you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"With mirrors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a puzzle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At this moment you\u0027re arguably the most successful builder in New York. Your name is plastered on half the real estate in this town. You\u0027re putting up the world\u0027s tallest skyscraper. Your competitors call you the Iron Butterfly. You\u0027ve made it big in a business traditionally dominated by men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that bother you, Mr. Thompson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. What bothers me, Miss Cameron, is that I can\u0027t figure out who you are. When I ask two people about you, I get three opinions. Everyone grants that you\u0027re a brilliant businesswoman. I mean...you didn\u0027t fall off a hay wagon and become a success. I know a lot about construction crews - they\u0027re a rough, tough bunch of men. How does a woman like you keep them in line?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"There are no women like me. Seriously, I simply hire the best people for the job, and I pay them well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo simplistic, Thompson thought. Much too simplistic. The real story is what she\u0027s not telling me. He decided to change the direction of the interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every magazine on the stands has written about how successful you are. I\u0027d like to do a more personal story. There\u0027s been very little printed about your background.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very proud of my background.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Let\u0027s talk about that. How did you get started in the real estate business?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara smiled, and he could see that her smile was genuine. She suddenly looked like a little girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Genes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your genes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father\u0027s.\" She pointed to a portrait on a wall behind her. It showed a handsome-looking man with a leonine head of silver hair. \"That\u0027s my father - James Hugh Cameron.\" Her voice was soft. \"He\u0027s responsible for my success. I\u0027m an only child. My mother died when I was very young, and my father brought me up. My family left Scotland a long time ago, Mr. Thompson, and emigrated to Nova Scotia - New Scotland, Glace Bay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glace Bay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a fishing village in the northeast part of Cape Breton, on the Atlantic shore. It was named by early French explorers. It means \u0027ice bay.\u0027 More coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My grandfather owned a great deal of land in Scotland, and my father acquired more. He was a very wealthy man. We still have our castle there near Loch Morlich. When I was eight years old, I had my own horse, my dresses were bought in London, we lived in an enormous house with a lot of servants. It was a fairy tale life for a little girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was alive with echoes of long-ago memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would go ice skating in the winter, and watch hockey games, and go swimming at Big Glace Bay Lake in the summer. And there were dances at the Forum and the Venetian Gardens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter was busily making notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father put up buildings in Edmonton, and Calgary, and Ontario. Real estate was like a game to him, and he loved it. When I was very young, he taught me the game, and I learned to love it, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was filled with passion. \"You must understand something, Mr. Thompson. What I do has nothing to do with the money or the bricks and steel that make a building. It\u0027s the people who matter. I\u0027m able to give them a comfortable place to work or to Jive, a place where they can raise families and have decent lives. That\u0027s what was important to my father, and it became important to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh Thompson looked up. \"Do you remember your first real estate venture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara leaned forward. \"Of course. On my eighteenth birthday my father asked me what I would like as a gift. A lot of newcomers were arriving in Glace Bay, and it was getting crowded. I felt the town needed more places for them to live. I told my father I wanted to build a small apartment house. He gave me the money as a present, but two years later I was able to pay him back. Then I borrowed money from a bank to put up a second building. By the time I was twenty-one, I owned three buildings, and they were all successful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father must have been very proud of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was that warm smile again. \"He was. He named me Lara. It\u0027s an old Scottish name that comes from the Latin. It means \u0027well known\u0027 or \u0027famous.\u0027 From the time I was a little girl, my father always told me I would be famous one day.\" Her smile faded. \"He died of a heart attack, much too young.\" She paused. \"I go to Scotland to visit his grave every year. I...I found it very difficult to stay on in the house without him. I decided to move to Chicago. I had an idea for small boutique hotels, and I persuaded a banker there to finance me. The hotels were a success.\" She shrugged. \"And the rest, as the cliche goes, is history. I suppose that a psychiatrist would say that I haven\u0027t created this empire just for myself. In a way, it\u0027s a tribute to my father. James Cameron was the most wonderful man I\u0027ve ever known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must have loved him a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. And he loved me a lot.\" A smile touched her lips. \"I\u0027ve heard that on the day I was born, my father bought every man in Glace Bay a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, really,\" Thompson said, \"everything started in Glace Bay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Lara said softly, \"everything started in Glace Bay. That\u0027s where it all began, almost forty years ago...\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-shine-down/page-2.html","bookId":2364,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM"}
