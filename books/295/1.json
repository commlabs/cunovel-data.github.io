{"id":38791,"no":1,"title":"Part One Chapter 1","content":"I first met Dean not long after my wife and I split up. I had just gotten over a serious illness that I won\u0027t bother to talk about, except that it had something to do with the miserably weary split-up and my feeling that everything was\u0026nbsp; dead. With the coming of Dean Moriarty began the part of my life you could call my life on the road. Before that I\u0027d often dreamed of going West\u0026nbsp; to\u0026nbsp; see the country, always vaguely planning and never taking off. Dean is the perfect guy for the road because he actually was born on the road, when his parents were passing through Salt Lake City in 1926, in a jalopy, on their way to Los Angeles. First reports of him came to me through Chad King, who\u0027d shown me a few letters from him written in a New Mexico reform\u0026nbsp; school. I was tre- mendously interested in the letters because they so naively and sweetly asked Chad to teach him all about Nietzsche and all the\u0026nbsp; wonderful intellectual things that Chad knew. At one point Carlo and I\u0026nbsp; talked about the letters and wondered if we would ever meet the strange Dean Moriarty. This is all far back, when Dean was not the way he is today, when he was a young jailkid shrouded in mystery. Then news came that Dean was out of reform school and was coming to New York for the first\u0026nbsp; time;\u0026nbsp; also there was talk that he had just married a girl called Marylou.\n\u003cbr\u003eOne day I was hanging around the campus and Chad and Tim Gray told me Dean was staying in a cold-water pad in East Harlem, the Spanish Harlem. Dean had arrived the night before, the first time in New\u0026nbsp; York, with his beautiful little sharp chick Marylou; they got off the Greyhound bus at 50th Street and cut around the corner looking for a place to eat and went right in Hector\u0027s, and since then Hector\u0027s cafete-ria has always been a big symbol of New York for Dean. They spent money on beautiful big glazed cakes and creampuffs.\n\u003cbr\u003eAll this time Dean was telling Marylou things like this: \"Now, darling, here we are in New York and although I haven\u0027t quite told you everything that I was thinking about when we crossed Missouri and especially\u0026nbsp; at\u0026nbsp; the point\u0026nbsp; when\u0026nbsp; we passed the Booneville\u0026nbsp; reformatory which reminded me of my jail problem, it is absolutely necessary now to postpone\u0026nbsp; all those leftover things concerning our personal loveth- ings and at once begin thinking of specific worklife plans ... \" and so on in the way that he had in those early days.\n\u003cbr\u003eI went to the cold-water flat with the boys, and Dean came to the door in his shorts. Marylou was jumping off the couch; Dean had dispatched the occupant of the apartment to the kitchen, probably to make coffee, while he proceeded with his love-problems, for to him sex was the one and only holy and important thing in life, although he had to sweat and curse to make a living and so on. You saw that in the way he\u0026nbsp; stood\u0026nbsp; bobbing\u0026nbsp; his\u0026nbsp; head,\u0026nbsp; always\u0026nbsp; looking\u0026nbsp; down,\u0026nbsp; nodding,\u0026nbsp; like\u0026nbsp; a young boxer to instructions, to\u0026nbsp; make you think he was listening to every word, throwing in a thousand\u0026nbsp; \"Yeses\" and \"That\u0027s rights.\" My first\u0026nbsp; impression\u0026nbsp; of\u0026nbsp; Dean\u0026nbsp; was\u0026nbsp; of\u0026nbsp; a\u0026nbsp; young\u0026nbsp; Gene\u0026nbsp; Autry--trim,\u0026nbsp; thin- hipped, blue-eyed, with a real Oklahoma accent--a sideburned hero of the snowy West. In fact he\u0027d just been working on a ranch, Ed Wall\u0027s in Colorado, before marrying Marylou and coming East. Marylou was a pretty blonde with immense ringlets of hair like a sea of golden tresses; she sat there on the edge of the couch with her hands hanging in her lap and her smoky blue country eyes fixed in a wide stare because she was in an evil gray New York pad that she\u0027d heard about back West, and waiting like a longbodied emaciated Modigliani surrealist woman in a serious room. But, outside of being a sweet little girl, she was aw- fully dumb and capable of\u0026nbsp; doing horrible things. That night we all drank beer and pulled wrists and talked till dawn, and in the morning, while we sat around dumbly smoking butts from ashtrays in the gray light of a gloomy day, Dean got up nervously, paced around, thinking, and decided the thing to do was to have Marylou make breakfast and sweep the floor. \"In other words we\u0027ve got to get on the ball, darling, what I\u0027m saying,\u0026nbsp; otherwise it\u0027ll be fluctuating and lack of true know- ledge or crystallization of our plans.\" Then I went away.\n\u003cbr\u003eDuring the following week he confided in Chad King that he absolutely had to learn how to write from him; Chad said I was a writ- er and he should come to me for advice. Meanwhile Dean had gotten a job in a parking lot, had a fight with Marylou in their Hoboken apart- ment--God knows why they went there--and she was so mad and so down\u0026nbsp; deep\u0026nbsp; vindictive\u0026nbsp; that\u0026nbsp; she\u0026nbsp; reported\u0026nbsp; to\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; police\u0026nbsp; some\u0026nbsp; false trumped-up hysterical crazy charge, and Dean had to lam from Hobo- ken. So he had no place to live. He came right out to Paterson, New Jersey, where I was living\u0026nbsp; with my aunt, and one night while I was studying there was a knock on the door, and there was Dean, bowing, shuffling obsequiously in the dark of the hall, and saying, \"Hello, you remember me--Dean Moriarty? I\u0027ve come to ask you to show me how to write.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"And where\u0027s Marylou?\" I asked, and Dean said she\u0027d apparent- ly\u0026nbsp; whored\u0026nbsp; a\u0026nbsp; few\u0026nbsp; dollars\u0026nbsp; together\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; gone\u0026nbsp; back\u0026nbsp; to\u0026nbsp; Denver--\"the whore!\" So we went out to have a few beers because we couldn\u0027t talk like we wanted to talk in front of my aunt, who sat in the living room reading her paper. She took one look at Dean and decided that he was a madman.\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the bar I told Dean, \"Hell, man, I know very well you didn\u0027t come\u0026nbsp; to me only to want to become a writer, and after all what do I really know about it except you\u0027ve got to stick to it with the energy of a benny addict.\" And he said, \"Yes, of course, I know exactly what you mean and in fact all those problems have occurred to me, but the thing that I want is the realization of those factors that should one depend on Schopenhauer\u0027s dichotomy for any inwardly realized ... \" and so on in that way, things I understood not a bit and he himself didn\u0027t. In those days he really didn\u0027t know what he was talking about; that is to say, he was a young jailkid all hung-up on the wonderful possibilities of be- coming a real intellectual, and he liked to talk in the tone and using the words, but in a\u0026nbsp; jumbled way, that he had heard from \"real intellec- tuals\"--although,\u0026nbsp; mind\u0026nbsp; you,\u0026nbsp; he\u0026nbsp; wasn\u0027t so\u0026nbsp; naive as\u0026nbsp; that\u0026nbsp; in\u0026nbsp; all other things, and it took him just a few months with Carlo Marx to become completely iin therei with all the terms and jargon. Nonetheless we understood each other on other levels of madness, and I agreed that he could stay at my house till he found a job and furthermore we agreed to go out West sometime. That was the winter of 1947.\n\u003cbr\u003eOne night when Dean ate supper at my house--he already had the\u0026nbsp; parking-lot\u0026nbsp; job in New York--he\u0026nbsp; leaned over my\u0026nbsp; shoulder as I typed\u0026nbsp; rapidly away and said, \"Come on man, those girls won\u0027t wait, make it fast.\"I said, \"Hold on just a minute, I\u0027ll be right with you soon as I finish\u0026nbsp; this chapter,\" and it was one of the best chapters in the book. Then I dressed and off we flew to New York to meet some girls. As we rode in the bus in the weird phosphorescent void of the Lincoln Tunnel we leaned on\u0026nbsp; each other with fingers waving and yelled and talked excitedly, and I was beginning to get the bug like Dean. He was simply a youth tremendously excited with life, and though he was a con-man, he was only conning because he wanted so much to live and to get in- volved with people who would otherwise pay no attention to him. He was conning me and I knew it (for room and board and \"how-to-write,\" etc.), and he knew I knew (this has been the basis of our relationship), but I didn\u0027t care and we got along fine--no pestering, no catering; we tiptoed around each other like heartbreaking new\u0026nbsp; friends. I began to learn from him as much as he probably learned from me. As far as my work was concerned he said, \"Go ahead, everything you do is great.\" He watched over my shoulder as I wrote stories, yelling, \"Yes! That\u0027s right! Wow! Man!\" and \"Phew!\" and wiped his face with his handker- chief.\u0026nbsp; \"Man, wow, there\u0027s so many things to do, so many things to write! How to even ibegini to get it all down and without modified restraints and all hung-up on like literary inhibitions and grammatical fears ... \"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"That\u0027s right, man, now you\u0027re talking.\" And a kind of holy lightning I saw flashing from his excitement and his visions, which he described so torrentially that people in buses looked around to see the \"overexcited nut.\" In the West he\u0027d spent a third of his time in the poolhall, a third in jail, and a third in the public library. They\u0027d seen him\u0026nbsp; rushing\u0026nbsp; eagerly\u0026nbsp; down\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; winter streets, bareheaded,\u0026nbsp; carrying books to the poolhall, or climbing trees to get into the attics of buddies where he spent days reading or hiding from the law.\n\u003cbr\u003eWe went to New York--I forget what the situation was, two colored girls--there were no girls there; they were supposed to meet him in a diner and didn\u0027t show up. We went to his parking lot where he had a few things to do--change his clothes in the shack in back and spruce up a bit in front of a cracked mirror and so on, and then we took off. And that was the night Dean met Carlo Marx. A tremendous thing happened when Dean met Carlo Marx. Two keen minds that they are, they took to each other at the drop of a hat. Two piercing eyes glanced into two piercing eyes--the holy con-man with the shining mind, and the sorrowful poetic con-man with the dark mind that is Carlo Marx. From that moment on I saw very little of Dean, and I was a little sorry too. Their energies met head-on, I was a lout compared, I couldn\u0027t keep up with them.\n\u003cbr\u003eThe whole mad swirl of everything that was to come began then; it would mix up all my friends and all I had left of my family in a big\u0026nbsp; dust-cloud over the American Night. Carlo told him of Old Bull Lee, Elmer Hassel, Jane: Lee in Texas growing weed, Hassel on Riker\u0027s Island, Jane wandering on Times Square in a benzedrine hallucination, with her baby girl in her arms and ending up in Bellevue. And Dean told Carlo of unknown people in the West like Tommy Snark, the club- footed poolhall rotation shark and cardplayer and queer saint. He told him of Roy Johnson, Big Ed Dunkel, his boyhood buddies, his street buddies, his innumerable girls and sex-parties and pornographic pic- tures,\u0026nbsp; his heroes, heroines, adventures. They rushed down the street together,\u0026nbsp; digging everything in the early way they had, which later became\u0026nbsp; so\u0026nbsp; much\u0026nbsp; sadder\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; perceptive\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; blank.\u0026nbsp; But\u0026nbsp; then\u0026nbsp; they danced down the streets like dingledodies, and I shambled after as I\u0027ve been doing all my life after people who interest me, because the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a\u0026nbsp; commonplace\u0026nbsp; thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman\u0026nbsp; candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes \"Awww!\" What did they call such young people in Goethe\u0027s Ger- many? Wanting dearly to learn how to write like Carlo, the first thing you know, Dean was attacking him with a great amorous soul such as only a con-man can have. \"Now, Carlo, let imei speak--here\u0027s whatiI\u0027mi saying ... \" I didn\u0027t see them for about two weeks, during which time\u0026nbsp; they cemented their relationship to fiendish allday-allnight-talk roportions.\n\u003cbr\u003eThen came spring, the great time of traveling, and everybody in the scattered gang was getting ready to take one trip or another. I was busily at work on my novel and when I came to the halfway mark, af- ter a trip\u0026nbsp; down South with my aunt to visit my brother Rocco, I got ready to travel West for the very first time.\n\u003cbr\u003eDean had already left. Carlo and I saw him off at the 34th Street Greyhound station. Upstairs they had a place where you could make pictures for a quarter. Carlo took off his glasses and looked sinister. Dean\u0026nbsp; made a profile shot and looked coyly around. I took a straight picture that made me look like a thirty-year-old Italian who\u0027d kill any- body who said\u0026nbsp; anything against his mother. This picture Carlo and Dean neatly cut down the middle with a razor and saved a half each in their wallets. Dean was wearing a real Western business suit for his big trip back to Denver; he\u0027d finished his first fling in New York. I say fling, but he only worked like a dog in parking lots. The most fantastic parking-lot\u0026nbsp; attendant in the world, he can back a car forty miles an hour into a tight squeeze and stop at the wall, jump out, race among fenders, leap into another car, circle it fifty miles an hour in a narrow space, back swiftly into\u0026nbsp; tight spot, ihumpi, snap the car with the emergency so that you see it bounce as he flies out; then clear to the ticket shack, sprinting like a track star, hand a ticket, leap into a newly arrived car before the owner\u0027s half out, leap literally under him as he steps out, start the car with the door flapping, and roar off to the next available spot, arc, pop in, brake, out, run; working\u0026nbsp; like that without pause eight hours a night, evening rush hours and\u0026nbsp; after-theater rush hours, in greasy wino pants with a frayed fur-lined\u0026nbsp; jacket\u0026nbsp; and beat shoes that flap. Now he\u0027d bought a new suit to go back in; blue with pencil stripes, vest and all--eleven dollars on Third Avenue,\u0026nbsp; with a watch and watch chain, and a portable typewriter with which he was going to start writing in a Denver rooming house as soon as he got a job\u0026nbsp; there. We had a farewell meal of franks and beans in a Seventh Avenue Riker\u0027s, and then Dean got on the bus that said Chicago and roared off into the night. There went our wrangler. I promised myself to go the same way\u0026nbsp; when spring really bloomed and opened up the land.\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd this was really the way that my whole road experience began, and the things that were to come are too fantastic not to tell.Yes, and it wasn\u0027t only because I was a writer and needed new experiences that I wanted to know Dean more, and because my life hanging around the campus had reached the completion of its cycle and was stultified, but because, somehow, in spite of our difference in character,\u0026nbsp; he reminded me of some long-lost brother; the sight of his suffering bony face with the long sideburns and his straining muscular sweating neck made\u0026nbsp; me remember my boyhood in those dye-dumps and swim-holes and riversides of Paterson and the Passaic. His dirty workclothes clung to him so gracefully, as though you couldn\u0027t buy a better fit from a custom tailor but only earn it from the Natural Tailor of Natural Joy, as Dean had, in his stresses. And in his excited way of speaking I heard again the voices of old companions and brothers un- der the bridge, among\u0026nbsp; the motorcycles, along the wash-lined neigh- borhood and drowsy doorsteps of afternoon where boys played guitars while their older brothers worked in\u0026nbsp; the mills. All my other current friends were \"intellectuals\"--Chad the Nietzschean anthropologist, Car- lo Marx and his nutty surrealist low-voiced\u0026nbsp; serious staring talk, Old Bull Lee and his critical anti-every-thing drawl--or else they were slink- ing criminals like Elmer Hassel, with that hip sneer; Jane Lee the same, sprawled on the Oriental cover of her couch, sniffing at the\u0026nbsp; iNew Yorkeri. But Dean\u0027s intelligence was every bit as formal and shining and complete, without the tedious intellectualness. And his \"criminali- ty\"\u0026nbsp; was\u0026nbsp; not something that sulked and sneered; it was a wild yea- saying\u0026nbsp; overburst of American joy; it was Western, the west wind, an ode from the\u0026nbsp; Plains, something new, long prophesied, long a-coming (he only stole cars for joy rides). Besides, all my New York friends were in the negative, nightmare position of putting down society and giving their tired bookish or political or\u0026nbsp; psychoanalytical reasons, but Dean just raced in society, eager for bread and love; he didn\u0027t care one way or the other, \"so long\u0027s I can get that lil ole gal\u0026nbsp; with that lil sumpin down there tween her legs, boy,\" and \"so long\u0027s we\u0026nbsp; can ieati, son, y\u0027ear me? I\u0027m ihungryi, I\u0027m istarvingi, let\u0027s ieat right\u0026nbsp; nowi!\"-- and off we\u0027d rush to eat, whereof, as saith Ecclesiastes, \"It is your portion under the sun.\"\n\u003cbr\u003eA\u0026nbsp; western\u0026nbsp; kinsman\u0026nbsp; of\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; sun,\u0026nbsp; Dean.\u0026nbsp; Although\u0026nbsp; my\u0026nbsp; aunt warned me that he would get me in trouble, I could hear a new call and see a new horizon, and believe it at my young age; and a little bit of trouble or even Dean\u0027s eventual rejection of me as a buddy, putting me down, as he would later, on starving sidewalks and sickbeds--what did it matter? I was a young writer and I wanted to take off.\n\u003cbr\u003eSomewhere along the line I knew there\u0027d be girls, visions, eve- rything; somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/17/156.html","bookId":295,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:50:45 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:50:45 AM"}
