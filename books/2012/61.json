Take me out of here, husband.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis, queen of the Shake, cleared her throat. ‘Leaving solves nothing—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wrong. It solves everything .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman facing her sighed. ‘This is the throne of the Tiste Andii, and Kharkanas is the capital of the Hold of Darkness. You are home, Highness—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stop calling me that!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But I must, for you are of royal blood—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We were all of royal blood in this infernal city!’ Sandalath Drukorlat pointed a finger at Yan Tovis. ‘As were the Shake!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But our realm was and is the Shore, Highness, whereas Kharkanas is yours. But if it must be that there be only one queen, then I freely abdicate—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You will not. They are your people! You led them here, Yan Tovis. You are their queen.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Upon this throne, Highness, only one of royal Tiste Andii blood can make a true claim. And, as we both well know, there is only one Tiste Andii in this entire realm, and that is you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fine, and over whom do I rule? Heaps of dust? Mouldy bones? Blood stains on the floor? And where is my High Priestess, in whose eyes Mother Dark shines? Where is my Blind Gallan, my brilliant, tortured court fool? Where are my rivals, my hostages, my servants and soldiers? Handmaidens and— Oh, never mind. This is pointless. I don’t want that throne.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nonetheless,’ said Yan Tovis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Very well, I accept it, and my first act is to abdicate and yield the throne and all of Wise Kharkanas to you, Queen Yan Tovis. Captain Brevity, find us a royal seal – there must be one lying around here somewhere – and parchment and ink and wax.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe queen of the Shake was smiling, but it was a sad smile. ‘“Wise Kharkanas.” I had forgotten that honorific. Queen Sandalath Drukorlat, I respectfully decline your offer. My duties are upon the Shore.’ She nodded to Brevity. ‘Until such time that other Tiste Andii return to Kharkanas, I humbly submit Captain Brevity here to act as your Chancellor, Palace Guard Commander, and whatever other duties of organization as are required to return this palace to its former glory.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandalath snorted. ‘Oh, clever. And I suppose a few hundred of your Shake are waiting outside with mops and buckets.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Letherii, actually. Islanders and other refugees. They have known great privation, Highness, and will view the privilege of palace employment with humility and gratitude.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And if I turn them all away? Oh yes, I see the traps you’ve set around me, Yan Tovis. You intend to guilt me on to that accursed throne. But what if I am a harder woman than you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The burden of rule hardens us both, Highness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandalath cast Withal a beseeching look. ‘Talk her out of this, husband.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I would if I thought I had any chance of swaying her, beloved.’ He strode to the base of the dais, eyeing the throne. ‘Needs a cushion or two, I should think, before you could hope to sit there for any length of time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And you as my consort? Gods, don’t you think I could do better?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Undoubtedly,’ he replied. ‘For the moment, however, you are stuck with me, and,’ he added with a wave at the throne, ‘with this. So sit down and make it official, Sand, so Yan Tovis can kneel or curtsey or whatever it is she has to do, and Brevity can get on with scrubbing the floors and beating the tapestries.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tiste Andii woman cast about, as if seeking another amphora, but the nearest one stood perched on a stone cup near the side door – now an orphan, Withal saw, noting the unoccupied stone base on the entrance’s other side. He waited to see if she’d make the fierce march to repeat her gesture of frustration and anger, but all at once his wife seemed to subside. Thank Mael. That would have made her look ridiculous. Decorum, beloved, as befits the Queen of Darkness. Aye, some things you can’t run from .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There will be two queens in this realm,’ Sandalath said, coming round to slump down in the throne. ‘Don’t even think of curtseying, Tovis.’ She eyed the Shake woman with something close to a glower. ‘Other Tiste Andii, you said.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Surely they have sensed Mother Dark’s return,’ Yan Tovis replied. ‘Surely, they too understand that the diaspora is at last at an end.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just how many Tiste Andii do you imagine are left?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-61.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
