He hauled back on the controls as the \u0027thopter glided in beside the crawler. The wings tipped up, braked the \u0027thopter to a skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crawler was silent now, no sand spouting from its vents. Only a faint mechanical rumble issued from it, becoming more audible as the Duke opened his door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, their nostrils were assailed by the odor of cinnamon - heavy and pungent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a loud flapping, the spotter aircraft glided down to the sand on the other side of the crawler. The Duke\u0027s own escort swooped in to land in line with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul, looking out at the factory, saw how all the \u0027thopters were dwarfed by it - gnats beside a warrior beetle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gurney, you and Paul toss out that rear seat,\" the Duke said. He manually cranked the wings out to three-quarters, set their angle, checked the jet pod controls. \"Why the devil aren\u0027t they coming out of that machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re hoping the carryall will show up,\" Kynes said. \"They still have a few minutes.\" He glanced off to the east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll turned to look the same direction, seeing no sign of the worm, but there was a heavy, charged feeling of anxiety in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke took the microphone, punched for his command frequency, said: \"Two of you toss out your shield generators. By the numbers. You can carry one more man that way. We\u0027re not leaving any men for that monster.\" He keyed back to the working frequency, barked: \"All right, you in Delta Ajax niner! Out! Now! This is a command from your Duke! On the double or I\u0027ll cut that crawler apart with a lasgun!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hatch snapped open near the front of the factory, another at the rear, another at the top. Men came tumbling out, sliding and scrambling down to the sand. A tall man in a patched working robe was the last to emerge. He jumped down to a track and then to the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke hung the microphone on the panel, swung out onto the wing step, shouted: \"Two men each into your spotters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in the patched robe began lolling off pairs of his crew, pushing them toward the craft waiting on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four over here!\" the Duke shouted. \"Four into that ship back there!\" He jabbed a finger at an escort \u0027thopter directly behind him. The guards were just wrestling the shield generator out of it. \"And four into that ship over there!\" He pointed to the other escort that had shed its shield generator. \"Three each into the others! Run, you sand dogs!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall man finished counting off his crew, came slogging across the sand followed by three of his companions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear the worm, but I can\u0027t see it,\" Kynes said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others heard it then - an abrasive slithering, distant and growing louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn sloppy way to operate,\" the Duke muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAircraft began flapping off the sand around them. It reminded the Duke of a time in his home planet\u0027s jungles, a sudden emergence into a clearing, and carrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild ox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spice workers slogged up to the side of the \u0027thopter, started climbing in behind the Duke. Halleck helped, dragging them into the rear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In you go, boys!\" he snapped. \"On the double!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul, crowded into a corner by sweating men, smelled the perspiration of fear, saw that two of the men had poor neck adjustments on their stillsuits. He filed the information in his memory for future action. His father would have to order tighter stillsuit discipline. Men tended to become sloppy if you didn\u0027t watch such things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last man came gasping into the rear, said. \"The worm! It\u0027s almost on us! Blast off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke slid into his seat, frowning, said: \"We still have almost three minutes on the original contact estimate. Is that right, Kynes?\" He shut his door, checked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost exactly, my Lord,\" Kynes said, and he thought: A cool one, this duke .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All secure here, Sire,\" Halleck said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke nodded, watched the last of his escort take off. He adjusted the igniter, glanced once more at wings and instruments, punched the jet sequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe take-off pressed the Duke and Kynes deep into their seats, compressed the people in the rear. Kynes watched the way the Duke handled the controls - gently, surely. The \u0027thopter was fully airborne now, and the Duke studied his instruments, glanced left and right at his wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s very heavy, Sire,\" Halleck said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well within the tolerances of this ship,\" the Duke said. \"You didn\u0027t really think I\u0027d risk this cargo, did you, Gurney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck grinned, said: \"Not a bit of it, Sire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke banked his craft in a long easy curve - climbing over the crawler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul, crushed into a corner beside a window, stared down at the silent machine on the sand. The wormsign had broken off about four hundred meters from the crawler. And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the factory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The worm is now beneath the crawler,\" Kynes said. \"You are about to witness a thing few have seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now. The big machine began to tip down to the right. A gigantic sand whirlpool began forming there to the right of the crawler. It moved faster and faster. Sand and dust filled the air now for hundreds of meters around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they saw it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wide hole emerged from the sand. Sunlight flashed from glistening white spokes within it. The hole\u0027s diameter was at least twice the length of the crawler, Paul estimated. He watched as the machine slid into that opening in a billow of dust and sand. The hole pulled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gods, what a monster!\" muttered a man beside Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got all our floggin\u0027 spice!\" growled another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone is going to pay for this,\" the Duke said. \"I promise you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the very flatness of his father\u0027s voice, Paul sensed the deep anger. He found that he shared it. This was criminal waste!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the silence that followed, they heard Kynes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bless the Maker and His water,\" Kynes murmured. \"Bless the coming and going of Him. May His passage cleanse the world. May He keep the world for His people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that you\u0027re saying?\" the Duke asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Kynes remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul glanced at the men crowded around him. They were staring fearfully at the back of Kynes\u0027 head. One of them whispered: \"Liet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKynes turned, scowling. The man sank back, abashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother of the rescued men began coughing - dry and rasping. Presently, he gasped: \"Curse this hell hole!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall Dune man who had come last out of the crawler said; \"Be you still, Coss. You but worsen your cough.\" He stirred among the men until he could look through them at the back of the Duke\u0027s head. \"You be the Duke Leto, I warrant,\" he said. \"It\u0027s to you we give thanks for our lives. We were ready to end it there until you came along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship,\" Halleck muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul glanced at Halleck. He, too, had seen the tension wrinkles at the corner of his father\u0027s jaw. One walked softly when the Duke was in a rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto began easing his \u0027thopter out of its great banking circle, stopped at a new sign of movement on the sand. The worm had withdrawn into the depths and now, near where the crawler had been, two figures could be seen moving north away from the sand depression. They appeared to glide over the surface with hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s that down there?\" the Duke barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two Johnnies who came along for the ride, Soor,\" said the tall Dune man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wasn\u0027t something said about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the chance they took, Soor,\" the Dune man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lord,\" said Kynes, \"these men know it\u0027s of little use to do anything about men trapped on the desert in worm country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll send a ship from base for them!\" the Duke snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish, my Lord,\" Kynes said. \"But likely when the ship gets here there\u0027ll be no one to rescue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll send a ship, anyway,\" the Duke said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were right beside where the worm came up,\" Paul said. \"How\u0027d they escape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive,\" Kynes said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You waste fuel here, Sire,\" Halleck ventured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, Gurney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke brought his craft around toward the Shield Wall. His escort came down from circling stations, took up positions above and on both sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul thought about what the Dune man and Kynes had said. He sensed half-truths, outright lies. The men on the sand had glided across the surface so surely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the worm back out of its depths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFremen! Paul thought. Who else would be so sure on the sand? Who else might be left out of your worries as a matter of course - because they are in no danger? They know how to live here! They know how to outwit the worm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were Fremen doing on that crawler?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKynes whirled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall Dune man turned wide eyes on Paul - blue within blue within blue. \"Who be this lad?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalleck moved to place himself between the man and Paul, said: \"This is Paul Atreides, the ducal heir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?\" the man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They fit the description,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKynes snorted. \"You can\u0027t tell Fremen just by looking at them!\" He looked at the Dune man. \"You. Who were those men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friends of one of the others,\" the Dune man said. \"Just friends from a village who wanted to see the spice sands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKynes turned away. \"Fremen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was remembering the words of the legend: \"The Lisan al-Gaib shall see through all subterfuge .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They be dead now, most likely, young Soor,\" the Dune man said. \"We should not speak unkindly on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had brought Halleck instinctively into guarding position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul spoke dryly: \"A terrible place for them to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout turning, Kynes said; \"When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place. He causeth that creature\u0027s wants to direct him to that place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto turned a hard stare at Kynes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had observed here: This Duke was concerned more over the men that he was over the spice. He risked his own life and that of his son to save the men. He passed off the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture. The threat to men\u0027s lives had him in a rage. A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst his own will and all previous judgments, Kynes admitted to himself: I like this Duke .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- from \"Collected Sayings of Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dining hall of the Arrakeen great house, suspensor lamps had been lighted against the early dark. They cast their yellow glows upward onto the black bull\u0027s head with its bloody horns, and onto the darkly glistening oil painting of the Old Duke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath these talismans, white linen shone around the burnished reflections of the Atreides silver, which had been placed in precise arrangements along the great table - little archipelagos of service waiting beside crystal glasses, each setting squared off before a heavy wooden chair. The classic central chandelier remained unlighted, and its chain twisted upward into shadows where the mechanism of the poison-snooper had been concealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePausing in the doorway to inspect the arrangements, the Duke thought about the poison-snooper and what it signified in his society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a pattern , he thought. You can plumb us by our language - the precise and delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death. Will someone try chaumurky tonight - poison in the drink? Or will it be chaumas - poison in the food?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water. There was enough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to keep a poor Arrakeen family for more than a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate yellow and green tile. Each basin had its rack of towels. It was the custom, the housekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands ceremoniously into a basin, slop several cups of water onto the floor, dry their hands on a towel and fling the towel into the growing puddle at the door. After the dinner, beggars gathered outside to get the water squeezings from the towels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow typical of a Harkonnen fief , the Duke thought. Every degradation of the spirit that can be conceived . He took a deep breath, feeling rage tighten his stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The custom stops here!\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw a serving woman - one of the old and gnarled ones the housekeeper had recommended - hovering at the doorway from the kitchen across from him. The Duke signaled with upraised hand. She moved out of the shadows, scurried around the table toward him, and he noted the leathery face, the blue-within-blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lord wishes?\" She kept her head bowed, eyes shielded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured. \"Have these basins and towels removed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But . . . Noble Born . . .\" She looked up, mouth gaping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the custom!\" he barked. \"Take these basins to the front door. While we\u0027re eating and until we\u0027ve finished, each beggar who calls may have a full cup of water. Understood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer leathery face displayed a twisting of emotions: dismay, anger . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith sudden insight, Leto realized that she must have planned to sell the water squeezings from the foot-trampled towels, wringing a few coppers from the wretches who came to the door. Perhaps that also was a custom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face clouded, and he growled: \"I\u0027m posting a guard to see that my orders are carried out to the letter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whirled, strode back down the passage to the Great Hall. Memories rolled in his mind like the toothless mutterings of old women. He remembered open water and waves - days of grass instead of sand - dazed summers that had whipped past him like windstorm leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m getting old , he thought. I\u0027ve felt the cold hand of my mortality. And in what? An old woman\u0027s greed .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Great Hall, the Lady Jessica was the center of a mixed group standing in front of the fireplace. An open blaze crackled there, casting flickers of orange light onto jewels and laces and costly fabrics. He recognized in the group a stillsuit manufacturer down from Carthag, an electronics equipment importer, a water-shipper whose summer mansion was near his polar-cap factory, a representative of the Guild Bank (lean and remote, that one), a dealer in replacement parts for spice mining equipment, a thin and hard-faced woman whose escort service for off-planet visitors reputedly operated as cover for various smuggling, spying, and blackmail operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the women in the hall seemed cast from a specific type - decorative, precisely turned out, an odd mingling of untouchable sensuousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven without her position as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the group, he thought. She wore no jewelry and had chosen warm colors - a long dress almost the shade of the open blaze, and an earth-brown band around her bronzed hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized she had done this to taunt him subtly, a reproof against his recent pose of coldness. She was well aware that he liked her best in these shades - that he saw her as a rustling of warm colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, more an outflanker than a member of the group, stood Duncan Idaho in glittering dress uniform, flat face unreadable, the curling black hair neatly combed. He had been summoned back from the Fremen and had his orders from Hawat - \"Under pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady Jessica under constant surveillance .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke glanced around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was Paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the younger Arrakeen richece, and, aloof among them, three officers of the House Troop. The Duke took particular note of the young women. What a catch a ducal heir would make. But Paul was treating all equally with an air of reserved nobility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027ll wear the title well , the Duke thought, and realized with a sudden chill that this was another death thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul saw his father in the doorway, avoided his eyes. He looked around at the clusterings of guests, the jeweled hands clutching drinks (and the unobtrusive inspections with tiny remote-cast snoopers). Seeing all the chattering faces, Paul was suddenly repelled by them. They were cheap masks locked on festering thoughts - voices gabbling to drown out the loud silence in every breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m in a sour mood , he thought, and wondered what Gurney would say to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew his mood\u0027s source. He hadn\u0027t wanted to attend this function, but his father had been firm. \"You have a place - a position to uphold. You\u0027re old enough to do this. You\u0027re almost a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then cross to the group around the Lady Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Leto approached Jessica\u0027s group, the water-shipper was asking: \"Is it true the Duke will put in weather control?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind the man, the Duke said: \"We haven\u0027t gone that far in our thinking, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned. \"Ah-h, the Duke,\" he said. \"We missed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto glanced at Jessica. \"A thing needed doing.\" He returned his attention to the water-shipper, explained what he had ordered for the laving basins, adding: \"As far as I\u0027m concerned, the old custom ends now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this a ducal order, m\u0027Lord?\" the man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I leave that to your own . . . ah . . . conscience,\" the Duke said. He turned, noting Kynes come up to the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the women said: \"I think it\u0027s a very generous gesture - giving water to the - \" Someone shushed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke looked at Kynes, noting that the planetologist wore an old-style dark brown uniform with epaulets of the Imperial Civil Servant and a tiny gold teardrop of rank at his collar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water-shipper asked in an angry voice: \"Does the Duke imply criticism of our custom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This custom has been changed,\" Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked the frown on Jessica\u0027s face, thought: A frown does not become her, but it\u0027ll increase rumors of friction between us .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With the Duke\u0027s permission,\" the water-shipper said, \"I\u0027d like to inquire further about customs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto heard the sudden oily tone in the man\u0027s voice, noted the watchful silence in this group, the way heads were beginning to turn toward them around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it almost time for dinner?\" Jessica asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But our guest has some questions,\" Leto said. And he looked at the water-shipper, seeing a round-faced man with large eyes and thick lips, recalling Hawat\u0027s memorandum: \". . . and this water-shipper is a man to watch - Lingar Bewt, remember the name. The Harkonnens used him but never fully controlled him .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Water customs are so interesting,\" Bewt said, and there was a smile on his face. \"I\u0027m curious what you intend about the conservatory attached to this house. Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the people\u0027s faces . . . m\u0027Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto held anger in check, staring at the man. Thoughts raced through his mind. It had taken bravery to challenge him in his own ducal castle, especially since they now had Bewt\u0027s signature over a contract of allegiance. The action had taken, also, a knowledge of personal power. Water was, indeed, power here. If water facilities were mined, for instance, ready to be destroyed at a signal . . . The man looked capable of such a thing. Destruction of water facilities might well destroy Arrakis. That could well have been the club this Bewt held over the Harkonnens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lord, the Duke, and I have other plans for our conservatory,\" Jessica said. She smiled at Leto. \"We intend to keep it, certainly, but only to hold it in trust for the people of Arrakis. It is our dream that someday the climate of Arrakis may be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBless her! Leto thought. Let our water-shipper chew on that .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your interest in water and weather control is obvious,\" the Duke said. \"I\u0027d advise you to diversify your holdings. One day, water will not be a precious commodity on Arrakis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he thought: Hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this Bewt\u0027s organization. And we must start on stand-by water facilities at once. No man is going to hold a club over my head!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBewt nodded, the smile still on his face. \"A commendable dream, my Lord.\" He withdrew a pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto\u0027s attention was caught by the expression on Kynes\u0027 face. The man was staring at Jessica. He appeared transfigured - like a man in love . . . or caught in a religious trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKynes\u0027 thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy: \"And they shall share your most precious dream . \"He spoke directly to Jessica: \"Do you bring the shortening of the way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Dr. Kynes,\" the water-shipper said. \"You\u0027ve come in from tramping around with your mobs of Fremen. How gracious of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKynes passed an unreadable glance across Bewt, said: \"It is said in the desert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal carelessness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have many strange sayings in the desert,\" Bewt said, but his voice betrayed uneasiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica crossed to Leto, slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment in which to calm herself. Kynes had said: \" . . . the shortening of the way.\" In the old tongue, the phrase translated as \"Kwisatz Haderach.\" The planetologist\u0027s odd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the others, and now Kynes was bending over one of the consort women, listening to a low-voiced coquetry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKwisatz Haderach , Jessica thought. Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too? The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. He could be the Kwisatz Haderach. He could be .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water-shipper, and Bewt\u0027s voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations: \"Many people have sought to change Arrakis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his throat behind Leto, said: \"Dinner is served, my Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table,\" She said, and smiled; \"Shall we change that one, too, my Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke coldly: \"That seems a goodly custom. We shall let it stand for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe illusion that I suspect her of treachery must be maintained , he thought. He glanced at the guests filing past them. Who among you believes this lie?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done frequently the past week. He acts like a man struggling with himself, she thought. Is it because I moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party? Yet, he knows how important it is that we begin to mix our officers and men with the locals on a social plane. We are father and mother surrogate to them all. Nothing impresses that fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said when informed of the affair: \"Sire! I forbid it! \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grim smile touched the Duke\u0027s mouth. What a scene that had been. And when the Duke had remained adamant about attending the dinner, Hawat had shaken his head. \"I have bad feelings about this, my Lord,\" he\u0027d said. \"Things move too swiftly on Arrakis. That\u0027s not like the Harkonnens. Not like them at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than himself. He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded at something the young woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her father manufactures stillsuits,\" Jessica said. \"I\u0027m told that only a fool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the man\u0027s suits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?\" the Duke asked. \"I don\u0027t place him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A late addition to the list,\" she whispered. \"Gurney arranged the invitation. Smuggler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gurney arranged?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At my request. It was cleared with Hawat, although I thought Hawat was a little stiff about it. The smuggler\u0027s called Tuek, Esmar Tuek. He\u0027s a power among his kind. They all know him here. He\u0027s dined at many of the houses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is he here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone here will ask that question,\" she said. \"Tuek will sow doubt and suspicion just by his presence. He\u0027ll also serve notice that you\u0027re prepared to back up your orders against graft - by enforcement from the smugglers\u0027 end as well. This was the point Hawat appeared to like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I like it.\" He nodded to a passing couple, saw only a few of their guests remained to precede them. \"Why didn\u0027t you invite some Fremen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s Kynes,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, there\u0027s Kynes,\" he said. \"Have you arranged any other little surprises for me?\" He led her into step behind the procession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All else is most conventional,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she thought: My darling, can\u0027t you see that this smuggler controls fast ships, that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of escape from Arrakis if all else fails us here .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they emerged into the dining hall, she disengaged her arm, allowed Leto to seat her. He strode to his end of the table. A footman held his chair for him. The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping of chairs, but the Duke remained standing. He gave a hand signal, and the house troopers in footman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUneasy silence settled over the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at the corners of Leto\u0027s mouth, noted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks. What has angered him? she asked herself. Surely not my invitation to the smuggler .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some question my changing of the laving basin custom,\" Leto said. \"This is my way of telling you that many things will change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbarrassed silence settled over the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey think him drunk , Jessica thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor, lights shot beams of reflection off it. \"As a Chevalier of the Imperium, then,\" he said, \"I give you a toast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke. In the sudden stillness, a suspensor light drifted slightly in an errant breeze from the serving kitchen hallway. Shadows played across the Duke\u0027s hawk features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here I am and here I remain!\" he barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths - stopped as the Duke remained with arm upraised. \"My toast is one of those maxims so dear to our hearts: \u0027Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sipped his water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gurney!\" the Duke called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom an alcove at Leto\u0027s end of the room came Halleck\u0027s voice. \"Here, my Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give us a tune, Gurney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove. Servants began putting plates of food on the table at the Duke\u0027s gesture releasing them - roast desert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with melange (a rich cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table), a true pot-a-oie served with sparkling Caladan wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the Duke remained standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed before them and the standing Duke, Leto said: \"In olden times, it was the duty of the host to entertain his guests with his own talents.\" His knuckles turned white, so fiercely did he grip his water flagon. \"I cannot sing, but I give you the words of Gurney\u0027s song. Consider it another toast - a toast to all who\u0027ve died bringing us to this station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest her - there was the round-faced water-shipper and his woman, the pale and austere Guild Bank representative (he seemed a whistle-faced scarecrow with his eyes fixed on Leto), the rugged and scar-faced Tuek, his blue-within-blue eyes downcast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Review, friends - troops long past review,\" the Duke intoned. \"All to fate a weight of pains and dollars. Their spirits wear our silver collars. Review, friends - troops long past review: Each a dot of time without pretense or guile. With them passes the lure of fortune. Review, friends - troops long past review. When our time ends on its rictus smile, we\u0027ll pass the lure of fortune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep drink from his water flagon, slammed it back onto the table. Water slopped over the brim onto the linen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others drank in embarrassed silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its remaining half onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table must do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica was first to follow his example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their flagons. Jessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was studying the reactions around him. She found herself also fascinated by what her guests\u0027 actions revealed - especially among the women. This was clean, potable water, not something already cast away in a sopping towel. Reluctance to just discard it exposed itself in trembling hands, delayed reactions\u0027 nervous laughter . . . and violent obedience to the necessity. One woman dropped her flagon, looked the other way as her male companion recovered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKynes, though, caught her attention most sharply. The planetotogist hesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath his jacket. He smiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty flagon to her in a silent toast.
