When she\u0027d insisted she find her own way, given the debacle that evening at Marco\u0027s when she\u0027d wanted to escape but couldn\u0027t, he guessed he understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as seven had wound on to half past, the shine on his understanding had begun to tarnish. At quarter to eight, he was debating whether to call to check up, stride into the party alone or forget about this reunion deal altogether. He had work he could be doing. Going over that football proposal, for one. Instead he was standing here, waiting, waiting. He must look like an overdressed idiot. He knew he felt like one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a silver service cab swerved up. She got out. And Cole\u0027s chest expanded on a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs usual, Taryn Quinn was all grace. Her evening gown - a silver sequined sheath - fit her body like a high-fashion glove. The neckline was a modest scoop, but as she turned to set her stilettos correctly on the pavement, he saw that the back was cut low enough to hover on the edge of X-rated. She spotted him standing alone at the entrance of the inner-city five-star establishment and sent a little wave. He waved back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair always looked great...a long bouncy blond river. But tonight, beneath the city lights, it surrounded her face like a luxurious halo. And those lips, my God... Even from a distance, they looked tasty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole met her at the bottom of the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice tux,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? This old thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and something new lifted up inside of him. \"You said it was black tie. I took a chance and believed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a stunning gown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look beautiful.\" Incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brow pinched as if she wondered if he were only teasing, before her easy smile shone again. \"Sorry I kept you waiting. The cab took forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threaded his arm through hers. \"Absolutely no need to apologize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the ballroom, soft music played while guests churned around, nibbling salmon and caviar canapes while reminiscing. Both he and Taryn accepted chilled flutes from a passing waiter. As she sipped, Cole noticed the flute hovered longer than necessary, covering her smile. Grinning, too, he let his gaze sweep over the glittering room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s funny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just since you mentioned the navy, I had visions of scores of officers dressed up in crisp white suits and matching gloves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re partial to a man in uniform?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes glistened beneath the lights. \"Why? Do you have one hanging at the back of your wardrobe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hate to admit it but, as a cadet, I looked more like Popeye in my sailor\u0027s suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head went back and her hair bounced around her shoulders as she laughed. \"Popeye? Well, at least you\u0027re honest. Was there a Brutus in your unit of cadets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Big, burly, shaving daily by age ten. This guy\u0027s better looking than his cartoon counterpart, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze veered to the left. \"Would that be him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngling around, he spotted Brandon winding through the crowd. Cole grinned. \"Guess the shoulders gave it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon stopped before them, tipping his head at Taryn as he introduced himself. \"And you must be the mysterious Taryn Quinn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mysterious?\" She smiled. \"Maybe more your everyday working-class girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon\u0027s expression said plainly not. And he was right. Taryn was a beauty wearing office garb. But in this glittering silver number, she could put a supermodel out of a job. Her aura was magnetic, her laugh, infectious. He couldn\u0027t remember feeling this proud standing beside a date in his life. Those old feelings for Meredith McReedy were left for dead in the shade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon must have been thinking the same. He was searching the room. When he beckoned someone over, Cole recognized the woman. Barely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith McReedy bounced straight up, then, on her toes, planted a smacking kiss on Cole\u0027s chin. Her lips were so rouged, he just knew she\u0027d left a big red dot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cole, we missed you at the last reunion.\" Meredith smiled at Taryn, an honest expression, which was nice given the difference in their appearance. While Taryn came off statuesque, poised and glamorous, Cole wasn\u0027t certain what had happened to his erstwhile love. Meredith filled them in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m married now. Three children under four. We\u0027re the happiest little family.\" Meredith spoke directly to Taryn. \"You must be Cole\u0027s wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not wife,\" Cole cut in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith gave his lapel a playful slap. \"You can\u0027t hide from responsibility forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole coughed. Him hiding from responsibility. That was a new one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a \"We\u0027ll catch up later,\" Meredith disappeared into the tide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, Brandon raised his beer. \"Well, she looks happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole narrowed his eyes at his friend. If Brandon was thinking about blabbing, Taryn didn\u0027t need to know the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you in the forces?\" Taryn asked Brandon as the music changed and more couples headed for the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I own a security firm. I do some private investigating from time to time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must be exciting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can be,\" Brandon said, \"when you\u0027re on to something with substance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brow wrinkled. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes a client gets it into his head to chase dead ends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No stone left unturned,\" Cole reasoned, then saw Taryn looking between the two, wondering. He changed the subject. She didn\u0027t need to know about Guthrie\u0027s recent woes, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked Brandon, \"So, where\u0027s your date?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know how I said we have a love/hate relationship? Right now, she\u0027s not feeling the love. In fact, I think it\u0027s fair to say the curtain has dropped on that particular union.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn\u0027s shoulders fell. \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaze on the filling dance floor, Brandon sipped his beer, swallowed. Exhaled. \"Yeah, well, she\u0027s missing out. Marissa loves to dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do, too?\" Taryn asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With the right girl,\" Brandon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never know.\" Taryn\u0027s smile was encouraging. \"Maybe you\u0027ll find someone nice to dance with tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon cocked his head then shifted his focus to Cole, arching a brow as if asking permission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting both his and Taryn\u0027s flutes on a passing waiter\u0027s tray, Cole gave Brandon a \"she\u0027s mine\" look and led Taryn away for a dance of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached the floor, Cole half expected Taryn to kick up a fuss, maybe tell him that coming here was one thing, but dancing cheek to cheek was definitely another. Instead, in her glittering gown, which threw occasional sparks off beneath a slow spinning light, she stood calmly before him. Gaze fixed on his, she waited for his arm to wind around and tug her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was happy to oblige.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dress rustled as his hand grazed over her waist then slid down until his palm rested on the bare small of her back. When he pressed enough to let her know she should come closer, she stepped into his space. He took her slim warm hand in his and her head tilted back as she drew in a long breath. Then her hand found his shoulder and, with other couples weaving around, they began to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like your friend,\" she said as her fingers on his shoulder scrunched a little then splayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s one of a kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good at his work, I assume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A private investigator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down then back into his eyes. \"Cole, you don\u0027t have him investigating me, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He rotated her around. \"I\u0027ve decided I don\u0027t need to rattle your skeletons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile touched her eyes but then she blinked. \"He is working for you, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhaled. \"There\u0027s been a couple of incidents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Concerning you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression fell and dancing stopped. \"Is Guthrie in trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeering down into those beautiful concerned eyes, Cole set his jaw. Why the media hadn\u0027t got ahold of the story was beyond him, but he didn\u0027t expect that to last. Someone somewhere only needed to slip a scrap of information and, next thing, this attempted-murder business would be all over the news. He\u0027d already decided that he wouldn\u0027t share any of this with Taryn. Hell, he rarely shared anything personal with anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, for whatever reason, he wanted to tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole retold the story surrounding the attempts on Guthrie\u0027s life, how Jeremy Judge had practically sewn up the case in a twenty-four-hour window and, finally, how he wasn\u0027t satisfied this was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn shook her head in disbelief. \"No wonder you\u0027re irritable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppressing a grin, he moved her around in a tight circle. \"I\u0027m always irritable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious. I\u0027d be frantic if Vi\u0027s life was in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My aunt. She brought me up after...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes glistened before her gaze skirted away. Obviously too personal. Cole got that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to say, \"You don\u0027t have to talk about it,\" when she found his gaze again and explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know either of my parents. I was too young to have any memories of that time, but I still wish things had been different. Normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best he could offer was a supportive smile. She\u0027d said so much with so few words. Now he couldn\u0027t find a one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I grew up with my aunt,\" Taryn went on. \"Vi\u0027s the best there is. She\u0027s crazy about cats. She was over today when you phoned. She likes to drop in, you know, but she doesn\u0027t smother me like I\u0027ve heard some parents do.\" Her brow pinched and he felt her pull back an inch. \"I\u0027m boring you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze brushed her cheek, her lips. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the soft lights it was difficult to say, but he thought she might have blushed. Then he felt her draw away a little again. Put that wall back up between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you miss the sea?\" she asked, looking around at the other grown cadets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d mentioned there was a time I wanted to serve on a ship. I also thought I might buy a boat-building company and make my own. I imagined doing test runs all day long, standing bold and brave behind the wheel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was grinning, mocking himself, but Taryn\u0027s face was set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t have to think. \"Obligation. Duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To your family and Hunter Enterprises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you enjoy what you do there?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSearching her eyes, he gave a meaning-filled smile. \"Some days are better than others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And some days you get lumbered with problems you could do without.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was talking about her show, but her open look said she wasn\u0027t baiting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are positives to every situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree.\" She seemed to gather herself, gather the words. \"I haven\u0027t officially thanked you for approving my survey yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she hadn\u0027t. But...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze dropped to her lips again when he said, \"It\u0027s not too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her head angled, questioning and understanding at the same time, his pulse kicked, flames raced through his blood and impulse won out. His head lowered over hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath his palm, he felt her quiver. Over the music\u0027s percussion beat, he heard her sigh. His lips parted slightly as her face tilted more, slanting at the perfect angle to greet him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as if someone had stuck her with a pin, her eyes rounded and, unraveling herself, she stepped well away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not...\" She brushed back a tumble of hair fallen over one eye then met his gaze again. \"I wasn\u0027t expecting that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should apologize.\" He chanced a smile. \"But I\u0027m not sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, truth be told, he wanted to bring her close and finish what he\u0027d started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole felt a tap on his shoulder and, realizing where he was - in a highly public setting - looked back. A man Cole remembered from his cadet days was straightening his bow tie, speaking to him but looking at Taryn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wondered if I could beg a dance from the most beautiful woman in the room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout apology, Cole ground out, \"Not now,\" then escorted her off the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping control was hard enough when they were in a room full of people. God help him when they were away on that survey. The way she\u0027d almost surrendered just now, God help them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/losing-control-the-hunter-pact-1/page-8.html","bookId":1866,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:43:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:43:30 PM"}
