She didn\u0027t have to be inside to know what was happening. Her preternatural senses were so keen, she could almost picture the couple inside. The woman was mortal, young, and in love. The man was the vampire\u0027s own fledgling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had brought him across exactly a year ago. In all her long existence, she had only bestowed the Dark Gift on five other men. She had made them, used them, and forgotten them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this last one, Vince, there was something about him, something that kept him alive in her memory, and so she had decided to come and see how he was getting along in his new life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind connected with his. Come to me. It was not a request, but a command, one he could not ignore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, she faded into the shadows and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince frowned as a familiar voice whispered through the corridors of his mind. It was a voice he would never forget, one he was compelled to obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara frowned when he eased out of her embrace and rose from the sofa. \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? It\u0027s early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s after midnight.\" He tried to fight the compulsion to leave, but it was useless. Leaning down, he kissed her. \"I\u0027ve got a customer bringing a car in early in the morning. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow night, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, her expression worried. \"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, darlin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\" He kissed her again. \"Good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all he could do to keep from running out of the house toward the vampire who waited for him-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe vampire who had changed his life forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce outside, he stood on the sidewalk and then, as if guided by an invisible hand, he walked down the street until he came to a small park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire was waiting for him on a park bench. She . smiled as he approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vincent. How well you look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" She was even more beautiful than he remembered. Her skin was like smooth porcelain; her hair was thick and black and fell to her hips in rippling waves. Her eyes were an amazing shade of green. Clad in a pair of skin-tight black pants and a wine-red sweater that outlined every curve, she looked sexy as hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that any way to speak to me?\" She spoke like a queen questioning a commoner and as she did so, he felt her power roll over him, sizzling through his veins like an electric shock. The hair prickled along his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\" His tone was curt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, sit beside me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated only a moment, certain that any refusal would only cause him more pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So tell me,\" she said, \"how are you getting on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you care? You made me and dumped me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mind your tongue!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bit back the sharp retort that rose in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dragged her fingernails down his arm, leaving tiny furrows of blood behind. Her touch made him shiver. \"I\u0027ve thought of you often this past year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve thought of you, too,\" he muttered darkly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze bored into him. He had the distinct impression that she could see into his very soul, that she knew everything he had said and done in the past year, every thought that had crossed his mind, then and now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers kneaded his biceps. \"Is there anything you would like to ask me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your name, for a start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed softly. \"You may call me Mara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought vampires had to sleep during the day. Why doesn\u0027t the sun render me powerless?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My blood is very old and very powerful,\" she explained. \"The sun no longer has any effect on me, and since my blood now runs in your veins, you are able to be active during the day. In a year or two, the sun will have no power over you at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince felt a rush of excitement. If what she said was true, someday in the near future he would be able to return to his family and resume his old lifestyle. \"What is it about thresholds? What power do they hold?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"They have a built-in power all their own. Every home that has not been defiled is protected by that innate magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Defiled how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Homes where there has been foul play, murder, incest, or any kind of depravity. Such acts destroy the threshold, rendering it powerless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince nodded. It made sense in an otherworldly sort of way. \"How long have you been a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was made when Cleopatra ruled Egypt.\" Seeing his frown, she added, \"Sometime in 51 BC.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince swore in astonishment. These days, most people lived to be seventy-five or eighty. A few lived to be over a hundred. But to live for thousands of years... he shook his head. It was incredible. \"Is the vampire who made you still living?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I the only vampire you\u0027ve made?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. There were five before you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they still alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a vague gesture with her hand. \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what are you doing here? I mean, if you didn\u0027t give a damn about them...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed softly. \"Why do I care about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s why I came.\" She frowned thoughtfully. \"The woman inside. Cara. What is she to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know her name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read it in her mind. She\u0027s in love with you. Are you in love with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why ask? Can\u0027t you just read my thoughts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I wish, but conversation is more stimulating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said. \"I love her. Have you ever been in love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many times,\" she replied, her expression wistful. \"But it never lasts. Mortals are such fragile creatures, and they live such a short time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ones you made, were you in love with them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you bring them across?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"It\u0027s been so long, I don\u0027t recall. Curiosity, I suppose. Or maybe boredom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why you brought me across?\" he asked bitterly. \"Because you were bored?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed again, the sound soft and musical, like the chiming of silver bells on a summer day. \"I\u0027m afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince muttered an oath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not happy with your new state of being?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince frowned into the distance. Was he happy as a vampire? There were things about his new lifestyle that he liked, but until she had told him he would soon be able to go out in the sun, he would have said that, all things considered, he would rather be mortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of curiosity, he asked, \"Can you undo what you\u0027ve done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Only death can free you.\" She studied him dispassionately for a moment. \"Would you like me to release you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d destroy me?\" he exclaimed with a snap of his fingers. \"Just like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn, woman, you\u0027re one heartless...\" He let the thought die, unfinished, at the warning look in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to be unhappy,\" she said. \"I\u0027m not sure why. Come, spend the night with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a command?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you refusing me?\" She looked suddenly like a child whose stocking was empty on Christmas morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your little mortal wouldn\u0027t like it.\" She finished his thought for him as she caressed his cheek. \"Perhaps it was that streak of honor that first attracted me to you. Ah, well, I\u0027ll see you again,\" she said, and vanished from his sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince shook his head. If there was one thing he didn\u0027t need, it was another woman in his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara watched her fledgling get into his sleek black car and drive away. Sometimes she longed for the old days. Life had been simpler then, slower. There had been a charm and beauty to life in the long ago time that was missing today. She had seen so many changes in the eons since she had been made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally, when the rush and noise of the world grew too great, she sought shelter in the arms of the earth. There, lost in the quiet darkness, she sometimes slept for hundreds of years. Each time, she emerged regenerated, only to find a new world awaiting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many changes. Kingdoms rose and fell. New discoveries were made in the earth and in the heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were always wars in distant lands. Cures were found for old diseases while new ailments were constantly being discovered. Earthquakes, tidal waves, tornadoes, and floods reminded humanity of how frail and precarious their existence was. Airplanes flew higher, cars went faster. Mankind was constantly inventing new and better ways to destroy itself. Sometimes she wondered how mortals slept at night when their lives were in constant peril.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. The only constant was change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fledgling had changed, as well. Until Vince, she had not made a new vampire in over a thousand years. She was surprised at how powerful he had become in such a short time. Did he have any idea of just how invincible he was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of the young female inside the house and experienced a rush of unexpected jealousy. For a moment, she toyed with the idea of destroying the female. It would be all too easy. She could do it from here with no more than a thought, but to what end? Mortals lived such a short time, there was little satisfaction in depriving them of the few years they had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps hunting for prey would dispel her melancholia. It had been years since she had needed to feed, but she was suddenly overcome with the urge to hunt, to hold a mortal in thrall, to feel the rapid beating of a fearful heart, to savor the warm sweet taste of life\u0027s elixir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving that part of the city, she sought a place to hunt. Though she had no fear of recriminations, old habits died hard. It had ever been her wont to find her prey among the poor and downtrodden. Should she decide to drain her victims dry, there would be no one to mourn their passing, no one to comment on their absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had just turned down a seedy looking street when she realized there was another vampire nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, she sought him out. He was young in the life, compared to her; but then, compared to her, they were all little more than fledglings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came to an abrupt halt when he saw her, his eyes narrowing as he recognized her for what she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara plucked his name from his mind. \"Roshan DeLongpre,\" she murmured. \"I bid you good evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bowed from the waist. \"I\u0027m afraid you have me at a disadvantage, madam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was deep and rich, his manner respectful yet wary. She liked him immediately. \"I am Mara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he tried to hide it, his surprise was evident in the widening of his eyes and the sharp intake of his breath. \"Like all of our kind, I have heard of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" She took a step closer, noting his finely chiseled features, the strength of his jaw, the spread of his shoulders. \"And what have you heard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you are truly immortal, and that the sun no longer holds any power over you.\" His gaze moved over her in frank admiration. \"And that you are the most beautiful of women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, pleased by the compliment and his obvious sincerity. \"I take it you are the master of the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had known it wasn\u0027t Vincent. He was too young in the life and too new to the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am surprised you allow another into your domain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak of Cordova?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is my daughter\u0027s friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, she thought, the woman in the house. Cara. \"How is it that you have a child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We adopted her when she was an infant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara digested that for a moment. \"What was it like, raising a human child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was...\" He searched for the right word. \"Interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, thinking that interesting was probably an understatement. \"How did she feel, having vampires for parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until recently, she didn\u0027t know. She was understandably upset when she found out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet she is in love with a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t believe he\u0027s one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It should be... interesting... when she finds out the truth,\" Mara remarked with a faint smile. \"Come, hunt with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be my pleasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And mine,\" she said, linking her arm with his. \"I have not hunted with a companion in many years.\" She threw back her head and took a deep breath. \"Do you smell it?\" she asked, and he heard the underlying note of excitement in her voice, saw it in the predatory gleam in her extraordinary green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan nodded. The scent of prey was in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara was a skilled and ruthless hunter, but then, that was to be expected, Roshan thought with a wry grin, seeing as how she\u0027d had thousands of years to perfect her skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called her desired prey to her with a look, and because she was in the mood to hunt, she took only a taste from each of her chosen victims before offering them to Roshan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing like it, he thought, the thrill of the hunt, the surge of power as you held your prey in your grasp, the thick, rich taste of their life\u0027s blood sliding over your tongue, the way it filled you with warmth and strength, the exhilarating sense of being invincible. In the last few years, he had hunted only when necessary and taken only what he needed to survive. But tonight, tonight they drank from dozens until even his prodigious thirst was quenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, to his surprise, Mara drew him into her arms. \"Shh,\" she whispered, \"don\u0027t be afraid. I want only a taste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would have refused, but he found himself powerless to resist. He stared into her eyes, eyes as deep and green as the Nile, sighed as her fangs pierced the skin of his neck just below his left ear. It had been a long time since anyone had drunk from him. He had forgotten what it was like, the heat of it, the sensual pleasure that bordered on ecstasy. And yet, even as he reveled in it, he felt the sharp prick of his conscience, certain that Brenna would not approve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara licked the wound in his neck, then swept her hair aside, offering Roshan her throat. A thrill of anticipation ran down his spine. To drink from Mara was akin to drinking from the wellspring of eternal life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shake of his head, he backed away from her. \"No, I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head again. It was bad enough that he had let her drink from him. To drink from her would be like betraying Brenna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not be so quick to refuse,\" Mara said. \"I\u0027m offering you more than you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you yourself said, the sun no longer has any power over me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. Once you have drunk from me, you will no longer be under its spell. You may even find that, after a year or so, you can walk in its light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pondered that a moment-to walk in the sun\u0027s light again, to feel its warmth on his face. Was it truly possible? \"Why are you offering this to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted one slim shoulder and let it fall. \"Consider it a gift in appreciation for your company this night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If my wife drinks from me, will she be affected the same way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should think so, though it may take longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be a miracle to walk in the light of day again, to no longer be rendered helpless each dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely Brenna would understand! He knew how much she missed the brisk days of autumn and the warm halcyon days of summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara was watching him, waiting for his decision. Taking a deep breath, he reached for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes as he lowered his head. Her skin was smooth, cool to the touch. Her blood was like liquid fire on his tongue. He felt the power of it sing through every fiber and cell of his being. More, he thought, he wanted more. He wanted it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice rang out in his mind and he drew back, unable to resist her command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me,\" he murmured, horrified by what he had so desperately longed to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is nothing to forgive,\" she said, and he saw the understanding in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" he replied fervently, and then asked, \"What of Vince? Is he able to walk in the sun\u0027s light?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet, but soon. The sun does not render him powerless, though he must remain indoors, and at some point during the day he must rest. But as he grows older and stronger, the sun will have less power over him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a courtly gesture, Roshan took Mara\u0027s hand in his. He bowed over it, then kissed the back of her hand. \"Again, my thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of yourself, Roshan DeLongpre. There is evil in this city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you feel it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as strongly as my wife. Do you know who or what it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, only that it is nearby and growing stronger.\" She smiled at him, her green eyes glowing, and then she vanished from his sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there for a long while, reliving all that had happened, all that Mara had told him, and then he went home, eager to tell Brenna of the night\u0027s events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna looked up from the book she was reading when Roshan entered the room. \"What took you so long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t believe this,\" he said, dropping down on the sofa beside her. \"I ran into Mara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s here, in the city?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"She asked me to go hunting with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan grinned. There was no mistaking the edge in his wife\u0027s voice or the jealousy in her eyes. \"How could I refuse? But, Brenna, listen, she took my blood...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Her eyes narrowed ominously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush, love, and listen...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna sprang to her feet. Hands fisted on her hips, she stared down at him. \"How could you let her do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t let her,\" he said curtly. \"She wanted it and she took it.\" He took a deep breath. \"Brenna, listen to me. She took my blood and she gave me hers.\" Even now, he couldn\u0027t believe it. \"I can feel it inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna, you can\u0027t imagine the power!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You drank from her?\" she asked, her voice little more than a whisper. Between vampires, the sharing of blood was akin to making love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna.\" Rising, he drew her into his arms. \"Listen to me. She said the sun will no longer have any power over me and that I won\u0027t be rendered helpless during the day. That in a year or two it won\u0027t have any power over me at all. Do you know what that means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood stiff and unmoving in his arms, her eyes swimming with tears. \"You betrayed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna, I did it for you. She said if I give you my blood, the day will come when you, too, will be able to walk in the sunlight. Think of it, love. You won\u0027t be trapped in the darkness anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna blinked at him, her brow furrowed. \"I don\u0027t believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true. Read my mind if you don\u0027t believe me. You\u0027ll see that it\u0027s true.\" He caressed her cheek. \"Think of it, love, to be able to walk in the sun again.\" He drew her down on the sofa once more and turned his head to the side. \"Drink, love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated a moment before she licked his skin, and then her fangs pierced his flesh. His blood was warm as it flowed over her tongue. She had tasted him before, but it was different now. She felt a sudden rush of power flood her being, felt her senses expand as never before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting her head, she gazed into her husband\u0027s eyes. And even though she knew it was only her imagination, she saw the sun shining there. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-19.html","bookId":2300,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM"}
