Maggie felt the brush of his warm lips and then cold air as he jerked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"he said.\"No.\" She could see the clash of fear and anger in his eyes, and she could see itsuddenly resolve itselfas the pain grew unbearable.He shuddered once, and then all the turmoil vanished, asif it were being swept aside by a giant hand. It left only icy determination in its wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not going to help,\" Maggie said. \"I don\u0027teven understand why you want to be this way, butyou can\u0027t just squash everything down-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" he said in a clipped, taut voice. \"Yousaid that in your dream I told you to go away. Well,I\u0027m telling you the same thing now. Go away anddon\u0027t ever come back. I never want to see yourface again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, fine.\" Maggie was trembling herself withfrustration. She\u0027d had it; she\u0027d finally reached thelimit of her patience with him. There was so muchbitterness in his face, so much pain, but it was clear he wasn\u0027t going to let anyone help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it. And you don\u0027t know how much of aconcession it is. I\u0027m letting you go. You\u0027re not justan escaped slave, you\u0027re an escaped slave whoknows about the pass in the mountains. The pen-.alty for that is death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So kill me,\" Maggie said. It was a stupid thingto say and she knew it. He was dangerous - andthe master of that blue fire. He could do it at theturn of an eyelash. But she was feeling stupid andreckless. Her fists were clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you to leave,\" he said. \"And I\u0027ll tellyou something else. You wanted to know what happened to your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie went still. There was something differentabout him suddenly. He looked like somebodyabout to strike a blow. His body was tense and hiseyes were burning gold like twin flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, here it is,\" he said. \"Your brother is dead. I killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a blow. Maggie felt as if she\u0027d been hit. Shock spread through her body and left her tingling with adrenaline. At the same time she felt strangely weak, as if her legs didn\u0027t want to hold her up any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t believe it. She couldn\u0027t believe it, not just like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth and dragged in a breathto speakand froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere outside the cave a voice was calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie couldn\u0027t make out the words, but it was agirl\u0027s voice. And it was close ...and coming closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelos\u0027s head whipped around to look at the entrance of the cave. Then, before Maggie could say anything, he was moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took one step to the wall and blew out theflame of the little stone lamp. Instantly, the cavewas plunged into darkness. Maggie hadn\u0027t realizedhow little light came from the entrance crack-almost none at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she thought. Less light is coming throughthan before. It\u0027s getting dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, she thought. Cady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just walked off and left her there. What\u0027s wrongwith me? I forgot all about her-1 didn\u0027t eventhink....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" Delos whispered harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie paused in mid rush and looked at himwildly. Or looked towardhim, actually, becausenow she couldn\u0027t see anything but darkness against paler darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Cady,\" she said, distracted and frantic, clutching the water bag she\u0027d grabbed. \"I left herdown there. Anything could have happened bynow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t go outside,\" he said. \"That\u0027s the hunting party I came with. If they catch you I won\u0027t beable to help-2\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t care!\" Maggie\u0027s words tumbled over his.\"A minute ago you never wanted to see me again.Oh, God, I left her. How could I do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It hasn\u0027t been that long,\" he hissed impatiently. \"An hour or so.\" Vaguely, Maggie realized that hemust be right. It seemed like a hundred years sinceshe had climbed up to his ledge, but actually every thing had happened quickly after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still have to go,\" she said, a little more calmly.\"She\u0027s sick. And maybe Gavin came back.\" A waveof fear surged through her at the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they catch you, you\u0027ll wish you were dead,\" he said distinctly. Before Maggie could answer, hewas going on, his voice as brusque as ever. \"Stayhere. Don\u0027t come out until everybody\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the movement of air and the brush ofcloth as he passed in front of her. The light fromthe entrance crack was cut off briefly, and then shesaw him silhouetted for an instant against gray sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie stood tensely for a moment, listening.The sound of her own breathing was too loud. She crept quietly to the entrance and crouched\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd felt a jolt. She could hear footsteps crunching on the broken slate outside. Rightoutside. Thena shadow seemed to fall across the crack and sheheard a voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delos! What are you doing up here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a light, pleasant voice, the voice of a girl only a little older than Maggie. Not a woman yet.And it was both concerned and casual, addressingDelos with a familiarity that was startling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn\u0027t what gave her the bigjolt. It wasthat she recognized the voice. She knew it and shehated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Sylvia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s here, Maggie thought. And from the wayshe\u0027stalkingshe\u0027s been here before - enough to getto know Delos. Or maybe she was born here, and she\u0027s just started coming Outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever the truth, it somehow made Maggiecertain that Miles had been brought here, too. But then-what? What had happened to him after that?Had he done something that meant he had to disappear? Or had it been Sylvia\u0027s plan from thebeginning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould Delos have really... ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t believe it, Maggie thought fiercely, butthere was a pit of sick fear in her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Sylvia was chatting on in a musical voice. \"We didn\u0027t even know you\u0027d left the groupbut then we saw the blue fire. We thought youmight be in trouble-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\"Delos laughed briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-we thought there might betrouble,\" Sylvia amended. Her own laugh was like wind chimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine. I used the fire for practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delos.\" Sylvia\u0027s voice was gently reproving now,in a way that was almost flirtatious. \"You knowyou shouldn\u0027t do that. You\u0027ll only do more damageto your armit\u0027s never going to get better if youkeep using it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Delos\u0027s brusque tone was a sharp con\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrast to Sylvia\u0027s teasing. \"But that\u0027s my business.\"\"I only want what\u0027s best for you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go. I\u0027m sure the rest of the party is waiting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t like her, Maggie thought. All herwhinnying and prancing doesn\u0027t fool him. But Iwonder what she is to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she really wanted at that moment was to dash out and confront Sylvia. Grab her and shake her until she coughed up some answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she\u0027d already tried that once-and it had gotten her thrown into slavery. She gritted her teethand edged closer to the entrance crack. It was dangerous and she knew it, but she wanted to seeSylvia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she did, it was another shock. Sylvia always wore slinky tops and fashionable jeans, butthe outfit she had on now was completely medieval.More, she looked comfortable in it, as if thesestrange clothes were natural to her-and flattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing a sea-green tunic that had longsleeves and fell to the ground. Over that was another tunic, a shade paler, this one sleeveless andtied with a belt embroidered in green and silver. Her hair was loose in a fine shimmering mass, andshe had a falcon on her wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA real falcon. With a little leather hood on itshead and leather ties with bells on its feet. Maggie stared at it, fascinated despite herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat whole fragile act Sylvia puts on, shethought. But you have to be strong to hold up a big bird like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, we don\u0027t have to rush back just yet,\" Sylvia was saying, moving closer to Delos. \"Now that I\u0027m here, we could go a little farther. This looks like anice path; we could explore it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCady, Maggie thought. If they go to the end ofthe path, they\u0027ll see her. Sylvia will see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had just decided to jump out of the cavewhen Delos spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m tired,\" he said in his flat, cold way. \"We\u0027regoing back now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you\u0027re tired,\" Sylvia said, and her smile wasalmost sly. \"You see. I told you not to use yourpowers so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\"Delossaid,evenmoreshortly. \"Iremember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could say anything else, Sylvia went on. \"I forgot to mention, a funny thing happened.A guy named Gavin dropped in on the huntingparty a little while ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u0027s stomach plummeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got away. And he saw everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he must have moved fast,she thought absently. To hook around and get to a hunting partyon the other side of this ledge-in time for Sylviato come find Delos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You probably donI know him,\" Sylvia was saying. \"But I do. He\u0027s the slave trader I use to getgirls from Outside. He\u0027s normally pretty good, but today he was all upset. He said a group of slavesgot loose on the mountain, and somehow his part ner Bern got killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou... witch,Maggie thought. She couldn\u0027tthink of a swear word strong enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSylvia knew. There was no doubt about it. IfGavin was her flunky, and if he\u0027d told her that Bernwas dead, he must have told her the rest. That Bernhad been killed by Prince Delos himself, fried withblue fire, and that there were two slave girls infront of Delos at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew all along, Maggie thought, and she wasjust trying to trap Delos. But why isn\u0027t she afraidof him? He\u0027s the prince, after all. His father\u0027s dead; he\u0027s in charge. So how come she daresto set upher little traps?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were all concerned,\" Sylvia was going on,tilting her silvery head to one side. \"All the nobles,and especially your greatgrandfather. Loose slavescan mean trouble\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How sweet of you to worry,\" Delos said. Fromwhat Maggie could see of his face, it was expressionless and his voice was dry and level. \"But youshouldn\u0027t have. I used the fire for practice-on the other slave trader. Also on two slaves. They interrupted me when I wanted quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie sat in helpless admiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did it. He outsmarted her. Now there\u0027s nothing she can say. And there\u0027s no way to prove thathe didn\u0027t kill us. Gavin ran; he couldn\u0027t have seenanything after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saved us. Delos saved Cady and me bothagain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" Sylvia bowed her head, looking sweet andplacating, if not quite convinced. \"Well, of courseyou had every right to do that. So the slaves aredead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And since they were only slaves, why arewe standing heretalking about them? Is there something about them I don\u0027t know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. Of course not,\" Sylvia said quickly. \"You\u0027re right; we\u0027ve wasted enough time. Let\u0027s go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her mind, Maggie heard Gavin\u0027s voice. \"It\u0027s not like they were ordinary slaves. If we don\u0027t deliver that maiden we\u0027re dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she\u0027s lying again, Maggie thought. What a surprise. But who\u0027s the maiden? And why\u0027s she so important?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor that matter, she thought, who\u0027s this greatgrandfather of Delos\u0027s? When Sylvia mentionedhim it sounded almost like a threat. But if he\u0027s agreat-grandfather he\u0027s got to be ancient. How areSylvia and some old geezer teamed up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an interesting question, but there was no time to think about it now. Sylvia and Delos wereturning away from the cave, Sylvia murmuringabout having to take a look at Delos\u0027s arm when they got back. In another moment they\u0027d passed out of Maggie\u0027s line of sight and she heard thecrunching noise of feet on slate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie waited until the last footstep faded, then she held her breath and waited for a count ofthirty. It was all she could stand. She ducked through the entrance crack and stood in the openair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was fully dark now. She was very nearly blind.But shecould sense the vast emptiness of the valley in front of her, and the solidity of the mountain at her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she should have felt relieved, to be outsideand not caught-but instead she felt strangely stifled. It took her a moment to realize why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sound at all. No footsteps, novoices, and no animals, either. And that was whatfelt eerie. It might be too cold at night for mosquitoes and gnats and flies, but there should have been someanimal life to be heard. Birds heading intothe trees to rest, batsheadingout. Deer feeding.Bucks charging around-it was autumn, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing. Maggie had the unnervingfeeling that she was alone in a strange lifelessworld swathed in cotton, cut off from everythingreal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t stick around and think about it, she toldherself sternly. Find Cady. Now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGritting her teeth, she thrust the water bag intoher jacket and started back. By keeping close to the mountains bulk on her left and feeling ahead with her foot before each step, she could find her way in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she reached the ledge, her stomach tightened in dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrific. Going down in pitch darkness-there\u0027s going to be no way to see the footholds. Oh, well, I\u0027ll feel for them. The worst that can happen is I fall a hundred feet straight down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cady,\" she whispered. She was afraid to talk tooloudly; the hunting party might be anywhere andsound could carry surprisingly well on a mountain slope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cady? Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart thumped slowly five times before she heard something below. Not a voice, just a stirring,like cloth on rock, and then a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief flooded through Maggie in a wave that wasalmost painful. Cady hadn\u0027t died or been abducted. because Maggie had left her. \"Stay there,\" she whispered as loudly as she dared. \"I\u0027m coming down.I\u0027ve brought water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t ashard going downas she\u0027d expected. Maybe because she was still high on adrenaline,running in survival mode. Her feet seemed to findthe toeholds of their own accord and in a few minutes she was on the boulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cady.\" Her fingers found warmth and cloth. Itmoved and she heard another little sigh. \"Cady, areyou okay? I can\u0027t see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the darkness seemed to lighten, andMaggie realized that she couldsee the shape shewas touching, dimly but distinctly. She glanced up and went still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon was out. In a sky that was otherwisecovered with clouds, there was a small opening, a clear spot. The moon shone down through it like asupernatural white face, nearly full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie.\" The voice was a soft breath, almost awhisper, but it seemed to blow peace and calm into Maggie\u0027s heart. \"Thanks for letting me rest. I feel stronger now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie looked down. Silver light touched thecurves of Cady\u0027s cheek and lips. The blind girllooked like some ancient Egyptian princess, herdark hair loose in crimped waves around her shoulders, her wide, heavy-lashed eyes reflecting themoon. Her face wasas sereneasever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry it took so long. I got some water,\"Maggie said. She helped Cady sit up and put thewater bag to her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t look as feverish, she thought asCadywas drinking. Maybe she can walk. But where?Where can we go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would never make it to the pass. And even if they did, what then? They\u0027d be high on a moun tain-some mountain-in the dark and cold of aNovember night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to get you to a doctor,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCady stopped drinking and gave the bag back. \"Idon\u0027t think there\u0027s anything like that here. There might be some healing woman down there in thecastle - but. .She stopped and shook her head. \"It\u0027s not worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, it\u0027s not worth it? And, hey, you rereally feeling better, aren\u0027t you?\" Maggieadded, pleased. It was the first time Cady had gottenout more than a few words. She sounded very weak,but rational, and surprisingly knowledgeable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not worth it because it\u0027s too much of a risk. I\u0027m too much of a risk. You have to leave me here, Maggie. Go down and get to shelter yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this again!\" Maggie waved a hand She really couldn\u0027t deal with this argument anymore. \"IfI left you up here, you\u0027d die. It\u0027s going to get freezing cold. So I\u0027m not going to leave you. And ifthere\u0027s a healing woman down at the castle, thenwe\u0027re going to the castle. Wherever the castle is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the place all the Night People are,\" Arcadiasaid, unexpectedly grim. \"The slaves, too. Everybody who lives here is inside the castle gates; it\u0027sreally like a little town. And it\u0027s exactly the placeyou shouldn\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie blinked. \"How come you know so much?Are you an escaped slave like Jeanne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I heard about it a year or so ago from someone who had been here. I was coming here for a reason-it was just bad luck that I got caught bythe slave traders on my way in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie wanted to ask her more about it, but anagging voice inside her said that this wasn\u0027t thetime. It was already getting very cold. They couldn\u0027t be caught on the mountainside overnight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That road the cart was on-does it go all theway to the castle? Do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCady hesitated. She turned her face toward the valley, and Maggie had the strange sense that shewas looking out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so,\" she said, at last. \"It would makesense that it does, anyway-there\u0027s only one placeto go in the valley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ve got to find it again.\" Maggie knewthat wouldn\u0027t be easy. They\u0027d run a long way fromBern and Gavin. But she knew the general direction. \"Look, even if we don\u0027t get to the castle, weshould find the road so we know where we are. And if we have to spend the night on the mountain,it\u0027s much better to be in the forest. It\u0027ll be warmer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true. But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie didn\u0027t give her a chance to go on. \"Canyou stand up? I\u0027ll help-put your arm around myneck... .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was tricky, getting Cady out of the nest of boulders. She and Maggie both had to crawl most of the way. And although Cady never complained, Maggiecould see how tired it made her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Maggie said. \"You\u0027re doing great.\"And she thought, with narrowed eyes and set teeth,If it comes to that, I\u0027ll carryher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo many people had told her to leave this girl.Maggie had never felt quite this stubborn before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t easy. Once into the woods, the canopy of branches cut off the moonlight. In only minutes, Cady wasleaning heavilyon Maggie,stumbling and trembling. Maggie herself was stumbling, tripping over roots, slipping on club mossand liverwort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely, Cady seemed to have a better sense ofdirection than she did, and in the beginning shekept murmuring, \"This way, I think.\" But after awhile she stopped talking, and some time afterthat, she stopped even responding to Maggie\u0027squestions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, she stopped dead and swayed on her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no good. The taller girl shivered once, thenwent limp. It was all Maggie could do to breakher fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she was sitting alone in a small clearing, with the spicy aroma of red cedar around her, and an unconscious girl in her lap. Maggie held still and listened to the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was broken suddenly by the crunch offootsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps coming toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might be a deer. But there was something hesitant and stealthy about it. Crunch, pause; crunchpause. The back of Maggie\u0027s neck prickled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her breath and reached out, feeling fora rock or a stick-some weapon. Cady was heavyin her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething stirred in the salal bushes betweentwo trees. Maggie strained her eyes, every muscle tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s there?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-black-dawn-night-world-8/page-10.html","bookId":2081,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:55 PM"}
