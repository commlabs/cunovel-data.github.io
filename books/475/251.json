{"id":15208,"no":251,"title":"September 8","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress\" (Ps. 4:1).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is one of the grandest testimonies ever given by man to the moral government of God. It is not a man\u0027s thanksgiving that he has been set free from suffering. It is a thanksgiving that he has been set free through suffering: \"Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress.\" He declares the sorrows of life to have been themselves the source of life\u0027s enlargement.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd have not you and I a thousand times felt this to be true? It is written of Joseph in the dungeon that \"the iron entered into his soul.\" (Ps.105:18) We all feel that what Joseph needed for his soul was just the iron. He had seen only the glitter of the gold. He had been rejoicing in youthful dreams; and dreaming hardens the heart. He who sheds tears over a romance will not be most apt to help reality; real sorrow will be too unpoetic for him. We need the iron to enlarge our nature. The gold is but a vision; the iron is an experience. The chain which unites me to humanity must be an iron chain. That touch of nature which makes the world akin is not joy, but sorrow; gold is partial, but iron is universal.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMy soul, if thou wouldst be enlarged into human sympathy, thou must be narrowed into limits of human suffering. Joseph\u0027s dungeon is the road to Joseph\u0027s throne. Thou canst not lift the iron load of thy brother if the iron hath not entered into thee. It is thy limit that is thine enlargement. It is the shadows of thy life that are the real fulfillment of thy dreams of glory. Murmur not at the shadows; they are better revelations than thy dreams. Say not that the shades of the prison-house have fettered thee; thy fetters are wings--wings of flight into the bosom of humanity. The door of thy prison-house is a door into the heart of the universe. God has enlarged thee by the binding of sorrow\u0027s chain.--George Matheson \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf Joseph had not been Egypt\u0027s prisoner, he had never been Egypt\u0027s governor. The iron chain about his feet ushered in the golden chain about his neck.—Selected \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e九月八日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「我在困苦中，祢曾使我宽广。」（诗四1）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e这是一个最伟大的见证。他的感谢不是因为从苦难得到释放，乃是因为因苦难得到释放：「我在困苦中，你曾使我宽广。」他告诉我们：人生的困苦，就是人生宽广的来源。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e经上记着约瑟在牢狱中「……被铁捆拘」（诗一○五18）。约瑟所需要的正是铁。他以前所看见的，只是黄金的灿烂，所享受的，只是少年的幻梦。人生的悲哀，是他所不能想象的。我们，像约瑟一样，也都需要铁来使我们宽广。金不过是幻梦，铁纔是经历。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e啊！我的己哪！如果你要宽广，你必须先去受苦。约瑟的牢狱，是约瑟登宝座的路径。如果你自己没有被铁捆拘，你就不能取去你弟兄的铁荷。神用悲哀的铁链约束你，为要使你宽广。－－马德胜\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e如果约瑟不做埃及的囚犯，绝不能做埃及的宰相。他脚上的铁链，引上了他颈上的金链。－－选\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5399.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:48:11 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:48:11 AM"}
