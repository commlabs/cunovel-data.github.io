Always a troublemaker.\" But the smile playing at the corner of his lips softened the gruffness. \"How have they been treating you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like it\u0027s the Hilton, sir. Room service is a bit slow, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it always.\" The colonel gestured to the guard to open the cell. \"Follow me, Sergeant Brust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Mr. Brust now, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever,\" he said with a frown, turning away. \"We\u0027ve got to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard interrupted. \"Should I handcuff him, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen gave Colonel Matson his most innocent look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Matson said. \"You\u0027d better. There\u0027s no trusting civilians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Ben said, standing at mock attention. \"You win. Sergeant Brust, reporting for duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, Colonel Matson waved the guard away. \"C\u0027mon, then, Sergeant. We\u0027re going to my office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen followed him out of the prison, and after a short drive, they arrived at the Administration Building. The colonel\u0027s office had not changed. Same walnut desk with stained coffee mug circles; walls festooned with banners from the Old Guard; trophies lining the side wall. During the ride over, Ben could tell from the hesitancy in an otherwise ebullient man that something of importance was being withheld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colonel ushered Ben to sit, then Matson leaned on the edge of his desk and studied him. The colonel\u0027s face was stone. Ben tried not to squirm under his gaze. Finally his old commander spoke, his voice tired, \"What the hell happened to you? The best of the best, and you just disappear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a better offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Guiding yuppies with midlife crises on little thrill tours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I prefer to call them \u0027Adventure Vacations.\u0027 Besides, I earn enough to help keep my dad\u0027s sheep station afloat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And earned yourself a bit of a reputation. Quite the cave hound. I read about that cavern rescue in the States. Big hero, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s not why you left here. It was Jack, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen\u0027s face went cold at the mention of his friend\u0027s name. \"I believed in the Guard. And honor. I believed in you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Matson grimaced. \"Sometimes political pressure bends rules. Distorts honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit!\" Ben shook his head. \"The prime minister\u0027s son deserved every inch of the pummeling he got from Jack after the shit he tried with his girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A prime minister has powerful friends. It couldn\u0027t go unpunished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bloody hell!\" Ben slammed his fist on the arm of his chair. \"I\u0027da done the same. His court-martial was a travesty.\" Ben stopped, swallowed hard, then continued in a quieter voice. \"Jack was stripped of everything that made him a man. And you wonder why I left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatson sighed, seemingly satisfied. \"Then the balance of fate has shifted your way this time. Now the political pressures are aligned to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen\u0027s brow furrowed. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should pretend I never received this letter. As much trouble as you caused, you sure as hell deserve a couple years behind bars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What letter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A command from the Home Office. You\u0027re to be set free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat joke was this? They were just going to let him walk? Ben watched a worried look pass over Matson\u0027s face. \"What\u0027s up, Colonel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a catch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Ben thought. There always was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must join an international expedition. A professor somewhere in the Americas has requested your expertise in cave exploration. Some hush-hush operation. No other details. They\u0027ll waive all charges and pay you for your services.\" He slid a sheet of paper toward Ben. \"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen quickly read the letter, and his eyes caught on the figure at the bottom of the page. He stared at all those zeros, daring them to change. This couldn\u0027t be right. After this, he could own his sheep station free and clear. No more shady tour operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost too good to be true?\" Matson leaned forward, his hands on Ben\u0027s shoulders. \"But impossible to pass up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something tells me you had better watch your ass, Ben.\" Matson strode to the chair behind his desk and sat. \"The big boys are playing with you, and they have a tendency to roll over the little people. Remember your friend Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen stared at the number at the bottom of the page, drawing a breath. Too good to be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in his cell, with an arm draped over his eyes, Ben drifted to sleep and was soon lost in a nightmare he hadn\u0027t had since childhood. He found himself, a boy again, threading his way through meter-wide columns of damp stone inside a huge cave. He knew this place. His grandfather had once brought him here to show him Aboriginal petroglyphs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same cave, but now the rock columns sprouted fruit-laden branches. Curious, he reached for a red pulpy gourd, but it was just beyond his reach. As he was pulling back his arm, he felt eyes drilling into the nape of his neck. He whipped around, but no one was there. Yet now those eyes were all around him. Just at the edge of his vision, he spotted motion from behind a large rock cylinder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s there?\" he called, racing to peer behind the column. Just more empty space. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word \"ghosts\" came unbidden to his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to runâ€¦\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt something following him, calling him back. He ignored it and ran, searching for an exit. The pillars closed around him, slowing his progress. Then he sensed a soft touch at the back of his neck and heard garbled words whispered in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe screamed, bolting out of the dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe woke on his cot, his heart still racing, and rubbed at his temples. Bloody hell. What brought back that old nightmare? He closed his eyes, recalling that the nightmares had first started after an argument with his grandfather in an Aboriginal cave outside of Darwin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not true,\" the thirteen-year-old Ben had yelled, tears welling at the revelation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is, young man. And I don\u0027t take to being called a liar.\" His grandfather\u0027s wrinkled leather face frowned at him. \"This was once the ancestral home of my grandmother,\" he repeated, then poked him in the chest. \"A direct relative of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe implications that he could have Aboriginal blood running through his veins had horrified him. He and his friends had always made fun of the dark-skinned Aboriginal kids at school. And now, in a single heartbeat, he had been lumped in with them. He shook his head. \"I am not a damned darkie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stinging slap to his cheek. \"You\u0027ll respect your ancestors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now, he cringed at the memory. As a youngster, this heritage had shamed him. Aborigines, at the time, were considered second-class citizens, only slightly above animals. Luckily, diluted by generations of European blood, his blighted heritage was an easily kept secret. Except from himself. It was then the nightmares had started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor countless nights, he\u0027d awaken with his sheets clinging to his sweating body, tears coursing down his cheeks. Clenching handfuls of sheets, he would pray no one would learn his secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, he had matured, even come to respect and appreciate his unique heritage, and the dreams had eventually faded away, like old toys put in cardboard boxes. Forgotten and no longer needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. So why now? Why dredge up this old childhood terror?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMust be this bloody cell, he concluded, and burrowed deeper under his ratty blanket. Well, thanks to that timely letter, he would soon be rid of this damn place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty days later, his mysterious benefactor telegraphed Black Rock, and in twenty hours Ben found himself upgraded from his cramped cell in Australia to a suite of rooms at the Sheraton Buenos Aires in Argentina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen tested the bathwater with his foot. He cringed at the heat, then smiled. Ahhh, perfect. After a month in the Black Rock prison, a month of tepid showers that barely penetrated the layer of grime caked into his pores, a full hot bath was just possibly orgasmic. He stepped into the tub and settled himself into the steaming water. He tapped the button for the jets. Tickling sprays massaged him from all sides, creating a gentle whirlpool. Definitely orgasmic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, leaning back into the tub and allowing his body to relax and float in the jets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knock on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring it, Ben slipped farther into the jets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knock came again, more persistently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing his elbows, he raised himself higher in the tub. \"Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muffled voice replied, \"Excuse me, sir, but Dr. Blakely requests your presence in the Pampas room on the main floor. The other guests are arriving now as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen rubbed his red eyes. \"Gimme five minutes.\" He pushed out of the hot tub, the chill air raising gooseflesh on his bare legs. After dressing in an old brown tweed suit, Ben proceeded to the conference suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his relief, the antechamber to the auditorium was set up with a mobile bar. A bartender hustling hooch paraded behind a shelf of bottles. Already a good number of men and women stood gathered in small groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced around. No one looked his way. So much for the warm greeting. After searching the room one final time, he decided a whiskey would help his outlook on this \"party.\" He stalked over to the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your pleasure, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whiskey and a beer back.\" He leaned his elbow on the black Naugahyde padding that edged the bar and watched the room. It was not his kind of crowd. No loud laughs, no spilled drinks, no angry drunks. Boring. After dumping the whiskey straight into his stomach, he slapped down his shot glass, squeezing the burn, then settled in with his beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind him, he heard a woman\u0027s voice. \"Whiskey. Neat, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to see who had a similar taste in beverages. Whiskey-drinking women were as scarce as hen\u0027s teeth. He wasn\u0027t disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe toyed with the drink set before her, long fingers, short nails, polished. No rings. No wedding band-good. She stood as tall as him, surprising for a woman. Her skin was bronzed, a coppery rich hue that spoke of days under the sun. But what most caught the breath in his throat was her black hair, trailing in lazy curls to her waist. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-3.html","bookId":1526,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM"}
