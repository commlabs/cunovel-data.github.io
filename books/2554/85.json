The sun had sunk a while ago and darkness had settled. Eddie\u0027s BlackBerry had found an Enterprise car rental place but it had taken forever to reach it and do the paperwork. Jack figured he\u0027d probably ruined John Tyleski\u0027s credit by abandoning his last rental on the South Fork, so he\u0027d used a new credit card identity to rent a Pontiac G6. Not much of a car, but that wasn\u0027t a bad thing. It meant no one would pay much attention to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let Eddie and Weezy keep the Crown Vic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he doing the right thing, leaving Weezy and Eddie to go on alone? He wasn\u0027t comfortable with that but ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. Maybe it was just him, but he couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that they were missing something ... something that had to do with that sigil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he turned onto Quakerton he saw a pickup pull out onto 206 and head north. Looked familiar. That guy Tommy? What had he come back for? Something big, covered by a drape, sat on the bed of his truck. Most likely some of his equipment, but Jack had a feeling -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough with these damn feelings. Feelings-feelings-feelings. What the hell? They were driving him crazy. He needed facts, damn it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the Lodge, a pale blob against the darker trees behind it, and not a single light on inside. He parked a block down on the street and walked back. Old Town had fewer streetlights than the newer sections on the other side of the lake, and that was a good thing tonight. He\u0027d taken his lock-pick set and bump keys from the Crown Vic and carried them now, along with a flashlight, plus one of Weezy\u0027s Sharpies and a pad, all in a small backpack slung over a shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went straight to the back door. He\u0027d noted the brand of the door lock before, so he had his Quickset bumps ready. The third one fit and in seconds he was in. Turning on his flashlight for only a second at a time for guidance, he found the basement door ... leaning against a wall. The black rectangle of the doorway gaped before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gut twisted. Not good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiscarding all discretion, he turned on the basement lights and pelted down the stairs. The basement looked different, rearranged since they\u0027d left. He fairly ran to the opening in the floor. The ladder had been pulled out and lay beside it. He lowered it back into the hole and descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sign of the sigil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeart pounding, Jack raced back up the ladder. The sigil was too big to hide, so the only explanation was they\u0027d removed it. That guy Tommy had been leaving Johnson. Had he had the sigil in the back of his truck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was his phone number? Weezy had rattled it off. She\u0027d know. But as he pulled out his phone to call her, he heard her voice in his head reciting the number. Instead of speed-dialing her, he punched in that number. After two rings he reached the voice mail:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve reached Thomas Mulliner Excavating and Land Clearing Service. Leave a number and we\u0027ll call you back as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGot him. Jack left his cell number, said he had to speak to him ASAP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, Tommy was one of the Mulliner clan. The Pinelands were full of them, going back to revolutionary times. Jack wasn\u0027t going to sit around waiting for a call back that might not come till morning. He had to find a Mulliner with an excavating business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe punched in 4-1-1. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-85.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
