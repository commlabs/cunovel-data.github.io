She was a virgin priestess dedicated to the goddess Isis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing a fine linen shift that fell from her waist to her ankles. Above the waist, she wore\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enothing except a deep silver collar strung with beads of amethyst, carnelian, turquoise, and lapis lazuli.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two silver bracelets on her upper arms and two on her wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorning was her favorite time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis morning she carefully placed her offering in front of the statue of Isis. Lotus blossoms, small cakes,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand beer. Then, facing south, she began the chant to wake the goddess up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Awaken, Isis, Mother of the Stars, Great of Magic, Mistress of all the World, Sovereign of her father,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMightier than the gods,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady of the Waters of Life,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowerful of Heart,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsis of the Ten Thousand Names ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA step sounded behind her and she broke off short, feeling startled and annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. Did I disturb you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a woman, a beautiful woman with long black hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not allowed in here,\" Ha-nahkt said sharply. \"Only priests and priestesses...\" Her voice trailed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoff as she looked at the woman more closely. Maybe she is a priestess, she thought. There\u0027s something in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher face....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to talk to you,\" the woman said. Her voice was husky and persuasive, almost mesmerizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very important.\" She smiled and Ha-nahkt felt hairs stir at the back of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she\u0027s a priestess, I bet she\u0027s a priestess of Set. Set was the most evil of all the gods-and one of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emost powerful. Ha-nahkt could sense power in this woman, no question about that. But evil? She wasn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Maya. And what I have to tell you may save your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa-nahkt stood still. Part of her wanted to run from Maya, to go and get her best friend Khet-hetep-\"es.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, better yet, one of the senior priestesses. But another part of her was curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really shouldn\u0027t stop in the middle of the chant,\" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about the stranger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa-nahkt lost her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long moment of silence, and then she said, \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould hear the shake in her own voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, you do. The stranger. Tall, blond, handsome... and with such sad dark eyes. The one you\u0027ve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen meeting on the sly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa-nahkt could feel the shaking take over her whole body. She was a priestess, sworn to the goddess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anyone found she\u0027d been meeting a man. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t worry, little one,\" Maya said and laughed. \"I\u0027m not here to turn you in. Just the opposite, in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efact. I want to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t done anything,\" Ha-nahkt faltered. \"Just kissed. He says he doesn\u0027t want me to leave the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etemple. He isn\u0027t going to stay long. He says he saw me, and he just had to speak to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And no wonder,\" Maya said in a cooing tone. She touched Ha-nahkt\u0027s hair lightly and Ha-nahkt moved\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einstinctively away. \"You\u0027re such a pretty girl. Such unusual coloring for this part of the world. I suppose\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou think you love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do love him,\" Ha-nahkt blurted before she could stop herself. Then she lowered her voice. \"But I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow my duty. He says that in the next world we\u0027ll be together.\" She didn\u0027t want to tell the rest of it, the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremarkable things she\u0027d seen with the stranger, the way she\u0027d recognized him. The way they were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edestined for each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you believed him? Oh, my dear child. You\u0027re so innocent. I suppose that comes from living your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elife in a temple.\" She gazed around thoughtfully, then looked back at Hannah. Her face became grave and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eregretful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate to have to tell you this,\" she said. \"But the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estranger does not love you. The truth is that he\u0027s a very evil man. The truth is that he\u0027s not a man at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s an Ur-Demon and he wants to steal your sa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Isis, Ha-nahkt thought. Sa was the breath of life, the magical force that allowed you to live. She\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheard of demons who wanted to steal it. But she couldn\u0027t believe it of the stranger. He seemed so gentle,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso kind...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" Maya said positively. She glanced at Ha-nahkt sideways. \"And you know it is, if you think\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout it. Why else would he want to taste your blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa-nahkt started and flushed. \"How do you know-?\" She stopped and bit her lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been meeting him at night by the lotus pool, when everyone else is asleep,\" Maya said. \"And I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esuppose you thought it wouldn\u0027t hurt to let him drink a little of your blood. Not much. Just a bit. It was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexciting. But I\u0027m telling you the truth, now-it will hurt you. He\u0027s a demon and he wants you dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe husky, mesmerizing voice went on and on. It was telling all about Ur-Demons who drank blood,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand men and women who could change into animals, and a place called the World of the Night, where\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey all lived. Ha-nahkt\u0027s head began to spin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd her heart shattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiterally. She could feel the jagged pieces of it every time she tried to breathe. A priestess didn\u0027t cry, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etears were forcing themselves out of her closed lids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause she couldn\u0027t deny that the stranger did act a little like an Ur-Demon. Why else would he drink\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblood?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the things she\u0027d seen with him, the feeling of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edestiny... that must have all been magic. He had tricked her with spells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya seemed to have finished her story. \"Do you think you can remember all that?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa-nahkt made a miserable gesture. What did it matter if she remembered it? She only wanted to be left\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa-nahkt glanced up, startled. It was a mistake. Maya\u0027s eyes were strange; they seemed to turn different\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecolors from moment to moment, and once Ha-nahkt met them, she couldn\u0027t look away. She was caught\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein a spell, and she felt her will slipping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" Maya said, and her eyes were deep gold and ancient as a crocodile\u0027s. \"Remember all that. And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremember this. Remember... how he kills you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the strangest thing of all happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt suddenly seemed to Ha-nahkt that she was two people. One of them was her ordinary self. And the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother was a different self, a distant self, who seemed to be looking on from the future. At this moment,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa-nahkt and the future self were seeing different things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa-nahkt saw that Maya was gone and the temple was empty. And then she saw that someone else was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewalking in. A tall figure, with light hair and dark fathomless eyes-the stranger. He smiled at her, walked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoward her with his arms held out. He grasped her with hands that were as strong as a demon\u0027s. Then he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshowed his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe future self saw something else. She saw that Maya never left the temple. She saw Maya\u0027s face and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebody ripple as if they were made of water-and then change. It was as if there were two images, one on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etop of the other. The outward image was of the stranger, but it was Maya underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it. That\u0027s how she did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice came from outside Ha-nahkt, and she didn\u0027t understand it. She didn\u0027t have time to think about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit, either, because the next instant she felt the tearing pain of teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Isis, Goddess of Life, guide me to the other world....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how she did it,\" Hannah breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sitting up on the couch. She knew who she was, and more, she knew who she\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was another of those blinding flashes of illumination. She felt as if she were standing at the end of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecorridor of time and looking back at a hundred different versions of herself. They each looked slightly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edifferent, and they wore different clothes, but they were all her. Her name had been Hanje, Anora, Xiana,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNan Haiane, Honni, Ian, Annette. She had been a warrior, a priestess, a princess, a slave. And right now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe felt she had the strength of all her selves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the far end of the corridor, back where it was misty and blurry and faintly tinted pink and blue, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed to see Hana smiling at her. And then Hana turned and walked away, her task accomplished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah took a deep breath and let it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She did it with illusions,\" she said, hardly aware that she was talking out loud. \"Maya. And she\u0027s done it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebefore, of course. Maybe every time. What do you do with somebody who keeps killing you over and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover? Never letting you live to your seventeenth birthday? Trying to destroy you, not just your life, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour heart... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized that Paul was staring at her. \"You want me to answer that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah shook her head even as she went on talking. \"Goddess-I mean, God-she must hate me. I still\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t understand why. It must be because she wants Thierry herself-or maybe just because she wants\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim miserable. She wants him to know that I\u0027m terrified of him, that I hate him. And she did it. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econvinced me. She convinced my subconscious enough that I started warning myself against him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If any of this is true-which I\u0027m not going to admit for a second, because they would definitely take my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elicense away-then I can tell you one thing,\" Paul said. \"She sounds very, very dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you so happy?\" he asked pathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah glanced at him and laughed. She couldn\u0027t hope to explain it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was more than happy, she was exalted. She was buoyant, ecstatic, over the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry wasn\u0027t evil. She had the confirmation of a hundred selves whispering it to her. Maya was the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenemy, the snake in the garden. Thierry was exactly what he\u0027d told her he was. Someone who had made\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea terrible mistake and had spent millennia paying for it-and searching for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is gentle and kind. He does love me. And we are destined for each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got to find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thought came as an additional bright revelation, but one that made her sit up and go still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no idea how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had he gone? Home. Where was home? She didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could be anywhere in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Hannah whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Hannah, I think we should maybe do some work on this. Talk about it, examine your feelings ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, hush!\" Hannah waved a hand at him. \"She gave me a clue! She didn\u0027t mean to, but she gave me a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclue! She said he had connections with witches in Vegas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God,\" Paul muttered. Then he jumped up. \"Hannah, where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\" She darted back into the office, threw her arms around him, and gave him a kiss. Then,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmiling into his startled face, she said, \"Thank you. Thank you for helping. You\u0027ll never know how much\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou\u0027ve done for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChess blinked, but went on looking at her intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it isn\u0027t fair to ask you without explaining why. But I can\u0027t tell you. It would be dangerous for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just have to ask you to trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChess kept looking at her. The slanted green eyes searched Hannah\u0027s face. Then, without a word, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egot up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah sat on Chess\u0027s crisp white-on-white coverlet and waited. After a few minutes Chess came back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einto the room and settled her own petite self on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" she said, and plunked down a credit card. \"Mom said I could use it to get some things for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egraduation. I figure she\u0027ll understand-maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah threw her arms around her. \"Thank you,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027ll pay it back as soon as I can.\" Then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe burst out, \"How can you be so nice? I\u0027d be yelling to know what was going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am going to yell,\" Chess said, squeezing her back. \"But more than that. I\u0027m going with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah drew back. How could she explain? She knew that by going to Las Vegas she would be putting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher own life in danger. From Maya, certainly. From the Night World, probably. Even from the witches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry had connections with, possibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she couldn\u0027t drag Chess into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got something I want you to hang on to,\" she said. She reached into her canvas bag and pulled out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ean envelope. \"This is for you and for my mom- just in case. If you don\u0027t hear from me by my birthday,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen I want you to open it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you hear me? I\u0027m going with you. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s been going on with you, but I\u0027m not going\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto let you run off on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I can\u0027t take you.\" She caught the glowing cat-eyes and held them. \"Please understand, Chess. It\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething I have to do alone. Besides, I need you here to cover for me, to tell my mom I\u0027m at your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehouse so she doesn\u0027t worry. Okay?\" She reached out and gave Chess a tiny shake. \"Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChess shut her eyes, then nodded. Then she sniffled, her chin trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah hugged her again. \"Thank you,\" she whispered. \"Let\u0027s be best friends forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday morning, instead of going to school, Hannah started for Billings airport. She was driving the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord-her mom had fixed it over the weekend. Her mom thought she was spending the next couple of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edays with Chess to study for finals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was frightening but exhilarating to fly on a plane by herself, going to a city she\u0027d never been to before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the time she was in the air, she was thinking, Closer, closer, closer-and looking at the black rose ring\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon her finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d fished it out of her bedroom wastebasket. Now she turned her hand this way and that to see the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblack gems catch the light. Her chest tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if I can\u0027t find him? she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other fear she didn\u0027t want to admit, even to herself. What if she did find him, and he didn\u0027t want her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanymore? After all, she\u0027d only told him that she hated him a few dozen times and ordered him to stay\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway from her forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t think about that. There\u0027s no point. First I have to track him down, and after that what happens,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airport in Las Vegas was surprisingly small. There were slot machines all over. Hannah collected her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone duffel bag at the luggage carousel and then walked outside. She stood in the warm desert air, trying\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto figure out what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you find witches?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know. She didn\u0027t think they were likely to be listed in the phone book. So she just trusted to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eluck and headed where everybody else was heading-the Strip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a mistake from the beginning, and that afternoon and night were among the worst times in. her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t start off so bad. The Strip was gaudy and glittery, especially as darkness fell. The hotels were so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebizarre and so dazzling that it took Hannah\u0027s breath away. One of them, the Luxor, was shaped like a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egiant black pyramid with a Sphinx in front of it. Hannah stood and watched colored lasers dart from the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSphinx\u0027s eyes and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would Ha-nahkt have thought of that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was something almost sickening about all the lights and the hustling after a while. Something . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. unwholesome. The crowds were so thick, both inside the hotels and out on the street, that Hannah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould hardly move. Everyone seemed to be in a rush-except the people nailed in front of slot machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels... greedy, Hannah decided finally, searching in her mind for the right word. All these people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewant to win free money. All these hotels want to take their money. And of course, the hotels are the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewinners in the end. They\u0027ve built a sort of Venus\u0027 flytrap to lure people here. And some of these people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t look as if they can afford to lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart felt physically heavy and her lungs felt constricted. She wanted Montana and a horizon so far\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway that it pried your mind open. She wanted clean air. She wanted space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even worse than the atmosphere of greed and commercialism was the fact that she wasn\u0027t finding\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eany witches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struck up conversations a few times with desk clerks and waitresses. But when she casually asked if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere were any odd people in town who practiced witchcraft, they looked at her as if she were crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy nine o\u0027clock that night she was dizzy, exhausted, and sick with defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m never going to find them. Which means I\u0027m never going to find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe collapsed on a bench outside the Stardust Hotel, wondering what to do next. Her legs hurt and her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehead was pounding. She didn\u0027t want to spend Chess\u0027s mom\u0027s money on a hotel-but she\u0027d noticed police\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eofficers making people move on if they tried to sleep on the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I come here? I should have put an ad in the paper: \"Desperately Seeking Thierry.\" I should\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave known this wouldn\u0027t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she was thinking it, something about a boy in the crowd caught her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t Thierry. He wasn\u0027t anything like Thierry. Except for the way he moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was that same rippling grace she\u0027d seen in both Thierry and Maya, an easy control of motion that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereminded her of a jungle cat. And his face ... he was almost eerily good-looking in a ragamuffin way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he glanced up toward the Stardust\u0027s tall neon sign, she thought she could see light reflect from his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s one of them. I know it. He\u0027s one of the Night People.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout stopping to think, she jumped up, slung her bag over her shoulder, and followed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t easy. He walked fast and she had to keep dodging tourists. He was headed off the Strip, to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone of the quiet dimly-lit streets that ran parallel to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a whole different world here, just one block away from the glitter and bustle. The hotels were,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmall and in poor repair. The businesses seemed to be mostly pawnshops. Everything had a dingy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edepressed feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt a prickling down her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was now following the only figure on a deserted street. Any minute now, he\u0027d realize she was tailing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim-but what could she do? She didn\u0027t dare lose sight of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy seemed to be leading her into worse and worse areas-sleazy was the word for them, Hannah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought. The streetlights were far apart here with areas of darkness in between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once he took a sharp left turn, seeming to disappear behind a building with a sign that read, Dan\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBail Bonds. Hannah jogged to catch up to him and found herself staring down a narrow alley. It was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eextremely dark. She hesitated a moment, then grimly took a few steps forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the third step, the boy appeared from behind a Dumpster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was facing her, and once again Hannah caught the flash of eyeshine. She stood very still as he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewalked slowly toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You following me or something?\" he asked. He seemed amused. He had a sharp face with an almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epointed chin and dark hair that looked uncombed. He was no taller than Hannah, but his body seemed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etough and wiry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s the Artful Dodger, Hannah thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he reached her, he looked her up and down. His expression was a combination of lechery and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehunger. Gooseflesh blossomed on Hannah\u0027s skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said, trying to make her voice quiet and direct. \"I was following you. I wanted to ask\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou something-I\u0027m looking for someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You found him, baby,\" the boy said. He darted a quick glance around as if to make sure that there was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enobody in the alley with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, before Hannah could say another word, he knocked her into the wall and pinned her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-12.html","bookId":2080,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM"}
