{"id":38800,"no":10,"title":"Part One Chapter 10","content":"That night I found Carlo and to my amazement he told me he\u0027d been in Central City with Dean. \"What did you do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh, we ran around the bars and then Dean stole a car and we drove back down the mountain curves ninety miles an hour.\" \"I didn\u0027t see you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"We didn\u0027t know you were there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Well, man, I\u0027m going to San Francisco.\" \"Dean has Rita lined up for you tonight.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e\"Well, then, I\u0027ll put it off.\" I had no money. I sent my aunt an\n\u003cbr\u003eairmail letter asking her for fifty dollars and said it would be the last money I\u0027d ask; after that she would be getting money back from me, as soon as I got that ship.\n\u003cbr\u003eThen I went to meet Rita Bettencourt and took her back to the apartment. I got her in my bedroom after a long talk in the dark of the front room. She was a nice little girl, simple and true, and tremendous- ly frightened of sex. I told her it was beautiful. I wanted to prove this to her. She let me prove it, but I was too impatient and proved nothing. She sighed in the dark. \"What do you want out of life?\" I asked, and I used to ask that all the time of girls.\n\u003cbr\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"Just wait on tables and try to get along.\" She yawned. I put my hand over her mouth and told her not to yawn. I tried to tell her how excited I was about life and the things we could do\u0026nbsp; together; saying that, and planning to leave Denver in two days. She turned\u0026nbsp; away wearily. We lay on our backs, looking at the ceiling and wondering what God had wrought when He made life so sad. We made vague plans to meet in Frisco.\n\u003cbr\u003eMy moments in Denver were coming to an end, I could feel it when I walked her home, on the way back I stretched out on the grass of an old church with a bunch of hobos, and their talk made me want to get back on that road. Every now and then one would get up and hit a passer-by for a dime. They talked of harvests moving north. It was warm and soft. I\u0026nbsp; wanted\u0026nbsp; to go and get Rita again and tell her a lot more things, and really make love to her this time, and calm her fears about men. Boys and girls in America have such a sad time together; sophistication demands that they\u0026nbsp; submit to sex immediately without proper\u0026nbsp; preliminary\u0026nbsp; talk.\u0026nbsp; Not\u0026nbsp; courting\u0026nbsp; talk--real\u0026nbsp; straight\u0026nbsp; talk\u0026nbsp; about souls, for life is holy and every moment is precious. I heard the Denver and Rio Grande locomotive howling off to the mountains. I wanted to pursue my star further.\n\u003cbr\u003eMajor and I sat sadly talking in the midnight hours. \"Have you ever\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; read\u0026nbsp; iGreen\u0026nbsp; Hills\u0026nbsp; of\u0026nbsp; Africai?\u0026nbsp; It\u0027s\u0026nbsp; Hemingway\u0027s\u0026nbsp; best.\"\u0026nbsp; We wished each other luck. We would meet in Frisco. I saw Rawlins under a dark tree in the\u0026nbsp; street. \"Good-by, Ray. When do we meet again?\" I went to look for Carlo and Dean--nowhere to be found. Tim Gray shot his hand up in the air and said, \"So you\u0027re leaving, Yo.\" We called each other Yo. \"Yep,\" I said. The next few days I wandered around Denver.\n\u003cbr\u003eIt seemed to me every bum on Larimer Street maybe was Dean Moriarty\u0027s father; Old Dean Moriarty they called him, the Tinsmith. I went in the Windsor Hotel, where father and son had lived and where one night\u0026nbsp; Dean was frightfully waked up by the legless man on the rollerboard\u0026nbsp; who\u0026nbsp; shared\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; room\u0026nbsp; with\u0026nbsp; them;\u0026nbsp; he\u0026nbsp; came\u0026nbsp; thundering across the floor on his terrible wheels to touch the boy. I saw the little midget newspaper-selling woman with the short legs, on the corner of Curtis and 15th. I walked around the sad honkytonks of Curtis Street; young kids in jeans and red shirts;\u0026nbsp; peanut shells,\u0026nbsp; movie marquees, shooting\u0026nbsp; parlors.\u0026nbsp; Beyond\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; glittering\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; street\u0026nbsp; was\u0026nbsp; darkness,\u0026nbsp; and beyond the darkness the West. I had to go.\n\u003cbr\u003eAt dawn I found Carlo. I read some of his enormous journal, slept there, and in the morning, drizzly and gray, tall, six-foot Ed Dun- kel came in\u0026nbsp; with Roy Johnson, a handsome kid, and Tom Snark, the clubfooted\u0026nbsp; poolshark.\u0026nbsp; They\u0026nbsp; sat\u0026nbsp; around\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; listened\u0026nbsp; with\u0026nbsp; abashed smiles as Carlo Marx read them his apocalyptic, mad poetry. I slumped in my chair, finished.\u0026nbsp; \"Oh ye Denver birds!\" cried Carlo. We all filed out and went up a typical cobbled Denver alley between incinerators smoking slowly. \"I used to roll my hoop up this alley,\" Chad King had told me. I wanted to see him do it; I\u0026nbsp; wanted to see Denver ten years ago when they were all children, and in\u0026nbsp; the sunny cherry blossom morning of springtime in the Rockies rolling their hoops up the joyous alleys full of promise--the whole gang. And Dean, ragged and dirty, prowling by himself in his preoccupied frenzy.\n\u003cbr\u003eRoy Johnson and I walked in the drizzle; I went to Eddie\u0027s girl\u0027s house to get back my wool plaid shirt, the shirt of Shelton, Nebraska. It was there,\u0026nbsp; all\u0026nbsp; tied up, the whole enormous sadness of a shirt. Roy Johnson said he\u0027d meet me in Frisco. Everybody was going to Frisco. I went and found my\u0026nbsp; money had arrived. The sun came out, and Tim Gray rode a trolley with\u0026nbsp; me\u0026nbsp; to the bus station. I bought my ticket to San Fran, spending half of the\u0026nbsp; fifty, and got on at two o\u0027clock in the afternoon. Tim Gray waved good-by. The bus rolled out of the storied, eager Denver streets. \"By God, I gotta come back and see what else will happen!\" I promised. In a last-minute phone call Dean said he and Car- lo might join me on the Coast; I pondered this, and realized I hadn\u0027t talked to Dean for more than five minutes in the whole time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/17/165.html","bookId":295,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:50:45 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:50:45 AM"}
