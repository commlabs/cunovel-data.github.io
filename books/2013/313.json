The altar, buried beneath rubble, the rubble grinding and shifting, a thousand minute adjustments ensnaring Mael-he could not move, could no longer even so much as cry out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErrant! You bastard!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy have you done this to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Errant had never shown much interest in lingering over his triumphs. He was nowhere close, and even if he had been, he would not have answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA player had been removed from the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the game played on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the throne room of the Eternal Domicile, Rhulad Sengar, Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, sat alone, sword in one hand. In wavering torchlight he stared at nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside his mind was another throne room, and in that place he was not alone. His brothers stood before him; and behind them, his father, Tomad, and his mother, Uruth. In the shadows along the walls stood Udinaas, Nisall, and the woman Rhulad would not name who had once been Fear’s wife. And, close to the locked doors, one more figure, too lost in the dimness to make out. Too lost by far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBinadas bowed his head. ‘I have failed, Emperor,’ he said. ‘I have failed, my brother.’ He gestured downward and Rhulad saw the spear transfixing Binadas’s chest. ‘A Toblakai, ghost of our ancient wars after the fall of the Kechra. Our wars on the seas. He returned to slay me. He is Karsa Orlong, a Teblor, a Tartheno Toblakai, Tarthenal, Fenn-oh, they have many names now, yes. I am slain, brother, yet I did not die for you.’ Binadas looked up then and smiled a dead man’s smile. ‘Karsa waits for you. He waits.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear took a single step forward and bowed. Straightening, he fixed his heavy gaze on Rhulad-who whimpered and shrank back into his throne. ‘Emperor. Brother. You are not the child I nurtured. You are no child I have nurtured. You betrayed us at the Spar of Ice. You betrayed me when you stole my betrothed, my love, when you made her with child, when you delivered unto her such despair that she took her own life.’ As he spoke his dead wife walked forward to join him, their hands clasping. Fear said, ‘I stand with Father Shadow now, brother, and I wait for you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhulad cried out, a piteous sound that echoed in the empty chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull, his pate pale where his hair had once been, his eyes the eyes of the Shorn-empty, unseen by any, eyes that could not be met by those of any other Tiste Edur. Eyes of alone. He raised the spear in his hands, and Rhulad saw the crimson gleam on that shaft, on the broad iron blade. ‘I led warriors in your name, brother, and they are now all dead. All dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I returned to you, brother, when Fear and Binadas could not. To beg for your soul, your soul of old, Rhulad, for the child, the brother you had once been.’ He lowered the spear, leaned on it. ‘You drowned me, chained to stone, while the Rhulad I sought hid in the darkness of your mind. But he will hide no longer.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the gloom of the doors, the vague figure moved forward, and Rhulad on his throne saw himself. A youth, weaponless, unblooded, his skin free of coins, his skin smooth and clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We stand in the river of Sengar blood,’ Trull said. ‘And we wait for you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stop!’ Rhulad shrieked. ‘Stop!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Truth,’ said Udinaas, striding closer, ‘is remorseless, Master. Friend?’ The slave laughed. ‘You were never my friend, Rhulad. You held my life in your hand-either hand, the empty one or the one with the sword, makes no difference. My life was yours, and you thought I had opened my heart to you. Errant take me, why would I do that? Look at my face, Rhulad. This is a slave’s face. No more memorable than a clay mask. This flesh on my bones? It works limbs that are naught but tools. I held my hands in the sea, Rhulad, until all feeling went away. All life, gone. From my once-defiant grasp.’ Udinaas smiled. ‘And now, Rhulad Sengar, who is the slave?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I stand at the end of the chains. The end but one. One set of shackles. Here, do you see? I stand, and I wait for you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNisall spoke, gliding forward naked, motion like a serpent’s in candle-light. ‘I spied on you, Rhulad. Found out your every secret and I have them with me now, like seeds in my womb, and soon my belly will swell, and the monsters will emerge, one after another. Spawn of your seed, Rhulad Sengar. Abominations one and all. And you imagined this to be love? I was your whore. The coin you dropped in my hand paid for my life, but it wasn’t enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I stand where you will never find me. I, Rhulad, do not wait for you.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-313.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
