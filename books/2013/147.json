Water she licked from dew-laden grasses, the cupped holes of deer and elk tracks in basins, and once she found a spring, almost hidden by thick brush in which flitted hundreds of tiny birds. It had been their chittering songs that had drawn her attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn eternity of running later, she had fallen. And found no strength to rise once more, to resume the wondrous journey through this glowing land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight then stole upon her, and not long after came the four-legged people. They wore furs smelling of wind and dust, and they gathered close, lying down, sharing the warmth of their thick, soft cloaks. There were children among them, tiny babes that crawled as did their parents, squirming and snuggling up against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when they fed on milk, so did Stayandi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four-legged people were as mute as she was, until they began their mournful cries, when night was at its deepest; crying-she knew-to summon the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stayed with her, guardians with their gifts of warmth and food. After the milk, there was meat. Crushed, mangled carcasses-mice, shrews, a headless snake-she ate all they gave her, tiny bones crunching in her mouth, damp fur and chewy skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis too seemed timeless, a foreverness. The grown-ups came and went. The children grew burlier, and she now crawled with them when it was time to wander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the bear appeared and rushed towards them, she was not afraid. It wanted the children, that much was obvious, but the grown-ups attacked and drove it off. Her people were strong, fearless. They ruled this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil one morning she awoke to find herself alone. Forcing herself to her hind legs, helpless whimpering coming from her throat in jolts of pain, she scanned the land in all directions-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd saw the giant. Bare above the waist, the deep hue of sun-darkened skin almost entirely obscured beneath white paint-paint that transformed his chest, shoulders and face into bone. His eyes, as he walked closer, were black pits in the caked mask skull. He carried weapons: a long spear, a sword with a broad, curved blade. The fur of the four-legged people was wrapped about his hips, and the small but deadly knives strung in a necklace about the warrior’s neck, they too belonged to her people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrightened, angry, she bared her teeth at the stranger, even as she cowered in the fold of a small hummock-nowhere to run, knowing he could catch her effortlessly. Knowing that yet another of her worlds had shattered. Fear was her bronze box, and she was trapped, unable to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her for a time, cocking his head as she snapped and snarled. Then slowly crouched down until his eyes were level with her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembering… things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were not kind eyes, but they were-she knew-like her own. As was his hairless face beneath that deathly paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had run away, she now recalled, until it seemed her fleeing mind had outstripped her flesh and bone, had darted out into something unknown and unknowable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this savage face, across from her, was slowly bringing her mind back. And she understood, now, who the four-legged people were, what they were. She remembered what it was to stand upright, to run with two legs instead of four. She remembered an encampment, the digging of cellar pits, the first of the sod-walled houses. She remembered her family-her brother-and the night the demons came to steal it all away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a time of mutual silent regard, he straightened, settled the weapons and gear about himself once more, then set out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, then rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, at a distance, she followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked towards the rising sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratching at the scarred, gaping hole where one eye had been, Toc watched the children running back and forth as the first cookfires were lit. Elders hobbled about with iron pots and wrapped foodstuffs-they were wiry, weathered folk, but days of marching had dulled the fire in their eyes, and more than a few snapped at the young ones who passed too close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw Redmask, trailed by Masarch and Natarkas and another bearing the red face-paint, appear near the area laid out for the war leader’s yurt. Seeing Toc, Redmask approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tell me, Toc Anaster, you flanked our march on the north this day-did you see tracks?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What sort do you mean?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask turned to Natarkas’s companion. ‘Torrent rode to the south. He made out a trail that followed an antelope track-a dozen men on foot-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Or more,’ the one named Torrent said. ‘They were skilled.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not Letherii, then,’ Toe guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Moccasined,’ Redmask replied, his tone betraying slight irritation at Torrent’s interruption. ‘Tall, heavy.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-147.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
