The steady Two Rivers man glanced at Elayne, and his eyes opened wider, as if he was surprised to see her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Majesty\", Tam said. \"I was told you were still out on the battlefield\". He turned back to Bashere, who grew red-faced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn’t want you going to her with—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough!\" Elayne said, riding Moonshadow between them. Why was Tam of all people arguing with Bashere? \"Bashere, the second Trolloc army is almost upon us\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\", Bashere said, breathing deeply. \"I just had word. Light, this is a disaster, Elayne. We need to pull out through gateways\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We exhausted the Kinswomen on our push up here, Bashere\", Elayne said. \"Most can barely channel enough now to warm a teacup, let alone make a gateway\". Light, and I couldn’t warm the tea. She forced her voice to remain firm. \"That was part of the plan\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . That’s right\", Bashere said. He looked at the map. \"Let me think. The city. We’ll retreat into the city\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And give the Shadowspawn time to rest, gather together, and assault us?\" Elayne asked. \"That’s what they’re probably trying to force us to do\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t see any other choice\", Bashere said. \"The city is our only hope\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The city?\" Talmanes said, hurrying up, panting. \"You can’t be talking about pulling back into the city\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Elayne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Majesty, our infantry have just managed to surround a Trolloc army! They’re going at it tooth and claw! We have no reserves left, and our cavalry is exhausted. We’d never manage to disengage from that contest without sustaining heavy losses. And then our survivors would be holed up in the city, trapped between two armies of the Shadow\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Light\", Elayne whispered. \"It’s like they planned it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they did\", Tam said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this again\", Bashere bellowed. He didn’t seem like himself at all, though she knew that Saldaeans could have tempers. Bashere almost seemed like a different person. His wife had stepped up to his side, arms folded, and both confronted Tam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have your say, Tam\", Elayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I—\" Bashere began, but Elayne held up a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knew, Your Majesty\", Tam said softly. \"Its the only thing that makes sense. He hasn’t been using the Aiel to scout\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Elayne said. \"Of course he has. I read the scout reports\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reports are faked, or at least tampered with\", Tam said. \"I talked to Bael. He said that none of his Aiel had been sent on scouting duty the last few days of our march. He said he thought my men had been doing it, but they hadn’t. I talked to Arganda, who thought Whitecloaks had been doing it, but Galad said that it was the Band\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn’t us\", Talmanes said, frowning. \"None of my men have been used for scout details\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes turned to Bashere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\", Elayne asked, \"has been watching our rear, Bashere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . \". He looked up, anger flaring again. \"I have the reports somewhere! I showed them to you, and you approved them!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s all too perfect\", Elayne said. She felt a sudden chill, right at the middle point of her back. It spread down through her body, a wave of icy wind blowing through her veins. They’d been trapped, perfectly. Channelers run to exhaustion, soldiers committed to a close-fought battle, a second army left to approach in secret a day ahead of where falsified reports said they would be . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavram Bashere was a Darkfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bashere is relieved of duty\", she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But—\" he sputtered. His wife put her hand on his arm, looking at Elayne with fire in her eyes. Bashere leveled a finger at Tam. \"I did send the Two Rivers men! Tam al’Thor must be the culprit. He’s trying to distract you, Your Majesty!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talmanes\", Elayne said, feeling cold to the bone. \"Have five Redarms put Lord Bashere and his wife under guard\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBashere let out a string of curses. Elayne was surprised at how calm she felt. Her emotions were deadened. She watched him be dragged away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t time for this. \"Gather our commanders\", Elayne said to the others. \"Galad, Arganda . . . Finish off that Trolloc army above the city! Spread the word to the men. Throw everything we have into this battle! If we can’t crush the Trollocs in the next hour, we die here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talmanes, those dragons can’t be much use against the Trollocs now that they’re surrounded—you risk hitting our men. Have Aludra move all of the dragon carts up on the tallest hill to pound the new enemy coming up from the south. Tell the Ogier to make a cordon around the hill the dragons are on; we can’t have them damaged. Tam, put your Two Rivers bowmen on the surrounding hills. And have the Legion of the Dragon form up the front lines, crossbowmen in the lead, heavy cavalry behind. Light willing, that will be enough to buy us time to finish off the surrounded Trollocs\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be close. Light! If that second army surrounded her men . . . Elayne took a deep breath, then opened herself to saidar. The One Power flooded into her, though she could hold only a trickle. She could act as if she weren’t exhausted, but her body knew the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would lead them anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 27\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriendly Fire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGareth Bryne strode through the camp he had set up on the Arafellin side, several hundred paces on the Kandor border east of the ford, ignoring soldiers who tried to salute him. Siuan hastened at one side, a messenger delivering reports at his other. They were trailed by a flurry of guards and attendants carrying maps, ink and paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole burning place shook with explosions of the Power. Crashing racket and calamity . . . it was like being in the middle of a rockslide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d stopped being bothered by the scent of smoke. It was pervasive. At least some of the fires were put out; those Seanchan channelers had set up by the river and were drawing out streams of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, a rack of polearms tumbled to the ground in a clatter as a surge of the One Power hit in the camp nearby. He stumbled, and earth sprayed around him and Siuan, pebbles clattering against his helmet and breastplate. \"Keep talking, man\", he snapped at Holcom, the messenger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er, yes, my Lord\". The spindly man had a face like a horse. \"The Aes Sedai on the Red, Green, and Blue hilltops are all holding.
