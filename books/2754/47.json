She’s right about us. We were friends first. Always friends. Not understanding a relationship that close, it got muddled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flashes a genuine smile and I smile back. Yeah, Beth and I, we can do friends. A few feet behind her and hanging with what I assume is Logan’s entire baseball team, Beth’s guy, Ryan, watches us with his arms folded over his chest. I tip my chin at him to let him know I’m good, and he tilts his head in acceptance. That’ll probably be the longest conversation the two of us ever have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah leans into us so that we form our own circle. “Do you know what he’s been doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth shrugs. “He’s always liked to drive fast. Stupidity caught up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stupidity did catch up, but not in that way.” Noah’s dark eyes snap to mine and he rolls his shoulders back. He’s looking for a fight and my body reacts. My head continues to throb like a bad bass line, but if Noah wants to have it out, we will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Say what you gotta say, Noah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa.” Beth places an arm between us. “He just got out of the hospital. This is the first time I’ve been with the two of you in months. You are not ruining this for me by fighting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah and I stand toe to toe and neither one of us flinch. “Do you want to tell her, Isaiah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Naw, man. It sounds like you’ve got all the answers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping his eyes locked on me, Noah drops the bomb. “He owes money to Eric.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence between the three of us builds pressure in my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much,” asks Beth in a low tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enough,” I answer. Too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” she demands. “Why did you street race?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah finally looks away. “Because I told him I was moving into the dorms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noah!” Beth grabs hold of the arm of his jacket. “What the hell? You promised both of us a year ago that you would never leave us behind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you here?” Noah asks Beth. “You promised you’d stay away from Louisville.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth’s head tilts in her familiar pissed-off way. “Logan’s my friend. So is Isaiah. Explain why you’re bailing on us? You break a promise to him, you break it to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I kept my promise to you,” says Noah. “Who do you think told Shirley to call your uncle when you got arrested last fall? Do you think the lush figured it out on her own? I reminded her that your Uncle Scott had money and would be able to help with bail. As for Isaiah, I can’t help him if he owes people like Eric.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth pales. “You...you did that to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah lowers himself to stare into her eyes. “Don’t stand there acting like I ratted you out. You’re better off and you know it. You’re happy. You’ve told me that yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth clenches her hands together. “But it should have been my choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beth...you never saw your choices.” And his eyes flash to me. “And neither do you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gesture with palms open. “Show me my rich uncle, Noah, and I’m game. Wait...my bad...out of the three of us, I’m the only trash here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah shoves a finger into my chest, daring me into a physical confrontation. “You’re so bent on believing what you want people to see that you forget that you’re more. Keep saying it. Keep saying you’re trash and take the fucking swing at me, but if you do, know I’m hitting back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head is so close to Noah’s that I feel the heat of his anger, or maybe it’s mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to fight, man?” I ask. “Is that what you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, bro. But I do want to kick some sense into your head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround us, several guys leap to their feet, calling at us to back down. Most of them wear jock jackets like Logan’s. One has the balls to touch me. Ryan, Beth’s guy, has the balls to touch Noah. “Bring it down a notch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth smacks Ryan’s arm. “Let him go, Ryan.” She turns to the one with his arm on me. “You, too, Chris. This is how the two of them communicate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyan yanks on the bill of his baseball cap. “This is a fight, Beth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolls her eyes. “It’s a family reunion. A fucked-up one, but how else would we do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah cracks his crazy-ass grin with her words and chuckles. I pop the tension out of my neck, and Noah flexes his shoulders to relax. “You should have told me you had problems.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. “I got problems.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah pats my back. “Then we’ll figure it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in a while, the pressure inside of me dips. “Thanks, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the emergency room opens. On crutches, Logan hobbles out of the E.R. with a man who must be his dad by his side. Some of the guys near us clap or yell out Logan’s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time since waking up from the crash, I feel like I can take a lungful of air. Logan acknowledges his friends as he and his two poles maneuver through the mass of people. There’s no mistake that he’s making his way to me, Beth, Chris and Ryan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris is the first to speak. “You’re a moron, Junior.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan pops that insane grin. “But it was a hell of a rush.” He nods at me. “You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stitches.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Same with me.” He kicks out his right leg. “Twenty-four stitches on my thigh. Nothing broken.” Logan loses the spark. “I’m out for a bit.” He’s referring to helping with the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s good,” I say. “Thanks, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t thank me. You still have to fix my ’57 Chevy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan turns to Ryan and the pair embrace. Beth told me they’d been friends since elementary school. I can only imagine their bond. Beth wraps her arms around me. “Thanks for being my friend again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hug her back. “No problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Isaiah,” says Logan. “Wasn’t that Rachel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 64\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eISAIAH HUGGED BETH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth—the strong girl, the beautiful girl, the girl who twisted Isaiah in knots. He smiled at her. He hugged her. And they looked perfect together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve watched Abby and Isaiah for weeks, and never once has he touched her, much less hugged her. And Isaiah doesn’t smile easily. It’s a rare gift and he gave it to her. Our fight must have opened his eyes. The crash must have revealed his true feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his feelings aren’t for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yank my keys out of my purse. They fall through my fingers and clank on the blacktop. Abby, I should go back for Abby, but I can’t stay. She went to pester a nurse for news on Logan and never returned. Isaiah can drive her home. Or Noah can. Or Beth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll people who belong together. I don’t belong in their world. I’m weak. They’re strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth is strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snatch the keys off the ground, and they clink together in my hands. I’m shaking, and it’s not because of the chill in the evening air. The guy I fell in love with never loved me. Never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rachel!” Isaiah calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance over my shoulder, gripping the keys tighter in my hand. My breathing hitches. I can’t do it. I can’t hear him say the words. Not with the memory of him holding her so fresh. Not with her probably observing through the glass door. A girl like her would enjoy watching me break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thoughts become a distorted mess, and my stomach hollows out as if I’ve been pushed over a ravine. I feel the sickening weightlessness like I’m falling, my arms flailing to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should run, but I’m paralyzed by the sight of him. Even moving slowly, Isaiah possesses the prowess of a panther. His muscles pronounced in the easy way he strides. The set, determined gaze on me as his prey. This only proves how weak I am. Like the animal on the verge of being devoured in the wild, I stand here stunned by his dangerous beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah touches me. His warm palm to my face. A soft slide of his thumb. My body has memorized the motion. I lean into his hand and close my eyes. I’ll miss this. I’ll miss everything about him. A tear escapes and creates a wet trail down my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah has always been gentle, and he is again as he wipes it away. “Why did you leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundreds of pounds of weight stack on top of my chest, restricting air. I open my eyes, not daring to meet his stare. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some stitches and bruises, but yeah, I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Logan?” I ask with as much strength as I can muster. I fight the tingling in my blood, a reaction to the shortage of oxygen. I have seconds before I lose control. Breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stitches, too. But fine. Rachel, look at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause his hand on my cheek prods me to face him, because I’ve hardly ever been able to defy him when he speaks to me in such a deep, soothing voice...my eyes rise to meet his. Confusion and hurt swirl in a murky storm in his gray eyes. I’d do anything if that pain was for me, but it’s not. It can’t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to hear his words, not yet, so I ask, “Your car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head drops as he presses his hands to his face. “Totaled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain for him, pain for me, rips at my heart. Another tear escapes. The car was his—a part of his soul. The sorrow he must feel—there has to be a better word than mourning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYearning to touch him, longing to comfort him, my fingers instinctively brush against his temple. Isaiah takes my hand and knots our fingers together, squeezing a little too tight. “This is why I didn’t want the system in your car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re back to this—so easily. His words are a sandblaster against my soul, decimating my insides, crushing my bones, leaving me as a completely empty shell. “Because your car, your life, is worth less?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he answers with stubborn resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hospital doors open, and Beth steps onto the sidewalk. My throat thickens, and the warning contortion of my stomach tells me my time is up. I yank my hand from his. “She’s waiting for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glances over his shoulder, and I take advantage by fleeing. Quickly. Turning into the maze of cars. Hoping to disappear. Words fly in my head—all related, yet not; all tangible, yet slipping through my fingers: Eric and debt and Isaiah and love and Beth and strength and weakness...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd my mother and my brothers and my father and Colleen...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of us dominoes on a board where one event results in chaos. One tip of a piece and everything scatters. There’s no control. Like everyone else, I’m a piece to be overturned. I will never control my destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand grabs at my coat, jerking it off as heat consumes me and chokes my neck. At the intersection of four parked cars, I fall to my knees and convulse with the first dry heave. Searing pain cuts through my throat and I become light-headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rachel!” Isaiah lifts me upright, wiping my hair from my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No hospital.” They can’t know...they can’t know...they can’t... “Promise they won’t know....” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crash-into-you-pushing-the-limits-3/page-47.html","bookId":2754,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM"}
