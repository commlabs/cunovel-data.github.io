I expected it to be Lissa, but a sleepy check of our bond showed that she was still fast asleep. Puzzled, I staggered out of the bed and opened the door. A Moroi girl I didn\u0027t recognize handed me some folded clothes with a note attached. I wondered if I should tip her or something, but she left too quickly for me to react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back on my bed and unfolded the clothing. Black slacks, white blouse, and a black jacket. It was the same ensemble that the other guardians wore around here, and it was in my size. Wow. I was about to become part of the team. A slow grin spread over my face, and I opened the note. It was in Dimitri\u0027s writing: Wear your hair up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grin stayed on my face. A lot of female guardians cut their hair to show off their molnija marks. I\u0027d reluctantly considered it once, and Dimitri had told me not to. He loved my hair and had told me to wear it up. The way he\u0027d said it back then had given me chills, just like now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, I was on my way to the trial with Lissa, Christian, and Eddie. Someone had rustled up a black-and-white outfit for Eddie too, and I think we both kind of felt like kids playing dress-up with their parents\u0027 clothing. My cropped jacket and stretchy blouse were actually pretty cute, and I wondered if I\u0027d be able to bring these back with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe courtroom was over in the large, ornate building we\u0027d passed upon arrival. Walking through its halls, I saw a mix of the old and the new. Outside, it was all arched windows and stone spires. Inside, it was a hub of modern activity. People worked in offices with flat-screen monitors. Elevators led to upper floors. Yet, despite that, a few antique touches could still be found. Sculptures on pedestals. Chandeliers in the halls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe courtroom itself had beautiful murals that stretched from floor to ceiling, and in the front of the room, seals from all the royal families hung on the walls. Lissa stopped as we walked in, her eyes falling on the Dragomir dragon. King of the beasts. A sea of conflicting emotions swirled within her as she stared at the seal and felt the full weight of being the only one left to carry on her name. Pride to be part of that family. Fear that she wouldn\u0027t be good enough to live up to the name. Giving her a gentle nudge, I urged her on toward our seats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seating was split by an aisle down the middle of the room. We sat at the front of the right-hand section. There were still several minutes to go before proceedings began, but the room wasn\u0027t very full yet. I suspected that wouldn\u0027t change, due to the secrecy surrounding what had happened with Victor. A judge sat at the front, but there was no jury. An elevated seat on one side of the room marked where the queen would sit when she arrived. She would be the one who made the ultimate decision. That was how it worked with royal criminal cases. I pointed it out to Lissa. \"Let\u0027s hope that she\u0027s against him. Looks like she\u0027ll be the only one making the decision.\" Lissa frowned. \"Not having a jury feels kind of weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because we spent so much time around humans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Maybe. I don\u0027t know. Just seems like there\u0027s a lot of room for corruption.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yeah. But this is Victor we\u0027re talking about.\" Moments later, Prince Victor Dashkov himself entered the courtroom. Or, rather, just Victor Dashkov did. He\u0027d been stripped of his title when he\u0027d been imprisoned. It had gone to the next oldest person in the Dashkov family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear shot through Lissa, and the little color that was in her cheeks completely disappeared. Mingled with that fear was an emotion I hadn\u0027t expected: regret. Before he\u0027d kidnapped her, Victor had been like an uncle to her - that was even how she\u0027d referred to him. She\u0027d loved him, and he\u0027d betrayed her. I put my hand over hers. \"Easy,\" I murmured. \"It\u0027s going to be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes, narrowed and cunning, looked around the courtroom as though it were a party. He had that same unconcerned look he\u0027d had while talking to Dimitri and me. I felt my lips curl into a sneer. A red haze tinged my vision, and I worked hard to be as serene as the other guardians in the room. He finally focused on Lissa, and she flinched at seeing the same eye color she and others of her family had. When he nodded a sort of greeting to her, I felt my control snap. Before I could actually do anything, I felt new words in my mind - Lissa\u0027s. Breathe, Rose. Just breathe. It looked like we were going to have to rely on each other to get through this. A heartbeat later, Victor was walking again, off to take his seat on the left side of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said to her, once he was gone. \"It\u0027s like you can read my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said gently. \"I could just feel your hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at where I\u0027d put my hand over hers. I\u0027d done it to comfort her and had ended up clenching her fingers in my own agitation. \"Yikes,\" I said, jerking away and hoping I hadn\u0027t broken her bones. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen Tatiana\u0027s entrance followed his, which distracted me and helped calm my dark feelings. We all stood when she appeared and then knelt. It was all kind of archaic, but it was a custom the Moroi had held onto over the years. We didn\u0027t rise until she took her seat, and then the rest of us were able to sit too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trial started. One by one, those who had witnessed the events with Victor gave their account of what they\u0027d seen. Largely, this involved the guardians who had pursued Lissa when Victor had taken her away and who had subsequently been part of the raid on Victor\u0027s hideout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri was the last of the guardians to go. On the surface, his testimony wasn\u0027t much different than theirs. They\u0027d all been part of the rescue squad, but his part in the story had begun a little earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was with my student, Rose Hathaway,\" he said. \"She shares a bond with the princess and was the first to sense what had happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor\u0027s lawyer - I couldn\u0027t even imagine how they\u0027d gotten anyone to represent him - glanced at some papers and then looked back up at Dimitri. \"Based on the events, it sounds like there was a delay between when she discovered that and when you alerted the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri nodded, his mask of composure never slipping. \"She couldn\u0027t act on it because Mr. Dashkov had inflicted a charm on her, one that caused her to attack me.\" He spoke the words so levelly, it amazed me. Not even the lawyer seemed to notice anything. Only I could see - or maybe it was just because I knew him - how much it hurt for Dimitri to lie. Oh, he wanted to protect us - wanted to protect me in particular -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;which was why he was doing this. But it killed a piece of him to stand up there, under oath, and lie. Dimitri was not perfect, no matter how much I thought he was some days, but he always tried to be truthful. Today he couldn\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Dashkov works with earth magic, and some who use that power and are strong in compulsion can influence our base instincts,\" continued Dimitri. \"In this case, he affected her anger and violence through an object.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff to my left, I heard a sound - like someone choking on their own laughter. The judge, an elderly but fierce Moroi woman, glared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Dashkov, please respect the decorum of this courtroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor, still smiling, waved his hands in apology. \"I\u0027m terribly sorry, Your Honor and Your Majesty. Something in Guardian Belikov\u0027s testimony just tickled my fancy, that\u0027s all. It won\u0027t happen again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held my breath, waiting for the blow to fall. It didn\u0027t. Dimitri finished his statement, and then Christian was called up. His part was short. He\u0027d been with Lissa when she\u0027d been taken and had been knocked out. His contribution was being able to ID some of Victor\u0027s guardians as the kidnappers. Once Christian sat down, it was my turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked up, hoping I looked calm in front of all those eyes - and in front of Victor. In fact, I went out of my way to not look at him at all. As I said my name and gave my oath to tell the truth, I suddenly felt the full force of what Dimitri must have experienced. I was standing before all these people, swearing I\u0027d be honest, but I would lie in an instant if the lust charm came up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy version was pretty straightforward. I had details to offer from before the night of the kidnapping, like about when Victor had laid his sick traps to test Lissa\u0027s power. Otherwise, my story lined up with Dimitri\u0027s and the other guardians\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d said before that I could lie well, and I brushed over the \"attack\" charm part with such ease that no one paid any attention. Except Victor. Despite my refusal to look at him, I inadvertently glanced in his direction when I mentioned the charm. His eyes bored into me, and a small smirk sat on his lips. His smugness, I realized, was more than just because he knew I was lying. It was also because he actually knew the precise truth - and the look he gave me told me that he had that power over me and Dimitri, the power to ruin everything for us in front of all these people - no matter what Dimitri had threatened. All the while, I kept my face calm enough to make Dimitri proud, but inside my chest, my heart thudded loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed to last forever, but I knew I was only on the stand for a few minutes. I finished, sagging with relief that Victor hadn\u0027t called me out, and then it was Lissa\u0027s turn. As the victim, she offered the first new perspective thus far, and everyone there grew caught up in her story. It was compelling; no one had ever heard anything like it. I also realized that, without even trying, Lissa was using her spirit-induced charisma. I think it came from the same place compulsion did. People were enraptured and sympathetic. When Lissa described the torture Victor had put her through to force her to heal him, I saw faces go pale with shock. Even Tatiana\u0027s stern mask faltered a little, though whether she felt pity or just simple surprise, I couldn\u0027t say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most amazing thing, though, was how calmly Lissa managed to deliver the story. On the outside, she was steady and beautiful. But as she spoke the words, describing exactly how Victor\u0027s henchman had tortured her, she relived the pain and terror of that night. The guy had been an air user, and he\u0027d toyed with that element, sometimes taking it away so she couldn\u0027t breathe and at other times smothering her with it. It had been horrible, and I\u0027d experienced it right along with her. In fact, I experienced it with her again now as she spoke about the events on the stand. Each painful detail was still etched in her mind, the pain echoing back to both of us. We were both relieved when her testimony finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it was Victor\u0027s turn. From the look on his face, you never would have guessed he was on trial. He wasn\u0027t angry or outraged. He wasn\u0027t contrite. He didn\u0027t plead. He looked like we were all hanging out somewhere, like he had nothing in the world to worry about. Somehow, that made me that much angrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven when answering, he spoke as though he made perfect sense. When the prosecuting lawyer asked why he\u0027d done what he had, he looked at her as though she were crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, I had no choice,\" he said pleasantly. \"I was dying. No one was going to condone me openly experimenting with the princess\u0027s powers. What would you have done in my place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawyer ignored that. She was having a hard time keeping the disgust off of her face. \"And you found coaxing your own daughter into turning Strigoi also necessary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in the courtroom shifted uncomfortably. One of the most awful things about Strigoi was that they were made, not born. A Strigoi could force a human, a dhampir, or a Moroi into becoming Strigoi if the Strigoi drank the victim\u0027s blood and then fed Strigoi blood back to the victim. It didn\u0027t matter if the victim wanted it or not, and once she became Strigoi, she lost all sense of her old, moral self. She embraced becoming a monster and killing others to survive. Strigoi converted others if they found someone they thought would strengthen their ranks. Sometimes they did it just out of cruelty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other way a Strigoi could be made was if a Moroi willingly chose to kill another person during feeding, destroying all the magic and life within themselves. Christian\u0027s parents had done that because they\u0027d wanted to be immortal, no matter the cost. Victor\u0027s daughter Natalie had done it because he had talked her into it. The extra strength and speed she\u0027d gotten from being a Strigoi had helped her free him, and he\u0027d felt his goals were worth the sacrifice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Victor showed no remorse. His answer was simple. \"Natalie made that decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you say that about everyone you used to meet your ends? Guardian Belikov and Miss Hathaway had no say in what you made them do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor chuckled. \"Well, that\u0027s a matter of opinion. I honestly don\u0027t think they minded. But if you have time after this case, Your Honor, you might want to consider trying a statutory rape case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze. He\u0027d done it. He\u0027d really done it. I expected everyone in the room to turn and point at Dimitri and me. No one even looked in our direction, though. Most people were giving Victor appalled looks. I realized that was exactly what Victor had known would happen. He just wanted to tease us; he didn\u0027t actually expect anyone to take him seriously. Lissa\u0027s feelings through the bond confirmed as much. She felt like Victor was trying to shift attention off of himself by making up stories about Dimitri and me. She was horrified that Victor would stoop so low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe judge was too, and she chastised Victor for getting off topic. By that point, most of the questioning was done. The lawyers wrapped up, and it was time for the queen to deliver her verdict. I held my breath again, wondering what she would do. He hadn\u0027t denied any of the charges. The evidence was overwhelming, thanks to my friends\u0027 testimonies, but as even Victor had pointed out, there was a lot of corruption among royals. The queen could very well decide that she didn\u0027t want the scandal involved with imprisoning someone so well known. Even if no one knew the details, his imprisonment would start a buzz. Maybe she didn\u0027t want to deal with that. Maybe Victor had bought her off too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the end, she found Victor guilty and sentenced him to life in prison - a different prison, not the one at Court. I\u0027d heard stories about Moroi prisons, and they were terrible places. I suspected his new home would be very different from the cell we\u0027d found him in. Victor remained calm and amused throughout it all, just as he had yesterday. I didn\u0027t like that. The conversation I\u0027d had with him made me think he wasn\u0027t going to accept this as serenely as he pretended. I hoped they\u0027d watch him closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gesture from the queen ended formalities. The rest of us stood up and began talking while she surveyed the room with a sharp eye, probably taking notes. Victor\u0027s escort started to lead him out. He passed by us again. This time, he stopped and spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vasilisa, I trust you\u0027ve been well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer. She still hated and feared him, but with this verdict, she finally believed he could no longer hurt her. It was like the end of a chapter she\u0027d been stuck in for months. She could finally move on and hopefully let those horrible memories fade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry we didn\u0027t get a chance to talk, but I\u0027m sure we will next time,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" said one of the guardians with him. They led him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s crazy,\" muttered Lissa once he was gone. \"I can\u0027t believe he said that stuff about you and Dimitri.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri was standing behind her. I looked up and met his eyes as he moved past us. His relief mirrored my own. We\u0027d danced with danger today - and we\u0027d won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian came up to her and hugged her, holding her for a long time. I watched them fondly, surprised at my own kind feelings for them. When a hand touched my arm, I jumped. It was Adrian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay, little dhampir?\" he asked softly. \"Dashkov said a few ... uh ... suggestive things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped closer, keeping my voice low as well. \"No one believed him. I think it\u0027s okay. Thanks for asking, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and tapped my nose. \"Two thank-yous in as many days. I don\u0027t suppose I\u0027ll get to see any, uh, special gratitude?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scoffed. \"Nope. You\u0027ll just have to imagine it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a half-hug and released me. \"Fair enough. But I have a good imagination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started to leave, and then Priscilla Voda hurried over to Lissa. \"The queen would like to meet with you before you leave. In private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over to the raised chair where the queen sat. Her gaze was fixed on us, and I wondered what this could be about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" said Lissa, as confused as I was. To me, she sent through the bond: Will you listen again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her a quick nod before Priscilla spirited her off. I returned to my room, tuning in to Lissa while I packed my things up. It took a little while because Tatiana had to finish a few courtroom formalities, but she finally arrived in the same room as yesterday. Lissa and Priscilla bowed as she entered and waited for the queen to sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTatiana made herself comfortable. \"Vasilisa, you need to be in the air soon, so I\u0027ll make this brief. I would like to make an offer to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of an offer, Your Majesty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll need to go to college soon.\" She spoke like it was a done deal. And yeah, Lissa did plan on going to college, but I didn\u0027t like the presumption. \"I understand you\u0027re dissatisfied with your choices.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...it\u0027s not that I\u0027m dissatisfied, exactly. It\u0027s just, all the places Moroi are supposed to go are small. I mean, I understand it\u0027s for safety, but I don\u0027t know. I\u0027d like to go somewhere bigger. Somewhere prestigious.\" Guardians monitored a handful of select colleges in the country so that Moroi could safely attend them. As Lissa had noted, though, they tended to be smaller schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTatiana nodded impatiently, like she already knew this. \"I\u0027m going to give you an opportunity that no one else has ever been given, to my knowledge. After graduation, I would like you to come live here, at the Royal Court. You have no family, and I think you\u0027d benefit from learning politics right in the heart of our government. Along with this, we would make arrangements for you to attend Lehigh University. It\u0027s less than an hour from here. Have you heard of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa nodded. I\u0027d never heard of it, but she was enough of a nerd to have researched every college in the U.S. \"It\u0027s a good school, Your Majesty. But... still small.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s bigger than the ones Moroi usually attend,\" she pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True.\" In her mind, Lissa was trying to puzzle out what was going on here. Why was Tatiana making this offer? Especially considering how she\u0027d seemed to disagree with Lissa earlier. There was something weird going on here, and she decided to see how far she could push it. \"The University of Pennsylvania isn\u0027t that far either, Your Majesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That school is enormous, Vasilisa. We couldn\u0027t ensure your safety there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa shrugged. \"Well, then it probably doesn\u0027t matter if I go to Lehigh or one of the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe queen looked shocked. So did Priscilla. They couldn\u0027t believe Lissa seemed indifferent to the offer. Truthfully, Lissa wasn\u0027t indifferent. Lehigh was a step up from what she\u0027d expected, and she wanted to go. But she also wanted to see how badly the queen wanted her to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTatiana frowned and appeared to be weighing matters. \"Depending on your grades and experiences at Lehigh, we could possibly arrange for you to transfer in a couple years. Again, the safety logistics would be very difficult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow. The queen did want her around. But why? Lissa decided to simply ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very flattered, Your Majesty. And grateful. But why are you offering me this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As the last Dragomir, you\u0027re a precious commodity. I\u0027d like to make sure your future is secure. And I do so hate to see bright minds wasted. Besides...\" She paused, hesitant to speak her next words. \"You were right to a certain extent. The Moroi do have trouble changing. It could be useful to have a dissenting voice around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa didn\u0027t answer right away. She was still analyzing this offer from every possible angle. She wished I was there to advise her, but I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d have much of an opinion. Splitting my guardian duty between the Court and a cool university could be pretty neat. On the other hand, we\u0027d have more freedom elsewhere. In the end, Lissa decided in favor of higher education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" she said at last. \"I accept. Thank you, Your Majesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent,\" said Tatiana. \"We\u0027ll see that the arrangements are made. You may go now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe queen made no signs of moving, so Lissa bowed again and scurried to the door, still reeling with this news. Tatiana suddenly called out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vasilisa? Will you send your friend here to talk to me? The Hathaway girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose?\" she asked in astonishment. \"Why do you - ? Yes, of course. I\u0027ll get her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLissa hurried toward guest housing, but I met her halfway. \"What\u0027s going on?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea,\" said Lissa. \"Did you hear what she said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup. Maybe she wants to tell me how I have to be extra careful with you going to that school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. I don\u0027t know.\" Lissa gave me a quick hug. \"Good luck. I\u0027ll see you soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the same room and found Tatiana standing with her hands clasped, posture stiff and impatient. She was dressed like a corporate businesswoman again, with a sleek brown blazer and skirt set. That color wouldn\u0027t have been my first choice to go with her dark gray hair, but that was her style adviser\u0027s problem, not mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bowed just as Lissa had and glanced around the room. Priscilla was gone; only a couple guardians remained. I expected Tatiana to tell me to sit, but instead, she stood up and walked right over to me. Her face did not look happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Hathaway,\" she said sharply, \"I\u0027m going to keep this brief. You are going to stop this atrocious affair you\u0027re having with my great-nephew. Immediately.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-14.html","bookId":2062,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:24 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:24 AM"}
