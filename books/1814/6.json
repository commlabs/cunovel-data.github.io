Billy Warren is, and always has been, a complete f**king idiot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m used to Drew’s digs against Billy. And in this case? he’s not exactly wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I tell him, “As long as you don’t to make me swallow the worm, I’ll give it a go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis eyes light up, like a kid in a bike shop. “You know what this means?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe wiggles his brows. “I get to teach you how to do body shots.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I don’t believe you need to be drunk to have great sex, having a good buzz certainly doesn’t hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew and I are in the elevator heading back to our room, both of us more than tipsy from the tequila. I can taste it on Drew’s tongue—bitter with a touch of citrus. he has me pinned against the wall, my skirt bunched up around my hips, and we’re pushing and grinding against each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m glad there’s no one else in the elevator—although at this point? I’m really too far gone to give a damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stumble into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill groping and kissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew slams the door and spins me around. In one quick movement he pulls the dress down my body, leaving me bare. Except for my heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean over the desk, resting on my elbows. I hear the hiss of a zipper—and then I feel him. Sliding his c**k between my lips— testing the waters—making sure I’m ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m always ready for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tease,” I whimper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween the tequila and the elevator, I’m really turned on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeedy. he pushes in slowly but to the hilt. And I sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, we all know the old phrase that bigger is better. And Drew is big—not that I have a lot to compare him to, but he’s twice the size of Billy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not making you boys out there uncomfortable, am I? News flash—this is how woman talk. At least when you’re not around to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, it’s not really size that makes the man. It’s rhythm—the pace—knowing how to hit all those delicious spots with just the right amount of pressure. So the next time you see an infomercial for Cockgrow or Miracle-Dick?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSave your money. Buy the Kama Sutra instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew grabs my hair, pulling my head back, and moves quicker. hard and fast. I grip the edge of the desk, holding on for balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe kisses my shoulder and whispers in my ear, “You like that, baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moan. “Yes . . . yes . . . so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe thrusts into me with more force, shaking the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, I’m coming like an out-of-control locomotive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m floating. Weightless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it’s sublime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew slows the movement of his hips as I come down, drawing it out—making it last. he pulls me back against his chest and his fingers skate up across my stomach and up to my br**sts, cupping and kneading them with both hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise my arms around his neck, turning my head, bringing his mouth to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love his mouth, his lips, his tongue. Kissing is an art form, and Drew Evans is Michelangelo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe pulls out of me and I turn around to face him. Backing him up to the bed. Drew sits on the edge and I climb on, wrapping my legs around his waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is how I like it best—chest to chest, mouth to mouth, not an inch of space between us. I take him in my hand and slide down onto him. My insides stretch with the fullness and Drew moans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rise slowly and slam down hard. Testing the strength of the bed springs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSqueak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSqueak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move faster. Deeper. Our bodies are slick from the Mexican heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Drew is holding my face in his hands, his thumbs moving back and forth across my skin. Suddenly tender. Worshipful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur foreheads press together and in the dim light I can see his eyes looking down, watching where he moves in and out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I look down too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s erotic. Sensual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push his hair back from his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd my voice is begging, “Tell me you love me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe doesn’t say it often. he prefers to show me. But I never get tired of hearing it. Because every time he actually says the words, I’m filled with same wonderment as the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you, Kate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis hands still hold my face. Both of us panting—moving faster—getting closer. It feels spiritual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA holy communion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew’s voice is hushed. Breathless. “Tell me you’ll never leave me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis eyes are soft now, liquid silver. Pleading for reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all his audacity and over-confidence, I think there’s a part of him that’s still haunted by the week he thought I’d chosen Billy over him. I think that’s why he works so hard to prove how much he wants me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo show me that I chose wisely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile softly and look right into his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never. I’ll never leave you, Drew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words feel like vows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis hands grip my hips, raising me up, helping me move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, Kate . . .” his eyes close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd our mouths open, giving and taking each other’s breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe expands inside me, throbbing, as I clamp down hard around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we come together. In perfect unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect splendor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, Drew’s arms tighten around me. I touch his face and kiss him gently. he falls backward on the bed, taking me with him, keeping me on top. We lie like that for a while until our heart rates come back down and our breathing slows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Drew rolls me under him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we do it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe New York City club scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePounding music that only allows for conversation if you’re a lip-reader. Sweaty guidos in their I’m-too-sexy silk shirts, who think breathing is a sign that you’re interested. Impossibly long lines at the bar and insanely priced watered-down drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot really my favorite place to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m more of a bar girl. Bottled beer, jukeboxes, pool tables—I can be quite the pool shark when I need to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I haven’t enjoyed a good rave or two in my time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? You thought pot was the only illegal substance to grace my bloodstream? Afraid not. Ecstasy, acid, ’shrooms—I’ve tried them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou look a little shocked. You shouldn’t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole drug culture was started by intellectuals in institutions of higher learning. Don’t even try and tell me Bill Gates came up with Windows—a maze of interconnected, multicolored path-ways—without some serious psychedelic assistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, despite my preferences, four weeks after Cabo, Drew and I end up at the hottest club of the moment. With our best friends, Matthew and Delores. To celebrate their first anniversary. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-tangled-2/page-6.html","bookId":1814,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM"}
