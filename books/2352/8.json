Hell, I felt myself mummifying on the spot, and almost turned around for more beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI passed a leather shop, general store, and glass blowing shop, and soon came upon a smallish adobe building set back from the boardwalk. The sign out front read: Rawhide Museum, Free Admission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we\u0027re talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused, listening. From somewhere nearby I heard the sharp report of rifle shots. From my research, I knew there was a shooting range just outside of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePraying for air conditioning, I entered the museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy prayers were answered. Maybe I should be a priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCool air blasted my face the moment I stepped into the small museum, itself nothing more than a converted frontier house, filled to overflowing with antique mining equipment. Hardhats, lanterns, pick axes, carts, stuff I didn\u0027t recognize, stuff I did but didn\u0027t know the names of. I had the general sense that mining in the days of yore took a lot of muscle, and probably a lot of nerve. Not to mention light. In one corner, a display let children pan for fool\u0027s gold. Along the walls, dozens of black and white photographs showed the town in various stages of growth and decline. Many featured hardened men sporting thick handlebar mustaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door was open to my right, leading into what might have once been a bedroom, but now was an office. Inside, a smallish young man with wire rim glasses and a goatee was working furiously on a computer, pounding the keyboard with a vengeance, oblivious to me. I studied him briefly, and concluded he would have looked better with a handlebar mustache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knocked on the door frame, and he jumped about six inches out of his seat, gasping, clutching his heart. He snapped his head around, his eyes wide behind his thick glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJumpy little fellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oops,\" I said. \"Of course, I could say I should have knocked, but that\u0027s just what I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027s not you,\" he said, settling back in his chair, letting out a long stream of air. The brass nameplate on his desk read: Jarred Booker, Town Historian. \"Just lost in my writing, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, do you write?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I was just trying to be agreeable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" he said, frowning. \"Anyway, I haven\u0027t had anyone step in here for...oh, a few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe the price scares them away,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any freer, and I would have to pay them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you here for a tour?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my wallet and showed him my license to detect, complete with my happy mug. A small grin, no teeth. Eyes bright, but hard. The picture was worth a thousand words, and one of them was roguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you, Mr. Knighthorse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him I was hired to investigate the death of Willie Clarke and that I was here to ask a few questions. Jarred stared at me for a moment, then got up and crossed the room and closed the door and went back and sat behind his desk again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I was told not to talk to anyone about Willie Clarke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Told by who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarred leaned back in his chair and studied me. The glow from his monitor reflected off his glasses. So nice it reflected twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tafford Barron?\" I asked. Shot in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked a little surprised. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any idea why he doesn\u0027t want you talking to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None that I can speculate on. Besides, I\u0027ve already told the police everything I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said. \"I\u0027d like to hire you to take me to the same place you took Willie Clarke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the desert?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Part of the investigation. Scene of the crime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to the police, there\u0027s been no crime. It was an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said. \"Which is why Tafford wants to keep you from talking to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarred shrugged. \"He doesn\u0027t want any more bad publicity for the town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad publicity for the town, or for his campaign?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t know anything about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment a back door to the office opened and bright sunshine flooded the narrow room. A pretty blond girl in her mid-twenties entered through the door, shut it quietly behind her, and stood blinking, letting her eyes adjust to the dim light. She wore jeans, a red cowboy shirt and boots, the Rawhide dress code. She was also holding a rifle. She didn\u0027t know I was there, at least not until her eyes adjusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best day yet, Jarred,\" she said. \"I couldn\u0027t miss. Oh, hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Howdy, ma\u0027am.\" I tipped my hat. I was getting better at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. \"Howdy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t help you, Mr. Knighthorse,\" said Jarred loudly, drawing my attention back to him. \"My hands are tied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tied about what?\" said the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you later,\" said Jarred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m investigating Willie Clarke\u0027s death,\" I said. I looked at Jarred. \"I prefer to tell her now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she said, frowning. \"Willie Clarke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be Patricia McGovern.\" I remembered her from the police report. She and Jarred had escorted Willie out into the desert together. She was the other person I wanted to talk to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Yes, I\u0027m Patricia. I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t know your name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her my most winning smile. \"I\u0027m Jim Knighthorse, detective extraordinaire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened. \"A detective?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good day, Mr. Knighthorse,\" said Jarred, standing. \"We have nothing further to add to your investigation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was watching Patricia. Mostly, I was observing her reaction to Jarred\u0027s unfriendliness towards me. She didn\u0027t like it. She seemed about to say something, but then bit her lip. Maybe she didn\u0027t want to lose her job, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I left, but first I handed them each a business card. Patricia looked at it as if I had handed her a two-dollar bill. Jarred tried to hand his back. Instead, I left his on his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tipped my ballcap toward Patricia. She smiled tightly, and I left the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Rawhide altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Sixteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day I was sitting in Detective Hansen\u0027s office on the third floor of the Huntington Beach Police Station. Today Hansen was wearing dark blue slacks, a powder blue Polo shirt with a shoulder holster, and loafers with no socks. I knew this because his feet were up on the desk, ankles crossed. His perfect hair was parted down the middle. Fit and tan, he was the quintessential Huntington Beach cop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI motioned toward his clothing. \"Items A \u0026amp; B, page one twenty three of the Nordstrom\u0027s men catalog?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close,\" he said. \"Ordered from Macy\u0027s. Wife picked them out. Thought I should set the standards for hip and cool for Huntington Beach PD.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which, itself, sets the standards for hip and cool for police departments everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, if you follow that train of logic, you are the hippest and coolest cop this side of the Mississippi. Perhaps ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gimme a break, Knighthorse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething caught my eye. Actually two somethings. Hansen\u0027s office overlooked a big alabaster fountain. The fountain was of mostly of a nude sea nymph. A buxomly sea nymph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Distracting, huh?\" said Hansen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sea nymph?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever the fuck it is,\" he said. \"Why the hell did they have to make her tits so goddamn big?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what can I do for you, Knighthorse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him about my mother, the picture, and why I was there. As I spoke, his eyes never wavered from mine. I finished the story. Hansen continued looking at me and then started shaking his head. His perfect hair never moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, Knighthorse, I never knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Few do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The case is closed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"I\u0027m re-opening it. Unofficially.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA corner of his lip raised in a sort of half smile. \"Of course. And you have a picture of the perp, or the presumed perp?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the picture\u0027s twenty years old?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat back in his chair, ran his fingers through his hair. His fingers, amazingly, were tan. And his hair, amazingly, never moved. Only grudgingly made some space for the fingers. Otherwise held its ground. I waited. Hansen thought some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we can ID him,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mugshots?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have them that far back, of course. Sound good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Sounds good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later we took an elevator down to the basement. He left me alone in a dusty backroom and, surrounded by outdated computers and boxes of old case files, I looked at the faces of hundreds, perhaps even thousands of Orange County\u0027s most hardened criminals of yesteryear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not the face I was looking for. And as I took the elevator back up from the basement, I was looking forward to crossing paths with the buxomly sea nymph. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-mummy-case-jim-knighthorse-2/page-8.html","bookId":2352,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:49 AM"}
