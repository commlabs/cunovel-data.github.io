At least to Fox\u0027s mind. The brightly colored minipots holding herbs arranged on the windowsill added to that tone, he supposed, and the skinny vase of white-faced daisies one of the women must have picked up at the flower shop in town finished it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women, Quinn, Cybil, and Layla, had managed to make a home out of the place in a matter of weeks with flea market furniture, scraps of fabric, and generous splashes of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d managed it while devoting the bulk of their time to researching and outlining the root of the nightmare that infected the Hollow for seven days every seven years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nightmare that had begun twenty-one years before, on the birthday he shared with Cal and Gage. That night had changed him, and his friends-his blood brothers. Things had changed again when Quinn had come to town to lay the groundwork for her book on the Hollow and its legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was more than a book to her now, the curvy blonde who enjoyed the spookier side of life, and who had fallen for Cal. It was more than a project for Quinn\u0027s college pal Cybil Kinski, the exotic researcher. And he thought it was more of a problem for Layla Darnell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Cal and Gage went back to babyhood-even before, as their mothers had taken the same childbirth class. Quinn and Cybil had been college roommates, and had remained friends since. But Layla had come to the Hollow, come into this situation, alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reminded himself of that whenever his patience ran a bit thin. However tightly the friendship was that had formed between her and the other two women, however much she was connected to the whole, she\u0027d come into this alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCybil walked in carrying a legal pad. She tossed it on the table, then picked up a bottle of wine. Her long, curling hair was pinned back from her face with clips that glinted silver against the black. She wore slim black pants and an untucked shirt of candy pink. Her feet were bare, with toe-nails painted to match the shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFox always found such details particularly fascinating. He could barely remember to match up a pair of socks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So...\" Her deep brown eyes tracked over to his. \"I\u0027m here to get your statement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to read me my rights?\" When she smiled, he shrugged. \"We gave you the gist when we came in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Details, counselor.\" Her voice was smooth as top cream. \"Quinn particularly likes details in the notes for her books and we all need them to keep painting the picture. Quinn\u0027s getting Layla\u0027s take upstairs while Layla changes. She had blood on her shirt. Yours, I\u0027m assuming, as she didn\u0027t have a scratch on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither do I, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, your super-duper healing power. That\u0027s handy. Run it through for me, will you, cutie? I know it\u0027s a pain, because when the others get here, they\u0027ll want to hear it, too. But isn\u0027t that what they say on the cop shows? Keep going over it, and maybe you\u0027ll remember something more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince she had a point, he began at the moment he\u0027d looked up and seen the crows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you doing right before you looked up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Walking up Main. I was going to drop in and see Cal. Buy a beer.\" Lips curved in a half smile, he lifted the bottle. \"Came here and got one free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bought them, as I recall. It just seems if you were walking toward the Square, and these birds were doing their Hitchcock thing above the intersection, you\u0027d have noticed before you said you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was distracted, thinking about... work, and stuff.\" He raked his fingers through hair still damp from being stuck under the faucet to wash the bird gunk out. \"I guess I was looking across the street more than up the street. Layla came out of Ma\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She walked over to get some of Quinn\u0027s revolting two percent milk. Was it luck-good or bad-that both of you were there, right on the spot?\" Her head cocked to the side; her eyebrow lifted. \"Or was that the point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe liked that she was quick, that she was sharp. \"I lean toward it being the point. If the Big Evil Bastard wanted to announce it was back to play, it makes a bigger impact if at least one of us was on the scene. It wouldn\u0027t be as much fun if we\u0027d just heard about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lean the same way. We agreed before that it\u0027s able to influence animals or people under some kind of impairment easier, quicker. So, crows. That\u0027s happened before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Crows or other birds flying into windows, into people, buildings. When it does, even people who were here when it happened before are surprised. Like it was the first time they\u0027d seen anything like it. That\u0027s part of the symptoms, we\u0027ll call it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were other people out-pedestrians, people driving by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And none of them stopped and said: Holy crap, look at all those crows up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He nodded, following her. \"No. No one saw them, or no one who did found them remarkable. That\u0027s happened before, too. People seeing things that aren\u0027t there, and people not seeing things that are. It\u0027s just never happened this far out from the Seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do after you saw Layla?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kept walking.\" Curious, he angled his head in an attempt to read her notes upside down. What he saw were squiggles of letters and signs he didn\u0027t understand how anyone could decipher right-side up. \"I guess I stopped for a second the way you do, then I kept walking. And that\u0027s when I... I felt it first, that\u0027s what I do. It\u0027s a kind of awareness. Like the hair standing up on the back of your neck, or that tingle between the shoulder blades. I saw them, in my head, then I looked up, and saw them with my eyes. Layla saw them, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And still, no one else did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Again, he scooped a hand through his hair. \"I don\u0027t think so. I wanted to get her inside, but there wasn\u0027t time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t interrupt or question when he ran through the rest of it. When he was done, she set down her pencil, smiled at him. \"You\u0027re a sweetheart, Fox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True. Very true. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued to smile as she rose, skirted the little table. She took his face in her hands and kissed him lightly on the mouth. \"I saw your jacket. It\u0027s torn, and it\u0027s covered with bird blood and God knows what else. That could\u0027ve been Layla.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can get another jacket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I said, you\u0027re a sweetheart.\" She kissed him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry to interrupt this touching moment.\" Gage strode in, his dark hair windblown, his eyes green and cynical. He stored the six-pack he carried in the fridge, then pulled out a beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moment\u0027s over,\" Cybil announced. \"Too bad you missed all the excitement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe popped the top. \"There\u0027ll be plenty more before it\u0027s over. Doing okay?\" he asked Fox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I won\u0027t be pulling out my DVD of The Birds anytime soon, but other than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cal said Layla wasn\u0027t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she\u0027s good. She\u0027s upstairs changing. Things got a little messy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Fox\u0027s glance, Cybil shrugged. \"Which is my cue to go up and check on her and leave you two to man talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she walked out, Gage followed her with his eyes. \"Looks good coming or going.\" Taking a long pull on the beer, he sat across from Fox. \"You looking in that direction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Oh, Cybil? No.\" She\u0027d left a scent in the air, Fox realized, that was both mysterious and appealing. But... \"No. Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looking\u0027s free. How bad was it today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve seen a lot worse. Property damage mostly. Maybe some cuts and bruises.\" Everything about him hardened, inside and out. \"They\u0027d\u0027ve messed her up, Gage, if I hadn\u0027t been there. She couldn\u0027t have gotten inside in time. They weren\u0027t just flying at cars and buildings. They were heading right for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could\u0027ve been any one of us.\" Gage pondered on it a moment. \"Last month, it went after Quinn when she was alone in the gym.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Targeting the women,\" Fox said with a nod, \"most specifically when one of them is alone. From the viewpoint-the faulty viewpoint-that a woman alone is more vulnerable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not entirely faulty. We heal, they don\u0027t.\" Gage kicked back in his chair. \"There\u0027s no way to keep three women under wraps while we try to come up with how to kill a centuries-old and very pissed-off demon. Besides that, we need them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the front door open and close, then shifted in his chair to watch Cal come in with an armload of take-out bags. \"Burgers, subs,\" Cal announced. He dumped them on the counter as he studied Fox. \"You\u0027re okay? Layla\u0027s okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only casualty was my leather jacket. What\u0027s it like out there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting out his own beer, Cal sat with his friends. His eyes were a cold and angry gray. \"About a dozen broken windows on Main Street, and the three-car pileup at the Square. No serious injuries, this time. The mayor and my father got some people together to clean up the mess. Chief Hawbaker\u0027s taking statements.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if it goes as it usually does, in a couple of days, nobody will think any more about it. Maybe it\u0027s better that way. If things like this stuck in people\u0027s minds, the Hollow\u0027d be a ghost town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it should be. Don\u0027t give me the old hometown cheer,\" Gage said to Cal before Cal could speak. \"It\u0027s a place. A dot on the map.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s people,\" Cal corrected, though this argument had gone around before. \"It\u0027s families, it\u0027s businesses and homes. And it\u0027s ours, goddamn it. Twisse, or whatever name we want to call it, isn\u0027t going to take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t it occur to you that it would be a hell of a lot easier to take him down if we didn\u0027t have to worry about the three thousand people in the Hollow?\" Gage tossed back. \"What do we end up doing through most of the Seven, Cal? Trying to keep people from killing themselves or each other, getting people medical help. How do we fight it when we\u0027re busy fighting what it causes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got a point.\" Fox lifted a hand for peace. \"I know I\u0027ve wished we could just clear everybody the hell out, have a showdown. Fucking get it done. But you can\u0027t tell three thousand people to leave their homes and businesses for a week. You can\u0027t empty out an entire town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Anasazi did it.\" Quinn stepped in from the doorway. She went to Cal first. Her long blond hair swung forward as she leaned over his chair to kiss him. \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she straightened, her hands stayed on his shoulders. Fox wasn\u0027t sure the gesture was purely out of affection or to soothe. But he knew when Cal\u0027s hand came up to cover one of hers, it meant they were united.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Towns and villages have emptied out before, for mysterious and unexplained reasons,\" she continued. \"The ancient Anasazi, who built complex communities in the canyons of Arizona and New Mexico, the colonial village of Roanoke. Causes might have been warfare, sickness, or something else. I\u0027ve been wondering if some of those cases might be the something else we\u0027re dealing with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think Lazarus Twisse wiped out the Anasazi, the settlers of Roanoke?\" Cal asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe, in the case of the Anasazi, before he took any name we know. Roanoke happened after sixteen fifty-two, so we can\u0027t hang that on our particular Big Evil Bastard. Just a theory I\u0027ve been kicking around.\" She turned to poke into the bags on the counter. \"In any case, we should eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile food and plates were transferred to the dining room, Fox managed to get Layla aside. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" She took his hand, turned it over to study the unbroken skin. \"I guess you are, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, if you want to take a couple of days off, from the office, I mean, it\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe released his hand, angled her head as she took a long study of his face. \"Do you really think I\u0027m that... lily-livered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I just meant-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do. You think because I\u0027m not sold on this idea of the-the Vulcan Mind Meld, I\u0027m a coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t. I figured you\u0027d be shaken up-anyone would be. Points for the Spock reference, by the way, even though it\u0027s inaccurate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it?\" She brushed past him to take her seat at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" Quinn gave Cal\u0027s burger one wistful glance before she started on her grilled chicken. \"We\u0027re all up to date on what happened at the Square. Bad birds. We\u0027ll log it and chart it, and I\u0027m planning on talking to bystanders tomorrow. I wondered if it might be helpful to get one of the bird corpses and send it off for analysis. Maybe there\u0027d be a sign of some physical change, some infection, something off that would come out in an autopsy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll just leave that to you.\" Cybil made a face as she nibbled on the portion of the turkey sub she\u0027d cut into quarters. \"And let\u0027s not discuss autopsies over dinner. Here\u0027s what I found interesting about today\u0027s event. Both Layla and Fox sensed and saw the birds, as far as I can tell, simultaneously. Or near enough to amount to the same. Now, is that simply because all six of us have some connection to the dark and the light sides of what happened, and continues to happen in Hawkins Hollow? Or is this because of the specific ability they share?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say both,\" was Cal\u0027s opinion. \"With the extra click going to shared ability.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tend to agree. So,\" Cybil continued, \"how do we use it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t.\" Fox scooped up fries. \"Not as long as Layla pulls back from learning how to use what she\u0027s got. That\u0027s the way it is,\" he continued when Layla stared at him. \"You don\u0027t have to like it, but that\u0027s how it is. What you have isn\u0027t any good to you, or to the team, if you won\u0027t use it, or learn how to use it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say I wouldn\u0027t, but I\u0027m not going to have you shove it down my throat. And trying to shame me into it isn\u0027t going to work either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will?\" Fox countered. \"I\u0027m open to suggestions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCybil held up a hand. \"Since I opened this can of worms, let me try. You\u0027ve got reservations about this, Layla. Why don\u0027t you tell us what they are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel like I\u0027m losing pieces of myself, or who I thought I was. Adding this in, I\u0027m never going to be who I was again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That may be,\" Gage said easily. \"But you\u0027re probably not going to live past July anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" On a half laugh, Layla picked up her glass of wine. \"I should look on the bright side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s try this.\" Cal shook his head at Gage. \"The odds are you\u0027d have been hurt today if something hadn\u0027t clicked between you and Fox. And it clicked without either one of you purposely trying. What?\" he asked as Quinn started to speak, then stopped herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Nothing.\" Quinn exchanged a quick look with Cybil. \"Let\u0027s just say I think I understand where everyone\u0027s coming from, and everyone makes a point. So I want to say, Layla, that maybe you could consider looking at it another way. Not that you\u0027re losing something with this, but you could be gaining something. Meanwhile, we\u0027re still going through Ann Hawkins\u0027s journals, and the other books Cal\u0027s great-grandmother gave us. And Cybil\u0027s working on finding where Ann might have gone the night Giles Dent faced down Lazarus Twisse at the Pagan Stone, where she stayed to have her sons, where she lived until she came back here when they were about two. We\u0027re still hopeful that if we find the place, we may find more of her journals. And Cybil also verified her branch of the family tree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A younger branch than all of yours, so far as I can tell,\" Cybil continued. \"One of my ancestors, a Nadia Sytarskyi, traveled here with her family, and with others in the mid-nineteenth century. She married Jonah Adams, a descendent of Hester Deale. I actually get two branches, as about fifty years later, one of my other ancestors-Kinski side- also came here, and hooked up with Nadia and Jonah\u0027s grandchild. So, like Quinn and Layla, I\u0027m a descendent of Hester Deale, and the demon who raped her and got her with child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Making us all one big happy family,\" Gage put in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Making us something. It doesn\u0027t sit well with me,\" Cybil added, speaking directly to Layla, \"to know that part of what I have, part of what I am, comes down from something evil, something neither human or humane. In fact, it pisses me off. Enough that I intend to use everything I have, everything I am to kick its ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it worry you that it may be able to use what you have and are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCybil lifted her glass again, her dark eyes cool as she sipped. \"It can try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It worries me.\" Layla scanned the table, the faces of the people she\u0027d come to care for. \"It worries me that I have something in me I can\u0027t fully understand or control. It worries me that at some point, at any point, it may control me.\" She shook her head before Quinn could speak. \"Even now I don\u0027t know if I chose to come here or if I was directed here. More disturbing to me is not being sure anymore if anything I\u0027ve done has been a choice, or just some part of a master plan created by these forces-the dark and the light. That\u0027s what\u0027s under it for me. That\u0027s the sticking point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s chaining you to that chair,\" Gage pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ease off,\" Fox told him, but Gage only shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so. She\u0027s got a problem, we\u0027ve all got a problem. So let\u0027s deal with it. Why don\u0027t you just pack up and go back to New York? Get your job back selling-what is it-overpriced shoes to bored women with too much money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Step back, Gage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Layla put a hand on Fox\u0027s arm as he started to rise. \"I don\u0027t need to be rescued, or protected. Why don\u0027t I leave? Because it would make me a coward, and up until now I\u0027ve never been one. I don\u0027t leave because what raped Hester Deale, what put its half-demon bastard in that girl, drove her mad, drove her to suicide, would like nothing better than for me to cut and run. I know better than anyone here what it did to her, because it made me experience it. Maybe that makes me more afraid than the rest of you; maybe that was part of the plan. I\u0027m not going anywhere, but I\u0027m not ashamed to admit that I\u0027m afraid. Of what\u0027s out there, and of what\u0027s inside me. Inside all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you weren\u0027t afraid you\u0027d be stupid.\" Gage lifted his glass in a half toast. \"Smart and self-aware are harder to manipulate than stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every seven years good people in this town, ordinary people, smart, self-aware people hurt each other, and themselves. They do things they\u0027d never consider doing at any other time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you could be infected?\" Fox asked her. \"That you could turn, hurt someone? One of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can we be sure I\u0027m immune? That Cybil and Quinn are? Shouldn\u0027t we consider that because of our line of descent we could be even more vulnerable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good question. Disturbing,\" Quinn added, \"but good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t fly.\" Fox shifted so Layla met his eyes. \"Things didn\u0027t go the way Twisse planned or expected, because Giles Dent was ready for him. He stopped him from being around when Hester delivered, stopped him from potentially siring more offspring, so the line\u0027s been diluted. You\u0027re not what he was after, and in fact, according to what we know, what we can speculate, you are part of what\u0027s going to give me, Cal, and Gage the advantage this time around. You\u0027re afraid of him, of what\u0027s in you? Consider Twisse is afraid of you, of what\u0027s in you. Why else has he tried to scare you off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good answer.\" Quinn rubbed her hand over Cal\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Part two,\" Fox continued. \"It\u0027s not just a matter of immunity to the power he has to cause people to commit violent, abnormal acts. It\u0027s a matter of having some aspect of that power, however diluted, that when pooled together is going to end him, once and for all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLayla studied Fox\u0027s face. \"You believe that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to answer, then took her hand, tightening his grip when she started to pull it free. \"You tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggled-he could see it, and he could feel it, that initial and instinctive shying away from accepting the link with him. He had to resist the urge to push, and simply left himself open. And even when he felt the click, he waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe it,\" Layla said slowly. \"You... you see us as six strands braided together into one rope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we\u0027re going to hang Twisse with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You love them so much. It\u0027s-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah...\" It was Fox who pulled away, flustered and embarrassed that she\u0027d seen more, gone deeper than he\u0027d expected. \"So, now that we\u0027ve got that settled, I want another beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed into the kitchen, and as he turned from the refrigerator with a beer in his hand, Layla stepped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing. No big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is. I just... It was like being inside your head, or your heart, and I saw-or felt-this wave of love, that connection you have to Gage and Cal. It wasn\u0027t what you asked me to do, and it was so intrusive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, look, it\u0027s a tricky process. I was a little more open than I should\u0027ve been because I figured you needed me to be. The fact is, you don\u0027t need as much help as I thought. As you thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re wrong. I do need help. I need you to teach me.\" She walked to the window to look out at the dark. \"Because Gage was right. If I keep letting this be a problem for me, it\u0027s a problem for all of us. And if I\u0027m going to use this ability, I have to be able to control it so I\u0027m not walking into people\u0027s heads right and left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll start working on it tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I\u0027ll be ready.\" And turned. \"Would you tell the others I went on up? It\u0027s been a very strange day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, she just stood, looking at him. \"I want to say, and I\u0027m sorry if it embarrasses you, but there\u0027s something exceptional about a man who has the capacity to love as deeply as you do. Cal and Gage are lucky to have a friend like you. Anyone would be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m your friend, Layla.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so. Good night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stayed where he was after she\u0027d gone, reminding himself to stay her friend. To stay what she needed, when she needed it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hollow-sign-of-seven-2/page-3.html","bookId":2249,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:24 PM"}
