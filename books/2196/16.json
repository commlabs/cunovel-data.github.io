Claudine was lying beside me on the bed, propped up on one elbow looking down at me compassionately. And Amelia was at the end of the bed in an easy chair, her bandaged leg propped up on an ottoman. She was reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come you\u0027re here?\" I asked Claudine. After seeing Eric and Bill last night, I wondered if everyone I knew followed me around. Maybe Sam would come in the door in a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, I\u0027m your fairy godmother,\" Claudine said. Claudine was usually the happiest fairy I knew. Claudine was just as lovely for a woman as her twin Claude was for a man; maybe lovelier, because her more agreeable personality shone through her eyes. Her coloring was the same as his; black hair, white skin. Today she was wearing pale blue capris and a coordinating black-and-blue tunic. She looked ethereally lovely, or at least as ethereal as you can look in capris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can explain that to me right after I go to the bathroom,\" I said, remembering all the water I\u0027d chugged down when I\u0027d gotten to the sink the night before. All my wanderings had made me thirsty. Claudine swung gracefully from the bed, and I followed her awkwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful,\" Amelia advised, when I tried to stand up too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s your leg?\" I asked her, when the world had righted itself. Claudine kept a grip on my arm, just in case. It felt good to see Claudine, and I was surprisingly glad to see Amelia, even limping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very sore,\" she said. \"But unlike you, I stayed at the hospital and had the wound treated properly.\" She closed her book and put it on the little table by the chair. She looked a little better than I suspected I did, but she was not the radiant and happy witch she\u0027d been the day before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had a learning experience, didn\u0027t we?\" I said, and then my breath caught when I remembered just how much I\u0027d learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudine helped me into the bathroom, and when I assured her I could manage, she left me alone. I did the necessary things and came out feeling better, almost human. Claudine had gotten some clothes out of my sports bag, and there was a mug on the bedside table with steam rising from it. I carefully sat against the headboard, my legs crossed in front of me, and held the mug to my face so I could breathe in the smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explain the fairy godmother thing,\" I said. I didn\u0027t want to talk about anything more urgent, not just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fairies are your basic supernatural being,\" Claudine said. \"From us come elves and brownies and angels and demons. Water sprites, green men, all the natural spirits... all are some form of fairy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re what?\" Amelia asked. It hadn\u0027t occurred to Amelia to leave, and that seemed to be okay with Claudine, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to become an angel,\" Claudine said softly. Her huge brown eyes looked luminous. \"After years of being... well, a good citizen, I guess you\u0027d call it, I got a person to guard. The Sook, here. And she\u0027s really kept me busy.\" Claudine looked proud and happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not supposed to prevent pain?\" I asked. If so, Claudine was doing a lousy job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I wish I could.\" The expression on Claudine\u0027s oval face was downcast. \"But I can help you recover from disasters, and sometimes I can prevent them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things would be worse without you around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded vigorously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take your word for it,\" I said. \"How come I rated a fairy godmother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not allowed to say,\" Claudine said, and Amelia rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not learning a lot, here,\" she said. \"And in view of the problems we had last night, maybe you\u0027re not the most competent fairy godmother, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right, Miss I-Sealed-Up-The-Apartment-So-It-Would-Be-All-Fresh,\" I responded, irrationally indignant at this assault on my godmother\u0027s competence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia scrambled out of her chair, her skin flushed with anger. \"Well, I did seal it up! He would have risen like that no matter when he rose! I just delayed it some!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would have helped if we had known he was in there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would have helped if your ho of a cousin hadn\u0027t killed him in the first place!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both screeched to a halt in our dialogue. \"Are you sure that\u0027s what happened?\" I asked. \"Claudine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she said, her voice placid. \"I\u0027m not omnipotent or omniscient. I just pop in to intervene when I can. You remember that time you fell asleep at the wheel and I got there in time to save you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she\u0027d nearly given me a heart attack in the process, appearing in the front seat of the car in the blink of an eye. \"Yes,\" I said, trying to sound grateful and humble. \"I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really, really hard to get somewhere that fast,\" she said. \"I can only do that in a real emergency. I mean, a life-or-death emergency. Fortunately, I had a bit more time when your house was on fire...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudine was not going to give us any rules, or even explain the nature of the rule maker. I\u0027d just have to muddle through on my belief system, which had helped me out all my life. Come to think of it, if I was completely wrong, I didn\u0027t want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting,\" said Amelia. \"But we have a few more things to talk about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she was being so hoity-toity because she didn\u0027t have her own fairy godmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want to talk about first?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027d you leave the hospital last night?\" Her face was tight with resentment. \"You should have told me. I hauled myself up these stairs last night to look for you, and there you were. And you\u0027d barricaded the door. So I had to go back down the damn stairs again to get my keys, and let myself in the French windows, and hurry - on this leg - to the alarm system to turn it off. And then this dooms was sitting by your bed, and she could have done all of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t open the windows with magic?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was too tired,\" she said with dignity. \"I had to recharge my magical batteries, so to speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So to speak,\" I said, my voice dry. \"Well, last night, I found out...\" and I stopped dead. I simply couldn\u0027t speak of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Found out what?\" Amelia was exasperated, and I couldn\u0027t say as I blamed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill, her first lover, was planted in Bon Temps to seduce her and gain her trust,\" Claudine said. \"Last night, he admitted that to her face, and in front of her only other lover, another vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a synopsis, it was flawless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... that sucks,\" Amelia said faintly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said. \"It does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t kill him for you,\" Claudine said. \"I\u0027d have to take too many steps backward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay,\" I told her. \"He\u0027s not worth your losing any brownie points.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m not a brownie,\" Claudine explained kindly. \"I thought you understood. I\u0027m a full-blooded fairy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia was trying not to laugh, and I glared at her. \"Just let it go, witch,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, telepath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what next?\" I asked, in general. I would not talk any more about my broken heart and my demolished self-worth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We figure out what happened,\" the witch said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How? Call CSI?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudine looked confused, so I guessed fairies didn\u0027t watch television.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Amelia said, with elaborate patience. \"We do an ectoplasmic reconstruction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sure that my expression matched Claudine\u0027s, now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, let me explain,\" Amelia said, grinning all over. \"This is what we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia, in seventh heaven at this exhibition of her wonderful witch powers, told Claudine and me at length about the procedure. It was time- and energy-consuming, she said, which was why it wasn\u0027t done more often. And you had to gather at least four witches, she estimated, to cover the amount of square footage involved in Jake\u0027s murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll need real witches,\" Amelia said. \"Quality workers, not some hedgerow Wiccan.\" Amelia went off on Wiccans for a good long while. She despised Wiccans (unfairly) as tree-hugging wannabes - that came out of Amelia\u0027s thoughts clearly enough. I regretted Amelia\u0027s prejudice, as I\u0027d met some impressive Wiccans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudine looked down at me, her expression doubtful. \"I\u0027m not sure we ought to be here for this,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can go, Claudine.\" I was ready to experiment with anything, just to take my mind off the big hole in my heart. \"I\u0027m going to stay to watch. I have to know what happened here. There are too many mysteries in my life, right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have to go to the queen\u0027s tonight,\" Claudine said. \"You missed last night. Visiting the queen is a dress-up occasion. I have to take you shopping. You don\u0027t want to wear any of your cousin\u0027s clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that my butt could get into them,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that your butt should want to,\" she said, equally harshly. \"You can cut that out right now, Sookie Stackhouse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at her, letting her see the pain inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I get that,\" she said, her hand patting me gently on the cheek. \"And that sucks big-time. But you have to write it off. He\u0027s only one guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been the first guy. \"My grandmother served him lemonade,\" I said, and somehow that triggered the tears again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Amelia said. \"Fuck him, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the young witch. She was pretty and tough and off-the-wall nuts, I thought. She was okay. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"When can you do the ecto thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I have to make some phone calls, see who I can get together. Night\u0027s always better for magic, of course. When will you go pay your call to the queen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought for a moment. \"Just at full dark,\" I said. \"Maybe about seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should take about two hours,\" Amelia said, and Claudine nodded. \"Okay, I\u0027ll ask them to be here at ten, to have a little wiggle room. You know, it would be great if the queen would pay for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much do you want to charge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d do it for nothing, to have the experience and be able to say I\u0027d done one,\" Amelia said frankly, \"but the others will need some bucks. Say, three hundred apiece, plus materials.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ll need three more witches?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to have three more, though whether I can get the ones I want on this short notice... well, I\u0027ll do the best I can. Two might do. And the materials ought to be...\" She did some rapid mental calculations. \"Somewhere in the ballpark of sixty dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will I need to do? I mean, what\u0027s my part?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Observe. I\u0027ll do the heavy lifting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll ask the queen.\" I took a deep breath. \"If she won\u0027t pay for it, I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then. We\u0027re set.\" She limped out of the bedroom happily, counting off things on her fingers. I heard her go down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudine said, \"I have to treat your arm. And then we need to go find you something to wear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to spend money on a courtesy call to the vampire queen.\" Especially since I might have to foot the bill for the witches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to. It\u0027s my treat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may be my fairy godmother, but you don\u0027t have to spend money on me.\" I had a sudden revelation. \"It\u0027s you who paid my hospital bill in Clarice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudine shrugged. \"Hey, it\u0027s money that came in from the strip club, not from my regular job.\" Claudine co-owned the strip club in Ruston, with Claude, who did all the day-today running of the place. Claudine was a customer service person at a department store. People forgot their complaints once they were confronted with Claudine\u0027s smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true that I didn\u0027t mind spending the strip club money as much as I would have hated using up Claudine\u0027s personal savings. Not logical, but true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudine had parked her car in the courtyard on the circular drive, and she was sitting in it when I came down the stairs. She\u0027d gotten a first aid kit from the car, and she\u0027d bandaged my arm and helped me into some clothes. My arm was sore but it didn\u0027t seem to be infected. I was weak, as if I\u0027d had the flu or some other illness involving high fever and lots of fluids. So I was moving slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wearing blue jeans and sandals and a T-shirt, because that was what I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You definitely can\u0027t call on the queen in that,\" she said, gently but decisively. Whether she was very familiar with New Orleans or just had good shopping karma, Claudine drove directly to a store in the Garden District. It was the kind of shop I\u0027d dismiss as being for more sophisticated women with lots more money than I had, if I\u0027d been shopping by myself. Claudine pulled right into the parking lot, and in forty-five minutes we had a dress. It was chiffon, short-sleeved, and it had lots of colors in it: turquoise, copper, brown, ivory. The strappy sandals that I wore with it were brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I needed was a membership to the country club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudine had appropriated the price tag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just wear your hair loose,\" Claudine advised. \"You don\u0027t need fancy hair with that dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, there is a lot going on in it,\" I said. \"Who\u0027s Diane von Furstenburg? Isn\u0027t it real expensive? Isn\u0027t it a little bare for the season?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might be a little cool wearing it in March,\" Claudine conceded. \"But it\u0027ll be good to wear every summer for years. You\u0027ll look great. And the queen will know you took the time to wear something special to meet her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t go with me?\" I asked, feeling a little wistful. \"No, of course, you can\u0027t.\" Vampires buzz around fairies like hummingbirds around sugar water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might not survive,\" she said, managing to sound embarrassed that such a possibility would keep her from my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it. After all, the worst thing has already happened, right?\" I spread my hands. \"They used to threaten me, you know? If I didn\u0027t do thus and such, they\u0027d take it out on Bill. Hey, guess what? I don\u0027t care any more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think before you speak,\" Claudine advised. \"You can\u0027t mouth off to the queen. Even a goblin won\u0027t mouth off to the queen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise,\" I said. \"I really appreciate your coming all this way, Claudine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaudine gave me a big hug. It was like an embrace with a soft tree, since Claudine was so tall and slim. \"I wish you hadn\u0027t needed me to,\" she said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/definitely-dead-sookie-stackhouse-6/page-16.html","bookId":2196,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:31 PM"}
