Any man under the same suspicion you are under now I would simply challenge to a duel and shoot like the dog he is. However,’ he paused for a moment to take a breath, ‘that will not be possible in your case, since you are… not quite as male as I could wish.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere! That was why I was not afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You mean because I’m a girl,’ I pointed out. ‘Which means I am female, not male. You can say the word, you know. It’s not poisonous.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, but it is,’ he responded, coolly. ‘Poisonous to my reputation, and now to my interests. I must have that file, Mr Linton. However, you were right: I am a gentleman. And because of that unfortunate condition you conceal under your trousers, I, as a gentleman, can neither search you nor kill you to gain what I must have.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunate condition? God, this fellow really needed his head examined!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why are you so bloody convinced that it was me who stole your precious papers, anyway?’ I lashed out. ‘Why so determined to think that I am the guilty one? Why not some other member of your staff? The file could have been gone for days.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, it couldn’t,’ he replied curtly. ‘Because nobody had access to the files in the safe.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nobody else had another key? And what about the one you gave me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why these pointless questions?’ he asked, shaking his head. ‘We both know that you are guilty! There is no duplicate key, and the one I gave you was in my own possession the entire time since last Wednesday when-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, his head-shaking ceased. His whole body froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes?’ I demanded. ‘When what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly he came out of his paralysis and turned his head to face me directly. His dark eyes flashed as though a storm was raging in them. For one moment he looked so dangerous I actually took a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I realized that for once, his anger was not directed at me. A word passed his lips like the hiss of a snake preparing to strike:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Simmons!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarim let out a low oath in a language I didn’t understand. But the way he said it, I didn’t have to know the words to know that it was a curse. He had obviously understood. I, on the contrary, was still completely in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Simmons?’ I echoed, making it a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe met my eyes with his deep, dark, blue-grey ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. Simmons, Mr Linton. Simmons, my previous private secretary. Simmons, who disappeared a few days ago without any explanation. Simmons, the treacherous snake.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a few long strides Mr Ambrose was over at my desk and started rifling through my drawers. The wooden ones in the desk, I mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What are you doing?’ I demanded. ‘I thought your big bull already checked those.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarim threw me a look that signified about a ton of displeasure. Apparently he didn’t appreciate his new nickname. I made a mental note to use it again at the earliest opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Karim did search the drawers,’ Mr Ambrose agreed. ‘But he searched them for the missing file, not for a sign of where the traitor who has taken the file might have gone. This was his desk once.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So you think that this Simmons did it now? You no longer think it was me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No! I was a fool to ever have thought it. After all, you’re only…’ He waved his hand non-committally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A girl?’ I piped up. ‘Is that what you were going to say? We females can steal things just as well as any man, thank you very much!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A moment ago you were afraid of me thinking you’re guilty, and now you praise your skills as a thief?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not my skills, but the skills of womanhood in general! And I was certainly not afraid.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You were not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do I look afraid to you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ he admitted. ‘You look superfluous. Leave the room. I and my men have a thief to catch.’ He nodded to the door and returned to his work of rifling through the desk, as if I had already left, or as if I had ceased to exist entirely. That, I was sure, was how he would have preferred things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing my arms, I planted myself in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m not going anywhere.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I give you the rest of the day off,’ he said, not looking at me. ‘Go and enjoy your holiday. Trust me when I say I do not give holidays often.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘With me it seems that is almost the only thing you do! I did not come here to juggle meaningless pieces of paper like a monkey trained for some circus and then be chucked out after half a day. I came here to work! And if you have a thief to catch, I will come with you!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just for your information,’ he said, ‘the pieces of paper that you have “juggled” as you put it have most certainly not been meaningless.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still didn’t bother to turn around and look at me. All I could do was send my furious glares at his broad, hard back, and that did nothing to calm me down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They all pertain to my business in a very real way,’ he continued. ‘And you are nothing whatsoever like a circus monkey. A monkey wouldn’t talk back at me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But it might bite!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m not sure I wouldn’t prefer that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is that so?’ I took an involuntary step towards him. ‘Well, I could try if you wished.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis neck muscles tensed. ‘No need to put yourself to trouble. Go home. That is an order.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No!’ I stamped my foot. I didn’t care if I made a spectacle of myself. He was going to accept me whether he wanted to or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You cannot refuse to go home if I send you away.’ I wouldn’t have believed his voice could grow colder than it already was. But he was reaching new heights of vocal deep-freezing. ‘You work for me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Exactly.’ I nodded. ‘I work for you. And just as I could protest if you were to keep me at work longer than the normal hours, I have the right to protest if you send me away early. You accepted my work in exchange for a salary, Mr Ambrose, and I intend to earn that salary. I will not accept charity from anyone, and most certainly not from you.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-50.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:58 PM"}
