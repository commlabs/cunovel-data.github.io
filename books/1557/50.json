Little lady can\u0027t take care of herself. Needs to call her boss for help. No, she wouldn\u0027t play into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still part of the investigation. Fine, that was all she wanted. A foot in the door. She started digging up all she could on the roommate, Kimmy Dale. It wasn\u0027t too difficult. Kimmy had a record for prostitution. Despite what people thought, prostitution was not legal in Clark County, where Las Vegas is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Dale\u0027s old probation officers, an old-timer named Taylor, was in early. He remembered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I tell you?\" Taylor began. \"Kimmy Dale had a bad family history, but what girl out here doesn\u0027t? You ever listen to Howard Stern on the radio?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever listen when he has strippers on? He always kinda jokingly asks, \u0027And you were first abused at what age?\u0027 and the thing is, they always have an answer. They always were. They sit there and say it\u0027s great getting naked and they made their own choice, blah blah, but there\u0027s always something in the background. You know what I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Kimmy Dale was another classic case. She ran away from home and started stripping when she was probably fourteen, fifteen tops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where she is now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She moved out to Reno. I got a home address if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her Kimmy Dale\u0027s home address. \"Last I heard she works out of a place called the Eager Beaver, which, believe it or not, is not as classy as the name would lead you to believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEager Beaver, she thought. Wasn\u0027t that where Yates said Charles Talley worked?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor said, \"Nice town, Reno. Not like Vegas. Don\u0027t get me wrong. I love Vegas. We all do. It\u0027s awful and horrible and mobbed up, but we don\u0027t leave. You know what I\u0027m saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m calling you from Newark, New Jersey,\" she said. \"So yeah, I know what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor laughed. \"Anyway, Reno is actually a pretty nice place to raise a family nowadays. Good weather because it\u0027s below the Sierra Nevada mountains. Used to be divorce capital of the USA and have more millionaires per capita than anywhere in the country. You ever been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you cute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adorable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So come out to Vegas. I\u0027ll show you around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next plane, I\u0027m there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, you\u0027re not one of those \u0027I-hate-men\u0027 feminazis, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only when I don\u0027t get enough sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s this about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell phone began to ring. \"I\u0027ll fill you in later, okay? Thanks, Taylor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll stay at the Mandalay Bay. I know a guy. You\u0027ll love it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, soon, bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hung up and hit the answer button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout preamble, Mother Katherine said, \"She was murdered, wasn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoren was about to hem and haw again, but something in Mother Katherine\u0027s tone told her it would be a waste of time. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I need to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t allowed to say anything before. Sister Mary Rose was very specific.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Specific about what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please come by my office as soon as you can, Loren. I need to show you something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you, Agent Yates?\" Olivia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the door, Cal Dollinger\u0027s eyes swept the room. Adam Yates sat and rested his elbows on his thighs. \"You own a lot of books,\" Yates said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very observant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they yours or your husband\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia put her hands on her hips. \"Yes, I can see how that would be relevant, so let me clear your mind. Most of the books belong to me. Are we done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates smiled. \"You\u0027re very amusing,\" he said. \"Isn\u0027t she amusing, Cal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal nodded. \"Most strippers and whores, they\u0027re bitter. But not her. She\u0027s a slice of sunshine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sunshine indeed,\" Yates added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia did not like the way this was going. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You faked your own death,\" Yates said. \"That\u0027s a crime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That girl who really died,\" he went on. \"What was her name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name was Cassandra, wasn\u0027t it?\" Yates leaned in a little. \"Were you the one who murdered her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia held her ground. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates\u0027s hands tightened into fists, then relaxed. She glanced at the door. Cal remained calm, a statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates tried a smile. \"Where\u0027s the tape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia stiffened. She flashed back to that trailer. There had been a horrible smell when she and Kimmy first moved into it, as if small animals had died in the walls. Kimmy had bought some heavy potpourri- much too perfumed. It tried to mask something that could never really be hidden. The smell came back to her now. She saw Cassandra\u0027s crumpled body. She remembered the fear on Clyde Rangor\u0027s face as he asked:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the tape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to keep her voice from cracking. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you run away and change your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I needed a fresh start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Olivia said. \"Nothing about it was \u0027just like that.\u0027 \" She stood. \"And I don\u0027t want to answer any more questions until my attorney is present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates looked up at her. \"Sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you both out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked over at Cal Dollinger again. Still playing statue. He had eyes with nothing behind them. Olivia did as Yates said. She sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to say something like, \u0027You got a nice life here, you wouldn\u0027t want me to spoil it all for you,\u0027 \" Yates began. \"But I\u0027m not sure that will work. Your neighborhood is a cesspool. Your house is a dump. Your husband is an ex-con wanted in a triple murder.\" He gave her the smile. \"One would have thought you\u0027d have made the most of your new start, Candi. But amazingly you did just the opposite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was intentionally trying to antagonize her. Olivia wouldn\u0027t let that happen. \"I\u0027d like you both to leave now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t care who learns your secret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could arrest you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when she decided to take the chance. Olivia put out her hands, as if ready to be cuffed. Yates did not move. He could arrest her, of course. She wasn\u0027t sure of the exact law or the statute of limitations, but she had clearly interfered with a murder investigation- she had, in fact, pretended to be the victim. It would be more than enough to hold her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn\u0027t what Yates wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde\u0027s pleading voice: \"Where\u0027s the tape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYates wanted something else. Something Cassandra had died for. Something Clyde Rangor had killed for. She looked into his face. The eyes were steady. His hands kept clenching and unclenching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer wrists were still together in front of her. She waited another second, then dropped them back to her sides. \"I don\u0027t know anything about any tapes,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Yates\u0027s turn to study her. He took his time. \"I believe you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for some reason the way he said it scared her more than anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please come with us,\" Yates said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking you in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On what charge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want the list alphabetically?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll need to call my attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can call him from the precinct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not sure how to play this. Cal Dollinger took a step toward her. When she took a step back, the big man said, \"You want me to drag you out of here in cuffs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia stopped. \"That won\u0027t be necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed outside. Yates took the lead. Dollinger stayed next to her. Olivia checked the streets. The giant brown beer bottle was in the sky. For some reason it gave her comfort. Yates walked ahead. He unlocked the car door, slid in, started it up. He turned back and looked at Olivia and suddenly it hit her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe recognized him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNames fled easily, but faces were her prisoners for life. When she\u0027d danced it became a way of numbing herself. She\u0027d studied the faces. She\u0027d memorize them, classify them by their level of boredom and enjoyment, try to remember how many times they\u0027d been there. It had been a mental exercise, a way to distract herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam Yates had been to Clyde\u0027s club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe may have hesitated or maybe Cal Dollinger was just attuned to what was going on around him. She was about to flee, just start running until her legs gave out, but Dollinger put a firm hand on her arm. He squeezed the spot above her elbow just hard enough to get her attention. She tried to pull away, but it was like pulling your arm out of a concrete block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were almost at the car now. Cal picked up speed. Olivia\u0027s eyes skimmed the street, pausing on Lawrence. He was standing on the corner, swaying with another man she didn\u0027t know. Both of them had brown paper bags in their hand. Lawrence looked at her and started to raise his hand to wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia mouthed the words: Help me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence\u0027s face didn\u0027t change. There was no reaction at all. The other man made a joke. Lawrence laughed long and hard and slapped his thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t seen her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey approached the car. Olivia\u0027s mind raced. She did not want to get in with them. She tried to slow her walk. Dollinger gave her arm a quick, painful pinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep moving,\" the big man told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the back door. Dollinger opened it. She tried to hold her ground, but his grip was simply too strong. He pushed her into the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo, got a dollar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big man took a quick glance. It was Lawrence. Dollinger started turning away, dismissing the panhandler, but Lawrence grabbed his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo, man, I\u0027m hungry. Got a dollar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buzz off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence put his hands on the big man\u0027s chest. \"I\u0027m just asking for a dollar, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dollar. Is that too much to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was when Dollinger let go of her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia hesitated but not for long. When both of Dollinger\u0027s hands gripped Lawrence by the front of his shirt, she was ready. She jumped up and started to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run, Liv!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence didn\u0027t have to tell her twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDollinger dropped Lawrence and spun around. Lawrence jumped on the big man\u0027s back. Dollinger shrugged him off like dandruff. Then Lawrence did something truly foolish. He hit Dollinger with the brown bag. Olivia could hear the clunk from the beer bottle inside. Dollinger turned around and punched Lawrence in the sternum. Lawrence went down hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDollinger shouted, \"Stop! FBI!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think so, big man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia heard the car take off. The tires squealed as Yates peeled out. She glanced behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDollinger was catching up to her. And he had a gun in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lead was maybe fifty feet. She ran as hard as she could. This was her neighborhood. She\u0027d have the advantage, right? She cut down a back alley. It was empty- nobody else in sight. Dollinger followed. She risked a look back. He was gaining on her and didn\u0027t look the least bit put out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun forward and ran harder, pumping her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bullet whizzed by her. Then another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God. He\u0027s shooting!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to get out of the alley. Had to find people. He wouldn\u0027t just shoot her in front of a lot of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe veered right back onto the street. The car was there. Yates sped toward her. She rolled over a parked car and onto the sidewalk. They were at the old Pabst Blue Ribbon factory. Soon it would be gone, replaced with yet another no-personality shopping center. But right now the broken-down ruins could be a haven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, where was that old tavern?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swerved to the left. It was down the second alley. She remembered that. Olivia did not dare look behind her, but she could hear his footsteps now. He was gaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike hell, she thought. The tavern. Where the hell was that tavern?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBingo, there it was!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was on the right. She wasn\u0027t far from it. She ran hard. She grabbed the handle as Dollinger made the turn. She pulled the door open and fell inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one person inside. He was cleaning glasses behind the bar. He looked up in surprise. Olivia stood and quickly threw the bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" the bartender shouted, \"what\u0027s going on here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone is trying to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door shook. \"FBI. Open up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia shook her head. The bartender hesitated, then gestured toward the back room with his head. She ran for it. The bartender picked up a shotgun as Dollinger kicked the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender was startled by the size of the man. \"Jesus H. Christ!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"FBI! Drop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just slow down, buddy...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDollinger pointed his gun at the bartender and fired twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender went down, leaving only a splash of blood on the wall behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my God oh my God oh my God!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia wanted to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Go. Hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about the baby inside her. It gave her the extra spurt. She dove into the back room where the bartender had gestured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunfire raked the wall behind her. Olivia dropped to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crawled toward the back door. It was made of heavy metal. There was a key in the lock. In one move she pulled the door open and twisted the key so hard that it broke in the knob. She rolled back into the sunlight. The door closed and locked automatically behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him twisting the knob. When that didn\u0027t work, he began to pound on the door. This time the door would not give way easily. Olivia ran, keeping off the main streets, looking out for both Yates\u0027s car and Dollinger on foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw neither.
