She allowed it, though, and even leaned closer to look at the paper in his hands. Apparently, the weird conversation had relieved the strain between her and the rest of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is up with that?” I agreed, though I had a feeling I knew. They wanted to protect her. “Maybe they’re worried about her hands.” I’d said it jokingly, but there was a kernel of truth there. The vampires had kidnapped her and wanted to preserve her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd somehow I played a part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” Emma chirped. “Let’s ask Ronan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up, and there he was. I braced instantly, trying to put up shields I knew would be no match for those green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ronan,” I said under my breath. “Speak of the devil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRonan made a beeline for the table. There were many of us he taught, but a small part of me hoped that I was the one he was coming to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked that emotion. If anyone would be able to sense my bond with Carden, it’d be Ronan. If anything, I should be avoiding him. Besides, the vampire wouldn’t take kindly to the quasi-friendship we shared. I had enough complications in my life without testing that theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized I was glaring at him when he glared at me back. I had to say something now. “Good evening to you, too, Ronan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, he stopped by my chair. “Will you be ready to work tomorrow morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would he even ask me that? And why did I feel like his gaze could pierce right through me? I forced myself not to squirm under the scrutiny. “Do I have a choice?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I saw it—the briefest smile flickered across his features and was gone just as fast. He’d told me once how I reminded him of his sister who’d been killed in Watcher training. What else did he see when he looked at me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at my tray. “Are you finished here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMei-Ling was eating quietly. I didn’t want to leave her alone. I glanced at my friends, an unasked question in my eyes. Emma nodded. She’d keep an eye out for my mysterious roommate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I’m done.” I stood and gathered my tray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Walk with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to get back soon.” Curfew was coming, and it was time for all good girls to be nestled safe in their beds. “We Acari aren’t allowed to roam like you guys.” I chafed my arms, feeling as bitter as the wind that pummeled me even through the thick wool of my coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll drop you at the dorm,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was September and the end of the dimming, which meant the sun was dipping low on the horizon. Full darkness was back—thank God. I thought I’d never see it again. And I thought I’d never want to. But the body craves darkness. There was a metaphor in there somewhere that I didn’t want to spend too much time analyzing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind went to Carden. Would I see him one more time today? I told myself it didn’t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you?” Something about Ronan’s tone was stilted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did he want to know? Had he already guessed about my bond with Carden?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpossible. I was imagining things. Interactions with me were always stilted. If he sounded weird, it was just more of my own social ineptitude. So why the inane question?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you better than that, Ronan.” I attempted a smile over my chattering teeth. “I don’t think you pulled me from the dining hall just to ask how I was doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strained look on his face told me I was right. “I wanted to ask you what it is you think you’re doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” I asked, instantly on the defensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression softened. “You’re in danger, Annelise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard about the killer. I know…I’ll be careful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not the killer that concerns me. It’s Carden McCloud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy every sense went on alert. “Why would you say that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut a look at me. “Do not pretend naïveté. I see how he favors you. The other vampires have noticed it, too. Your name has been on many a vampire tongue, and it’s a concern.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething deep inside me deflated. A secret part of me had hoped maybe Ronan was having a guy’s reaction to Carden—that maybe he was jealous. Instead, it was just a concerned-teacher reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRonan was one of my primary instructors, not to mention the Tracer who’d brought me in. If my bond with Carden was discovered, would Ronan get in trouble as well? He’d warned me not to trust Alcántara. Given time, I’m sure he’d warn me against Carden McCloud, too. And if he ever found out I’d bonded with McCloud? Fellow Scotsman be damned, Ronan’s head would probably explode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just keeping an eye out for me?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy tone had been cynical, but Ronan’s reply was serious. Heartfelt, even. “I am looking out for you. Is that such a surprise?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just shook my head, needing a moment to rid my throat of this tight feeling. I spent so much time armored against my solitude. To be reminded that there might’ve actually been some people out there who cared…it sideswiped me with emotions I couldn’t afford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You must be careful,” he continued, slowing his pace. He lowered his voice and looked around to make sure we were alone. “Vampires have their own agenda. You must always be wary. And if you ever need help, you can come to me. Don’t wait until it’s too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed hard, the ache in my throat too thick. I’d already ignored careful and had flown right past too late. “Thanks,” I said, mustering a weak smile. “But there’s nothing to worry about between me and Carden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuilt crushed my chest. I’d assumed the worst of Ronan, and now, by underplaying my relationship with Carden, I was lying to him, too. “I’ve been staying away from him these days anyway,” I added, consoled that at least that part was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I thought of a problem I could bring to Ronan. If anyone could give me insight as to why the vampires had abducted Mei-Ling, it’d be him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is something I do need help with,” I said. “My roommate. I don’t get why she’s here. They took her, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” he said, his voice tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought only girls who’d hit rock bottom ended up here. Your hoodoo-juju powers aside, it was me who walked up the steps into that plane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What you say is true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So now they’re kidnapping girls for their little Watcher army?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mei-Ling is the only one,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But she’s just a kid from Long Island. What can she do for a bunch of vampires?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s not entirely helpless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared hard at him. “You sure are being mysterious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, he conceded, “She tried to fight back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pictured Mei-Ling. Slim. Young. With a name meaning beautiful, delicate. The image of her fighting back made me ill. She’d had some fancy school and parents who loved her. She shouldn’t have had to learn to fight back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flashed back to those times I’d tried to fight back at fifteen—and I’d only ever faced off against my father. Mei had been up against Tracer Otto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a mental note to kick his ass someday. Him and so many others…It was getting to be one long list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’d she possibly fight back against Adolph?” I sneered, using my pet name for the detested Tracer Otto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Caution, Annelise.” Ronan cut me a look, then glanced around to make certain no one was close enough to overhear. “Otto came for her after school. As I understand it, she stabbed him in the throat with her violin bow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckled, surprised and more than a little amused. “Go, Mei, go. Maybe she’ll last more than a week after all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRonan smirked. I got the impression he wasn’t the biggest Otto fan. “She caught him by surprise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fighting spirit or not, she’s just a regular kid. She’s not saying much, but I’m sure she must be terrified. How’s she even going to make it through the week? Once the other Acari get wind of her, they’ll chew her up and spit her out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe her placement with you was intentional,” Ronan said evenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped short. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are how she’s going to make it through the week. I believe that’s why she was placed with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait, you’re saying they put her with me on purpose? Why me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRonan shook his head, frowning like I was a puzzle to be muddled out. “Have you heard how you’ve been speaking? Have you heard your own outrage? All you have said to me is true. Other Acari would’ve met a younger girl, sensed weakness, and struck. But not you. Look how you’ve reacted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. The moment I saw how young and scared she was, I went into protective mode. Apparently I had some shreds of humanity left inside. I guess that was heartening. Heartening and stupid. “Are you saying the vampires hoped I’d bring her under my wing? Why would they care whether or not she’s safe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know for certain,” he said quietly. “What I do know is, it would probably serve both of you well should you use your best efforts to help keep her alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As in, if something happens to her, I’m toast?” As if I didn’t have enough on my mind. He’d paused but began walking again, and I did a little jog to catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the dorm, and I bobbed up and down on my toes as we stood there. I was chilled, and it wasn’t entirely due to the weather. “So, tomorrow. Did you have to make our class at seven in the morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have many students.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Couldn’t you have made them get up at dawn? What are we doing that can’t wait till, I don’t know, nine a.m.?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s time to bring your swimming to the next level.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-fever-the-watchers-3/page-6.html","bookId":2293,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:38 PM"}
