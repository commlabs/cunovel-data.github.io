If we ever fail to receive strength and defense from Him, it is because we are not on the outlook for it. Many a proffered succour from heaven goes past us, because we are not standing on our watch-tower to catch the far-off indications of its approach, and to fling open the gates of our heart for its entrance. He whose expectation does not lead him to be on the alert for its coming will get but little. Watch for God in the events of your life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe old homely proverb says: \"They that watch for Providence will never want a providence to watch for,\" and you may turn it the other way and say, \"They that do not watch for providences will never have a providence to watch for.\" Unless you put out your water-jars when it rains you will catch no water.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe want to be more business-like and use common sense with God in pleading promises. If you were to go to one of the banks, and see a man go in and out and lay a piece of paper on the table, and take it up again and nothing more--if he did that several times a day, I think there would soon be orders to keep the man out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThose men who come to the bank in earnest present their checks, they wait until they receive their gold, and then they go; but not without having transacted real business.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey do not put the paper down, speak about the excellent signature, and discuss the excellent document; but they want their money for it, and they are not content without it. These are the people who are always welcome at the bank, and not triflers. Alas, a great many people play at praying. They do not expect God to give them an answer, and thus they are mere triflers. Our Heavenly Father would have us do real business with Him in our praying. --C. H. Spurgeon.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Thine expectation shall not be cut off.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　 四月六日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“我要站在守望所，立在望楼上观看，看耶和华对我说什么话“（哈二：1）。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　不等神的帮助，不得神的帮助。许多时侯我们从神那里得不到所求的，都因为我们没有等候他的答应。许多从天来的援助只经过我们，而不临到我们，都是因为我们没有站在守望所远远看它临近，开我们的心门来迎接它。所以一个人的期待，倘使不能警觉到神助之将临，所得必属稀少。在你生命的过程中，应随时注意着神。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　古谚有云：“凡是等候天神的人，就无需天神守护”。反过来也可以说：“凡是不守候天神的人，就没有天神守护他”。天下雨的时侯，你如果不把你的水缸拿出来，你还是得不到水。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　人到银行里去支钱，决不会一会儿进去，一会儿出来，一会儿把支票放在柜台上，一会儿把它收回来——如果有人一天这样作几次的话，我想定规会有命令下来把这人赶出去。凡诚心到银行里来拿钱的人，都是把支票交出来，静静地在那里等待，直到他们拿到了钱，然后出去的。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　正常的人往银行去取款，决不会把支票放下，反而空论签字的笔法如何，纸张的优劣又如何。记着，人到银行的目的是取款，取不到不罢休，这才是银行欢迎的顾客，不是浪费时间去作无聊之事。啊，可惜今天有顶多的人把祷告当作儿戏。他们祷告了，不等神的答应，就收回了；再求，再收。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　信徒们，让我们学习在守望所的望楼上多守候神！——司布真\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“你的指望…不至断绝”（箴二十三：18）。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5032.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:41:12 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:41:12 AM"}
