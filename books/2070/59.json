She masked her fears behind a face kept still and stern, yet they were there all the same, growing with every league they crossed. Her days were anxious, her nights restless, and every raven that flew overhead made her clench her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe feared for her lord father, and wondered at his ominous silence. She feared for her brother Edmure, and prayed that the gods would watch over him if he must face the Kingslayer in battle. She feared for Ned and her girls, and for the sweet sons she had left behind at Winterfell. And yet there was nothing she could do for any of them, and so she made herself put all thought of them aside. You must save your strength for Robb, she told herself. He is the only one you can help. You must be as fierce and hard as the north, Catelyn Tully. You must be a Stark for true now, like your son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobb rode at the front of the column, beneath the flapping white banner of Winterfell. Each day he would ask one of his lords to join him, so they might confer as they marched; he honored every man in turn, showing no favorites, listening as his lord father had listened, weighing the words of one against the other. He has learned so much from Ned, she thought as she watched him, but has he learned enough?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blackfish had taken a hundred picked men and a hundred swift horses and raced ahead to screen their movements and scout the way. The reports Ser Brynden\u0027s riders brought back did little to reassure her. Lord Tywin\u0027s host was still many days to the south . . . but Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing, had assembled a force of near four thousand men at his castles on the Green Fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Late again,\" Catelyn murmured when she heard. It was the Trident all over, damn the man. Her brother Edmure had called the banners; by rights, Lord Frey should have gone to join the Tully host at Riverrun, yet here he sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four thousand men,\" Robb repeated, more perplexed than angry. \"Lord Frey cannot hope to fight the Lannisters by himself. Surely he means to join his power to ours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he?\" Catelyn asked. She had ridden forward to join Robb and Robett Glover, his companion of the day. The vanguard spread out behind them, a slow-moving forest of lances and banners and spears. \"I wonder. Expect nothing of Walder Frey, and you will never be surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s your father\u0027s bannerman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some men take their oaths more seriously than others, Robb. And Lord Walder was always friendlier with Casterly Rock than my father would have liked. One of his sons is wed to Tywin Lannister\u0027s sister. That means little of itself, to be sure. Lord Walder has sired a great many children over the years, and they must needs marry someone. Still . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think he means to betray us to the Lannisters, my lady?\" Robett Glover asked gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatelyn sighed. \"If truth be told, I doubt even Lord Frey knows what Lord Frey intends to do. He has an old man\u0027s caution and a young man\u0027s ambition, and has never lacked for cunning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must have the Twins, Mother,\" Robb said heatedly. \"There is no other way across the river. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And so does Walder Frey, you can be sure of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night they made camp on the southern edge of the bogs, halfway between the kingsroad and the river. It was there Theon Greyjoy brought them further word from her uncle. \"Ser Brynden says to tell you he\u0027s crossed swords with the Lannisters. There are a dozen scouts who won\u0027t be reporting back to Lord Tywin anytime soon. Or ever.\" He grinned. \"Ser Addam Marbrand commands their outriders, and he\u0027s pulling back south, burning as he goes. He knows where we are, more or less, but the Blackfish vows he will not know when we split.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless Lord Frey tells him,\" Catelyn said sharply. \"Theon, when you return to my uncle, tell him he is to place his best bowmen around the Twins, day and night, with orders to bring down any raven they see leaving the battlements. I want no birds bringing word of my son\u0027s movements to Lord Tywin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ser Brynden has seen to it already, my lady,\" Theon replied with a cocky smile. \"A few more blackbirds, and we should have enough to bake a pie. I\u0027ll save you their feathers for a hat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ought to have known that Brynden Blackfish would be well ahead of her. \"What have the Freys been doing while the Lannisters burn their fields and plunder their holdfasts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s been some fighting between Ser Addam\u0027s men and Lord Walder\u0027s,\" Theon answered. \"Not a day\u0027s ride from here, we found two Lannister scouts feeding the crows where the Freys had strung them up. Most of Lord Walder\u0027s strength remains massed at the Twins, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat bore Walder Frey\u0027s seal beyond a doubt, Catelyn thought bitterly; hold back, wait, watch, take no risk unless forced to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he\u0027s been fighting the Lannisters, perhaps he does mean to hold to his vows,\" Robb said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatelyn was less encouraged. \"Defending his own lands is one thing, open battle against Lord Tywin quite another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobb turned back to Theon Greyjoy. \"Has the Blackfish found any other way across the Green Fork?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheon shook his head. \"The river\u0027s running high and fast. Ser Brynden says it can\u0027t be forded, not this far north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must have that crossing!\" Robb declared, fuming. \"Oh, our horses might be able to swim the river, I suppose, but not with armored men on their backs. We\u0027d need to build rafts to pole our steel across, helms and mail and lances, and we don\u0027t have the trees for that. Or the time. Lord Tywin is marching north . . . \" He balled his hand into a fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord Frey would be a fool to try and bar our way,\" Theon Greyjoy said with his customary easy confidence. \"We have five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you need to, Robb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not easily,\" Catelyn warned them, \"and not in time. While you were mounting your siege, Tywin Lannister would bring up his host and assault you from the rear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobb glanced from her to Greyjoy, searching for an answer and finding none. For a moment he looked even younger than his fifteen years, despite his mail and sword and the stubble on his cheeks. \"What would my lord father do?\" he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find a way across,\" she told him. \"Whatever it took.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning it was Ser Brynden Tully himself who rode back to them. He had put aside the heavy plate and helm he\u0027d worn as the Knight of the Gate for the lighter leather-and-mail of an outrider, but his obsidian fish still fastened his cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer uncle\u0027s face was grave as he swung down off his horse. \"There has been a battle under the walls of Riverrun,\" he said, his mouth grim. \"We had it from a Lannister outrider we took captive. The Kingslayer has destroyed Edmure\u0027s host and sent the lords of the Trident reeling in flight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold hand clutched at Catelyn\u0027s heart. \"And my brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wounded and taken prisoner,\" Ser Brynden said. \"Lord Blackwood and the other survivors are under siege inside Riverrun, surrounded by Jaime\u0027s host.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobb looked fretful. \"We must get across this accursed river if we\u0027re to have any hope of relieving them in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That will not be easily done,\" her uncle cautioned. \"Lord Frey has pulled his whole strength back inside his castles, and his gates are closed and barred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn the man,\" Robb swore. \"If the old fool does not relent and let me cross, he\u0027ll leave me no choice but to storm his walls. I\u0027ll pull the Twins down around his ears if I have to, we\u0027ll see how well he likes that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like a sulky boy, Robb,\" Catelyn said sharply. \"A child sees an obstacle, and his first thought is to run around it or knock it down. A lord must learn that sometimes words can accomplish what swords cannot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobb\u0027s neck reddened at the rebuke. \"Tell me what you mean, Mother,\" he said meekly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Freys have held the crossing for six hundred years, and for six hundred years they have never failed to exact their toll.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What toll? What does he want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"That is what we must discover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what if I do not choose to pay this toll?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you had best retreat back to Moat Cailin, deploy to meet Lord Tywin in battle . . . or grow wings. I see no other choices.\" Catelyn put her heels to her horse and rode off, leaving her son to ponder her words. It would not do to make him feel as if his mother were usurping his place. Did you teach him wisdom as well as valor, Ned? she wondered. Did you teach him how to kneel? The graveyards of the Seven Kingdoms were full of brave men who had never learned that lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was near midday when their vanguard came in sight of the Twins, where the Lords of the Crossing had their seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Green Fork ran swift and deep here, but the Freys had spanned it many centuries past and grown rich off the coin men paid them to cross. Their bridge was a massive arch of smooth grey rock, wide enough for two wagons to pass abreast; the Water Tower rose from the center of the span, commanding both road and river with its arrow slits, murder holes, and portcullises. It had taken the Freys three generations to complete their bridge; when they were done they\u0027d thrown up stout timber keeps on either bank, so no one might cross without their leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe timber had long since given way to stone. The Twins—two squat, ugly, formidable castles, identical in every respect, with the bridge arching between—had guarded the crossing for centuries. High curtain walls, deep moats, and heavy oak-and-iron gates protected the approaches, the bridge footings rose from within stout inner keeps, there was a barbican and portcullis on either bank, and the Water Tower defended the span itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne glance was sufficient to tell Catelyn that the castle would not be taken by storm. The battlements bristled with spears and swords and scorpions, there was an archer at every crenel and arrow slit, the drawbridge was up, the portcullis down, the gates closed and barred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Greatjon began to curse and swear as soon as he saw what awaited them. Lord Rickard Karstark glowered in silence. \"That cannot be assaulted, my lords,\" Roose Bolton announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor can we take it by siege, without an army on the far bank to invest the other castle,\" Helman Tallhart said gloomily. Across the deep-running green waters, the western twin stood like a reflection of its eastern brother. \"Even if we had the time. Which, to be sure, we do not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the northern lords studied the castle, a sally port opened, a plank bridge slid across the moat, and a dozen knights rode forth to confront them, led by four of Lord Walder\u0027s many sons. Their banner bore twin towers, dark blue on a field of pale silver-grey. Ser Stevron Frey, Lord Walder\u0027s heir, spoke for them. The Freys all looked like weasels; Ser Stevron, past sixty with grandchildren of his own, looked like an especially old and tired weasel, yet he was polite enough. \"My lord father has sent me to greet you, and inquire as to who leads this mighty host.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\" Robb spurred his horse forward. He was in his armor, with the direwolf shield of Winterfell strapped to his saddle and Grey Wind padding by his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old knight looked at her son with a faint flicker of amusement in his watery grey eyes, though his gelding whickered uneasily and sidled away from the direwolf. \"My lord father would be most honored if you would share meat and mead with him in the castle and explain your purpose here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words crashed among the lords bannermen like a great stone from a catapult. Not one of them approved. They cursed, argued, shouted down each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must not do this, my lord,\" Galbart Glover pleaded with Robb. \"Lord Walder is not to be trusted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoose Bolton nodded. \"Go in there alone and you\u0027re his. He can sell you to the Lannisters, throw you in a dungeon, or slit your throat, as he likes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he wants to talk to us, let him open his gates, and we will all share his meat and mead,\" declared Ser Wendel Manderly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or let him come out and treat with Robb here, in plain sight of his men and ours,\" suggested his brother, Ser Wylis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatelyn Stark shared all their doubts, but she had only to glance at Ser Stevron to see that he was not pleased by what he was hearing. A few more words and the chance would be lost. She had to act, and quickly. \"I will go,\" she said loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, my lady?\" The Greatjon furrowed his brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother, are you certain?\" Clearly, Robb was not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never more,\" Catelyn lied glibly. \"Lord Walder is my father\u0027s bannerman. I have known him since I was a girl. He would never offer me any harm.\" Unless he saw some profit in it, she added silently, but some truths did not bear saying, and some lies were necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am certain my lord father would be pleased to speak to the Lady Catelyn,\" Ser Stevron said. \"To vouchsafe for our good intentions, my brother Ser Perwyn will remain here until she is safely returned to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He shall be our honored guest,\" said Robb. Ser Perwyn, the youngest of the four Freys in the party, dismounted and handed the reins of his horse to a brother. \"I require my lady mother\u0027s return by evenfall, Ser Stevron,\" Robb went on. \"It is not my intent to linger here long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSer Stevron Frey gave a polite nod. \"As you say, my lord.\" Catelyn spurred her horse forward and did not look back. Lord Walder\u0027s sons and envoys fell in around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father had once said of Walder Frey that he was the only lord in the Seven Kingdoms who could field an army out of his breeches. When the Lord of the Crossing welcomed Catelyn in the great hall of the east castle, surrounded by twenty living sons (minus Ser Perwyn, who would have made twenty-one), thirty-six grandsons, nineteen great-grandsons, and numerous daughters, granddaughters, bastards, and grandbastards, she understood just what he had meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Walder was ninety, a wizened pink weasel with a bald spotted head, too gouty to stand unassisted. His newest wife, a pale frail girl of sixteen years, walked beside his litter when they carried him in. She was the eighth Lady Frey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord,\" Catelyn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man squinted at her suspiciously. \"Is it? I doubt that. Spare me your sweet words, Lady Catelyn, I am too old. Why are you here? Is your boy too proud to come before me himself? What am I to do with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatelyn had been a girl the last time she had visited the Twins, but even then Lord Walder had been irascible, sharp of tongue, and blunt of manner. Age had made him worse than ever, it would seem. She would need to choose her words with care, and do her best to take no offense from his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father,\" Ser Stevron said reproachfully, \"you forget yourself. Lady Stark is here at your invitation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I ask you? You are not Lord Frey yet, not until I die. Do I look dead? I\u0027ll hear no instructions from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is no way to speak in front of our noble guest, Father,\" one of his younger sons said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now my bastards presume to teach me courtesy,\" Lord Walder complained. \"I\u0027ll speak any way I like, damn you. I\u0027ve had three kings to guest in my life, and queens as well, do you think I require lessons from the likes of you, Ryger? Your mother was milking goats the first time I gave her my seed.\" He dismissed the red-faced youth with a flick of his fingers and gestured to two of his other sons. \"Danwell, Whalen, help me to my chair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shifted Lord Walder from his litter and carried him to the high seat of the Freys, a tall chair of black oak whose back was carved in the shape of two towers linked by a bridge. His young wife crept up timidly and covered his legs with a blanket. When he was settled, the old man beckoned Catelyn forward and planted a papery dry kiss on her hand. \"There,\" he announced. \"Now that I have observed the courtesies, my lady, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths. Why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To ask you to open your gates, my lord,\" Catelyn replied politely. \"My son and his lords bannermen are most anxious to cross the river and be on their way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Riverrun?\" He sniggered. \"Oh, no need to tell me, no need. I\u0027m not blind yet. The old man can still read a map.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Riverrun,\" Catelyn confirmed. She saw no reason to deny it. \"Where I might have expected to find you, my lord. You are still my father\u0027s bannerman, are you not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heh,\" said Lord Walder, a noise halfway between a laugh and a grunt. \"I called my swords, yes I did, here they are, you saw them on the walls. It was my intent to march as soon as all my strength was assembled. Well, to send my sons. I am well past marching myself, Lady Catelyn.\" He looked around for likely confirmation and pointed to a tall, stooped man of fifty years. \"Tell her, Jared. Tell her that was my intent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was, my lady,\" said Ser Jared Frey, one of his sons by his second wife. \"On my honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could march?\" He leaned back against his cushions and scowled at her, as if challenging her to dispute his version of events. \"I am told the Kingslayer went through him like an axe through ripe cheese. Why should my boys hurry south to die? All those who did go south are running north again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatelyn would gladly have spitted the querulous old man and roasted him over a fire, but she had only till evenfall to open the bridge. Calmly, she said, \"All the more reason that we must reach Riverrun, and soon. Where can we go to talk, my lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re talking now,\" Lord Frey complained. The spotted pink head snapped around. \"What are you all looking at?\" he shouted at his kin. \"Get out of here. Lady Stark wants to speak to me in private. Might be she has designs on my fidelity, heh. Go, all of you, find something useful to do. Yes, you too, woman. Out, out, out.\" As his sons and grandsons and daughters and bastards and nieces and nephews streamed from the hall, he leaned close to Catelyn and confessed, \"They\u0027re all waiting for me to die. Stevron\u0027s been waiting for forty years, but I keep disappointing him. Heh. Why should I die just so he can be a lord? I ask you. I won\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have every hope that you will live to be a hundred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would boil them, to be sure. Oh, to be sure. Now, what do you want to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want to cross,\" Catelyn told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, do you? That\u0027s blunt. Why should I let you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment her anger flared. \"If you were strong enough to climb your own battlements, Lord Frey, you would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside your walls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll be twenty thousand fresh corpses when Lord Tywin gets here,\" the old man shot back. \"Don\u0027t you try and frighten me, my lady. Your husband\u0027s in some traitor\u0027s cell under the Red Keep, your father\u0027s sick, might be dying, and Jaime Lannister\u0027s got your brother in chains. What do you have that I should fear? That son of yours? I\u0027ll match you son for son, and I\u0027ll still have eighteen when yours are all dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You swore an oath to my father,\" Catelyn reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bobbed his head side to side, smiling. \"Oh, yes, I said some words, but I swore oaths to the crown too, it seems to me. Joffrey\u0027s the king now, and that makes you and your boy and all those fools out there no better than rebels. If I had the sense the gods gave a fish, I\u0027d help the Lannisters boil you all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you?\" she challenged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Walder snorted with disdain. \"Lord Tywin the proud and splendid, Warden of the West, Hand of the King, oh, what a great man that one is, him and his gold this and gold that and lions here and lions there. I\u0027ll wager you, he eats too many beans, he breaks wind just like me, but you\u0027ll never hear him admit it, oh, no. What\u0027s he got to be so puffed up about anyway? Only two sons, and one of them\u0027s a twisted little monster. I\u0027ll match him son for son, and I\u0027ll still have nineteen and a half left when all of his are dead!\" He cackled. \"If Lord Tywin wants my help, he can bloody well ask for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all Catelyn needed to hear. \"I am asking for your help, my lord,\" she said humbly. \"And my father and my brother and my lord husband and my sons are asking with my voice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Walder jabbed a bony finger at her face. \"Save your sweet words, my lady. Sweet words I get from my wife. Did you see her? Sixteen she is, a little flower, and her honey\u0027s only for me. I wager she gives me a son by this time next year. Perhaps I\u0027ll make him heir, wouldn\u0027t that boil the rest of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m certain she will give you many sons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head bobbed up and down. \"Your lord father did not come to the wedding. An insult, as I see it. Even if he is dying. He never came to my last wedding either. He calls me the Late Lord Frey, you know. Does he think I\u0027m dead? I\u0027m not dead, and I promise you, I\u0027ll outlive him as I outlived his father. Your family has always pissed on me, don\u0027t deny it, don\u0027t lie, you know it\u0027s true. Years ago, I went to your father and suggested a match between his son and my daughter. Why not? I had a daughter in mind, sweet girl, only a few years older than Edmure, but if your brother didn\u0027t warm to her, I had others he might have had, young ones, old ones, virgins, widows, whatever he wanted. No, Lord Hoster would not hear of it. Sweet words he gave me, excuses, but what I wanted was to get rid of a daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your sister, that one, she\u0027s full as bad. It was, oh, a year ago, no more, Jon Arryn was still the King\u0027s Hand, and I went to the city to see my sons ride in the tourney. Stevron and Jared are too old for the lists now, but Danwell and Hosteen rode, Perwyn as well, and a couple of my bastards tried the melee. If I\u0027d known how they\u0027d shame me, I would never have troubled myself to make the journey. Why did I need to ride all that way to see Hosteen knocked off his horse by that Tyrell whelp? I ask you. The boy\u0027s half his age, Ser Daisy they call him, something like that. And Danwell was unhorsed by a hedge knight! Some days I wonder if those two are truly mine. My third wife was a Crakehall, all of the Crakehall women are sluts. Well, never mind about that, she died before you were born, what do you care?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was speaking of your sister. I proposed that Lord and Lady Arryn foster two of my grandsons at court, and offered to take their own son to ward here at the Twins. Are my grandsons unworthy to be seen at the king\u0027s court? They are sweet boys, quiet and mannerly. Walder is Merrett\u0027s son, named after me, and the other one . . . heh, I don\u0027t recall . . . he might have been another Walder, they\u0027re always naming them Walder so I\u0027ll favor them, but his father . . . which one was his father now?\" His face wrinkled up. \"Well, whoever he was, Lord Arryn wouldn\u0027t have him, or the other one, and I blame your lady sister for that. She frosted up as if I\u0027d suggested selling her boy to a mummer\u0027s show or making a eunuch out of him, and when Lord Arryn said the child was going to Dragonstone to foster with Stannis Baratheon, she stormed off without a word of regrets and all the Hand could give me was apologies. What good are apologies? I ask you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatelyn frowned, disquieted. \"I had understood that Lysa\u0027s boy was to be fostered with Lord Tywin at Casterly Rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it was Lord Stannis,\" Walder Frey said irritably. \"Do you think I can\u0027t tell Lord Stannis from Lord Tywin? They\u0027re both bungholes who think they\u0027re too noble to shit, but never mind about that, I know the difference. Or do you think I\u0027m so old I can\u0027t remember? I\u0027m ninety and I remember very well. I remember what to do with a woman too. That wife of mine will give me a son before this time next year, I\u0027ll wager. Or a daughter, that can\u0027t be helped. Boy or girl, it will be red, wrinkled, and squalling, and like as not she\u0027ll want to name it Walder or Walda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatelyn was not concerned with what Lady Frey might choose to name her child. \"Jon Arryn was going to foster his son with Lord Stannis, you are quite certain of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes, yes,\" the old man said. \"Only he died, so what does it matter? You say you want to cross the river?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you can\u0027t!\" Lord Walder announced crisply. \"Not unless I allow it, and why should I? The Tullys and the Starks have never been friends of mine.\" He pushed himself back in his chair and crossed his arms, smirking, waiting for her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest was only haggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA swollen red sun hung low against the western hills when the gates of the castle opened. The drawbridge creaked down, the portcullis winched up, and Lady Catelyn Stark rode forth to rejoin her son and his lords bannermen. Behind her came Ser Jared Frey, Ser Hosteen Frey, Ser Danwell Frey, and Lord Walder\u0027s bastard son Ronel Rivers, leading a long column of pikemen, rank on rank of shuffling men in blue steel ringmail and silvery grey cloaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobb galloped out to meet her, with Grey Wind racing beside his stallion. \"It\u0027s done,\" she told him. \"Lord Walder will grant you your crossing. His swords are yours as well, less four hundred he means to keep back to hold the Twins. I suggest that you leave four hundred of your own, a mixed force of archers and swordsmen. He can scarcely object to an offer to augment his garrison . . . but make certain you give the command to a man you can trust. Lord Walder may need help keeping faith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you say, Mother,\" Robb answered, gazing at the ranks of pikemen. \"Perhaps . . . Ser Helman Tallhart, do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fine choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What . . . what did he want of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you can spare a few of your swords, I need some men to escort two of Lord Frey\u0027s grandsons north to Winterfell,\" she told him. \"I have agreed to take them as wards. They are young boys, aged eight years and seven. It would seem they are both named Walder. Your brother Bran will welcome the companionship of lads near his own age, I should think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all? Two fosterlings? That\u0027s a small enough price to—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord Frey\u0027s son Olyvar will be coming with us,\" she went on. \"He is to serve as your personal squire. His father would like to see him knighted, in good time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A squire.\" He shrugged. \"Fine, that\u0027s fine, if he\u0027s—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also, if your sister Arya is returned to us safely, it is agreed that she will marry Lord Walder\u0027s youngest son, Elmar, when the two of them come of age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobb looked nonplussed. \"Arya won\u0027t like that one bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you are to wed one of his daughters, once the fighting is done,\" she finished. \"His lordship has graciously consented to allow you to choose whichever girl you prefer. He has a number he thinks might be suitable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his credit, Robb did not flinch. \"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you consent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I refuse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if you wish to cross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I consent,\" Robb said solemnly. He had never seemed more manly to her than he did in that moment. Boys might play with swords, but it took a lord to make a marriage pact, knowing what it meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crossed at evenfall as a horned moon floated upon the river. The double column wound its way through the gate of the eastern twin like a great steel snake, slithering across the courtyard, into the keep and over the bridge, to issue forth once more from the second castle on the west bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatelyn rode at the head of the serpent, with her son and her uncle Ser Brynden and Ser Stevron Frey. Behind followed nine tenths of their horse; knights, lancers, freeriders, and mounted bowmen. It took hours for them all to cross. Afterward, Catelyn would remember the clatter of countless hooves on the drawbridge, the sight of Lord Walder Frey in his litter watching them pass, the glitter of eyes peering down through the slats of the murder holes in the ceiling as they rode through the Water Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe larger part of the northern host, pikes and archers and great masses of men-at-arms on foot, remained upon the east bank under the command of Roose Bolton. Robb had commanded him to continue the march south, to confront the huge Lannister army coming north under Lord Tywin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor good or ill, her son had thrown the dice. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-game-of-thrones-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-1/page-59.html","bookId":2070,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:26:25 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:26:25 AM"}
