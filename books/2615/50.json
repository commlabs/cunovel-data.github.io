I knew that both the baroness and Sir Stephan had served Vlad in hopes of one day being his eternal servants. They both longed for immortality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Stephan regarded both of us for a long moment before opening his case and fussing with the paperwork within. “I am well aware of our Master’s demands. Hopefully, he will see that I have done all he has desired and that my obedience to you will be a reflection of my loyalty to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to feel more triumphant in the minutes that followed, but I felt a strange emptiness fill me. As the Baroness Dosza signed the documents that would make me the sole inheritor of her fortune, effectively signing her own death warrant, I thought of my family, long deceased and gone from this world, and wondered if I would feel satisfaction when I killed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finished signing the last of the paperwork, she turned to me and kissed me on both cheeks. Pressing her forehead to mine, she clutched my hands tightly. “I will do all you desire for eternity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gently stroked her hair, compelling her to lay her head upon my shoulder and not kiss me in a manner that would cause me discomfort. She obeyed, content in her decision and the execution of it. I watched Sir Stephan tuck away the papers, his hands slightly trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are your thoughts?” My voice sounded harsher than I desired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Stephan snapped his case shut and beheld me with misty eyes. “I wonder what will be the price I pay for my own immortality.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised by his words and had no answer for him. He obviously took this as an ominous sign for his hands began to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not want to give up my only child to you! It is enough that Maria and I stand aside and allow you to befriend her. Your influence upon her frightens us. We merely want her to marry and be happy. Is that too much to ask? Let the price of our immortality be anything other than our only living child, Countess Dracula.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him aghast. “I have no desire for her life! She is truly my friend! I would never hurt her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly?” He was clearly surprised by my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Of course!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what will be our price?” Confusion filled his features as he sat with his case upon his bony knees staring at me with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is for Vlad to decide,” I answered. My anger against him and Maria was in no way assuaged, yet I could not bear to do anything against them for fear of hurting Laura. The bastard was saved by my devotion to his daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly his shoulders relaxed as he gazed at me with a mixture of relief and lingering fear. “I suppose that is all I could hope for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vlad honors loyalty.” Csilla smiled with contentment now that she believed her future as a vampire was secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, he does.” Sir Stephan stood, bowed, and moved toward the door. “If you should see him soon, please send him my warm regards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good night, Sir Stephan.” I watched him depart then turned to Csilla. Smiling blissfully at me, she turned her head, baring her neck. In triumph, I bit into her throat and fed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Countess Dracula\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNovember 21, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dosza Palace, Buda\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snow continues to fall. It seems every night the sky is full of snowflakes. The river has begun to freeze over and huge chunks of ice have made the ferry passage to Pesth difficult. In the light of the full moon, the world is white and black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continue to drink from Csilla and occasionally the guards. Csilla has embraced her malaise happily. She regards it as a rite of passage from the world of the living to the world of the vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Adem continues to drill me on fighting tactics and Magda is always a pleasant companion, my world has become the palace. Before when I chose to hide myself away, I did not feel so trapped. But now that the snow drifts are packed high, I am restless. Perhaps it is that damned fallen angel’s warning. I fear something is amiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A message from Sir Stephan,” Magda said, setting the envelope before me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set my novel aside and reached for the letter. “He sent out a messenger in this weather?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps it is urgent.” Magda lingered at my side, obviously just as curious as I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreaking the seal, I opened the envelope and drew out a simple sheet of paper. I read the words once, then twice, my heart letting out a sharp thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDearest Countess Dracula,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe implore you to come to our home immediately. Laura has fallen ill and we are gravely concerned. She is requesting that you come to her beside. Maria and I agree that seeing you will lift her spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease come swiftly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Stephan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell Adem we are departing immediately to Sir Stephan’s house,” I said. “Laura is ill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my!” Magda gasped before rushing from the room to do as I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, I crumpled the letter in my hand remembering the words of the fortuneteller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou cannot escape the dragon forever. It will come to consume you and death will be your harbinger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerribly afraid, I quickly dressed in a warm wool dress and donned my coat. Snatching up my hat, I rushed downstairs to find Adem. I found Enre in the foyer clad in a heavy coat and hat for the cold weather. He bowed his head as I approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The sleigh is being brought around. We shall leave shortly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I pulled on my gloves, I could not help but worry about Laura. She had confided in me about the death of her brother during a bad winter storm some years past and how she had almost died as well. It was unbearable to consider losing my dear friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrice appeared from the dark depths of one of the halls that led to the kitchens. In one hand he carried a pot by its handle, careful not to spill its contents. I was surprised to see him and even more surprised when he held the tiny pot out to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s medicinal tea,” he explained. “A few of the maids are sick with a cough and this tea has given them some relief.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Brice. This is a lovely gesture.” I gratefully took it and smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression remained stoic as he studied me with some degree of suspicion. At last, he slightly bowed and returned to the darkness of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and a harsh, freezing wind flooded the foyer. Adem stepped hurriedly inside and slammed the door shut. Bits of snow whirled around him before settling wetly on the marble floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Countess, the snowstorm is not as fierce as it was earlier, but we should depart now and hope it does not worsen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am ready to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed the tea to Enre before taking Adem’s arm. We slipped out into the night, the cold gripping me immediately. The snow flurries swirled about on the night breeze and the packed snow beneath our feet crunched with our every step. The dark sleigh and black horses were a striking contrast to the white world enfolding us. Adem valiantly helped me up and tucked the heavy blankets around me once I was seated. Enre handed me the pot and I nestled it on my lap, cradling it with my gloved hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver of the sleigh was thickly wrapped up in a coat and cloak. The familiar face of the baroness’ personal driver peeked out from beneath his hat. Adem and Enre stepped onto the runners and held on as the horses clopped forward. Lowering my head, I tried to keep the freezing wind from my eyes as it tugged at my hat and coat. It was not a long distance to Sir Stephan’s house, but the weather hampered our progress. It was difficult to see the road and the driver was leery of the tall snow banks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen at last we drew up the long drive to the mansion where Laura lived, I was quite relieved to see the light pouring into the night from the windows. It gave the home a comforting, warm allure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There we are,” the driver said, a smile finally gracing his ruddy face. “No little snow storm can keep me from fulfilling my duties.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am grateful for your assistance. I would not have asked for you to leave the comfort of the palace if not for my great concern for my friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand, Countess Dracula. Unlike some rich folk, you actually care for others.” He gave me small nod of his head and drew the sleigh up to the front doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdem was lifting me down when the door flew open. Maria stumbled out into the cold, clutching her shawl about her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, thank goodness you are here! Hurry! Hurry!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHastening into the foyer of the house, I clutched the pot of tea to my bosom. Though I did not know if it could truly help my beloved friend, I was determined to deliver it safely. Maria rushed me deeper into the house, away from the coldness of the foyer. I thought she would take me to Laura’s room, but instead she ushered me into the same parlor where I had met the fortuneteller. Laura was nowhere to be seen, but Sir Stephan was waiting anxiously next to a blazing fireplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At last!” He surged toward me and gripped my shoulders. “You must help her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I brought her tea,” I said, offering the pot. “It’s medicinal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAppearing confused, Maria took it from me, her brow furrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tea?” Sir Stephan gasped. “Tea? You offer tea?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning at them, I began to unbutton my coat as Adem lingered at my side and Enre stood in the doorway. “I am here to see Laura. Where is she? How is she?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-50.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
