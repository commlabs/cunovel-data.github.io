Lewis started the engine. `Where to?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Miss Lembeck\u0027s new apartment. The one Wright just rented.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Okay,\u0027 Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they arrived at the apartment building, they saw Wright\u0027s limousine parked in front. Behind the wheel George was reading a newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Are we fully set up across the street?\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`We should be,\u0027 Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves nodded. `Wait here. I\u0027ll go see what they\u0027ve found.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day before, they had set up a surveillance unit in the apartment building facing Wright\u0027s. Graves rode to the nineteenth floor, got out, and walked to Room 1905. He knocked once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Who is it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Graves.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was opened for him. He entered the room. It was small and bare except for equipment clustered around the windows. There were two sets of binoculars on tripods and three sets of cameras; four chairs; a directional microphone, also on a tripod; recording equipment; film canisters; heaped ashtrays. And a television set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the TV Walter Cronkite was saying, `- are trying to get a vote from the Alabama delegation, which is apparently still in caucus.\u0027 In the background a booming, echoing mechanical voice was saying, `Alabama\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlabama... Alabama...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves ignored the TV. `What\u0027ve you got?\u0027 he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the three men in the room stepped away from the binoculars. `Have a look,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom this vantage point he could see directly into one window of Wright\u0027s apartment on the nineteenth floor of the opposite building. There were no drapes on the window, which made it easy to see in. The room was bare except for four peculiar wooden structures standing in the centre of the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`They had drapes on that window too,\u0027 the man said, `but they took them off half an hour ago.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`From all the windows?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`No. Just this one.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves frowned. Why? Did they know they were being observed? Did they want to make it easier? Because that was what they had done. He could see Wright striding around the room, directing two other people. Wright was working in shirtsleeves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`The window\u0027s open,\u0027 Graves said. `It must be hot as hell in there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`That\u0027s right,\u0027 the man said. `The window has been open ever since Wright showed up. An hour ago.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What\u0027re those wooden things on the floor?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Sawhorses,\u0027 the man said. `We figure they had paperhangers in there. Paperhangers use sawhorses. But there\u0027s something funny going on.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`How do you mean?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well, look at the sawhorses closely. They have indentations cut in them.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves looked. He could see a broadly curved, U-shaped cut in each sawhorse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Beats me. They just cut them a while back.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You mean, specially?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`That\u0027s right. They\u0027ve been doing a lot of unusual things in there. Every so often Wright sticks his hand out the window, and he\u0027s got this whirling thing, like a kid\u0027s whirling top... He sticks his hand out there for a minute, then pulls it back.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves looked away from the window. `Describe it exactly.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`It has four arms,\u0027 the man said, `and at the end of each is a cup, to catch the wind. Sort of a weathervane. But there isn\u0027t much wind today.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Anemometer,\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`A what?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`It measures wind velocity.\u0027 Why should Wright want to know the wind velocity outside the window of his girl friend\u0027s apartment?,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Why does he care about that?\u0027 the man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves shook his head and turned back to the window, examining the sawhorses through the binoculars. Each sawhorse with its single indentation in the crossbar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour sawhorses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo tanks. Of course! The crossbars would have indentations so that the tank wouldn\u0027t roll off. `You seen any tanks in there?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Nothing like that,\u0027 the man said. `All we\u0027ve seen is a lot of mechanical equipment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What kind of mechanical equipment?\u0027 Graves peered through the binoculars. He didn\u0027t see any equipment at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`It looks like pumps and stuff,\u0027 the man said. `It was right in the middle of the floor.\u0027 He glanced through the binoculars, then shook his head. `They must have moved it to another room. They had some electronic equipment, too.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What kind?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Looked like a hi-fi, maybe.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves thought of several nasty remarks, but said nothing. A hi-fi, for Christ\u0027s sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`That guy in there must be pretty weird,\u0027 the man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves turned on him. `He is not weird. He is a brilliant and a dedicated man. He is engaged in a complicated plot and he is daring -\u0027 He broke off. The man was staring. `He\u0027s not weird,\u0027 Graves finished, and returned to the binoculars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he watched, John Wright stepped to the window and extended his hand. He held an anemometer; the cups spun lazily. After a moment Wright withdrew the instrument and returned to directing the other men in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves turned away from the window and made some calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Department of Defence.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Public Information, please.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Just a minute, please.\u0027 There was a clicking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Public Information, Miss,Conover speaking.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I\u0027d like to talk to Lieutenant Morrison, please.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`One minute, please.\u0027 More clicking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Lieutenant Morrison\u0027s office.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`John Graves calling for Lieutenant Morrison.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Just a minute, I\u0027ll see if he\u0027s in.\u0027 Still more clicking. \u0027Morrison here.

He is expected shortly.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Did he leave a number?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`No, I\u0027m sorry - just a moment, he\u0027s coming through the door. Whom shall I say is calling?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`John Graves. State Intelligence.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`One moment please, Mr Graves.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a very long wait, and a humming sound as Graves was put on `hold\u0027.

It\u0027s been a long time. When was it? Senator Evans\u0027 party, I think. You had a very cute -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Listen, Tom. I have a problem. I need your help.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I\u0027ll do what I can.\u0027 Said very smoothly, in the manner that all those people adopted sooner or later. No promises, but very smooth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves paused. `I need my file.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Your file?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Yes.

Yes, in a few minutes. Absolutely. Five minutes, tell him five minutes. John?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I\u0027m here,\u0027 Graves said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Now what was it? Your file?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Yes. I need my own file.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I\u0027ve never heard of anyone needing their own file,\u0027 Burnett chuckled. `Curiosity, yes, but -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Tom. Stop being polite. This is Department business and it\u0027s very important.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Perhaps you could stop by the office and -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I can\u0027t stop by the office. I\u0027m not in Washington. I\u0027m in San Diego.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Oh?\u0027 There was hesitation now, the smoothness gone. `San Diego?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I\u0027m doing an SS here. A guy named John Wright. I need my own -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`John Wright.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well why didn\u0027t you say so before? I\u0027ll get it to you right away. The Secretary has directed everyone to cooperate fully with the San Diego operation.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves sighed. That was refreshing. He had an enormous sense of relief. What was that joke? It felt so good when he stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Let\u0027s see,\u0027 Burnett said. `I\u0027ll have to get an authorization. I can do that with the Undersecretary; I don\u0027t have to bother the boss. Then we have to get it to you. You don\u0027t have access to a photoprinter?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`No.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well, let\u0027s see... I don\u0027t know what sort of facilities are available in San Diego. Look. There\u0027s one sure bet. The police department. They have a printer for sure. I can transmit the file contents to you over that. But it\u0027ll take time to do the whole thing.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I don\u0027t want the whole thing. I just want the psychological test scores.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You do?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Well,\u0027 Burnett said, `I can have that for you right away. They\u0027ll transmit in fifteen or twenty minutes. Okay?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Okay,\u0027 Graves said. `And thanks.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`For Christ\u0027s sake, don\u0027t mention it,\u0027 Burnett said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs in the car, Lewis said, `You look like you\u0027ve gargled with Drano.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I have,\u0027 Graves said.
