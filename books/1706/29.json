He was annoyed to see that she had arisen from her bed perfectly composed, her face uncreased, beautiful as ever. \"How are you?\" he said to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to brush my teeth,\" she said. \"How long until we land?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up, and walked to the back of the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans looked out the window. The sunlight was glaring, harsh. He hadn\u0027t had enough sleep. The line of stitches in his scalp pinched. His body ached from being wedged in the damned crevasse for so long. Just to rest his elbow on the armrest of the seat was painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter,\" Kenner said, \"those guys tried to kill you.

Sixty-five percent of the surface area of Los Angeles was devoted to cars. People had to wedge themselves in what little was left. It was an inhuman design and it was environmentally absurd. Everything was so far apart, you couldn\u0027t walk anywhere, the pollution was incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd people like Kenner did nothing but criticize the good work of environmental organizations, without whose efforts the environment of a place like Los Angeles would be much, much worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFace it, he thought. The world needed help. It desperately needed an environmental perspective. And nothing in Kenner\u0027s smooth manipulation of facts would change that truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thoughts rambled on in this way for another ten minutes, until he crossed Mulholland Pass and came down toward Beverly Hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the passenger seat beside him. The doctored cell phone glinted in the sunlight. He decided to take it to Drake\u0027s office right away. Get this whole thing over with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe telephoned Drake\u0027s office and asked to talk to him; he was told Drake was at the dentist and would return later in the day. The secretary wasn\u0027t sure exactly when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans decided to go to his apartment and take a shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe parked in the garage and walked through the little garden to his apartment. The sun was shining down between the buildings; the roses were in bloom, beautiful. The only thing that marred it, he thought, was the lingering odor of cigar smoke in the air. It was offensive to think that somebody had smoked a cigar and that what remained was \"Sssst! Evans!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. He looked around. He could see nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans heard an intense whisper, like a hiss: \"Turn right. Pick a damn rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk, you idiot. And stop looking around. Come over here and pick a rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans moved toward the voice. The cigar smell was stronger. Behind the tangle of the bushes, he saw an old stone bench that he had never noticed before. It was crusted with algae. Hunched down on the bench was a man in a sportcoat. Smoking a cigar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk,\" the man whispered. \"How many times do I have to tell you. Take the rose, and smell it. That\u0027ll give you a reason to stay a minute. Now listen to me. I\u0027m a private investigator. I was hired by George Morton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans smelled the rose. Inhaling cigar smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have something important for you,\" the guy said. \"I\u0027ll bring it to your apartment in two hours. But I want you to leave again, so they\u0027ll follow you. Leave your door unlocked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans turned the rose in his fingers, pretending to examine it. In fact, he was looking past the rose at the man on the bench. The man\u0027s face was familiar, somehow. Evans was sure he had seen him before amp; \"Yeah, yeah,\" the man said, as if reading his thoughts. He turned his lapel, to show a badge. \"AV Network Systems. I was working in the NERF building. Now you remember, right? Don\u0027t nod. For Christ\u0027s sake. Just go upstairs, change your clothes, and leave for a while. Go to the gym or whatever. Just go. These assholes\" he jerked his head toward the street \"have been waitin\u0027 for you. So don\u0027t disappoint them. Now go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis apartment had been put back together very well. Lisa had done a good jobthe slashed cushions had been flipped over; the books were back in the bookcase. They were out of order, but he would deal with that later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the large windows in his living room, Evans looked out toward the street. He could see nothing except the green expanse of Roxbury Park. The kids playing at midday. The clusters of gossiping nannies. There was no sign of surveillance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked perfectly normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelf-consciously, he started unbuttoning his shirt, and turned away. He went to the shower, letting the hot spray sting his body. He looked at his toes, which were dark purple, a worrisome, unnatural color. He wiggled them. He didn\u0027t have much sensation, but other than that, they seemed to be all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe toweled off, and checked his messages. There was a call from Janis, asking if he was free tonight. Then another, nervous one from her, saying her boyfriend had just come back into town and she was busy (which meant, don\u0027t call her back). There was a call from Lisa, Herb Lowenstein\u0027s assistant, asking where he was. Lowenstein wanted to go over some documents with him; it was important. A call from Heather, saying that Lowenstein was looking for him. A call from Margo Lane, saying she was still in the hospital and why hadn\u0027t he called her back? A call from his client the BMW dealer, asking when he was coming to the showroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd about ten hang-ups. Far more than he usually had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hang-ups gave him a creepy feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans dressed quickly, putting on a suit and tie. He came back into the living room and, feeling uneasy, clicked on the television set, just in time for the local noon news. He was heading for the door when he heard: \"Two new developments emphasize once again the dangers of global warming. The first study, out of England, says global warming is literally changing the rotation of the Earth, shortening the length of our day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans turned back to look. He saw two co-anchors, a man and a woman. The man was explaining that even more dramatic was a study that showed that the Greenland ice cap was going to melt entirely away. That would cause sea levels to rise twenty feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, I guess it\u0027s good-bye Malibu!\" the anchor said cheerfully. Of course, that wouldn\u0027t happen for a few years yet. \"But it\u0027s coming amp;unless we all change our ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans turned away from the television and headed for the door. He wondered what Kenner would have to say about this latest news. Changing the rotation speed of the Earth? He shook his head at the sheer enormity of it. And melting all the ice in Greenland? Evans could imagine Kenner\u0027s discomfiture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, he\u0027d probably just deny it all, the way he usually did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans opened the door, carefully ensured that it would remain unlocked, closed it behind him, and headed for his office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 44\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCENTURY CITY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSATURDAY, OCTOBER 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:08 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran into Herb Lowenstein in the hall, walking toward a conference room. \"Jesus,\" Lowenstein said, \"where the hell have you been, Peter?
