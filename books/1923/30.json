there, utterly still except for the heavy lift and fall of his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Gideon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith muttered curse, he released me, his hand falling limply to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rushed to get to him, my pulse pounding at the thought that he might change his mind and deny me .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat he might decide he was done with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only help he gave me was a momentary lift of his hips, so I could yank his jeans and boxer briefs out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his big, beautiful cock was in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moaned at the taste of him, at the warmth and satiny softness of his skin, at the smell of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nuzzled my cheek against his groin and balls, wanting his scent all over me, marking me as his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy tongue followed the thick veins coursing the length of him, licking him up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard his teeth grind when I sucked him with long drawing pulls, moans of apology and bliss vibrating in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt broke my heart that he was so silent, my vocal lover who always talked dirty to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways told me what he wanted and needed .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow good he felt when I made love to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was holding himself back, denying me the satisfaction of knowing I pleased him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePumping the thick root with my fist, I milked him, sucking on the plush crown, luring his pre-cum to the tip where I could lick it up with rapid flutters of my tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thighs bunched, his breath came in fierce pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt him coil tight and I went wild, double-fisting him, my mouth working so hard that my jaw ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis spine straightened, his head lifting from the seat only to slam backward as the first thick spurt exploded in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whimpered, his flavor igniting my senses, making me crave more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed convulsively, my hands pulling and rubbing on his throbbing penis to lure more of his rich, creamy semen onto my tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body quaked as he came for long minutes, filling my mouth until he spilled out of the sides of my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made no sound, as unnaturally silent as he\u0027d been during the fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would\u0027ve sucked him off for hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to, but he put both hands on my shoulders and urged me away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up into his heartrendingly gorgeous face, saw his eyes glittering in the semidarkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched my lips with his thumb, smearing his semen over and around the swollen curves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slide your tight cunt around me,\" he ordered hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got more to give you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaky and frightened by his harsh remoteness, I wriggled out of my boy shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it all off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything except the boots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did as he said, my body quickening at his command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d do anything he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would prove to him that I was his and only his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would atone however he needed me to so he\u0027d know I loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unzipped my skirt and pushed it off, then whipped my tank top over my head and threw it on the opposite bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy bra followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I straddled him, Gideon caught my hips and looked up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you wet?\" \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It turns you on to suck my cock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy nipples hardened further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blunt, crude way he talked about sex turned me on, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you kiss him?\" The abrupt change in topic knocked me askew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lower lip trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released me, reaching up and over his shoulders with both hands to grip the sides of the headrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis biceps bulged with the pose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was aroused by the sight, as I was by everything about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to see his bare chest glistening with sweat, his abs tightening and flexing as he pumped his cock into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI licked my lips, tasting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your shirt off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stilled, my heart racing in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was using sex against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the limo where we\u0027d first made love, in the same position I\u0027d first taken him .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re punishing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve earned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter that he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0027d earned it, so had he.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gripped the top of the seat back for balance and wrapped the fingers of my other hand around his cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still hard, still throbbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle in his neck twitched as I stroked him in my fist, priming him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed the wide crest between the lips of my cleft, rubbing him back and forth, coating him with the slickness of my desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze never left his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him as I teased us both, looking for any sign of the passionate lover I adored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA furious stranger glared back at me, daring me, taunting me with his detachment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let the first thick inch push inside me, spreading me open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I slammed my hips down, crying out as he pierced me deep and stretched me almost unbearably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck,\" he bit out, shuddering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamn it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis uncontrolled outburst spurred me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigging my knees into the seat, I set my hands on either side of his and lifted, pulling off him, my trembling sex clinging tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed back down, the glide easier now that he was wet from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my buttocks hit his thighs I found his muscles hard as stone, his body giving away the lie - he wasn\u0027t indifferent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted again, slowly, making us both feel every nuance of the delicious friction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I pushed back down, I tried to be as stoic as he was, but the sensation of fullness, the heated connection, was too exquisite to contain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moaned, and he shifted restlessly, his hips moving in a delicious little circle before he could stop himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel so good,\" I whispered, stroking his raging cock with my eager, aching sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re all I need, Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were made for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forgot that,\" he bit out, his knuckles white from his grip on the seat back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if he was just holding on or physically restraining himself from reaching for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could never forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re a part of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me why you kissed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested my damp forehead against his, feeling the tears burning behind my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then shut up and make me come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he\u0027d slapped my face, it couldn\u0027t have shocked me more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straightened and leaned away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027re getting the idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHot tears slid down my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t treat me like a whore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was low and raspy, filled with warning, but his eyes were dark and desolate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilled with pain that matched my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to stop, you know what to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one word I could unmistakably, irrefutably put an end to this agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t use it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust the fact that he brought up my safe word told me he was testing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had an agenda, and if I gave up now, I\u0027d never know what it was.Reaching behind me, I set my hands on his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arched my back and dragged my soaked sex along the rigid length of his cock, then slammed back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI adjusted the angle, lifted and fell again, gasping at the feel of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMad as hell or not, my body worshipped his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoved the feel of him, the sense of rightness that was there despite the anger and hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath was powering out of his lungs with every plunge of my hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body was hot, so hot, radiating heat like a blast furnace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pumped my hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking the pleasure he refused to give me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thighs, buttocks, stomach, and core tightened with every lift, fisting him from root to tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey relaxed when I dropped, letting him sink deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fucked him with everything I had, pounding myself onto his cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath hissed out between his clenched teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was coming hard, jetting inside me so fiercely I felt each scorching burst of semen like a separate thrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cried out, loving the feel of it, chasing an orgasm that would shatter me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wound so tightly, my body desperate for release after pleasing him twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he moved, grabbing me by the waist and restraining my movements, holding himself deep as he pumped me full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choked off a scream when I realized he was deliberately preventing me from coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me why, Eva,\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" \"I don\u0027t know!\" I yelled, trying to grind my hips onto him, pounding his shoulders with my fists when his grip tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding me pinned to his pelvis and filled with his cock, Gideon pushed to his feet and everything shifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out of me, flipped me to face away from him, then bent me over the edge of the seat with my knees on the floorboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one hand at the small of my back, holding me down, he cupped my sex and rubbed, massaging his semen into my cleft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spread it around, coating me with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hips circled, seeking that perfect bit of pressure to get me off .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept it from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeliberately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pounding in my clit and the needy clenching of my empty core was driving me mad, my body hungry for release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed two fingers into me and my nails dug into the black leather seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finger-fucked me leisurely, sliding lazily in and out, keeping me on the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gideon,\" I sobbed, the sensitive tissues inside me rippling greedily around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was coated in sweat, barely able to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to pray for the car to stop, for us to reach our destination, holding my breath in desperate anticipation of escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the limo never pulled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt kept driving and driving, and I was restrained so completely that I couldn\u0027t rise up enough to see where we were.
