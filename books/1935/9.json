Which is understandable—they knew each other their entire lives. Mom’s completely at loose ends without him, but that’s not the worst of it.” Susannah shook her head. “As we were driving back to the house, Mom got very quiet. She said she had something important to tell me. She claimed that my father had come to her earlier this week.” Susannah closed her eyes for a few seconds. “Her neighbor had already told me about this. But to hear Mom describe it…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s missing him so much that her mind must be conjuring him up,” Carolyn suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was my reaction at first, too, but then Mom told me he walked her home. This wasn’t some momentary visit, some trick of the mind. Her hand nearly left bruises on my arm, she was so adamant. My mother says she spent at least half an hour with my father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked, Carolyn couldn’t come up with anything to say. Except that Mrs. Leary was obviously in bad shape, and Susannah already knew that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, Susannah walked through her mother’s garden, seeking a moment of peace. It was something she often did at home during the summer, wandering through her own garden, assessing the state of her flowers, inhaling their fragrance, making plans for the day. She noticed that Vivian’s plants and flowerbeds were in reasonably good condition—better than she’d expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, she returned to the house for coffee, hoping there’d be some milk or cream. She opened her mother’s refrigerator and was appalled at what she found. The cheese had grown moldy. A tomato had shriveled up and shrunk to half its original size. Containers filled with leftovers crammed the shelves, most of them several days, if not weeks, old. Along with that, Susannah saw a number of small tinfoil packages; she assumed these were bits of meat. She had no intention of finding out. Almost everything should’ve been discarded long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coffee perked in the old-fashioned pot behind her. Of course she hadn’t discovered the carton of milk she’d wanted but the door of the fridge held many small bottles and jars, some of them unopened. Just how many types of mustard could one woman accumulate? Susannah counted twelve different varieties—at least eight more than she’d seen during her visit in March.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t hear you get up,” Vivian said, coming into the kitchen. She tied the sash of her housecoat around her waist. Susannah noticed that her mother had taken to shuffling her feet, as if her slippers were too heavy for her. She took tiny steps and looked so much older than she had even a few months ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning, Mom,” Susannah said cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother brought down a cup and saucer from the cupboard and set them next to the coffeepot. “Did you sleep well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother nodded. “Do you need something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah glanced back inside the refrigerator and remembered her father shouting at her as a kid to close the refrigerator door. “I was looking for milk,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have lots of milk.” Vivian seemed surprised that Susannah hadn’t found it. “I’m positive I got some just the other day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah moved a number of plastic containers onto the counter and sure enough, an unopened milk carton rested at the back of the top shelf. Bringing it out, she placed it on the table and reached for her cup. The smell alerted her the moment she opened the milk. When she saw that the expiry date was over a month ago, she dumped the thick, lumpy liquid down the drain, running water to lessen the foul odor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong with it?” Vivian asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s gone bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother’s face twisted with displeasure. The narrowed eyes and pinched mouth was an expression Susannah remembered well from her childhood. It was the same frown she got when she’d misbehaved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we should take that carton back to Safeway and demand a refund. They sold me spoiled milk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, Mom…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just like those big chain stores to take advantage of a widow. Well, I won’t stand for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom, it’s too early in the morning to get upset. Drink your coffee and we’ll talk about it later.” Susannah figured it was pointless to explain that Vivian had bought the milk six or seven weeks ago and then forgotten all about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs her mother poured coffee from the sterling silver coffeepot, her hand trembled. Susannah had to bite her lip to keep from stepping forward and taking over. When Vivian finished, she sat down at the kitchen table, seeming rather pleased with herself. Susannah could only suppose it was because she’d managed without spilling a drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had a nice visit with Carolyn Bronson,” Susannah commented, as she joined her mother at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who, dear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carolyn Bronson. Remember, you saw her recently and she gave you her phone number? We met last night at the pub where the old A \u0026amp; W used to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes, of course. How are her parents?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah found this sporadic forgetfulness frustrating—and sad. But if she reminded Vivian that both Mr. and Mrs. Bronson had died, she might upset her. In any event, she had more pressing subjects to discuss. She decided to be intentionally vague. “I’m not sure, Mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mrs. Bronson is a funny one.” She leaned closer to Susannah and lowered her voice. “She’s always putting on airs because she’s French.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carolyn was one of my best friends all through school,” Susannah said mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I tried to be friendly,” her mother continued, ignoring her remark. “Went out of my way, in fact, but apparently I wasn’t good enough for the likes of Brigitte Bronson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carolyn sent you her best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was a sweet girl.” Vivian sipped her coffee and again Susannah noticed how her mother’s hand trembled as she lifted the cup. “Unlike her mother…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah didn’t want to get involved in a mean-spirited conversation about Brigitte, but she knew what Vivian meant. Although nothing was ever said, Susannah had always had the impression that Carolyn’s mother didn’t approve of their friendship. As an adult, she was able to analyze those feelings, understanding that Mrs. Bronson was a woman whose unhappiness made her cold and resentful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah waited until her mother had finished her first cup of coffee before she brought up the subject of assisted living. “You must be rambling around this house all by yourself,” she began casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother stared at her. “Not at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you lonely?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft smile turned up the edges of Vivian’s mouth. “I was until your father came back to see me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom—” Susannah bit off words of protest. She was afraid that her mother had lost her grip on reality and grown comfortable in her fantasy world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVivian studied her as though waiting for Susannah to comment on her father’s visits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, Mom,” Susannah said, gathering her resolve. “There’s something we need to discuss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” her mother asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom,” Susannah said, praying for the right words. “I’m concerned about you being here all alone, especially now that Martha’s quit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be,” she said, calmly dismissing Susannah’s apprehensions. “I’m perfectly fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you consider moving to Seattle?” That would solve so many problems, but even as Susannah asked she knew it was futile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And leave Colville?” Her mother appeared to mull it over, then shook her head. “I can’t. Much as I’d love to be closer to you and the grandchildren, I won’t leave my home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah knew that change of any kind terrified Vivian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doug and your father are buried here,” her mother went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My friends are close by.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of whom were dead or dying, but Susannah couldn’t bring herself to mention it. “I’d be able to visit far more often,” she offered as enticement, hoping against hope that her mother would see the advantages of moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVivian sipped her coffee and allowed the cup to linger at her lips a moment longer than usual, as if she was considering the prospect again. Slowly she shook her head. “I’m sorry, dear, but this is my home. Seattle is way too big a city for me. I’d be lost there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah reached across the table and took her mother’s fragile hand. “That’s something else we need to discuss. Mom, I’m afraid this house is too much for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” An edge sharpened her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I worry about you here all alone, trying to cope with maintenance and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’ll shovel the sidewalk when it snows?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll hire a neighborhood boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What would you do if a water pipe broke?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The pipes aren’t going to break, Susannah. Now stop being difficult.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah didn’t feel she was the one who was being difficult. The more she thought about the problems faced by an elderly person living alone—especially an elderly person losing her memory—the more worried she became.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know why you’d want to come all the way from Seattle to talk such nonsense to me,” Vivian said in a querulous voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah remembered what Mrs. Henderson had said about her attempt to discuss assisted living back in March. That had probably influenced today’s response—if Vivian even remembered the earlier conversation. Regardless, Susannah had hoped that by pointing out a number of practical issues, she could get Vivian to realize on her own the advantages of moving into an assisted-living complex. Clearly that approach wasn’t going to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom, I think we need to sell the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Vivian banged her cup against the saucer, her eyes wide. “For the last time, Susannah, I am not leaving my home. I am stunned that you would even suggest such a thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word, Vivian stood, deposited her cup and saucer in the sink and disappeared down the hallway to her bedroom, muttering as she left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah planted her elbows on the table, and cupped her ears with her hands. She closed her eyes, silently praying for wisdom. She hadn’t expected this to be easy, but so far she was getting absolutely nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Vivian had dressed, she came back into the kitchen. Ignoring Susannah, she collected a straw basket and clippers. The garden was in full bloom; irises and roses were two of Susannah’s favorites and they were in abundant display along the white picket fence. The lilacs were pruned and shapely, and their heady scent drifted through the open window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven her mother’s limited endurance, Susannah had been surprised to discover that the garden looked quite good, although the fence was a disaster. The paint had faded and one entire section tilted precariously. Her father would never have allowed that to go unfixed for more than a day. He was a stickler for order, at home and in the courtroom. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/susannah-s-garden-blossom-street-3/page-9.html","bookId":1935,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:42 AM"}
