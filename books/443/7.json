{"id":12402,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"Jack, forbidden the refuge of his own little room, continued to walk the streets, while he debated how best to meet the complicated situation that faced him. Stumbling at last on Bryant Park in his wanderings, he dropped on a bench. His eyes moved sightlessly over the scene before him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Once the newspaper guys get hold of me, and print my picture on the front page, I\u0027m a marked man,\" he was thinking, \"I couldn\u0027t walk down the street then, without a crowd following. It would be a cinch for this gang to keep tab on me, and a fat chance I\u0027d have of getting anything on them. So I\u0027ve got to keep out of the papers if I can. That\u0027s decided.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But it\u0027s not going to be so easy. For the more of a mystery I make of myself the hotter they\u0027ll get on my trail. A paper like the Sphere, I suppose, would spend a hundred thousand to run me down. What I ought to do is to get some harmless young fellow to take the part of Jack Norman, while I lie low and do my work.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who could I get in our gang? There\u0027s Bill Endicott; good fellow, but too much of a talker, specially with a girl. He\u0027d never do. There\u0027s Joe Welland, he\u0027s close enough—but too thick. He couldn\u0027t take a part any more than a bronze statue. They say Stan Larkin and I look alike. He might do. No! He\u0027s too hard-headed. He wouldn\u0027t do what I wanted. It\u0027s too risky anyhow to let one of the gang in on this. The others would have to know. I\u0027d better keep away from them for the present.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack\u0027s reflections were interrupted by an appeal from alongside: \"Say, fella, can you help a fella to a meal?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He became aware for the first that he shared the bench with another. It was a fat youth of about his own age with an expression at once piteous and absurd. There is bound to be something ludicrous in the spectacle of a fat beggar. Chubby cheeks were designed to wear a good-natured smile. The shame-faced look that accompanied the appeal did not suggest the professional beggar in this case.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack had reached the point where he was glad of a diversion. His thoughts had begun to chase themselves in circles. \"What\u0027s the trouble, \u0027Bo?\" he asked in friendly fashion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Down on my luck, that\u0027s all. I\u0027m an actor. Got a job to walk on in a big show called \u0027Ulysses.\u0027 Rehearsed three weeks and then they flivved. I had borrowed every cent I could on the job, and now I dassent be seen where my friends are. I\u0027m done! Ain\u0027t eaten since yesterday. Say, it\u0027s Hell for a fat man to be hungry!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack laughed. Moreover the word \"hunger\" started something insistent in his own internals. He dropped a further consideration of his problems until that should be satisfied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"By Gad! That reminds me I haven\u0027t had any dinner myself! Come on, let\u0027s see what we can find.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You mean it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where\u0027ll we go.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s Little\u0027s over here on Sixth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To Hell with Little\u0027s! I\u0027m fed up on beaneries. It would take a hundred of Little\u0027s little portions to fill me. No, I got money \u0027Bo! Us for the big eats. Let\u0027s try that swell French café on the south side of the square. The French know how to eat.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ahh! They wouldn\u0027t serve a guy like me in there!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, the clothing stores over on Broadway are open yet. Let\u0027s go and get you an outfit. An actor\u0027s got to show his Tuppenheimers they say, before he can pull down a salary.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ahh! You\u0027re stringin\u0027 me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come along! I got a wad that\u0027s burning a hole in my jeans! I might as well blow it on you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fat youth made up his mind that Jack had been drinking. He had an open countenance, and upon it was clearly visible his thankfulness to Heaven for sending such a one his way. As Jack started off he took his arm, either with the idea of guiding his footsteps, or in fear that he might escape. His anxious glance, prepared for any sudden, unfavorable change in the weather, never left Jack\u0027s face. He even pretended for the sake of camaraderie to be a little spiffed himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack was vastly tickled by the whole incident. It gave him a new luxurious sensation of opulence. Besides, he had reached the point where he felt he had to blow off a little steam.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What a fool I was to worry myself to a standstill! Too much thinking is worse than none at all. If you mull over a thing too long, your thoughts begin to go round like a squirrel in a revolving cage. Here\u0027s the whole town open to us! We\u0027ll have us a time and forget our troubles!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fat youth who had no idea of the nature of these troubles made haste to agree. \"You\u0027re dead right, fellow! Eat, drink and be merry, as the poet says, for to-morrow the rent falls due!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s your name?\" asked Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Private or professional?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, anything you like.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I\u0027m generally known as Guy Harmsworth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Some name, \u0027Bo!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e However, the really significant names seem to come out of the air. Jack started calling his friend \u0027Bo. From that it was but a little step to Bobo. In the sound of Bobo there was something subtly descriptive. It stuck. He is Bobo still.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As they entered the big clothing store Jack said: \"Get the best. I\u0027ll stand for it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo thus encouraged, proved to have a very nice taste in wearing apparel. They bought hurriedly, for the pangs of hunger were pressing. But when the main articles, suit, hat, shoes, were out of the way both young men plunged in the smaller and more luxurious articles; shirts of heavy silk that crinkled richly between thumb and finger; wonderful cravats that would almost stand alone. Few youngsters attain their desires in this direction, and Bobo and Jack, long denied, fairly wallowed. They each bought a valise to carry away their surplus purchases.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In half an hour Bobo was transformed. To call Bobo fat was merely to indicate his type. He was not all over the place, but a well set-up youngster of a rather melting style of beauty, which promised obesity later perhaps, but in youth was not unpleasing. At least not in his new clothes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When finally Jack produced the roll of yellow backs to pay for what they had bought, Bobo\u0027s look of anxiety disappeared and was not seen again. A little sigh escaped him. It was as if he had said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is not a dream.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo leaving the outfitters was metamorphosed in more than his apparel. He stuck his chest out now, and looked passers-by in the eye. A stage-English accent crept into his unadorned Manhattanese. Jack seeing him cast sheep\u0027s-eyes at a stand of walking-sticks, purchased him a yellow malacca, such as his own soul had hankered after earlier in the day. It was the finishing touch. Bobo swung it with a delightful arrogance. He even adopted a certain condescension of tone towards Jack who had no stick.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I say, old chap, these togs are really not half bad for ready-made, what! Not what a London tailor would turn out of course. But they fit, because I happen to have a normal figure.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perfect forty-six,\" murmured Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They returned for their dinner to the famous café on Bryant Square. It was the first eating-place in New York that dared to veil its interior from the vulgar gaze. Those alluring, closely-drawn pink curtains cause the envious poor to suspect the delightful worst. It is not so well known in the provinces as flashier resorts, but it is certainly the place where most New Yorkers go first when they get money.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they finally penetrated the mystery the plainness of the interior was rather disappointing, and the place was almost empty for it was half way between the dinner and the supper hours. But the food when it came justified the café\u0027s great reputation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack had ordered blindly from the French carte-de-jour, choosing the most expensive dish from each subdivision; Petite Marmite; Cotelotte des Ecrivisses au diable; Filet Mignon au Moelle: pommes de terre Florizel; Choux-fleur hollandaise; plombière, etc. The result was eminently satisfactory. Bobo groaned with delight. It appeared that Bobo had a special and particular talent for eating.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t wake me! Don\u0027t wake me!\" he prayed. \"Many\u0027s the time I\u0027ve dreamed of this, but it was always snatched away just as I sat down. Say, are we going to have coffee and cigars?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure thing. Fifty centers.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"O Lord, let me sleep till then and afterwards. You can do what you like to me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You seem to have a nice taste in fancy eats,\" said Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A nice taste! I was born with the tongue of an epicure, a delicate tongue, a high-toned tongue! For me to be obliged to eat in lunch wagons and beaneries was a crime against nature!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, how would you like to keep this up for a while?\" said Jack with an offhand air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey?\" said Bobo opening his eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack studied him. \"He\u0027s something of a fool,\" he thought. \"But maybe that\u0027s what I need. I couldn\u0027t control a hard-headed guy. And he\u0027s an actor. He ought to be able to play a part. And he\u0027d be grateful for his meals, I could do what I wanted with him. Anyhow I have to take a chance, and I might do worse.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What d\u0027ye mean, keep it up?\" demanded Bobo.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is only a sample,\" said Jack. \"How would you like the real thing for a while; a suite of rooms at the Madagascar; a yacht, a motor car—— Oh, half a dozen motors; all the clothes you wanted from the best tailor in America; as for the eats—all you\u0027d have to do would be press a button and give your order.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo turned a little pale. \"What are you getting at?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Supposing a man offered you this, would you be willing to put yourself in his hands?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Say, if it was on the level, he could do what he wanted with me!\" said Bobo fervently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right!\" said Jack. \"It\u0027s a go!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo stared. \"Say, fellow, what kind of a pipe are you giving me? Do you mean you are offering me—— Are you crazy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you read the afternoon papers?\" asked Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo nodded. \"Fellow left his on a bench beside me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ve never asked me my name.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jack Norman.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo stared speechless. \"On the level?\" he gasped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack took a couple of letters from his pocket and showed him the superscriptions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jack Norman!\" said Bobo. \"Then what were you loafing in the park by yourself for?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Trying to get accustomed to the idea.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo had no more to say. He had lost the condescending air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here\u0027s the situation,\" said Jack. \"For certain reasons which I will explain to you, I want to keep under cover for a while. I want to keep my picture out of the papers. I don\u0027t want to be pointed out and followed wherever I go. Well, the easiest way to escape notice is for me to get some fellow to take my place, see?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But everybody who knows you will know I\u0027m not the real guy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s all right. We won\u0027t be moving in the same circles as I used to. Want to do it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do I want to do it——!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wait a minute. It\u0027s only fair to warn you that old Silas Gyde was croaked by a gang of blackmailers, and they\u0027re after me now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo paled and hesitated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I mean to meet all their demands until we nail them, so there\u0027s not much danger.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobo\u0027s face cleared. \"Will I do it——\" he began again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hold on! There are two conditions. You must promise to do everything I tell you. And second, you are not to marry any woman under false pretences.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I promise,\" said Bobo.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good! It\u0027s a bargain. From this moment you are John Farrow Norman, the newly-made millionaire, and I am plain Jack Robinson, your secretary.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They shook hands across the table. \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61342.html","bookId":443,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:40:38 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:40:38 AM"}
