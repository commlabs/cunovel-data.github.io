This dagger of hers was a high-grade human-step treasure. After she poured her true essence into it, she would be able to cut Lin Ming like a piece of tofu, especially since he didn’t have any true essence protecting him. But as the dagger slid a third of the way through, it suddenly became stuck in his ribs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo stab, it would not stab through.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo pull out, she could not pull it out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, in this short delay, Zhou Xinyu had already lost the chance to commit suicide.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You want to die?

His skinny hand grabbed Zhou Xinyu’s wrist, forcefully pinching, wringing the dagger out of her hand.

Ever since he had been deprived of his status as the successor to the Sect Master, and then all the overwhelming amount of resources had also gone over to his junior-apprentice sister, he had regarded her as a thorn in his side. Ever since then, he had wanted to lock her up, then completely humiliate and ravage her to no end.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Junior-apprentice Sister, I was hoping for this day to come. Finally, you have fallen into my hands. Be relieved, I won’t kill you. I don’t know how many times I wished that I could lock you away, waste your martial arts, and plunder you daily.” Huang Sanping greedily licked his lips; this was truly the most wonderful and greatest event ever. Naturally, as a genius of the Moon Seizing Sect, he had no lack of women swarming around him. But the woman in front of him was different. She was the one that was favored by the Moon Seizing Sect’s Sect Master to be the future successor. Being able to ruin someone with Zhou Xinyu’s status brought him a great deal of excitement and satisfaction.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhou Xinyu had lost all color.

Thinking about the hellish future she would have to live, she only felt absolutely horrified! With her true essence sealed, she didn’t even have the ability to commit suicide. As for biting her tongue to kill herself, even mortals wouldn’t die, much less a martial artist.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?

How stupid of him. Did he think he could rely on the Shattered Demon Heart Crystal to make a breakthrough in this final moment, and reverse the tables to kill us? Humph! Even if I swallow the Shattered Demon Heart Crystal, I will still die when my body explodes from the energy!” Huang Zixuan sullenly said as he sneered.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Motherf*cker!” Huang Sanping flew into a rage as he heard this, “This idiot! If he dies then he should die alone, but why does he have to touch my precious Shattered Demon Heart Crystal! F*ck!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Huang Sanping spoke, he suddenly realized something and then turned onto Zhou Xinyu, his wicked eyes changing into those of a wild beast that wanted to take a bite out of its prey, “You slut, why would you give him the Shattered Demon Heart Crystal!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs he spoke, he grabbed Zhou Xinyu’s hair and viciously yanked, causing her to painfully scream.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Slut! Slut! You dare help outsiders! I will let you know what it means to beg for death! Second Uncle, break this slut’s meridians first and ruin her martial arts, lest she cause any more trouble in the future!” As Huang Sanping spoke, he discovered that Huang Zixuan stood there as if he hadn’t heard him. Instead, his eyes were shifted onto Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuang Sanping looked down, and suddenly paused; he could feel a faint breath of life coming from Lin Ming’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This boy hasn’t died!? He’s like this, but he still has life?” Huang Sanping said with surprise.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuang Zixuan frowned, then slowly said, “To live up to now even after swallowing the Shattered Demon Heart Crystal is really a cause for surprise. Looking at his appearance, he should have already persisted for a long period of time, yet he hasn’t died!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Humph! He hasn’t died? Even better. First I’ll tear apart his hand and feet tendons, and then I’ll save him. I want him to experience a life worse than death!” Huang Sanping’s eyes flashed with a bloodthirsty elation. If Lin Ming had died so easily, it would be difficult to erase the hate in his heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuang Zixuan shook his head and said, “It’s useless. Since he swallowed the Shattered Demon Heart Crystal, he will die without a doubt. Even a Xiantian master with insufficient cultivation will die, let alone this boy.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Every moment he can live longer is fine.” Huang Sanping grinned as he walked over, grabbing Lin Ming. First he would feed him some pills to sustain his life, then before anything else, he would slice Lin Ming’s wrist and cut apart his wrist tendons.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePu!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe saber stabbed down. But, it didn’t enter that deeply. The blade pierced down just a bit, cutting apart the blackish-red skin, then was stuck there as if it were mired, unable to enter any further.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?

He saw Lin Ming’s skin began to rustle as it flaked away like dried scraps of paper being burned away by fire. Then, under that blackened exterior was tender flesh that seemed as if it were from a newborn baby.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Huang Sanping’s blade attempted to cut into this tender pink flesh, it wasn’t even able to leave behind a scar.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuang Sanping looked as if he saw a ghost while he watched this scene. But, he didn’t believe in superstitious nonsense. He kept slicing at Lin Ming’s body, but each sword was only able to rub off the blackened red skin, revealing the incomparably soft skin underneath, without even a single blade scar left behind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ping’er, fall back!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuang Zixuan’s expression changed; something wasn’t right!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, his voice hadn’t even faded when it was too late.

Lin Ming, who was lying like a corpse on the ground suddenly opened his eyes, his pupils colored with a deep glazed fold, thunder shooting out from his sharp gaze.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming glanced at the panic-stricken Huang Sanping with indifference in his eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuang Sanping was someone who wouldn’t be afraid even if he saw a corpse jump up from its grave. However, Lin Ming’s gaze was too terrifying. It was just like the eyes of a death god, a callous apathy that froze the soul, causing anyone who saw it to shiver.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuang Sanping instantly paled.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ping’er!
