The beasts were not strong fighters if measured by strength of arm. Elayne waited, preparing weaves. Those Draghkar who tried to flee, she burned from the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the last of them were dead—at least, the ones they could see—Elayne waved Birgitte to approach. The air smelled sharply of burned flesh. Elayne wrinkled her nose, and reached down from horseback to take Birgitte’s head in her hands, Healing the woman\u0027s ears. The babes kicked as she did so. Did they react to times when she Healed someone, or was that her fancy? Elayne reached down to hold her stomach with one arm as Birgitte stepped back, looking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Warder nocked an arrow, and Elayne felt her alarm. Birgitte loosed, and a Draghkar stumbled back from cover inside a nearby tent. A Seanchan stumbled out, eyes glassed over. The feeding had been interrupted halfway through; the poor fellow would never be right in the mind again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne turned her horse and saw some Seanchan troops charging into the area. Birgitte spoke to them, then turned to speak to Elayne. Elayne just shook her head, and Birgitte hesitated, then said something else to the Seanchan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne’s guards grouped around her again, watching the Seanchan with distrust. Elayne understood the sentiment perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBirgitte waved her forward, and they continued on in the direction they had been going. As they did, a damane and sul\u0027dam approached and—surprisingly—curtsied to Elayne. Perhaps this Fortuona had given them orders to respect foreign monarchs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne hesitated, but what was she going to do? She could return to her own camp for Healing, but that would take time, and it was urgent that she speak with Mat. What was the point of spending days drawing up war plans if he was going to throw them aside? She trusted him—Light, she had to—but she’d still rather know what he intended to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, then held out her foot to the damane. The woman frowned, then glanced to the suldam. Both seemed to take it as an insult. Elayne had certainly intended it as one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe suldam nodded, and her damane reached to touch Elayne’s leg just above her booted foot. Elayne’s sturdy boots looked like something a soldier would wear, not a queen, but she didn’t intend to ride into battle wearing slippers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small icy shock of Healing ran through her, and her hearing returned slowly. The low pitches returned first. Explosions. The distant boom of dragonfire, the rush of the river nearby. Several Seanchan talking. Midranges came next, then a flood of sound. Flaps rustling, screams of soldiers, calls of horns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them to Heal the others\", Elayne said to Birgitte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBirgitte raised an eyebrow, probably wondering why Elayne wouldn’t just give the order herself. Well, these Seanchan paid very close attention to which people could speak to one another. Elayne would not give them the honor of speaking to them directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBirgitte relayed the order, and the suldam s lips drew to a line. She had had the sides of her hair shaved; she was highborn. Light willing, Elayne had managed to insult her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will do it\", the woman said. \"Though why any of you would want to be Healed by an animal is beyond me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seanchan didn’t believe in letting damane Heal. At least, that was what they kept claiming—that hadn’t stopped them from reluctantly teaching the weaves to their captive women, now that they’d seen firsthand what an advantage it was in battle. From what Elayne had heard, the highborn rarely accepted that Healing, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let’s go\", Elayne said, riding forward. She waved for her soldiers to stay behind and be Healed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBirgitte eyed her, but did not object. The two of them hurried on, Birgitte mounting her horse and riding with Elayne toward the Seanchan command building. One story, perhaps the size of a small farmhouse, it sat in a large, high-walled cleft at the southern base of Dashar Knob—they’d moved it from the top, as Mat worried it would be too exposed. The top would continue to be used for overseeing the battle at short intervals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne allowed Birgitte to help her dismount—Light, but she was starting to feel unwieldy. It was as if she were a ship in dry dock. She took a moment to properly compose herself. Smooth features, emotions in control. She picked at her hair, straightened her dress, then walked into the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\", she bellowed as she stepped in, \"in the name of a bloody, twofingered Trolloc haystack-grunter do you think you are doing, Matrim Cauthon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsurprisingly, the curse made the man grin as he looked up from the map table. He wore his hat and coat over some very nice silken clothing that looked as if it had been tailored to match the hat’s color, and to include tooled leather at the cuffs and collar so as to not be so out of place. It smelled of some kind of compromise. Why was his hat banded with pink ribbon, though?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Elayne\", Mat said. \"I figured that I could look forward to seeing you soon\". He waved to a chair, bearing the red and gold of Andor, at the side of the room. It was extra cushioned, with a cup of warm tea steaming on the stand beside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurn you, Matrim Cauthon, she thought. When did you grow so clever?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seanchan Empress sat on her own throne at the head of the room, Min at her side, draped in enough green silk to supply a shop in Caemlyn for two weeks. Elayne did not miss the fact that Fortuona’s throne was two fingers higher than Elayne’s. Bloody insufferable woman. \"Mat. There are Draghkar in your camp\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burn it\", he said. \"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should say there were Draghkar in your camp\", Elayne said. \"We dealt with them. You need to tell your archers to keep better watch\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’ve told them\", Mat complained. \"Bloody ashes. Somebody check on the archers, I—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great Prince!\" a Seanchan messenger said, skidding through the doorway. He went to his knees, then prostrated himself with a smooth motion, never stopping his narrative. \"Archer bank is down! Hit by Sharan outriders—they masked their attack by smoke from fireballs\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood and bloody ashes!\" Mat said. \"Send sixteen damane and sul’dam down there now! Send to the northern archery units and bring squads forty-two and fifty down. And tell the scouts I’ll have them flogged if they let anything like this happen again\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great One\", the scout said, saluting and scrambling to his feet, backing out of the room without looking up to avoid the risk of \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-211.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
