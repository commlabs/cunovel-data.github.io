They came—just as the stupid animals they were in truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe barely saw him coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got just a glimpse of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the phone call he’d made to her, she’d guessed that he was Jake. She’d giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d almost giggled, too, it was so damned perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what an idiot woman. You’d think they’d have to get through some kind of school to broadcast the news. But a pretty blonde was all you had to be, it seemed. Maybe not. Maybe others were smarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her when she came staggering along the overgrown and marshy trail near the bayou, swearing as she did so. Actually, he watched her for a while. He didn’t know what it was about her that had made him want to do this. He’d plotted and planned his first kill forever; he’d thought that it would be his only kill. But he started hearing the voice again. She was nosy. She was going to start dredging things up and just might have some journalistic abilities. The voice said that she needed to go. And looking at her, he had begun to anticipate the kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced toward Beaumont; he could see the plantation through the trees. But there was nothing going on there—the plantation offered its last tour at four, and people were usually off the property by five. Even the actors and historians would all be by the road now, ready to head out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stumbled her way to the small clearing. Her little red spiked heels were completely ruined, and her jacket was torn. But though she was irritated, she wanted the story more. In fact, when he came upon her, she was looking down at her shoes and cursing about how much they had cost her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it, what the hell are you doing here?” she demanded, tossing back her head of bleached blond curls. “I was expecting—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never voiced what she was expecting. He was quick. The needle got her with such speed that she barely gasped, much less managed to get out a scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she fell, he heard the horses. He heard the rummaging over on the next trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to move with speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled her down to the true swampy area just before the bayou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her head under in just a half foot of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t struggle. She was out, and she was easy to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was dead, he couldn’t help but roll her over. He smiled, looking at her face. That pretty, bitchy face, all clotted with mud now. Her lashes were slipping. False lashes; she’d been all makeup and hype and selfishness. Actually, he’d done the damned world a favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn’t look so good on the eleven o’clock news now. Of course, they wouldn’t find her right away, and they wouldn’t expect to find her out here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut somebody was out here now. He had to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd move quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood in gathering twilight, cursing her mare for throwing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor mare; it wasn’t her fault—she had been startled. Scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn you, foul rodent!” she cried into the bushes. She swore softly; it was time to walk, and walk quickly. “Last time I follow a ghost into the woods!” she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it a ghost? Was there really a ghost? Or did she have deep-seated memories that she needed to address, and seeing the ghost of Marshall Donegal was a way of doing it? Hmm. That would be a good one for a shrink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe, just maybe, people did see ghosts. And maybe it was some kind of a gift, and she’d been far too terrified to ever recognize the possibility before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake had that gift—that sixth sense or intuition. And when he’d come to her with it, she had simply panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, too late on that one!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused; she heard something coming from the pines and brush closer to the bayou. Gator? It was unlikely that one of the giant crocodilians she’d known all her life was going to come this far in off the bayou and stalk her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe quickened her pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, she knew that even on land an alligator could move damned fast as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, no. The woods here were filled with birds, the bayou was brimming with fish and there were plenty of small mammals. A gator had not had a whiff of her and decided that it was time for his evening meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard it again. Definitely not a gator, because she kept hearing the rustling, would stop—and then the rustling would stop as well. A beast of prey would come straight for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to run. As she did so, she heard a thrashing in the woods ahead of her and then from one of the other trails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swore and looked around her. There was a fallen slender pine near her, leaning against an oak. She tested the trunk carefully, found that it would bear her weight and crawled up to the branches of the hardier oak. She kept crawling, hoping that whatever was out there didn’t climb trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thrashing around her grew louder, as if amplified in the thickening darkness of the night. She finally realized that she could hear hoofbeats, and a rider was coming for her. She waited, barely daring to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Cliff knew that she was out here. When her mare came back without her, he’d be on the trail, coming to find her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even as she heard the sound of a horse, she saw something dark below her. Not a creature—a man. A man who looked like a shadow because he was dressed in black: black boots, jeans, sweatshirt and hoodie. He moved with his face lowered, and in the darkness he might have been a black shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she seeing shadows now instead of ghosts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was approaching the tree; he paused as if listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard her name called through the trees. And she no longer heard the sound of hoofbeats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, the entire world seemed silent. She waited, not daring to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness fell in earnest, but the moon prevailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, naturally, the moon was covered by clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley cursed herself for starting out alone tonight. She had to breathe; she tried to do it silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, though she couldn’t see him, she was certain that the man below her in the dark hoodie was looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he see her frozen there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her position. She couldn’t tell if he was there or not anymore; his form seemed to have been swallowed up by the blackness of the ground below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was rustling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was someone below her, someone who seemed to be stalking the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething banged against the tree. A man’s hand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to slip; she felt a splinter of bark shoot into her hand and barely kept from crying out. She tried to shift her position and fell, a scream escaping her lips at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe landed hard on human flesh, toppling the standing man to the ground. Panic seized her and she shot out a fist, striking anywhere she could as she tried to rise. She made it halfway to her feet when she heard him shout out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bloody hell, Ashley! Why are you hitting me, damn it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went still and started trembling. For a minute, she still had to wonder if he’d been in the pines before the bayou, stalking her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then both heard it; more noise coming from the trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ashley! Jake! Where the hell are you two?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was Cliff’s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd from the bayou, another voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey! What’s going on in there? I have a gun, and I know how to use it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake scrambled up, half knocking Ashley over but then drawing her to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA light suddenly glared into the darkness, and they both raised their hands to protect their eyes. Cliff came trotting up on his favorite mount, Jeff. He dismounted in the little clearing where he found them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cliff!” Jake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s your horse?” Cliff asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is your horse?” Ashley asked Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mine is tethered down the road—he meant you!” Jake told her, irritated. “What the hell are you doing, skulking around in the woods by yourself? Jesus, Ashley, how much of an idiot are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was clearly upset, but he took a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it, I would have thought that you had some sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the safety slide on Cliff’s shotgun, and she felt a millisecond of fear again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wrong; Cliff was bitter, and he was going to shoot her in the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone is coming,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later, his shotgun aimed at the clearing, Toby Keaton came into view. Seeing them, he lowered his weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this? A family meeting? You guys scared the hell out of me! What’s going on over here?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was out riding. Some fairly big mammal scared Varina, my mare,” said Ashley. Ruefully, she added, “She threw me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToby looked at Jake, standing beside her, and Cliff, seated again up on Jeff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With what went on—you all damn near scared the death out of me. I mean, this side is your property, but I’m just a spit across that bayou. You’ve got to warn me when you’re going to be rustling around by the water at night. I can tell the difference between the sound of a gator and the sound of folks stomping around in the woods, you know!” Toby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was clearly shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Toby, I’m so sorry,” Ashley said. She looked at him. His black jacket didn’t have a hood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he might have a hoodie stuck down beneath his coat; his shirt was black as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you get over here, Toby?” Jake asked him, as if reading Ashley’s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I live next door, remember?” Toby said, exasperated. “One of my hounds was going crazy, but he lost the scent at the water. I don’t come out at night without a shotgun. God knows when you’re going to come upon a doped-up schoolkid, a gator or, hell, a damned poacher! Or just a nutcase now, like whoever did in old Charles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry. Toby, how did you get here?” Ashley repeated. “Have you been over in the woods right by the bayou?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I came over in my little aluminum canoe,” Toby said. “I heard all manner of rustling—and it’s turned out to be you!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heart-of-evil-krewe-of-hunters-2/page-28.html","bookId":2276,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:00 PM"}
