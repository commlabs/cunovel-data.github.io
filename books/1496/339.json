{"id":45656,"no":339,"title":"Chapter 337: Gold Sun!","content":"\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun’s consciousness was fading. At the same time, everything around him seemed to slow down. He suddenly found himself thinking about how he used to light incense on Mount Hood, and everything that happened in the Spirit Stream Sect, the Blood Stream Sect, and then the River-Defying Sect....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs those memories flashed through his mind, he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a smile of both bitterness and helplessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe practiced cultivation in order to live forever, and yet, in pursuit of that goal, he always ended up in deadly crises. The slightest mistake in such a situation could lead to him losing his poor little life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was somewhat of a paradox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To live forever,” he murmured, “you don’t just have to struggle against the heavens, you have to fight other people. It’s a narrow, rugged path to walk, a path that most people give up on. Many people meet defeat, or end up losing their way....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Living forever.... That\u0027s the whole reason I started to practice cultivation. To live forever....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Live forever.... I’m going to live forever!!” Suddenly, everything became incredibly clear. Although he felt incredibly weak at the moment, he was completely focused on living forever. That one simple thought continued to fill his mind, like the rumblings of thunder!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t count on other people all the time. I have to get stronger! Only if I get strong enough can I make sure that nobody interferes with my will to live forever!!” Bai Xiaochun trembled as his heart and mind roared, causing his nine spiritual seas to begin to rage and emit thunderous rumblings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heaven-Dao aura which had built up in his nine spiritual seas throughout Foundation Establishment suddenly erupted out. It was like a string, connecting all of the nine spiritual seas and drawing them together into one!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun had already been in a position to begin the process of reaching Gold Core. Now, being completely focused on his desire to live forever, and with his life actually being on the line, he was ready to break through!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Live forever!!” Bai Xiaochun threw his head back and roared, and as he did, his nine spiritual seas erupted with shocking energy, energy that surged out of him and connected to heaven and earth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heaven-Dao aura caused colors to flash in the sky, and a huge wind to kick up. An enormous, swirling vortex appeared overhead, so large that the entire Sky River Court was covered!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden appearance of the rumbling vortex caused many people to look up and then involuntarily gasp!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the wind swept around Bai Xiaochun, bolts of lightning appeared up above, as well as an illusory scene that looked somewhat like nine seas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in that exact moment that his Gold Core opponent closed in with killing intent surging. Even as he reached out to attack, his face fell, and the energy surging from Bai Xiaochun battered him backward by over 30 meters!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You....” the young man said, his face a mask of disbelief. What shocked him was not the fact that Bai Xiaochun was choosing this moment to step into Core Formation, but rather, that this type of Core Formation was something completely different than anything he had ever seen before!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever before had he ever seen such strange signs and portents appear in heaven and earth during Core Formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun hadn’t even actually reached Core Formation, and yet the mere pressure and aura was so powerful that he couldn’t get close. The young Gold Core cultivator was completely and utterly taken aback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t the only one. Everyone in the area was shocked beyond belief!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a Heaven-Dao aura. Don’t tell me... don’t tell me he’s going to reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nascent Soul Daoist masters from the Sky River Court were also shocked, and some of them even had looks of jealousy on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeaven-Dao Gold Core was something out of legend!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe term Gold Core was actually a blanket term often applied to different levels. The Core Formation stage was more properly classified into the heaven, earth, and mortal varieties. The Mortal-Dao of men led to Mortal Core. Earth-Dao led to Earth Core. And Heaven-Dao led to Gold Core!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Heaven-Dao Gold Core could truly be considered Gold Core!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only way to reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core was to start out in Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment. And yet, being in Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment wasn’t a guarantee of being able to reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeaven-Dao Gold Core experts were as rare as phoenix feathers or qilin horns, and not a single one had appeared in the last 10,000 years, not even in the Middle Reaches. The crushing pressure exerted by the Heaven-Dao Gold Core stage was something that could only be read about in the ancient records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the Nascent Soul patriarchs of the River-Defying Sect weren’t as surprised as everyone else, they were still taken aback. They knew that Bai Xiaochun was in the Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment stage, but that didn’t necessarily mean that he would reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was always a chance that he would fail, but if he succeeded, and formed a Heaven-Dao Gold Core, then it would mean his future potential was almost limitless, and he would also be capable of crushing anyone else in the same stage as him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battlefield suddenly went quiet. The Heaven-Dao aura which was now crushing down on everyone ensured that all fighting stopped!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes were looking in the direction of Bai Xiaochun. Not even a deva would be able to interfere with the process of Heaven-Dao Gold Core, and if they tried, they would be punished by the heavens!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFailure or success would not depend on any outside force, only on the person striving to reach Core Formation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs everyone watched, the crashing of thunder grew louder and louder in the sky above. At the same time, Bai Xiaochun’s ninth sea began to merge with the eighth, and at the same time, the first sea merged with the second!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the four seas merged together, colors flashed in the sky, the wind screamed, and the pressure grew more intense. Even the Nascent Soul cultivators were panting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The merging has started....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The process of breaking through from Foundation Establishment into Gold Core involves merging the spiritual seas. To start out by merging four together is the best. Merging six spiritual seas at the beginning is rare, and for someone to merge eight would be rare even in the Upper Reaches riversource sects!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bai Xiaochun already has four of the seas merged together....” The Gold Core and Nascent Soul cultivators were all looking up at the signs in the sky, and commenting among themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, many of the cultivators from the Sky River Court actually sighed in relief when they saw that Bai Xiaochun had only merged four of the seas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A mere four merged spiritual seas means that he will fail to reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core!” The Sky River Court cultivators weren’t the only ones to realize this; the patriarchs from the River-Defying Sect were now starting to get nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the junior patriarch of the River-Defying Sect, the patriarchs viewed him with utmost importance. They had originally planned to do everything in their power to help Bai Xiaochun reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core after the battle was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, something unexpected had happened, and Bai Xiaochun was forcing Core Formation in the middle of the fighting. To the River-Defying Sect, this unexpected event was turning out to be a big setback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was at this point that, all of a sudden, cries of shock began to rise up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s not stopping at four!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another merging is taking place!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo spiritual seas had merged on the top, and two on the bottom. But now, the first two spiritual seas were beginning to merge with the third!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that wasn’t the end of it! The eighth and ninth spiritual seas were slowly beginning to join together with the seventh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs that happened, the Heaven-Dao aura grew even more intense, suppressing the cultivation bases of all cultivators, and even throwing them into chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore and more cries of shock rang out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could this be happening?!?!” The Sky River Court cultivators were completely shocked, especially the young Gold Core expert who had been trying to kill Bai Xiaochun moments ago. That young man was trembling, his expression that of complete disbelief, and his heart was filled with regret at the realization that he had provoked a monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six seas!!” Patriarch Frigidsect from the Spirit Stream Division and Master Godwind of the Blood Stream Division were both overjoyed. The other patriarchs had the same reaction, and as for Li Qinghou and the other Gold Core cultivators, they were watching with wide eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, before the uproar could even commence, something else happened up above in the sky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first three spiritual seas began to merge into the fourth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimultaneously, the seventh through ninth spiritual seas began to connect to the sixth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was changing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottom four spiritual seas and the top four spiritual seas were drawing closer together, and between all of them was the fifth spiritual sea!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the fifth spiritual sea didn’t seem to be doing anything at all, it was obvious that all nine of the spiritual seas were merging together!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heaven-Dao pressure grew stronger than ever, exploding out into the entire area with unprecedented intensity!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat pressure was almost like a natural protection offered to anyone stepping into the Heaven-Dao Gold Core stage. As the pressure roiled out, something else happened that no one noticed. The ancient gravekeeper appeared high up in the sky. First, he looked at the spiritual seas, then down at Bai Xiaochun....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone watched as the nine spiritual seas slowly converged upon each other; as they did, they began to form a shape....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, that shape was a circle!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nine golden spiritual seas were completely eye-catching. To everyone who was looking at them, they seemed almost like a golden sun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a true and authentic Gold Core!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-336\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-338\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-337","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM"}
