The first thing upon entering, she went straight to the Lady and handed her the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think? Is it a name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Lady took it, Weezy moved to her side and together they stared at the weird glyphs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment the Lady nodded. \"It has been so long since I have seen this form of writing. It has been dead for ages. But, yes, it is a name.\" She then made a sound like two grunts of different pitch connected by a click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a name?\" Eddie said. He sounded as if he was suppressing a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady looked up at him. \"I believe that is what I said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy realized that Eddie wasn\u0027t used to the Lady\u0027s literal nature, so she jumped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But is it the name - Rasalom\u0027s Other Name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lady shrugged. \"Who is to say? I have no way of telling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it came from the broken sigil,\" Eddie said. \"It was written on the only remaining section of the border.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the sigil is made of tenathic,\" Weezy added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken said, \"If that\u0027s true, then it can only be from the First Age - the secret of forging it was lost in the Cataclysm. We have no choice but to proceed on the assumption this is his Other Name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if it\u0027s not?\" Weezy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will never be sure until we try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy finally looked directly at the playpen. Since entering the apartment, she\u0027d kept it in her peripheral vision. Now she had to confront the reality of burdening that baby with Rasalom\u0027s Other Name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs ever, he sat in his space and gnawed a soup bone. He seemed perfectly content, oblivious to the role he was about to play in a cosmic drama. If Glaeken was right, his limited intelligence would allow him to remain oblivious. And that in turn would protect him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him and thought about how they were all pawns being moved around a cosmic game board. And now the pawns in this room were about to move him, bringing him into the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut hadn\u0027t he always been in play? Wasn\u0027t that what Jonah Stevens had in mind when he started designing his own strategy using his bloodline - a strategy aimed at producing a child that would supplant the One?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, in a way, Jonah was going to get his wish: His grandchild was going to stop the One, though not in the way he\u0027d intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if it\u0027s not the One\u0027s Other Name,\" Eddie said, \"we haven\u0027t lost anything, have we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy looked from Glaeken to the Lady. \"Have we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Other Naming Ceremony can be performed only once on the child. Once given an Other Name, it cannot be undone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy looked back to the baby. \"So, he could wind up with an Other Name that has no power. Then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken shrugged. \"It is the only name we have. Unless you know of some other inscribed tenathic sigil somewhere, we must accept it as the only name we will ever have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to go with it, Weez,\" Eddie said. \"And the sooner the better, if you ask me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t asking him. She shook her head. \"I want to wait for Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie scowled. \"He could be cooling his heels in a jail cell for all we know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Glaeken said. \"Where is Jack? Why isn\u0027t he here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did she explain? She wasn\u0027t sure herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something about the situation bothers him. He thinks it\u0027s too easy, too pat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t argue with him on that. But if the sigil is, as you say, made of tenathic, then it must be genuine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree, but he wanted another look at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were caught trespassing in the Lodge,\" Eddie said. \"We were lucky we got away. Jack might not be so lucky a second time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know Jack,\" she snapped, fully intending the double meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie sighed. \"I do. Or at least I\u0027ve been getting to know him. But nobody\u0027s perfect. I think it was risky going back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And don\u0027t you think the stakes merit some risk? We\u0027ll wait until we hear from Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have the authority to say that, but she guessed enough of her determination shone through. No one argued. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-87.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
