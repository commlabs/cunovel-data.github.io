Law-abiding . . . except for the thirty-eight million dollars she took from the CHF hackers\u0027 accounts. Not to mention the millions she recovered in subsequent hacks. She hadn\u0027t kept the money, of course. She had simply moved it into accounts so the FBI could retrieve it. Still, in order to find the money, she had visited-she preferred that word to hacking-protected systems. She had been so cautious and was certain she had gotten in and out without leaving any footprints the FBI or any other agency could follow. She hadn\u0027t stolen anything for herself or changed anything that would cause harm. She was only helping out. That didn\u0027t make her a criminal . . . did it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was she kidding? If they knew what she had done, she\u0027d have been on her way to lockup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, as she sat there under the close scrutiny of two FBI agents, she wondered if breaking into one of those sites had been her downfall. She kept reminding herself that she\u0027d been careful-she was always careful-yet there were times when she\u0027d been in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence as the two men continued to look at her so expectantly was unnerving. One second she was confident she was safe, and the next she was ready to put her hands out for handcuffs. Phillips finally went around his desk and took a seat while Agent Scott, his arms folded across his chest, studied her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe desperately tried not to look at him, but it was impossible not to notice how attractive he was. She couldn\u0027t believe she was thinking about such foolish things now. Focus, she told herself. Focus on the problem at hand. Her ability to concentrate was one of her strongest traits. How many times had the sisters of St. Dominic\u0027s High School praised her for that very thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere these men going to arrest her or not? She could feel the panic returning. Was this how Will felt every time the police knocked on his door? she wondered. Or was he more cavalier about it all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a breath and asked, \"Why am I here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgent Scott answered, \"I\u0027ve been wanting to meet you. I\u0027ve heard a lot about you, Allison. Your talents are quite impressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who have you been talking to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In other words, you aren\u0027t going to tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer her question. He just smiled. The dimple in his cheek when he smiled made him look less intimidating. In fact, in any other situation she would have said it gave him a roguish charm. He had a lovely accent, too. British or Australian, she guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgent Phillips spoke up. \"As you know, this is a new facility, and our work here is very important.\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the little I\u0027ve seen, it\u0027s impressive.\" She glanced at Agent Scott and said, \"I should get going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she was getting up, Phillips asked, \"How do you feel about taking a lie detector test?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat back down. \"I\u0027m sorry. . . . Take a lie detector . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Phillips said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I want to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would like you to come work for us,\" he explained. \"But you\u0027re going to have to pass a lie detector test first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t quite grasp what he was saying. \"You\u0027re offering me a job?\" She glanced from one agent to the other. Both were nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeak with relief because she didn\u0027t have to worry about going to prison, she let out the breath she\u0027d been holding in. \"Thank you for the offer, but I\u0027m going to have to decline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Phillips asked. \"You don\u0027t even know what the job is or what your salary would be. How can you say no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to be blunt, she decided. \"I don\u0027t want to work here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhillips looked astonished. \"Why not?\" he asked, and before she could answer, he said, \"I don\u0027t think you understand what a unique opportunity this is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know you want to finish college,\" Agent Scott said. \"We\u0027d work around that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s in her last year,\" Phillips told him. He looked at Allison as he added, \"It\u0027s taken her five years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled sweetly. \"That\u0027s right, Agent Phillips. It will be five years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing that she was beginning to get irritated, Scott intervened. \"I think you should take some time to think about it before you decide. We haven\u0027t explained what you\u0027ll be doing here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not interested, Agent Scott.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me Liam,\" he insisted. \"How about we talk later? You\u0027re going over to Jordan\u0027s tonight, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did he know that? \"Yes,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Turning to Phillips, he said, \"Are we done here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now. I had hoped to test her today,\" he admitted, \"but we can wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. She needed time alone to figure out what exactly was going on. She knew there was a hidden agenda. She just didn\u0027t know what it was. How had they found out about her \"talents\"? Whom had they talked to? More important to know, what did they want her to do? If she had considered their offer for even one second, she would have insisted on answers to these questions, but the fact that they had manipulated her into this situation raised red flags she couldn\u0027t ignore. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-15.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
