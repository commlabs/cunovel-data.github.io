If I took him someplace new, I didn’t want either of us to overthink it. And if it didn’t feel natural, I wouldn’t do it. What we had together was too precious to spoil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning my hands down his chest, I gentled him, let him feel my love for him. How I worshipped him. There was nothing I wouldn’t do for him, except give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms came around me, one hand pushing into my hair, the other settling at the small of my back, urging me closer. His mouth was open to me, his tongue licking and tasting. I sank into the kiss, angling my head to get at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cock hardened between us, thickening against my belly. He arched his hips upward, increasing the pressure between us, and moaned into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved across his cheek to his throat, licking the salt from his skin before latching on. I sucked rhythmically, scoring him with my teeth, marking him. With his hand at my nape, he held me close, rough sounds of pleasure vibrating against my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling back, I looked at the bright red hickey I’d left him with. “Mine,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yours,” he vowed roughly, his eyes hooded and hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every inch of you.” I moved lower, finding and teasing the flat disks of his nipples. I licked over the tiny points, then around them, my touch feather light until I suckled him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon hissed as my cheeks hollowed on a drawing pull, his hands falling away to grip the comforter on either side of his hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Inside and out,” I said softly, as I turned to his other nipple and lavished similar attention on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I made my way down his straining body, I felt his tension grow. When my tongue rimmed his navel, he jerked violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh,” I soothed him, rubbing my cheek against his throbbing cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d washed up after our earlier round, leaving him smelling clean and delectable. His sac hung heavily between his legs, the satiny flesh bared by his meticulous grooming. I loved that he was as smooth as I was. When he was inside me, the connection was complete in every way, the sensations emphasized by touching skin to skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my hands on his inner thighs, I urged him to spread open wider, giving me room to settle comfortably. Then I licked along the seam of his taut sac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon growled. The untamed, animalistic sound sent a ripple of apprehension through me. Still, I didn’t stop. I couldn’t. I wanted him too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing only my mouth, I worshipped him, sucking softly and caressing him with my tongue. Then I suspended his testicles on the pads of my thumbs, lifting them to access the sensitive skin beneath. His balls drew up, the skin tightening and pulling close to his body. My tongue reached a little lower, an exploratory foray toward my ultimate goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva. Stop.” He panted. “I can’t. Don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind raced as I continued to touch him, my hand gripping his cock and stroking it. He was still too much inside his own head, too focused on what was to come instead of what was happening now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I knew how to get him to focus on something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t we do this together, ace?” Shifting, I turned around, straddling him backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands grabbed my hips before I was fully balanced, yanking my sex down to his waiting mouth. I cried out in surprise as he latched onto my clit, sucking hungrily. Swollen and sensitive from earlier, I could hardly bear the sudden rush of pleasure. He was wild and ravenous, his passion driven by his frustration and fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapping my lips around his cock, I gave him back what he was giving to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I sucked hard on the head of his erection, his groan vibrated against my clit and nearly made me come. He held me to him, his fingers digging into my hips with bruising force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved it. He was unraveling, and while he was afraid of what that meant, it thrilled me. He didn’t trust himself with me, but I trusted him. It was a level of trust we’d worked hard for, shed tears and blood for, and I valued it more than anything else in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFisting his cock, I pumped him, lapping up the surges of pre-cum that spilled from him. I’d just realized he was trembling when he wrenched us to our sides, placing us side by side instead of one on top of the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ate me hard and fast, his tongue pushing into my sex and driving me mad with furious thrusts. I touched the pucker of his anus with the tip of my finger, my mouth sliding feverishly up and down his thickness. He shuddered and the low sound that escaped him sent goose bumps racing across my sweat-misted skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hips were working without volition, grinding my slick sex against his working mouth. I was moaning uncontrollably, my core trembling with tiny shivers of delight. He was fucking me so good with his tongue … driving me insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then his fingertip was mimicking mine, rubbing against my rear entrance. My free hand searched blindly for the lotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon pushed the tube into my grip, a much-needed sign of consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d barely flipped the cap open when his finger pushed inside me. As I arched my back, his cock slipped out of my mouth and I gasped his name, my body absorbing the shock of his unexpected entry. He’d lubed his fingers before passing the tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, I was overwhelmed by him. He was everywhere—around me, inside me, plastered against me. And he wasn’t gentle. His finger in my rear plunged and retreated, fucking me, his forcefulness still tinged with that hint of anger. I was pushing him where he didn’t want to go and he was punishing me with pleasure that came too quick to manage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was gentler with him. Opening my mouth, I sucked his cock. I let the lotion warm on my fingers before I rubbed it against him. And I waited for him to push out for me, to flower open, before I pushed inside with a single finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound that rattled from him then was like nothing I’d ever heard. It was the cry of a wounded animal, but filled with soul-deep pain. He froze against me, breathing hard against my sex, his finger buried deep, his hard body quivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my mouth off him and crooned, “I’m in you now, baby. You’re doing so good. I’m going to make you feel so good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gasped when I slid a little deeper, my fingertip gliding over his prostate. “Eva!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cock swelled even further, turning red, the thick veins standing out along its length, pre-ejaculate spurting onto his lower belly. He was hard as stone, curving up to a point just past his navel. I’d never seen him so aroused and it made me so hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got you.” I stroked gently inside him, my tongue licking along his raging hard-on. “I love you so much, Gideon. I love touching you like this … seeing you this way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, Christ.” He shook violently. “Fuck me, angel. Now,” he bit out, as I rubbed him again. “Hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed his erection and gave him what he demanded, massaging the spot inside him that made him curse and writhe, his body fighting the bombardment of sensation. His hands left me, his big frame arching away, but I held on with my lips and hands, driving him onward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, God,” he sobbed, ripping the comforter in his fists, the tearing sound reverberating through the enclosed space. “Stop. Eva. No more. Damn it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed inside the same moment I sucked hard outside and he came with such force, I choked on the heated flood. He spurted across my lips as I pulled away, over his stomach and my breasts, releasing in a gushing torrent that made it hard to believe he’d already come twice in as many hours. I could feel the contractions against my fingertip, the wrenching pulses that propelled the semen from his cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t until his body stilled that I pulled away, turning around shakily to pull him into my arms. We were a sweaty, sticky mess and I loved that it didn’t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon buried his damp face between my breasts and cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGIDEON’S CHOSEN LOCATION was paradise. His pilot took us over the Windward Islands, flying low over the impossibly beautiful blue waters of the tranquil Caribbean into a private airport not far from our ultimate destination, the Crosswinds resort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were both still pretty shell-shocked when the plane landed. Gideon had had the orgasm of his life, after all. We had our passports stamped with our hair still wet, our hands linked tightly together. We hardly spoke, either to each other or to anyone else. I think we were both too raw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe slid into a waiting limousine and Gideon poured himself a stiff drink. His face gave nothing away, his guard up and impenetrable. I shook my head when he held up the crystal decanter in silent query.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe settled on the seat beside me and put his arm around my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuggled into him, draping my legs over his lap. “Are we okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed a hard kiss to my forehead. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” He tossed back his drink and set the empty tumbler in a cup holder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn’t say anything else on the long drive from the airport to the resort. It was dark by the time we arrived, but the open-air lobby was brightly lit. Framed by lush potted plants and decorated in dark woods and colorful ceramic tiles, the front desk welcomed guests with a carefree yet elegant style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hotel manager was waiting on the circular front drive as we rolled to a stop. His appearance was immaculate, his smile wide. He was clearly excited to have Gideon in residence and doubly so that Gideon knew his name—Claude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaude spoke animatedly, as we followed along behind him with our hands linked firmly together. No one could tell from looking at Gideon how intimate and exposed to each other we’d been only an hour or so before. While my hair had dried in a messy mop, his looked as gorgeous and sexy as ever. His suit was perfectly pressed and beautifully worn, while my dress looked a little limp after the long day. My makeup had washed off in the shower, leaving me pale with the remnants of raccoon eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet Gideon’s possessiveness toward me was clear in the way he gripped me, and how he steered me into our suite in front of him with his hand at the small of my back. He made me feel safe and accepted, even though he was in his work persona and I wasn’t at my best, which reflected on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved him for that. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/entwined-with-you-crossfire-3/page-48.html","bookId":1924,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM"}
