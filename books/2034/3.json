Come on; we\u0027ve got to get out of here!\" Meredith was shouting to be heard. \"It\u0027s your house, Caroline. Everybody grab hands and you lead us to the front door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Caroline said. She didn\u0027t sound as frightened as everybody else. That was the advantage to having no imagination, Bonnie thought. You couldn\u0027t picture the terrible things that were going to happen to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt better with Meredith\u0027s narrow, cold hand grasping hers. She fumbled on the other side and caught Caroline\u0027s, feeling the hardness of long fingernails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see nothing. Her eyes should be adjusting to the dark by now, but she couldn\u0027t make out even a glimmer of light or shadow as Caroline started leading them. There was no light coming through the windows from the street; the power seemed to be out everywhere. Caroline cursed, running into some piece of furniture, and Bonnie stumbled against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVickie was whimpering softly from the back of the line. \"Hang on,\" whispered Sue. \"Hang on, Vickie, we\u0027ll make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made slow, shuffling progress in the dark. Then Bonnie felt tile under her feet. \"This is the front hall,\" Caroline said. \"Stay here a minute while I find the door.\" Her fingers slipped out of Bonnie\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caroline! Don\u0027t let go-where are you? Caroline, give me your hand!\" Bonnie cried, groping frantically like a blind person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the darkness something large and moist closed around her fingers. It was a hand. It wasn\u0027t Caroline\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVickie immediately picked it up, shrieking wildly. The hot, moist hand was dragging Bonnie forward. She kicked out, struggling, but it made no difference. Then she felt Meredith\u0027s arms around her waist, both arms, wrenching her back. Her hand came free of the big one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she was turning and running, just running, only dimly aware that Meredith was be-side her. She wasn\u0027t at all aware that she was still screaming until she slammed into a large armchair that stopped her progress, and she heard herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush! Bonnie, hush, stop!\" Meredith was shaking her. They had slid down the back of the chair to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something had me! Something grabbed me, Meredith!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Be quiet! It\u0027s still around,\" Meredith said. Bonnie jammed her face into Meredith\u0027s shoulder to keep from screaming again. What if it was here in the room with them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds crawled past, and the silence pooled around them. No matter how Bonnie strained her ears, she could hear no sound except their own breathing and the dull thudding of her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie started to nod miserably, then abruptly lifted her head. \"Where\u0027s Vickie?\" she whispered hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I had to let go of her hand to pull you away from that thing. Let\u0027s move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie held her back. \"But why isn\u0027t she screaming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shudder went through Meredith. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God. Oh, God. We can\u0027t leave her, Meredith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t. Meredith, I made Caroline invite her. She wouldn\u0027t be here except for me. We have to get her out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, and then Meredith hissed, \"All right! But you pick the strangest times to turn noble, Bonnie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door slammed, causing both of them to jump. Then there was a crashing, like feet on stairs, Bonnie thought. And briefly, a voice was raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vickie, where are you? Don\u0027t-Vickie, no! No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was Sue,\" gasped Bonnie, jumping up. \"From upstairs!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we have a flashlight?\" Meredith was raging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie knew what she meant. It was too dark to go running blindly around this house; it was too frightening. There was a primitive panic hammering in her brain. She needed light, any light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t go fumbling into that darkness again, exposed on all sides. She couldn\u0027t do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, she took one shaky step away from the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" she gasped, and Meredith came with her, step by step, into the blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie kept expecting that moist, hot hand to reach out and grab her again. Every inch of her skin tingled in anticipation of its touch, and especially her own hand, which she had outstretched to feel her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she made the mistake of remembering the dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, the sickly sweet smell of garbage overwhelmed her. She imagined things crawling out of the ground and then remembered Elena\u0027s face, gray and hairless, with lips shriveled back from grinning teeth. If that thing grabbed hold of her...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t go any farther; I can\u0027t, I can\u0027t, she thought. I\u0027m sorry for Vickie, but I can\u0027t go on. Please, just let me stop here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a whole series of sounds, actually, but they all came so close together that they blended into one terrible swell of noise. First there was screaming, Sue\u0027s voice screaming, \"Vickie! Vickie! No!\" Then a resonant crash, the sound of glass shattering, as if a hundred windows were breaking at once. And over that a sustained scream, on a note of pure, exquisite terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it all stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was it? What happened, Meredith?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something bad.\" Meredith\u0027s voice was taut and choked. \"Something very bad. Bonnie, let go. I\u0027m going to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not alone, you\u0027re not,\" Bonnie said fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found the staircase and made their way up it. When they reached the landing, Bonnie could hear a strange and oddly sickening sound, the tinkle of glass shards falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the lights went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too sudden; Bonnie screamed involuntarily. Turning to Meredith she almost screamed again. Meredith\u0027s dark hair was disheveled and her cheekbones looked too sharp; her face was pale and hollow with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTinkle, tinkle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was worse with the lights on. Meredith was walking toward the last door down the hall, where the noise was coming from. Bonnie followed, but she knew suddenly, with all her heart, that she didn\u0027t want to see inside that room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith pulled the door open. She froze for a minute in the doorway and then lunged quickly inside. Bonnie started for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God, don\u0027t come any farther!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie didn\u0027t even pause. She plunged into the doorway and then pulled up short. At first glance it looked as if the whole side of the house was gone. The French windows that connected the master bedroom to the balcony seemed to have exploded outward, the wood splintered, the glass shattered. Little pieces of glass were hanging precariously here and there from the remnants of the wood frame. They tinkled as they fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiaphanous white curtains billowed in and out of the gaping hole in the house. In front of them, in silhouette, Bonnie could see Vickie. She was standing with her hands at her sides, as motionless as a block of stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vickie, are you okay?\" Bonnie was so relieved to see her alive that it was painful. \"Vickie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVickie didn\u0027t turn, didn\u0027t answer. Bonnie maneuvered around her cautiously, looking into her face. Vickie was staring straight ahead, her pupils pinpoints. She was sucking in little whistling breaths, chest heaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShuddering, Bonnie reeled away. Meredith was on the balcony. She turned as Bonnie reached the curtains and tried to block the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look. Don\u0027t look down there,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown where? Suddenly Bonnie understood. She shoved past Meredith, who caught her arm to stop her on the edge of a dizzying drop. The balcony railing had been blasted out like the French windows and Bonnie could see straight down to the lighted yard below. On the ground there was a twisted figure like a broken doll, limbs askew, neck bent at a grotesque angle, blond hair fanned on the dark soil of the garden. It was Sue Carson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd throughout all the confusion that raged afterward, two thoughts kept vying for dominance in Bonnie\u0027s mind. One was that Caroline would never have her foursome now. And the other was that it wasn\u0027t fair for this to happen on Meredith\u0027s birthday. It just wasn\u0027t fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Meredith. I don\u0027t think she\u0027s up to it right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie heard her father\u0027s voice at the front door as she listlessly stirred sweetener into a cup of chamomile tea. She put the spoon down at once. What she wasn\u0027t up to was sitting in this kitchen one minute longer. She needed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right there, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith looked almost as bad as she had last night, face peaked, eyes shadowed. Her mouth was set in a tight line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll just go out driving for a little while,\" Bonnie said to her father. \"Maybe see some of the kids. After all, you\u0027re the one who said it isn\u0027t dangerous, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could he say? Mr. McCullough looked down at his petite daughter, who stuck out the stubborn chin she\u0027d inherited from him and met his gaze squarely. He lifted his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s almost four o\u0027clock now. Be back before dark,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want it both ways,\" Bonnie said to Meredith on the way to Meredith\u0027s car. Once inside, both girls immediately locked their doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meredith put the car in gear she gave Bonnie a glance of grim understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your parents didn\u0027t believe you, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they believe everything I told them-except anything important. How can they be so stupid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith laughed shortly. \"You\u0027ve got to look at it from their point of view. They find one dead body without a mark on it except those caused by the fall. They find that the lights were off in the neighborhood because of a malfunction at Virginia Electric. They find us, hysterical, giving answers to their questions that must have seemed pretty weird. Who did it? Some monster with sweaty hands. How do we know? Our dead friend Elena told us through a Ouija board. Is it any wonder they have their doubts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re forgetting already,\" Meredith replied softly. \"You predicted it yourself. Life has gone back to normal, and everybody in Fell\u0027s Church feels safer that way. They all feel like they\u0027ve woken up from a bad dream, and the last thing they want is to get sucked in again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie just shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so it\u0027s easier to believe that a bunch of teenage girls got riled up playing with a Ouija board, and that when the lights went out they just freaked and ran. And one of them got so scared and confused she ran right out a window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence and then Meredith added, \"I wish Alaric were here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, Bonnie would have given her a dig in the ribs and answered, \"So do I,\" in a lecherous voice. Alaric was one of the handsomest guys she\u0027d ever seen, even if he was a doddering twenty-two years old. Now, she just gave Meredith\u0027s arm a disconsolate squeeze. \"Can\u0027t you call him somehow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Russia? I don\u0027t even know where in Russia he is now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie bit her lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she sat up. Meredith was driving down Lee Street, and in the high school parking lot they could see a crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Meredith exchanged glances, and Meredith nodded. \"We might as well,\" she said. \"Let\u0027s see if they\u0027re any smarter than their parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie could see startled faces turning as the car cruised slowly into the lot. When she and Meredith got out, people moved back, making a path for them to the center of the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline was there, clutching her elbows with her hands and shaking back her auburn hair distractedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not going to sleep in that house again until it\u0027s repaired,\" she was saying, shivering in her white sweater. \"Daddy says we\u0027ll take an apartment in Heron until it\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What difference does that make? He can follow you to Heron, I\u0027m sure,\" said Meredith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline turned, but her green cat\u0027s eyes wouldn\u0027t quite meet Meredith\u0027s. \"Who?\" she said vaguely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Caroline, not you too!\" Bonnie exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes came up and for an instant Bonnie saw how frightened she was. \"I can\u0027t take any more.\" As if she had to prove her words that minute, she pushed her way through the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her go, Bonnie,\" Meredith said. \"It\u0027s no use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s no use,\" said Bonnie furiously. If Caroline, who knew, was acting this way, what about the other kids?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the answer-in the faces around her. Everybody looked scared, as scared as if she and Meredith had brought some loathsome disease with them. As if she and Meredith were the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe this,\" Bonnie muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it either,\" said Deanna Kennedy, a friend of Sue\u0027s. She was in the front of the crowd, and she didn\u0027t look as uneasy as the others. \"I talked with Sue yesterday afternoon and she was so up, so happy. She can\u0027t be dead.\" Deanna began to sob. Her boyfriend put an arm around her, and several other girls began to cry. The guys in the crowd shifted, their faces rigid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie felt a little surge of hope. \"And she\u0027s not going to be the only one dead,\" she added. \"Elena told us that the whole town is in danger. Elena said...\" Despite herself Bonnie heard her voice failing. She could see it in the way their eyes glazed up when she mentioned Elena\u0027s name. Meredith was right; they\u0027d put everything that had happened last winter behind them. They didn\u0027t believe anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with you all?\" she said helplessly, wanting to hit something. \"You don\u0027t really think Sue threw herself off that balcony!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People are saying-\" Deanna\u0027s boyfriend started and then shrugged defensively. \"Well-you told the police Vickie Bennett was in the room, right? And now she\u0027s off her head again. And just a little bit earlier you\u0027d heard Sue shouting, \u0027No, Vickie, no!\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie felt as if the wind had been knocked out of her. \"You think that Vickie- oh, God, you\u0027re out of your mind! Listen to me. Something grabbed my hand in that house, and it wasn\u0027t Vickie. And Vickie had nothing to do with throwing Sue off that balcony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s hardly strong enough, for one thing,\" Meredith said pointedly. \"She weighs about ninety-five pounds soaking wet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomebody from the back of the crowd muttered about insane people having superhuman strength. \"Vickie has a psychiatric record-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena told us it was a guy!\" Bonnie almost shouted, losing her battle with self-control. The faces tilted toward her were shuttered, unyielding. Then she saw one that made her chest loosen. \"Matt! Tell them you believe us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt Honeycutt was standing on the fringe with his hands in his pockets and his blond head bowed. Now he looked up, and what Bonnie saw in his blue eyes made her draw in her breath. They weren\u0027t hard and shuttered like everyone else\u0027s, but they were full of a flat despair that was just as bad. He shrugged without taking his hands from his pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie, for one of the first times in her life, was speechless. Matt had been upset ever since Elena died, but this...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He does believe it, though,\" Meredith was saying quickly, capitalizing on the moment. \"Now what have we got to do to convince the rest of you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Channel Elvis for us, maybe,\" said a voice that immediately set Bonnie\u0027s blood boiling. Tyler. Tyler Smallwood. Grinning like an ape in his overexpensive Perry Ellis sweater, showing a mouthful of strong white teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not as good as psychic e-mail from a dead Homecoming Queen, but it\u0027s a start,\" Tyler added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt always said that grin was asking for a punch in the nose. But Matt, the only guy in the crowd with close to Tyler\u0027s physique, was staring dully at the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Tyler! You don\u0027t know what happened in that house,\" Bonnie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, neither do you, apparently. Maybe if you hadn\u0027t been hiding in the living room, you\u0027d have seen what happened. Then somebody might believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie\u0027s retort died on her tongue. She stared at Tyler, opened her mouth, and then closed it. Tyler waited. When she didn\u0027t speak, he showed his teeth again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For my money, Vickie did it,\" he said, winking at Dick Carter, Vickie\u0027s ex-boyfriend. \"She\u0027s a strong little babe, right, Dick? She could have done it.\" He turned and added deliberately over his shoulder, \"Or else that Salvatore guy is back in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You creep!\" shouted Bonnie. Even Meredith cried out in frustration. Because of course at the very mention of Stefan pandemonium ensued, as Tyler must have known it would. Everyone was turning to the person next to them and exclaiming in alarm, horror, excitement. It was primarily the girls who were excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEffectively, it put an end to the gathering. People had been edging away surreptitiously before, and now they broke up into twos and threes, arguing and hastening off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie gazed after them angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Supposing they did believe you. What did you want them to do, anyway?\" Matt said. She hadn\u0027t noticed him beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Something besides just standing around waiting to be picked off.\" She tried to look him in the face. \"Matt, are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie thought. \"No. I mean, in one way I\u0027m surprised I\u0027m doing as well as I am, because when Elena died, I just couldn\u0027t deal. At all. But then I wasn\u0027t as close to Sue, and besides... I don\u0027t know!\" She wanted to hit something again. \"It\u0027s just all too much!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie thought. \"No. I mean, in one way I\u0027m surprised I\u0027m doing as well as I am, because when Elena died, I just couldn\u0027t deal. At all. But then I wasn\u0027t as close to Sue, and besides... I don\u0027t know!\" She wanted to hit something again. \"It\u0027s just all too much!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m mad.\" Suddenly Bonnie understood the feelings she\u0027d been having all day. \"Killing Sue wasn\u0027t just wrong, it was evil. Truly evil. And whoever did it isn\u0027t going to get away with it. That would be-if the world is like that, a place where that can happen and go unpunished... if that\u0027s the truth...\" She found she didn\u0027t have a way to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what? You don\u0027t want to live here anymore? What if the world is like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were so lost, so bitter. Bonnie was shaken. But she said staunchly, \"I won\u0027t let it be that way. And you won\u0027t either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe simply looked at her as if she were a kid insisting there was so a Santa Claus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith spoke up. \"If we expect other people to take us seriously, we\u0027d better take ourselves seriously. Elena did communicate with us. She wanted us to do something. Now if we really believe that, we\u0027d better figure out what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt\u0027s face had flexed at the mention of Elena. You poor guy, you\u0027re still as much in love with her as ever, thought Bonnie. I wonder if anything could make you forget her? She said, \"Are you going to help us, Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll help,\" Matt said quietly. \"But I still don\u0027t know what it is you\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to stop that murdering creep before he kills anybody else,\" said Bonnie. It was the first time she\u0027d fully realized herself that this was what she meant to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone? Because you are alone, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are alone,\" Meredith corrected. \"But that\u0027s what Elena was trying to tell us. She said we had to do a summoning spell to call for help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An easy spell with only two ingredients,\" Bonnie remembered from her dream. She was getting excited. \"And she said she\u0027d already told me the ingredients-but she hadn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night she said there were corrupting influences distorting her communication,\" Meredith said. \"Now to me that sounds like what was happening in the dream. Do you think it really was Elena you were drinking tea with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Bonnie said positively. \"I mean, I know we weren\u0027t really having a mad tea party at Warm Springs, but I think Elena was sending that message into my brain. And then partway through something else took over and pushed her out. But she fought, and for a minute at the end she got back control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Then that means we have to concentrate on the beginning of the dream, when it was still Elena communicating with you. But if what she was saying was already being distorted by other influences, then maybe it came out weird. Maybe it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t something she actually said, maybe it was something she did...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hair! I asked her who did hers, and we talked about it, and she said, \u0027Hair is very important.\u0027 And Meredith-when she was trying to tell us the ingredients last night, the first letter of one of them was H!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it!\" Meredith\u0027s dark eyes were flashing. \"Now we just have to think of the other one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I know that too!\" Bonnie\u0027s laughter bubbled up exuberantly. \"She told me right after we talked about hair, and I thought she was just being strange. She said, \u0027Blood is important too.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith shut her eyes in realization. \"And last night, the Ouija board said \u0027Bloodblood-blood.\u0027 I thought it was the other thing threatening us, but it wasn\u0027t,\" she said. She opened her eyes. \"Bonnie, do you think that\u0027s really it? Are those the ingredients, or do we have to start worrying about mud and sandwiches and mice and tea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are the ingredients,\" Bonnie said firmly. \"They\u0027re the kind of ingredients that make sense for a summoning spell. I\u0027m sure I can find a ritual to do with them in one of my Celtic magic books. We just have to figure out the person we\u0027re supposed to summon...\" Something struck her, and her voice trailed off in dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wondering when you\u0027d notice,\" Matt said, speaking for the first time in a long while. \"You don\u0027t know who it is, do you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-dark-reunion-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-3.html","bookId":2034,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:26:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:26:20 PM"}
