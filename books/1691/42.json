{"id":64474,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Josh.\" Ray Arno shook Keene\u0027s hand as he stepped off the private elevator into his penthouse. McKendry followed on Keene\u0027s heels. \"Terr. I tell you, I could hardly believe it when I heard the message on my machine, saying that you\u0027d both be here. Good to see you both alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good to be seen,\" McKendry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay had to work to maintain his smile. Both men seemed to have aged a decade in the past year. McKendry, especially, must have shed another ten pounds since Ray had last seen him. Both men carried grim, haunted looks, as if they\u0027d been through hell and had not quite made it all the way back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay offered drinks and showed them around the penthouse. When he\u0027d given them the inside tour, he hit a switch that automatically drew all of the curtains, revealing picture windows which overlooked the panorama below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Behold. My own private playground,\" he said, pointing out the various hotels along the strip. Naming the mountains. Taking what was almost an owner\u0027s pride in Red Rock Canyon and snowcapped Mount Charleston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitors took in all the grandeur without much reaction. Keene\u0027s usual ebullience was conspicuously absent. He had moved to a window and stood gazing out at the glittering panorama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Van Alman coming?\" he said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tight voice and the use of the last name instead of \"Frik\" were not lost on Ray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s due any minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of good people are dead because of his little treasure hunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And because of us,\" McKendry said. \"We\u0027ve been over all this, Josh - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know, but I detest him and his goddamn device. If he\u0027d letitbe...\" He took a deep breath and turned from the window. \"We got our piece, didn\u0027t we? Like good little errand boys we went and found it, and we\u0027re here to deliver it. But at what cost? If it had been up to me I\u0027d have tossed it into the Cayman Trench and told Frik to go dive for it himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cayman Trench...hundreds of miles long, five miles deep. Ray shook his head. No one would ever have found it there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I needed to know that the past year wasn\u0027t for nothing. And because I promised someone that if this device could be put to good use, I\u0027d see to it that it was. I also promised that if it was going to be used for wrong, I\u0027d prevent it. By any means necessary. Otherwise this is the last place I want to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you came,\" Ray said softly, sensing Keene\u0027s pain. He\u0027d never imagined the man could be this bitter. \"We\u0027re dwindling in number.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKendry shook his head. \"Yeah, I keep trying to figure out what\u0027s happening. Arthur last year. Now Simon\u0027s gone. This goes on, there won\u0027t be anyone left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine with me,\" Keene said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay stared at him. \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a bit. I picked up a new perspective on a lot of things in the past year...what\u0027s important, what\u0027s not. And you know what\u0027s last on the list? This idiotic club. How\u0027d I ever get involved with such a bunch of arrested adolescents?\" Keene made a disgusted sound. \"What could I have been thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me remind you. You were thinking, Life\u0027s too short to play it safe,\" said a new voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all turned. Frikkie stood in the doorway, a shiny titanium briefcase dangling from his good hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, well,\" Keene muttered. \"If it isn\u0027t Mr. Teen America himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrik either didn\u0027t hear the remark or chose to ignore it. \"And you were thinking you didn\u0027t want to miss what could be an historic moment. Truly adefining moment in history. For all we know,A.D. may come to mean \u0027anno device\u0027 instead of anno Domini.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay saw Keene set his jaw and knew what he was thinking: no one could mix grandiosity and arrogance like Fredrick Van Alman and, yes, sometimes you wanted to punch out his lights. But Keene only dropped into a chair and swiveled it toward the window; he went back to staring silently at the bedizened desert, effectively removing himself from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s with him?\" Frik said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better you don\u0027t ask,\" McKendry replied. He fished in his pocket and pulled out a small object. \"Here\u0027s our part of the deal,\" he told Ray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up the piece as if he were about to toss it across the room, apparently changed his mind, and lowered it. He stepped closer and pressed it into Ray\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay understood. People had shed their blood for this little piece of strangeness. No one should play catch with it. He stared a moment at the object in his palm before he closed his fingers around it. It was larger than Arthur\u0027s. Bluer. With the little figure-eight piece at one end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Arthur\u0027s, the strangely textured surface seemed to suck the warmth and moisture from his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Peta?\" Frik asked, looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On her way.\" Ray jerked the thumb of his free hand over his shoulder. \"Should be landing on the helipad any minute.\"And won\u0027t you be surprised to see who\u0027s with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Because we can\u0027t do anything without Arthur\u0027s piece. In the meantime...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set his briefcase on the coffee table. Ray noticed for the first time that it was cuffed to his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrik unlocked the cuff and the catches. He lifted the lid to reveal a gray, foam-lined interior. Nestled among the egg-crate contours were three oddly shaped objects, similar to the piece in Ray\u0027s hand, yet distinct - distant relatives, but unquestionably members of the same family. A wire-frame stand lay in a rectangular cutout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Voila!\" Frik looked around. \"Now, where\u0027s this lab you told me you set up to assemble our treasures?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right through that door back there,\" Ray said without thinking. He\u0027d been toying with Arthur\u0027s piece on the workbench when the call announcing Keene and McKendry\u0027s arrival had come from downstairs. He\u0027d been trying to run a current through it, but not only was it nonconductive, it absorbed whatever he shot into it without altering its own temperature even a fraction of a degree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad he put it away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should wait for Peta,\" he said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will,\" Frik said. He rose and carried the briefcase like a tray toward the rear of the penthouse\u0027s great room. \"We have no choice. But why waste time once she arrives? We can assemble what we have now and be all set to go. When Peta gets here we\u0027ll simply have to plug in the final piece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Frik,\" Ray said, trailing after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. I\u0027ve waited all year for this moment, and I\u0027m not going to put it off a nanosecond longer than absolutely necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay glanced over his shoulder. McKendry was close behind, but Keene remained slouched in his seat by the window. How was he going to steer this little procession away from the lab - at least until he\u0027d checked it out to make sure that Arthur\u0027s piece wasn\u0027t visible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to scoot around Frik. \"At least wait until I straighten up a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" Frik said, not even slowing. \"We\u0027ve known each other too long to worry about messy desks and overflowing wastebaskets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled the door open and stepped through, leaving just enough space for Ray to slip past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay made it to the workbench first and suppressed a groan - You idiot! - when he spotted Arthur\u0027s piece lying out there dead center for all the world to see. Wouldn\u0027t be the end of the world if Frik spotted it, but he\u0027d promised Arthur and Peta not to assemble the device until they arrived, and he wanted to keep his word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretending to clear a space for the briefcase, he swept a forearm across the scarred surface, effectively moving the piece to the side. Picking it up might be too obvious, so he brushed a sheaf of notes over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to see if Frik had spotted it and barely suppressed a sigh of relief. The Afrikaner had stopped inside the door and was gazing at the equipment racked on the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you with all of this stuff?\" he said. \"Looks like an electronics store.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKendry sniffed the air. \"A temperature-controlled, electrostaticfiltered electronics store.\" He glanced at Ray. \"Laminar flow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay nodded. \"Just a hobby. Trying to build a better mousetrap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget mousetraps. Before the night is out you\u0027llreally have something to tinker with,\" Frik said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe removed the wire-frame stand from the briefcase, followed by the three pieces, one by one. He handled them gently, as if they were fragile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay knew that if these were related to the piece Arthur had given him, they were anything but fragile. He didn\u0027t know why, but his mouth began to dry as he watched Frik settle the largest of the three pieces into the base of the platform. After he\u0027d snapped another, slightly smaller piece into the first, he held out his hand for Keene and McKendry\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yours comes next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay handed it over, reluctantly, but he had to marvel at how perfectly it fit into the other two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one is Simon\u0027s?\" McKendry said. He stood behind Frik, watching over his shoulder. His voice was soft, almost hoarse. \"The one he died diving for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one.\" Frik lifted the final, unassembled piece. He rolled it between his thumb and fingers. \"Poor Simon. I miss him. He gave his life for this. I propose we name the device after him. The Brousseau Device, so that we never forget him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if we need that to remember him,\" Keene said from the other room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grand gesture, Ray thought, but ultimately meaningless. What did Frik care who it was named after, as long as he controlled it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Paul Trujold? And Arthur?\" Ray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrik glanced up, a sardonic smile twisting his lips. \"Paul was my employee. I assume Arthur acquiredhis piece through the mail or via your friend Manny, and he died in a men\u0027s room. I think the device deserves a better pedigree than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fit Simon\u0027s piece into the assembly, then jerked back his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Ray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It...\" Frik rubbed his fingers. \"It felt like a shock, like a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit!\" McKendry rasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay didn\u0027t have to ask - he knew what the big man was talking about: the incomplete assembly was moving. It spun around so the gap where the last piece would fit faced the pile of papers Ray had just moved. Platform and all, it began sliding, inching its way across the workbench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do?\" Ray said. He felt his gut coiling into a knot. Objects didn\u0027t move on their own, a force pushed or pulled them, energy was expended...unless it was magnetic and being drawn toward a metallic -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Oh, hell! It was butting up against the papers covering Arthur\u0027s piece. Ray reached out to grab it, but Frik stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" He gripped Ray\u0027s wrist with his good hand. \"Let\u0027s see where it\u0027s going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay had a pretty good idea: it was moving toward the rest of itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, it kept moving, bulldozing the papers aside, until it straddled Arthur\u0027s piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where didthat come from?\" Frik frowned as he pointed. \"That\u0027s...that\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arthur\u0027s,\" Ray said. No use trying to deny it. By process of elimination, Frik certainly knew what it looked like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was supposed to be in New York!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Supposedto be. But it\u0027s been here all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Peta lied about - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she really thought it was there. By now she knows otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" McKendry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story,\" Ray muttered, thinking that it was one he didn\u0027t want to tell. Not yet. Not until Peta and Arthur arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t have to worry about stalling. Frik was off and running. He picked up Arthur\u0027s piece and dragged the assembly and its frame back to the center of the workbench. \"Right now it\u0027s show time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should wait for Peta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for? Peta is coming in empty-handed. As I said before, I\u0027ve waited too long already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed the pair of insulated gloves lying to his right and slipped a glove over his good hand. Before Ray could stop him, he had snapped the fifth and final piece into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of brilliant blue-white light lit the room, knocking Frik backward. He would have fallen if McKendry hadn\u0027t been standing there. Ray too was staggered by the brilliance. He blinked furiously, trying to focus through the floating afterimages, but he could make out only shadows. He heard footsteps pounding in from the great room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell was that?\" Keene\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look who decided to join the party,\" McKendry quipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you jerks trying to do?\" Keene said. \"Wreck the thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Ray could see again. He focused on the workbench and saw the device jittering around as if in an earthquake, only the floor was still. And one of the pieces - Simon\u0027s, no Peta\u0027s, he thought - was smoking. The fumes stung Ray\u0027s nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something\u0027s wrong!\" Frik yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about telling us something we don\u0027t know,\" Keene said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smoking piece twisted and took off, hurtling across the room to shatter against the far wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrik and McKendry hurried over to check out the fragments. McKendry, who had been closest to them, got there first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice work, Van Alman,\" Keene said, his tone verging on a snarl. \"You must\u0027ve put it together wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t have,\" Frik said. \"The way they\u0027re shaped, there\u0027s only one way those pieces can interlock. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Face it, man,\" Keene said, keeping up the pressure. \"You blew it. Whatever you did triggered an eject button.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More like are ject button,\" McKendry said, picking up a handful of fragments. \"This piece was bogus, guys. The device spat it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peta!\" Frik said, doing his best to ball his good fist within the heavy glove and pounding it on the table. \"Damn her! She gave me a fake! When she gets here - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch out!\" Ray\u0027s gaze had been fixed on the device. \"It\u0027s up to something!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all watched as the device began to glow and a blue light enveloped it and its stand. The glow brightened and seemed to thicken - not a term Ray would normally apply to light, but the best he could come up with at the moment - and obscure the device within it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly a beam of bright blue shot out, thick as a man\u0027s wrist and laser focused. It barely missed Keene\u0027s head as it lanced toward a spot on the wall just to the left of the door. Keene stared at it a moment before stepping through into the great room. \"Get in here, guys. You\u0027vegot to see this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay led the way but stopped dead in the doorway when he saw what Keene was talking about. McKendry plowed into his back, propelling him into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beam of light had pierced the wall without damaging it - no hole, no burn marks. As far the beam was concerned, the wall didn\u0027t seem to exist. It traveled with undiminished brightness across the great room, through the outer wall, and into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" McKendry said, pointing. \"It\u0027s moving, almost as if it\u0027s tracking something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment Ray became aware of a pulsating thrum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you hear that?\" Frik said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay nodded. He knew the sound. \"That,\" he said, \"would be Peta\u0027s helicopter heading this way.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/artifact/page-42.html","bookId":1691,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM"}
