A holograph console stood next to it, icons moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Translocation platform,\" Fred whispered. \"Active, if I\u0027m reading these controls right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll use another pod to block it,\" Kurt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to key the COM, but Ash then broke in: \"Sir.

Counting a dozen—no, make that at least thirty of them scattered in a rough circle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt\u0027s heart sank to the pit of his stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were too many points of egress to block.

With a sizable Covenant force on their trail, it wouldn\u0027t be enough to get there first. They had to prevent the enemy from getting there as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt balanced the lives of his Spartans against the billions that might be saved… and the choice was regrettably all too clear to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt double-clicked the TEAMCOM. \"Olivia, Will, Holly grab those pods and get to the top of that hill ASAP.

They had amassed on the surface of the Forerunner city, over two hundred Sangheili in orderly rows for his review. Dropships and Seraph fighter craft hovered overhead, their landing lights playing over the courtyard, guarding against unexpected Sentinel or demon attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nearby edifices and paving stones of black-and-white-banded mineral provided a sharp contrast to his soldiers in their primary-colored armors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced down rows of warriors in blue battle suits, standing at attention, ready to fight and kill and die at his word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only grumble among his solders was because they carried Kig-yar shield gauntlets to supplement their armor systems. Many viewed this as a grave dishonor, but Voro had ordered it so. They would take no chances with the human demons, these \"Spartans.\" The Sangheili could not lose this world as they had the first Halo ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoro nodded to the Major Domo Sangheili in their glistening red armor. The Majors caught and held his gaze. They believed in him. He saw it in their unwavering stares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir confidence was infectious… and they gave him pause, for it was a dangerous thing for a leader of any rank to believe himself unstoppable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Voro marveled that he had been given command of the E\u0027Toro, R\u0027Lan, and N\u0027Nono warrior creches whose valor and savagery was legendary. Yet, as skilled as these soldiers were, he would have traded a dozen of them for one infiltrator in a light-bending suit to scout the terrain ahead and report on the demons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe halted before Paruto and Waruna. The towering Lekgolo pair growled their gratitude at leading the true vanguard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoro had been blessed with not one but three Lekgolo pairs. He had never seen a single pair defeated in combat before. And yet, the Spartans had managed to wound Waruna and escape, an insult to the Lekgolo pride that would only be assuaged by grinding the offenders into pulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make ready final preparation,\" Voro told his Majors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Majors shouted to their squads, who drew their swords and saluted Voro—their raised energy blades made the air waver with their combined heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey lowered their salute; grabbed rifles, grenades, pistols, and power cells; and marched across the courtyard, assembling near the banks of matte-black translocation pads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuicide Unggoy squads followed, dragging dissembled energy mortar units. Their frenzied squeals annoyed Voro. They would run ahead of the others, attempt to engage the enemy while their fellows set up their shields and mortars… and likely fall before they got a single unit assembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would, however, serve as a necessary distraction while the rest of his combat group found cover and set up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as fine a death as any Unggoy could wish for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoro looked up to the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had survived the Flood and treachery of the Jiralhanae at the second Halo construct, repelled the Sentinel guardians of this world, and emerged victorious even after the human fleet decimated their ships. Many in his ranks whispered Destiny protected them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat so-called victory against the human fleet, however, had been nothing more than luck. The human Ship Masters had outwitted them—a fact he still had difficultly reconciling. Only the timely arrival of reinforcements from Joyous Exultation had saved them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumors circulated that the reinforcing ships had survived some catastrophe. Voro suspected a surprise attack from the Ji-ralhanae. Whatever the cause, vengeance would have to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to win this battle, here and now, and claim the Forerunner technologies that would shift the strategic balance of power in the galaxy. So perhaps it was Destiny after all that had brought them to this world, but it was destiny of their own making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strode to the translocation platforms and rechecked the target coordinates. Voro was no priest, and he understood only a fraction of the Forerunner holy script.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same message had repeated since they found this system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolographic icons swarmed over the control surface. Voro read them, shouting the divine passage to his soldiers: \"The dark times are upon us… Unsheathe thy swords and smite… The Ark will be your guide… And bless the Reclaimers that may take refuge behind the sharpened edge of the Shield… Wonder beyond awaits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hundred Sangheili roared their approval as if the message had been set here for them, writ eons ago by gods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, the nuances of this message\u0027s meaning were lost upon Voro. He had discerned, though, the center of this world was where the \"Reclaimers\" were to assemble: a place that held technological wonders and weapons beyond measure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir task was clear: stop the human demons from getting there first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motioned to the suicide Unggoy squads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small creatures crowded upon the platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoro input the translocation command and sent the first wave into battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2140 HOURS, NOVEMBER 3, 2552 (MILITARY CALENDAR) \\ ZETA DORADUS SYSTEM \\ UNDETERMINED LOCATION IN THE FORERUNNER CONSTRUCT KNOWN AS ONYX-CORE- ROOM ANTECHAMBER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crack of Linda\u0027s sniper rifle was uncharacteristically quiet. The sound dissipated into the vast room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hundred meters from her perch a Grunt cried out. It fell, killed by the head shot. A jet of methane from its breathing apparatus ignited and spewed fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was five. The creatures had appeared on translocation pads, chittering like a dozen cockroaches, lugging parts of an energy shield unit. They had looked confused, running in random directions… until downed by Linda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout shifting from her flat position or removing her gaze from the Oracle scope, Linda dropped her magazine and inserted a new one. Lying next to her in a precise row were five magazines, all she had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt surveyed his team. They\u0027d taken the only logical, defensible position in the room: atop the artificial hill of concentric rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top of the structure was crowned with a meter-wide ledge and thirteen finlike towers that provided ample cover. The Spartans and Mendez took posts on either side of three of these towers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly had placed their last LOTUS antitank mines at the base of the hill, enough explosive force to penetrate the ultradense armor of an M808 Scorpion Main Battle Tank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis team had height, clean lines of fire, and yet Kurt knew they were entirely vulnerable surrounded by so many translocation pads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the ring of towers, a series of additional concentric circles fell steeply into the middle of the structure. In the exact center was a hole three meters wide, glowing with a brilliant blue-white heatless illumination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was ostensibly the \"doorway\" to the core room they sought. It was open, but in the time they had been here, the rings on the hill\u0027s outer and inner slopes had continued to flatten, and the fin towers had tilted and angled inward. The entire structure was closing like the petal of a great flower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt glanced at his mission timer: 21:22.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolographic control surfaces shimmered about the edge of the hole, and Dr. Halsey crouched there, laptop open, her tiny mote-of-light AI flitting among the symbols. She hadn\u0027t flinched at the sound of the sniper rifle, her full concentration fixed upon the center. Around her Kurt had set the eight sleeper pods for additional cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Compressed Slipspace field,\" Dr. Halsey whispered to her computer. \"Transdimensional crossover confirmed. Impossible in normal three-space, at least larger than the Fermi-Planck limit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Action on deck!\" Mendez cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe translocation pads scattered across the white room flickered with rings of gold. Upon dozens of pads… two hundred Grunts materialized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey screamed, fired plasma and needier pistols, and charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt had never been afraid of these diminutive aliens. But this was different. The cowardly creatures were wild-eyed, and sprinted headlong toward them, clawing at the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir plasma bolts dissipated along their two-hundred-meter-long trajectories, but several needier rounds exploded on the stones near Kurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold your fire,\" he said over TEAMCOM. He scanned the advancing line, and then past them spotted three teams of Grunts setting up energy mortars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In back,\" he said. \"Take out the artillery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda fired twice. A trio of Grunts assembling one mortar fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly and Ash grabbed sniper rifles and picked off the other two Grunt teams before the mortars\u0027 energy shields activated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe charging wave of Grunts surged against the base of the hill, clambering over one another to rush up the steep terraces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mines?\" Kelly calmly asked over the COM \"Negative,\" Kurt replied. \"Rifles. Everyone—sweep the slopes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreen acknowledgment lights burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey eased out from cover and loosened streams of automatic fire over the target-rich terrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leading Grunts jerked as bullets riddled their bodies. They fell backward onto their fellows, who struggled to maintain their forward momentum. Punctured breathing units spewed methane and blossomed into flame. Many Grunts ignited, tumbled down the stairs, and desperately rolled to extinguish themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartans dropped magazines, inserted fresh ones, and methodically continued shooting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grunts slowed and stopped halfway up the stairs, fell back, dead and alive, still screaming, but now in terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe survivors turned and fled—and were cut down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeaps of Grunts lay at the foot of the hill. Methane reverse tanks detonated, and burning armor and flesh spiraled up into columns of acrid smoke. Some Grunts attempted to crawl to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Police the wounded,\" Kurt ordered. \"Single shots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis team quickly dispatched them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Kurt spotted his mistake: Two hundred fifty meters back, almost lost in the glare of the vast room, stood Elites… now safely behind stationary shield generators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt increased the magnification on his faceplate. There were three groups equidistantly positioned around the hill—thirty Elites in each.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twelve, four, and seven o\u0027clock,\" Kurt whispered over TEAMCOM. \"Trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got three SPNKr missiles left,\" Linda offered. \"I could get a trajectory over those shield units.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt then saw outlines that made his stomach clench, silhouettes that hulked over the smaller Elites. Three Hunter pairs, one in each company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too much firepower,\" he told Linda. \"They\u0027d down them before impact. We\u0027ll wait for them to come to us. Stand by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove them, the towers leaned in at a 45-degree angle; the depth from the top of the hill to the center was now only six meters. Kurt could actually see the concentric rings settling, centimeter by centimeter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis countdown timer read \"17:51.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery Spartan had about a dozen magazines for their MA5B and MASK assault rifles, three grenades, sniper rifles—normally enough for nearly any engagement. This, however, would be a lopsided siege against an enemy who was well prepared and, Kurt had to admit it, outthinking them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved down to Dr. Halsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Progress?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey continued to stare at the white compressed space within the center. It flexed, and revealed a tantalizing glimpse of normal daylight beyond, and then shifted back to glare and distortion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is nothing 1 can do to hasten the closing of this aperture,\" she murmured. \"Are you still set on remaining here until the last possible moment?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-38.html","bookId":1636,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM"}
