In the blink of an eye, the cultivators who had been swept up by the fleeing black-robed Patriarch, were completely withered into nothing more than dust and smoke. Their bodies, their magical items, everything was rotted into nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the onlookers couldn’t help but be shaken deeply by the deaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople wanted to flee, but considering the level of the black-robed Patriarch’s cultivation base, they were nothing more than ants. No matter how quickly they scattered, he still threw them back as obstacles. As the power of Time consumed them, the black-robed Patriarch fled. Finally he had just a bit of breathing room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit! DAMMIT!” His face was ashen, and the shadow of death loomed heavily over him. It had been many, many years since he had experienced the feeling of a deadly chase like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, he was terrified, and was on full alert. Behind him, Meng Hao’s second true self continued to close in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a solitary sword that rumbled through the heavens. The power of Time fell like rain, enveloping everything. The black-robed Patriarch’s face paled even further, and his pupils constricted. He suddenly slapped his bag of holding to produce a black horn. He bit the tip of his tongue and spit some blood onto it, causing it to writhe and wriggle. It shattered with a bang as two centipedes suddenly flew out from inside!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe centipedes were pitch black, except for a white line that ran down their abdomens. As soon as they appeared, the aroma of deadly venom wafted out, along with an indescribable aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Attack!” The black-robed man’s face was pale. This was his trump card, something he had acquired years ago, and had even enabled him to launch a successful sneak attack against an injured false Immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the centipedes appeared, they shot through the air like Immortal creatures. Their speed was incredible as they closed in on the second true self. However, as soon as they entered the power of Time, they instantly stopped in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-robed Patriarch became even more nervous, and he quickly produced even more magical items.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the two many-legged centipedes continued to move forward, albeit much more slowly than before. They even looked excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white lines on their abdomens began to expand until they covered more than half their bodies. Now, the centipedes appeared to be half white and half black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, an incredible aura began to emanate out from them, and they grew even more excited. Gradually, their speed increased. Apparently, they were consuming the power of Time!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of it caused Meng Hao’s eyes to narrow as he stood within the shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-robed Patriarch was inwardly delighted, and he continued to flee at top speed. As he did, he waved his sleeve, causing the numerous glowing, magical items to shoot toward Meng Hao’s second true self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the black-robed Patriarch’s eyes flickered, and he performed an incantation gesture then pointed up into the sky. A lightning bolt crackled downward, and a lightning sword coalesced in the sky which then slashed down toward the second true self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second true self gave a cold snort and loosened his grip on the wooden sword, allowing it freedom to orbit around him. It immediately transformed into a vortex, which became a tempest. Sword qi raged, and the power of Time screamed through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the second true self, he lifted his right hand up, during which time a confused expression appeared in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, his right hand became transparent, and thousands of magical sealing marks appeared. Shockingly, they shot forward to form the shape that looked like a closed parasol!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parasol was formed from numerous magical symbols, and as soon as it appeared in full, it opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shocking aura exploded out, along with a brightness that rivaled the sun. In fact, anyone who glanced at it would think that this parasol really was a sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not one of Meng Hao’s divine abilities, but rather, a Daoist magic that existed in the memory of the Immortal’s soul inside the second true self!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Solitary Yang Sky!” said an ancient, icy voice that came from the mouth of the second true self. As the words echoed out, the black-robed Patriarch’s magical items all shattered into pieces. As for the Patriarch himself, he was caught up by the glowing light and the tempest. Blood sprayed from his mouth as his body withered significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock covered his face. “What divine ability is that!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat caused him even more despair was that the two centipedes, caught up in the river of Time, had been sated on Time power. Now, they shrank down and balled themselves up, leaving them unable to move and floating there in midair. Even when the black-robed Patriarch called for them to return, they completely ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit!!” he thought, his heart filled with frustration. Suddenly, back inside the shield, Meng Hao waved his right hand. The war chariot appeared directly in front of him, which he entered without hesitation, at the same circulating the qi of Immortal Shows the Way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chariot vanished, to reappear moments later in front of his second true self. He waved his hand, and the two sphere-like centipedes were instantly sucked into his bag of holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“YOU!!” roared the black-robed Patriarch, nearly coughing up blood. What he saw in front of him was two people who looked the same, and yet felt completely different. Immediately, he began to flee at top speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he fled, Meng Hao’s second true self took a step forward and then raised his hand, pointing out toward the Patriarch. Immediately, the wooden sword began to emit a droning sound. At the same time, Meng Hao also performed an incantation and then pointed forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s second true self was completely under his control, and in this moment he coordinated with it to jointly control the wooden sword. Droning, the wooden sword exploded with the power of Time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e70,000 years!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the power of 70,000 years of time, the river of Time transformed into a sword!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoundless sword qi caused everything to tremble and shake as the sword itself slashed toward the black-robed Patriarch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-robed Patriarch’s eyes widened, and he was about to dodge out of the way when suddenly, the golden vortex of the Blood Demon Grand Magic appeared, as well as the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnveloped, the man couldn’t move an inch. He could only remain there in place as a sword containing 70,000 years of Time power descended upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“NO!!” he howled. He performed a double-handed incantation, causing an ancient aura to suddenly appear, along with two sealing marks on both of his hands. His body was withering rapidly, not because of the vortex, or because of the decay of Time, but because of something he was doing to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the flesh and blood in his body, even the bones and qi passageways, all of his fleshly body was condensing into a divine ability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fleshly Sword Body!” he roared. His body collapsed, although his Nascent Divinity wasn’t harmed at all. His bag of holding tumbled off to the side as the various parts of his fleshly body were shattered and then formed back together… into a sword! Its blade was made of bone, and its hilt, flesh and blood! Qi and blood swirled around it in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword shot directly toward the Wooden Time Sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOOOOMMMMMMM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA massive explosion could be heard that shook the entire battlefield, astonishing everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white bone sword shattered, and the hilt fell to pieces. Qi and blood transformed into ripples that spread out in all directions. Meng Hao’s wooden sword trembled and emitted a droning sound as it spun backward. However, the second true self easily reached out his hand and grabbed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second true self’s face was pale white as he staggered backward a few measures. As for Meng Hao, he was completely protected by his second true self, and yet still coughed up a mouthful of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, peak Dao Seeking experts really can’t be killed easily,” he thought, his eyes glittering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling rolled out across the lands below; the force of the explosion just now was too powerful, and the Blood Demon Sect’s final shield layer couldn’t take the impact. It trembled, and then directly shattered into pieces. The Blood Demon Sect was now completely exposed in the middle of the battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-robed Patriarch’s Nascent Divinity grew very dim under the power of the explosion, but fled at top speed nonetheless, an expression of madness and hatred on his face. Since becoming Patriarch of the sect, he had never been so seriously injured, especially not to the point of being forced to use the Fleshly Sword Body. All of his failures had to do with the wooden sword. The most powerful magical arts he could utilize were all designed to be used in coordination with the sect’s precious treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re all dead!” the black-robed Patriarch roared. “Meng Hao, I’m going to possess your body!! Golden Frost, Li Yuanlei, no more delays! I’m making my move now!” Gritting his teeth, he grabbed his bag of holding and then slapped it to produce an enormous statue!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe statue was fully three thousand meters tall, and completely black. An intense energy surged up into the air as soon as it appeared. Gradually, a seemingly infinite murderous aura began to swirl around it. Its presence caused strange colors to flash in the sky, and the clouds roiled. At the same time, a huge vortex appeared around the statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn aura suddenly exploded out that belonged to an Immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an Immortal’s treasure!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dawn Immortal had been their trump card, but this statue was their last resort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-haired old man from the Golden Frost Sect and the 3rd Li Clan Patriarch exchanged determined glances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Golden Frost Sect Patriarch took a deep breath and then waved his hand. Immediately 1,000 fist-sized rocks flew out from within his sleeves. Shockingly, Immortal qi immediately began to emanate out. These were not magical items, nor spirit stones. These were… pieces of Immortal jade!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Immortals would rarely see so many pieces of Immortal jade!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the pieces of Immortal jade flew out, the vortex around the statue sucked them up. The statue’s energy shot upward, and the murderous air to its aura increased by tenfold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 3rd Li Clan Patriarch had a very serious look on his face as he opened his mouth and spit out a mouthful of blood. His entire body suddenly sagged, and he backed up anxiously. Within the blood were countless dots of golden light, which formed together into countless strands that resembled a root formed of countless veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was… a root of Immortality!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Immortal root flew into the statue, and the instant it did, the statue seemed to come to life. Its limbs trembled, and the entire statue turned into a puppet!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the black-robed Patriarch waved his sleeve to collect up Patriarch Six-Daos’ discarnate soul, then threw it off to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe river of 100,000 discarnate souls was no longer under the control of Patriarch Six-Daos, but rather, the black-robed Patriarch. He led the river of souls directly into the statue-puppet, which caused its eyes to open and radiate brilliant light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aura of an Immortal exploded out with full intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was an Immortal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it was not a true Immortal, even a false Immortal could still be called Immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA false Immortal puppet!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng Hao, it’s time to die!!” said the puppet, its voice that of the black-robed Patriarch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe puppet\u0027s eyes shone with boundless light at it slowly stood up. Its energy rumbled boundlessly, and the ground quaked. An Immortal aura exploded out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone, attack! Eradicate everyone in the Blood Demon Sect! Leave no one alive!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to the puppet’s voice, the more than 100,000 cultivators’ hearts surged. It was almost as if their bodies weren’t even under their own control. Without the slightest hesitation, they shot directly toward the shieldless Blood Demon Sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease send typos or mistakes to \u003ca href\u003d\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2c455f5f58440148494d58444e404d48496c554d444343024f4341\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail\u003d\"f8918b8b8c90d59c9d998c909a94999c9db88199909797d69b9795\"\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-745\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-747\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-746","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
