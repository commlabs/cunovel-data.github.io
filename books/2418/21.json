Crisscrossed telephone lines and pecan tree branches sliced up the sky. The only real light came from the end of the block across the street — the Church of Our Lady of the Mount. Its Moorish, yellow-capped spires were brutally lit, a dark bronze Jesus glaring down from on high at the Poco Mas. Jesus was holding aloft a circle of metal that looked suspiciously like a master\u0027s whip. Or perhaps a hubcap rim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the entrance to the cantina, I was greeted by a warm blast of air that smelled like an old man\u0027s closet — leather and mothballs, stale cologne, dried sweat and liquor. Inside, the rafters glinted with Christmas ornaments. Staple-gunned along the walls were decades of calendars showing off Corvettes with bras and women without. The jukebox cranked out Selena\u0027s \"Quiero\" just loud enough to drown casual conversation and the creaking my boots must\u0027ve made on the warped floor planks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got a momentary, disapproving once-over from the patrons at the three center tables. The men were hard-faced Latinos, most in their forties, with black cowboy hats and steel-toed boots. The few women were overweight and trying hard to pretend otherwise — tight red dresses and red hose, peroxide hair, large bosoms, and chunky faces heavily caked with foundation and rouge designed for Anglo complexions. Long neck beer bottles and scraps of bookie numbers littered the pink and white Formica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a raised platform in back were two booths, one empty, one occupied by a cluster of young locos — bandannas claiming their gang colors, white tank tops, baggy jeans laced with chains, scruffy day beards. One had a Raiders jacket. Another had a porkpie hat and a pretty young Latina on his lap. The girl and I locked eyes long enough for Porkpie to notice and scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I recognized someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector Mara, Zeta Sanchez\u0027s ex-brother-in-law, was talking to another man at the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara wore white shorts and Nikes and a black Spurs tunic that said ROBINSON. His egg-brown scalp reflected the beer lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara\u0027s friend was thinner, taller, maybe thirty years old, with a wiry build and a high hairline that made his thin face into a valentine. He had a silver cross earring and black-painted fingernails, a black trench coat and leather boots laced halfway up his calves. He\u0027d either been reading too much Anne Rice or was on his way to a bandido Renaissance festival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA line of empty beer bottles stood in front of the two men. Mara\u0027s face was illuminated by the little glowing screen of a palm-held computer, which he kept referring to as he spoke to the vampire, like they were going over numbers. I climbed onto the third bar stool next to Mara, and spoke to the bartender loud enough to be heard over Selena. \"Cerveza, por favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara and the vampire stopped talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender scowled at me. His face was puffy with age, his hair reduced to silver grease marks over his ears. \"Eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squinted past me suspiciously, as if checking for my reinforcements. Hector Mara just stared at me. Huge loops of armhole showed off his well-muscled shoulders, swirls of tattoos on his upper arms, thick tufts of underarm hair. He had an old gunshot scar like a starburst just above his left knee. The vampire stared at me, too. He clicked his black fingernails against the bar. Friendly crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you\u0027ve got a special tonight,\" I told the bartender. \"Manhattan, maybe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender reached into his cooler, opened a bottle, then plunked a Budweiser in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or beer is fine,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made the \"okay\" sign, dropped two dollars on the counter. Without hesitating, the old man got out a second beer and plunked it next to the first. I was tempted to put down a twenty and see what he\u0027d do. Instead I slid one of the Buds toward Hector Mara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe your friend could go commune with the night for a few minutes?\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara\u0027s face was designed for perpetual anger — eyes pinched, nose flared, mouth clamped into a scowl. \"I know you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw Zeta today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara and the vampire exchanged looks. The vampire studied my face one more time, memorizing it, then detached himself from the bar. He flicked his fingers toward the cholos in the back booth and they all lifted their chins. The vampire walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him get into the white Chevy van and drive away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo, gringo,\" Hector Mara said, \"You got any idea who you just offended?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None. Much more fun that way. Although if I was guessing, I\u0027d say it was Chich Gutierrez, your business partner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara\u0027s eye twitched. \"Who the fuck are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was at that party you threw yesterday out on Green Road. The one where Zeta blew a hole in the deputy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara\u0027s eyes drifted down to my boots, then made their way back up my rumpled dress clothes, my face, my uncombed hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ain\u0027t a cop,\" he decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then fuck off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed the beer back toward me and returned to his PalmPilot, started tapping on the screen with a little black stylus. On the jukebox, Selena segued into Shelly Lares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the bartender. \"Donde esta the famous spot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The place where Zeta Sanchez killed Jeremiah Brandon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender waved his hands adamantly. \"No, no. New management.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said it like a foreign phrase he\u0027d been trained to speak in an emergency. Mara pointed over his shoulder with the stylus. \"Second booth, gringo. The one that\u0027s always empty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender mumbled halfheartedly about the change of management, then retreated to his liquor display and began turning the bottles label-out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The D.A.\u0027s going to prosecute,\" I told Mara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They figure ten to ninety-nine for shooting the deputy, life for Aaron Brandon\u0027s murder, maybe federal charges for the bomb blast. Quick and easy. That\u0027s before they even consider the Old Man\u0027s murder case from \u002793.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hijo de puta like you gonna love that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stripe of green neon drifted across Mara\u0027s forehead as he turned toward me. His eyes burned with loathing. \"Reporter. Got to let those nervous gringos see the right headline, huh? Mexican Convicted for Alamo Heights Murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out one of my Erainya Manos Agency cards, slid it across the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I thought Sanchez was framed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara\u0027s bad-ass expression melted as soon as he saw the card. He looked from it to me. \"The guy in the Panama hat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"George Berton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara pushed the card away, then leaned far enough toward me so I could smell the beer on his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told your friend,\" he hissed. \"I said I\u0027d think about it. All right? Don\u0027t push me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to stay poker-faced. It wasn\u0027t easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said. \"I was just in the neighborhood. Thought I\u0027d check back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara sniffed disdainfully. He gestured toward the back of the room and the screen of his PalmPilot flashed like mercury. \"You see the locos in the corner? No, man, I don\u0027t mean look at them. They\u0027ll think you want trouble. Those are Chich\u0027s boys. His younger set. You think I\u0027m going to sit here and talk friendly with them watching us, you\u0027re crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make small talk. Were you in this place the night Jeremiah Brandon got shot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I—\" Hector looked down at the bar. \"No. I missed it. Most righteous thing that ever happened in this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can understand why you\u0027d think that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The old man had an affair with your sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Affair, shit. Raped, used, sent Sandra away when she was so shamed and scared there wasn\u0027t no choice. Like a whole bunch of girls before her. I never even saw her — not a good-bye, nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know about hard. Now you need to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about Sandra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector Mara hefted his PalmPilot. \"I got a salvage yard to manage, gringo. Books to balance. Don\u0027t help when the fucking police keep me tied up the whole day, neither. Why don\u0027t you leave me alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector tried to ignore me. He started writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank my beer. Behind us, Shelly Lares sang about her broken corazon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was Sandra happy married to Sanchez?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector\u0027s PalmPilot clattered on the bar. \"Chingate. What the fuck you want, man? Why do you care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like annoying you, Hector. It\u0027s so easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector stared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed my bottle at him and fired off a round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fucking insane, gringo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about your sister and I\u0027ll leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector glanced across the room. The men at the tables were bragging about greyhound races. One of the locos at the back booth laughed and the pretty Latina squealed in protest. They didn\u0027t seem to be paying us much mind. Hector Mara curled his large brown fingers into his palm one at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTattoos of swords and snakes on his inner arm rippled. \"You want the story? I claimed a rival set to Zeta Sanchez when I was fourteen. Chich Gutierrez, he was one of my older vatos. We were a shitty little set but we thought we were bad. Then one night Zeta and some of his homeboys cornered me at the Courts, said I could die or switch claims. If I switched, I could tell them where to shoot me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your leg,\" I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, traced his fingers over the scar tissue above his knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did that for one reason, man. I looked at Sanchez and I knew he had the kind of rep I needed for me, my family. Once I was down with Zeta, I got respect. My kid sister Sandra got respect. People left her alone. That was important to me, gringo. Real important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector looked at me to see how I was taking the story so far, maybe to see if the gringo was laughing at him inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently I passed the test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sandra wanted to be a poet,\" Hector said. \"You believe that? She never claimed no girl posses when we lived in the Courts. Couldn\u0027t stand up for herself. Me claiming Sanchez was all that saved her. Then when we were about sixteen, our mom got busted for dealing. Me and Sandra moved out to my grandmother\u0027s place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The property on Green Road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMara nodded. \"For a couple of years I had this stupid idea maybe Sandra was going to make it. Farm life. New school. Perfect for her. She never got into trouble. Made it all the way through high school. Even started college before Zeta got interested in her, you know — in a new way. Zeta decided it was a good match.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector turned his beer bottle in a slow circle. \"Zeta was old-fashioned. Didn\u0027t want his wife going to college. But he was good to Sandra. Looked out for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore silence. \"She and Zeta would\u0027ve worked things out, wasn\u0027t for the Brandons. After the Old Man caught her, she didn\u0027t have no choice but to take his money and run. Sanchez would\u0027ve killed her for what she did, her fault or not. But, man — it could\u0027ve been different for her. She almost made it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you make it out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHector smiled sourly. He dabbed his finger in the circle of sweat at the base of his beer, smeared a line of water away from the bottle. \"I\u0027m a man. Ain\u0027t the same for me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-21.html","bookId":2418,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM"}
