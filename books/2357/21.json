They had to be more discreet than ever, for Adam\u0027s campaign had actively begun, and he was becoming a nationally prominent figure. He gave speeches at political rallies and fund-raising dinners, and his opinions on national issues were quoted more and more frequently in the press.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam and Stewart Needham were having their ritual morning tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saw you on the Today show this morning,\" Needham said. \"Fine job, Adam. You got every single point across. I understand they\u0027ve invited you back again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stewart, I hate doing those shows. I feel like some goddamned actor up there, performing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStewart nodded, unperturbed. \"That\u0027s what politicians are, Adam - actors. Playing a part, being what the public wants them to be. Hell, if politicians acted like themselves in public - what expression do the kids use? - letting it all hang out? - this country\u0027d be a damned monarchy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the fact that running for public office has become a personality contest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStewart Needham smiled. \"Be grateful you\u0027ve got the personality, my boy. Your ratings in the polls keep going up every week.\" He stopped to pour more tea. \"Believe me, this is only the beginning. First the Senate, then the number one target. Nothing can stop you.\" He paused to take a sip of his tea. \"Unless you do something foolish, that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam looked up at him. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStewart Needham delicately wiped his lips with a damask napkin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your opponent is a gutter fighter. I\u0027ll bet you that right now he\u0027s examining your life under a microscope. He won\u0027t find any ammunition, will he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" The word came to Adam\u0027s lips automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Stewart Needham said. \"How\u0027s Mary Beth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer and Adam were spending a lazy weekend at a country house in Vermont that a friend of Adam\u0027s had loaned him. The air was crisp and fresh, hinting at the winter to come. It was a perfect weekend, comfortable and relaxed, with long hikes during the day and games and easy conversation before a blazing fire at night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had carefully gone through all the Sunday papers. Adam was moving up in every poll. With a few exceptions, the media were for Adam. They liked his style, his honesty, his intelligence and his frankness. They kept comparing him to John Kennedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam sprawled in front of the fireplace, watching flame shadows dancing across Jennifer\u0027s face. \"How would you like to be the wife of the President?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. I\u0027m already in love with a senator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you be disappointed if I don\u0027t win, Jennifer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The only reason I want it is because you want it, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I do win, it will mean living in Washington.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we\u0027re together, nothing else matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your law practice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer smiled. \"The last time I heard, they had lawyers in Washington.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I asked you to give it up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d give it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to. You\u0027re too damned good at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I care about is being with you. I love you so much, Adam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked her soft dark brown hair and said, \"I love you, too. So much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went to bed, and later, they slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Sunday night they drove back to New York. They picked up Jennifer\u0027s car at the garage where she had parked it, and Adam returned to his home. Jennifer went back to their apartment in New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s days were unbelievably full. If she had thought she was busy before, now she was besieged. She was representing international corporations that had bent a few laws and been caught, senators with their fingers in the till, movie stars who had gotten into trouble. She represented bank presidents and bank robbers, politicians and heads of unions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoney was pouring in, but that was not important to Jennifer. She gave large bonuses to the office staff, and lavish gifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorporations that came up against Jennifer no longer sent in their second string of lawyers, so Jennifer found herself pitted against some of the top legal talent of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was admitted into the American College of Trial Lawyers, and even Ken Bailey was impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" he said, \"you know, only one percent of the lawyers in this country can get in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m their token woman,\" Jennifer laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jennifer represented a defendant in Manhattan, she could be certain that Robert Di Silva would either prosecute the case personally or mastermind it. His hatred of Jennifer had grown with every victory she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring one trial in which Jennifer was pitted against the District Attorney, Di Silva put a dozen top experts on the stand as witnesses for the prosecution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer called no experts. She said to the jury: \"If we want a spaceship built or the distance of a star measured, we call in the experts. But when we want something really important done, we collect twelve ordinary folks to do it. As I recall, the founder of Christianity did the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer won the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the techniques Jennifer found effective with a jury was to say, \"I know that the words \u0027law\u0027 and \u0027courtroom\u0027 sound a little frightening and remote from your lives, but when you stop to think about it, all we\u0027re doing here is dealing with the rights and wrongs done to human beings like ourselves. Let\u0027s forget we\u0027re in a courtroom, my friends. Let\u0027s just imagine we\u0027re sitting around in my living room, talking about what\u0027s happened to this poor defendant, this fellow human being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, in their minds, the jurors were sitting in Jennifer\u0027s living room, carried away by her spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ploy worked beautifully for Jennifer until one day when she was defending a client against Robert Di Silva. The District Attorney rose to his feet and made the opening address to the jury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Di Silva said, \"I\u0027d like for you to forget you\u0027re in a court of law. I want you to imagine that you\u0027re sitting at home in my living room and we\u0027re just sitting around informally chatting about the terrible things the defendant has done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey leaned over and whispered to Jennifer, \"Do you hear what that bastard\u0027s doing? He\u0027s stealing your stuff!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" Jennifer replied coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jennifer got up to address the jury, she said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies and gentlemen, I\u0027ve never heard anything as outrageous as the remarks of the District Attorney.\" Her voice rang with righteous indignation. \"For a minute, I couldn\u0027t believe I had heard him correctly. How dare he tell you to forget you\u0027re sitting in a court of law! This courtroom is one of the most precious possessions our nation has! It is the foundation of our freedom. Yours and mine and the defendant\u0027s. And for the District Attorney to suggest that you forget where you are, that you forget your sworn duty, I find both shocking and contemptible. I\u0027m asking you, ladies and gentlemen, to remember where you are, to remember that all of us are here to see that justice is done and that the defendant is vindicated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jurors were nodding approvingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer glanced toward the table where Robert Di Silva was sitting. He was staring straight ahead, a glazed look in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s client was acquitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter each court victory, there would be four dozen red roses on Jennifer\u0027s desk, with a card from Michael Moretti. Each time, Jennifer would tear up the cards and have Cynthia take away the flowers. Somehow they seemed obscene coming from him. Finally Jennifer sent Michael Moretti a note, asking him to stop sending her flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jennifer returned from the courtroom after winning her next case, there were five dozen red roses waiting for her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-21.html","bookId":2357,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM"}
