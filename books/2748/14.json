She looked at me. \"Why didn\u0027t we see that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if we\u0027d both missed an easy question on a pop quiz and Macey couldn\u0027t help having a good laugh at our stupidity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So …\" Bex spoke slowly, carefully. \"They know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked out the glassless windows as if they might have been out there even as we spoke, because if they knew who we were…they knew where we lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that can\u0027t be,\" Liz protested. \"No one knows the truth about the Gallagher Academy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I just followed Bex\u0027s gaze into the darkness and thought about another night in another room, when Zach had asked me about the mystery surrounding my father\u0027s death. I found his words coming back to me as I wrapped my arms around myself and whispered, \"Somebody knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they knew Macey would have training, and they came after her and Preston anyway?\" Liz asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw my best friends looking at me—and even in the dark I couldn\u0027t hide the truth any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well …\" I started slowly, \"on the roof, Preston was with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Bex said. I could feel her impatience building, so I spoke faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got him out of there—got him off of that roof—and they didn\u0027t really…care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, Cam?\" Liz asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She means they didn\u0027t want him,\" Macey said. \"They didn\u0027t want us,\" she added, growing stronger. And then she stopped. She shrugged. \"They wanted me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been fearing that moment for days, thinking about the girl at the lake. I\u0027d worried what the knowledge might do to her—to us. But from the time she\u0027d stepped foot out of her parents\u0027 limousine, Macey had been a surprise, and this was no exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squinted at me. She shook her head. It was the exact same look she got when she mastered a formula for Mr. Mosckowitz\u0027s class, as if things were finally starting to make sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m gonna get my mom and Aunt Abby.\" I started for the door, but then Macey spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think they don\u0027t know already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it hit me—the truth. Of course they knew. They\u0027d always known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So either they came after Macey in spite of her training…\" Liz started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or because of it,\" Bex replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the strangest thing was happening. The moon was rising, full and clear. The lights of Roseville shone in the distance. Everything felt alive again, and I could see that in Macey. It was as if she knew it wasn\u0027t random anymore—there was purpose. And that made all the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I guess the question is,\" Bex said, crossing her arms, \"what are we gonna do about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovert Operations Report\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Cameron Morgan, Macey McHenry, Elizabeth Sutton, and Rebecca Baxter (hereafter referred to as \"The Operatives\")\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring a routine civilian engagement, Operatives McHenry and Morgan were attacked by figures representing an unknown organization with unknown affiliations and unknown goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter two weeks of extensive research (and some particularly fine computer hacking by agent Sutton), The Operatives learned the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no fewer than two dozen international lawsuits filed against McHenry Cosmetics (even though the Eye\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRejuvenation cream clearly states on the label that temporary blindness is a possible side effect).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch to Macey\u0027s shock, Senator McHenry does not appear to have any illegitimate children (that The Operatives know about).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one holding a significant amount of stock in Macey\u0027s mom\u0027s company made a significant gamble that the price of the stock would go down following the kidnapping attempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe McHenry family has approximately seventy-six disgruntled former servants (of whom, Macey swears, only seventy-five have cause to be really, truly angry).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s easy to imagine that a family of spies would have a lot of enemies. Well, turns out we\u0027ve got nothing on politicians and people who manufacture semi-dangerous cosmetics. By the time we\u0027d run down every shady business deal and political scandal, the list of suspects was long—like, the number of digits of pi that Liz knows by heart, long—and I wasn\u0027t sleeping any easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s impossible,\" I told Bex one day in P\u0026amp;E, but Bex, sadly, misunderstood, because instead of commiserating, she grabbed my arm and executed the most perfect Axley Maneuver I\u0027d ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow,\" I said, looking up at her. But Bex just laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wuss,\" she said, then stepped back to illustrate. \"It\u0027s not impossible. All you have to do is shift your weight in a counter—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the move,\" I snapped as I climbed to my feet, shifted my weight, and showed her. \"Macey,\" I whispered as she landed on the mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Bex said, staring up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the first hints of color were appearing on the trees, and the wind was growing cooler. Fall was coming soon, and yet the mysteries of summer were still alive and well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I touched them, Bex,\" I said, my voice low against the steady din of grunts and kicks that filled the loft. My breath came harder. \"I heard their voices and smelled their breath and I can\u0027t tell you anything about them except…\" I trailed off. But Bex, who is excellent in both the spy and best friend departments, read my mind. \"It\u0027s the ring, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeads of sweat ran from my forehead to my chin, but I didn\u0027t wipe them away. \"I\u0027ve seen that emblem somewhere before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe you, Cam,\" Bex started slowly. \"But didn\u0027t you sketch it for Liz and have her run it through the CIA database?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if they are as good as you say, then do you really think that woman would wear a ring that could lead us to her? It\u0027s a mistake,\" Bex finished, and I just stood there, the unspoken truth settling around us: they didn\u0027t make mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morgan!\" our teacher called. \"Baxter! Back to work, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled Bex to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" Bex said, \"there is one resource we haven\u0027t utilized yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the window, I saw my mother crossing the grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I snapped as Bex lunged toward me, her foot sailing far too close to my ear for comfort. \"I am not spying on my mom again,\" I said, maybe too loudly considering that Tina Walters and Eva Alvarez were ten feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who said anything about your mom?\" Bex whispered to me, gesturing behind us at the rock wall and Mr. Solomon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way,\" I whispered. \"Mom was bad enough, but Mr. Solomon would be—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look again,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I saw that Mr. Solomon was not alone. That he was with someone. That he was smiling. That they were laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that my best friend in the world thought that I should snoop on my aunt Abby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would like to point out that, despite evidence to the contrary, I don\u0027t like breaking rules. I do not enjoy violating people\u0027s privacy—especially people I love. And I try to never, ever stick my nose into other people\u0027s business. Still, I couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that what was happening with Macey had become my business when I fell forty feet through a metal shaft and landed in a cart full of dirty laundry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0027s why we huddled in our suite that Thursday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s why I didn\u0027t protest as Bex asked, \"So, everyone clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey laced up her running shoes and Liz gripped her flashlight, while I just sat there telling myself that there\u0027s a big difference between spying and snooping, and espionage isn\u0027t so much about uncovering embarrassing things as it is, you know, about saving lives (and other important stuff).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey was safe. The Secret Service and Aunt Abby were on the case. But if someone was hunting Gallagher Girls, then none of us would rest until we knew who. And why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovert Operations Report PHASE ONE 1830 hours\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the night of October 1, Operative McHenry announced to the entire post-dinner crowd in the Grand Hall that she was going for a run in the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgent Abigail Cameron announced that the protectee wasn\u0027t allowed in the woods alone, and that Agent Cameron had a headache, so therefore, the proctectee wasn\u0027t going anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOperative McHenry (a.k.a., the proctectee) announced that she was going for a run and if Agent Cameron didn\u0027t like it she could … (Well, let\u0027s just say it was in Arabic. And it wasn\u0027t very ladylike.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgent Cameron announced (louder, and in Farsi) that the protectee was not to leave the mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOperative McHenry replied (even louder) that she WAS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she fled the Grand Hall. Fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgent Cameron had no choice but to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking through the mansion with Bex that night, I felt a little sick to my stomach—not because of what we were about to do, but because I was afraid it might actually work. I might learn something I couldn\u0027t unlearn. And every spy knows that we live our lives on a need-to-know basis for a reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced out the window and saw a blur as Macey dashed through the woods, Abby following closely behind her. From behind a tree, a flashlight clicked off and on twice, Liz\u0027s way of telling us the coast was clear. Everything was going according to plan, and yet a nervous feeling settled in as I walked toward my aunt\u0027s room and knocked, knowing full well that no one would answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took ten full minutes to break into Aunt Abby\u0027s room. Yes, ten minutes. Not necessarily because my aunt had used every surveillance detection known to man, but because we couldn\u0027t be sure she hadn\u0027t, and Bex and I weren\u0027t taking any chances. (We were juniors, after all!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we finally stepped into Abby\u0027s room, for some reason I held my breath. Our flashlights played over a closetful of clothes I\u0027d never seen my aunt wear. There was a dresser covered with knickknacks, trinkets from other worlds and other times, and there wasn\u0027t a doubt in my mind that each one held a story that I\u0027d never heard. I\u0027d been listening to her wild tales for weeks, but every spy learns early on that the stories that matter most are the ones that you don\u0027t tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby had come back to us—but one look around her room told me that a part of her was still long gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beam of my flashlight nearly blinded me as it shone against the mirror. A tiny black-and-white photo was tacked to the bottom corner of the glass. I stood there for a long time staring at the image of my aunt, my favorite teacher, and my father—all three laughing at a joke that was long since over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a second I almost forgot what we were searching for. Someone was after Macey, but right then my aunt was the mystery I most wanted to solve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex\u0027s voice cut through the darkness as the beam of her flashlight fell upon—an image I\u0027d hoped I\u0027d never see again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" I muttered, stepping closer to look at the grainy black-and-white photograph—a close-up of a hand. It was pretty good considering it had been taken with an NSA satellite a few hundred miles above the earth. It didn\u0027t show the faces. If I hadn\u0027t known, I wouldn\u0027t have even recognized my own shoulder and neck. But the hand was fully in focus, the ring as clear as day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you recognize it?\" I asked, feeling my heart beat faster, seeing the proof at last that I wasn\u0027t chasing a phantom image from my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex stared harder. \"Maybe,\" she said, then shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1830 hours\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgent Cameron succeeded in dragging Operative McHenry back to the primary mansion. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-14.html","bookId":2748,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM"}
