What am I supposed to do with that, Professor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon shrugged weakly. He was feeling ill again and tried not to look down at his friend\u0027s severed hand. \"That\u0027s exactly what he told me. An ancient portal . . . hidden somewhere in this building. I told him I knew of no portal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why does he think you can find it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously, he\u0027s insane.\" He said Peter would point the way. Langdon looked down at Peter\u0027s upstretched finger, again feeling repulsed by his captor\u0027s sadistic play on words. Peter will point the way. Langdon had already permitted his eyes to follow the pointing finger up to the dome overhead. A portal? Up there? Insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This man who called me,\" Langdon told Sato, \"was the only one who knew I was coming to the Capitol tonight, so whoever informed you I was here tonight, that\u0027s your man. I recommend--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where I got my information is not your concern,\" Sato interrupted, voice sharpening. \"My top priority at the moment is to cooperate with this man, and I have information suggesting you are the only one who can give him what he wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my top priority is to find my friend,\" Langdon replied, frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato inhaled deeply, her patience clearly being tested. \"If we want to find Mr. Solomon, we have one course of action, Professor--to start cooperating with the one person who seems to know where he is.\" Sato checked her watch. \"Our time is limited. I can assure you it is imperative we comply with this man\u0027s demands quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" Langdon asked, incredulous. \"By locating and unlocking an ancient portal? There is no portal, Director Sato. This guy\u0027s a lunatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato stepped close, less than a foot from Langdon. \"If I may point this out . . . your lunatic deftly manipulated two fairly smart individuals already this morning.\" She stared directly at Langdon and then glanced at Anderson. \"In my business, one learns there is a fine line between insanity and genius. We would be wise to give this man a little respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He cut off a man\u0027s hand!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My point exactly. That is hardly the act of an uncommitted or uncertain individual. More important, Professor, this man obviously believes you can help him. He brought you all the way to Washington--and he must have done it for a reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said the only reason he thinks I can unlock this `portal\u0027 is that Peter told him I can unlock it,\" Langdon countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why would Peter Solomon say that if it weren\u0027t true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure Peter said no such thing. And if he did, then he did so under duress. He was confused . . . or frightened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s called interrogational torture, and it\u0027s quite effective. All the more reason Mr. Solomon would tell the truth.\" Sato spoke as if she\u0027d had personal experience with this technique. \"Did he explain why Peter thinks you alone can unlock the portal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor, if your reputations are correct, then you and Peter Solomon both share an interest in this sort of thing--secrets, historical esoterica, mysticism, and so on. In all of your discussions with Peter, he never once mentioned to you anything about a secret portal in Washington, D.C.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon could scarcely believe he was being asked this question by a high-ranking officer of the CIA. \"I\u0027m certain of it. Peter and I talk about some pretty arcane things, but believe me, I\u0027d tell him to get his head examined if he ever told me there was an ancient portal hidden anywhere at all. Particularly one that leads to the Ancient Mysteries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced up. \"I\u0027m sorry? The man told you specifically what this portal leads to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but he didn\u0027t have to.\" Langdon motioned to the hand. \"The Hand of the Mysteries is a formal invitation to pass through a mystical gateway and acquire ancient secret knowledge-- powerful wisdom known as the Ancient Mysteries . . . or the lost wisdom of all the ages.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ve heard of the secret he believes is hidden here.\" \"A lot of historians have heard of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how can you say the portal does not exist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With respect, ma\u0027am, we\u0027ve all heard of the Fountain of Youth and Shangri-la, but that does not mean they exist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe loud squawk of Anderson\u0027s radio interrupted them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chief?\" the voice on the radio said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson snatched his radio from his belt. \"Anderson here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, we\u0027ve completed a search of the grounds. There\u0027s no one here that fits the description. Any further orders, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson shot a quick glance at Sato, clearly expecting a reprimand, but Director Sato seemed uninterested. Anderson moved away from Langdon and Sato, speaking quietly into his radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato\u0027s unwavering focus remained on Langdon. \"You\u0027re saying the secret he believes is hidden in Washington . . . is a fantasy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon nodded. \"A very old myth. The secret of the Ancient Mysteries is pre-Christian, actually. Thousands of years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And yet it\u0027s still around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As are many equally improbable beliefs.\" Langdon often reminded his students that most modern religions included stories that did not hold up to scientific scrutiny: everything from Moses parting the Red Sea . . . to Joseph Smith using magic eyeglasses to translate the Book of Mormon from a series of gold plates he found buried in upstate New York. Wide acceptance of an idea is not proof of its validity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. So what exactly are these . . . Ancient Mysteries?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon exhaled. Have you got a few weeks? \"In short, the Ancient Mysteries refer to a body of secret knowledge that was amassed long ago. One intriguing aspect of this knowledge is that it allegedly enables its practitioners to access powerful abilities that lie dormant in the human mind. The enlightened Adepts who possessed this knowledge vowed to keep it veiled from the masses because it was considered far too potent and dangerous for the uninitiated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dangerous in what way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The information was kept hidden for the same reason we keep matches from children. In the correct hands, fire can provide illumination . . . but in the wrong hands, fire can be highly destructive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato took off her glasses and studied him. \"Tell me, Professor, do you believe such powerful information could truly exist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon was not sure how to respond. The Ancient Mysteries had always been the greatest paradox of his academic career. Virtually every mystical tradition on earth revolved around the idea that there existed arcane knowledge capable of imbuing humans with mystical, almost godlike, powers: tarot and I Ching gave men the ability to see the future; alchemy gave men immortality through the fabled Philosopher\u0027s Stone; Wicca permitted advanced practitioners to cast powerful spells. The list went on and on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an academic, Langdon could not deny the historical record of these traditions--troves of documents, artifacts, and artwork that, indeed, clearly suggested the ancients had a powerful wisdom that they shared only through allegory, myths, and symbols, ensuring that only those properly initiated could access its power. Nonetheless, as a realist and a skeptic, Langdon remained unconvinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say I\u0027m a skeptic,\" he told Sato. \"I have never seen anything in the real world to suggest the Ancient Mysteries are anything other than legend--a recurring mythological archetype. It seems to me that if it were possible for humans to acquire miraculous powers, there would be evidence. And yet, so far, history has given us no men with superhuman powers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato arched her eyebrows. \"That\u0027s not entirely true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon hesitated, realizing that for many religious people, there was indeed a precedent for human gods, Jesus being the most obvious. \"Admittedly,\" he said, \"there are plenty of educated people who believe this empowering wisdom truly exists, but I\u0027m not yet convinced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Peter Solomon one of those people?\" Sato asked, glancing toward the hand on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon could not bring himself to look at the hand. \"Peter comes from a family lineage that has always had a passion for all things ancient and mystical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that a yes?\" Sato asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can assure you that even if Peter believes the Ancient Mysteries are real, he does not believe they are accessible through some kind of portal hidden in Washington, D.C. He understands metaphorical symbolism, which is something his captor apparently does not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato nodded. \"So you believe this portal is a metaphor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Langdon said. \"In theory, anyway. It\u0027s a very common metaphor--a mystical portal through which one must travel to become enlightened. Portals and doorways are common symbolic constructs that represent transformative rites of passage. To look for a literal portal would be like trying to locate the actual Gates of Heaven.\" Sato seemed to consider this momentarily. \"But it sounds like Mr. Solomon\u0027s captor believes you can unlock an actual portal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon exhaled. \"He\u0027s made the same error many zealots make--confusing metaphor with a literal reality.\" Similarly, early alchemists had toiled in vain to transform lead into gold, never realizing that lead-to-gold was nothing but a metaphor for tapping into true human potential-- that of taking a dull, ignorant mind and transforming it into a bright, enlightened one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato motioned to the hand. \"If this man wants you to locate some kind of portal for him, why wouldn\u0027t he simply tell you how to find it? Why all the dramatics? Why give you a tattooed hand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had asked himself the same question and the answer was unsettling. \"Well, it seems the man we are dealing with, in addition to being mentally unstable, is also highly educated. This hand is proof that he is well versed in the Mysteries as well as their codes of secrecy. Not to mention with the history of this room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything he has done tonight was done in perfect accordance with ancient protocols. Traditionally, the Hand of the Mysteries is a sacred invitation, and therefore it must be presented in a sacred place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"This is the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol Building, Professor, not some sacred shrine to ancient mystical secrets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, ma\u0027am,\" Langdon said, \"I know a great number of historians who would disagree with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, across town, Trish Dunne was seated in the glow of the plasma wall inside the Cube. She finished preparing her search spider and typed in the five key phrases Katherine had given her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere goes nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling little optimism, she launched the spider, effectively commencing a worldwide game of Go Fish. At blinding speed, the phrases were now being compared to texts all over the world . . . looking for a perfect match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrish couldn\u0027t help but wonder what this was all about, but she had come to accept that working with the Solomons meant never quite knowing the entire story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Langdon stole an anxious glance at his wristwatch: 7:58 P.M. The smiling face of Mickey Mouse did little to cheer him up. I\u0027ve got to find Peter. We\u0027re wasting time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato had stepped aside for a moment to take a phone call, but now she returned to Langdon. \"Professor, am I keeping you from something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am,\" Langdon said, pulling his sleeve down over his watch. \"I\u0027m just extremely concerned about Peter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can understand, but I assure you the best thing you can do to help Peter is to help me understand the mind-set of his captor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon was not so sure, but he sensed he was not going anywhere until the OS director got the information she desired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A moment ago,\" Sato said, \"you suggested this Rotunda is somehow sacred to the idea of these Ancient Mysteries?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explain that to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon knew he would have to choose his words sparingly. He had taught for entire semesters on the mystical symbolism of Washington, D.C., and there was an almost inexhaustible list of mystical references in this building alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmerica has a hidden past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time Langdon lectured on the symbology of America, his students were confounded to learn that the true intentions of our nation\u0027s forefathers had absolutely nothing to do with what so many politicians now claimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmerica\u0027s intended destiny has been lost to history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forefathers who founded this capital city first named her \"Rome.\" They had named her river the Tiber and erected a classical capital of pantheons and temples, all adorned with images of history\u0027s great gods and goddesses--Apollo, Minerva, Venus, Helios, Vulcan, Jupiter. In her center, as in many of the great classical cities, the founders had erected an enduring tribute to the ancients--the Egyptian obelisk. This obelisk, larger even than Cairo\u0027s or Alexandria\u0027s, rose 555 feet into the sky, more than thirty stories, proclaiming thanks and honor to the demigod forefather for whom this capital city took its newer name. Washington.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, centuries later, despite America\u0027s separation of church and state, this state-sponsored Rotunda glistened with ancient religious symbolism. There were over a dozen different gods in the Rotunda--more than the original Pantheon in Rome. Of course, the Roman Pantheon had been converted to Christianity in 609 . . . but this pantheon was never converted; vestiges of its true history still remained in plain view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you may know,\" Langdon said, \"this Rotunda was designed as a tribute to one of Rome\u0027s most venerated mystical shrines. The Temple of Vesta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As in the vestal virgins?\" Sato looked doubtful that Rome\u0027s virginal guardians of the flame had anything to do with the U.S. Capitol Building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Temple of Vesta in Rome,\" Langdon said, \"was circular, with a gaping hole in the floor, through which the sacred fire of enlightenment could be tended by a sisterhood of virgins whose job it was to ensure the flame never went out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato shrugged. \"This Rotunda is a circle, but I see no gaping hole in this floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not anymore, but for years the center of this room had a large opening precisely where Peter\u0027s hand is now.\" Langdon motioned to the floor. \"In fact, you can still see the marks in the floor from the railing that kept people from falling in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Sato demanded, scrutinizing the floor. \"I\u0027ve never heard that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like he\u0027s right.\" Anderson pointed out the circle of iron nubs where the posts had once been. \"I\u0027ve seen these before, but I never had any idea why they were there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re not alone, Langdon thought, imagining the thousands of people every day, including famous lawmakers, who strode across the center of the Rotunda having no idea there was once a day when they would have plunged down into the Capitol Crypt--the level beneath the Rotunda floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hole in the floor,\" Langdon told them, \"was eventually covered, but for a good while, those who visited the Rotunda could see straight down to the fire that burned below.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato turned. \"Fire? In the U.S. Capitol?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More of a large torch, actually--an eternal flame that burned in the crypt directly beneath us. It was supposed to be visible through the hole in the floor, making this room a modern Temple of Vesta. This building even had its own vestal virgin--a federal employee called the Keeper of the Crypt--who successfully kept the flame burning for fifty years, until politics, religion, and smoke damage snuffed out the idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Anderson and Sato looked surprised. Nowadays, the only reminder that a flame once burned here was the four-pointed star compass embedded in the crypt floor one story below them--a symbol of America\u0027s eternal flame, which once shed illumination toward the four corners of the New World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Professor,\" Sato said, \"your contention is that the man who left Peter\u0027s hand here knew all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clearly. And much, much more. There are symbols all over this room that reflect a belief in the Ancient Mysteries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Secret wisdom,\" Sato said with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice. \"Knowledge that lets men acquire godlike powers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That hardly fits with the Christian underpinnings of this country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it would seem, but it\u0027s true. This transformation of man into God is called apotheosis. Whether or not you\u0027re aware of it, this theme--transforming man into god--is the core element in this Rotunda\u0027s symbolism.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apotheosis?\" Anderson spun with a startled look of recognition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Anderson works here. He knows. \"The word apotheosis literally means `divine transformation\u0027--that of man becoming God. It\u0027s from the ancient Greek: apo--`to become,\u0027 theos--`god.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson looked amazed. \"Apotheosis means `to become God\u0027? I had no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I missing?\" Sato demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027am,\" Langdon said, \"the largest painting in this building is called The Apotheosis of Washington. And it clearly depicts George Washington being transformed into a god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato looked doubtful. \"I\u0027ve never seen anything of the sort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I\u0027m sure you have.\" Langdon raised his index finger, pointing straight up. \"It\u0027s directly over your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Apotheosis of Washington--a 4,664-square-foot fresco that covers the canopy of the Capitol Rotunda--was completed in 1865 by Constantino Brumidi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnown as \"The Michelangelo of the Capitol,\" Brumidi had laid claim to the Capitol Rotunda in the same way Michelangelo had laid claim to the Sistine Chapel, by painting a fresco on the room\u0027s most lofty canvas--the ceiling. Like Michelangelo, Brumidi had done some of his finest work inside the Vatican. Brumidi, however, immigrated to America in 1852, abandoning God\u0027s largest shrine in favor of a new shrine, the U.S. Capitol, which now glistened with examples of his mastery--from the trompe l\u0027oeil of the Brumidi Corridors to the frieze ceiling of the Vice President\u0027s Room. And yet it was the enormous image hovering above the Capitol Rotunda that most historians considered to be Brumidi\u0027s masterwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Langdon gazed up at the massive fresco that covered the ceiling. He usually enjoyed his students\u0027 startled reactions to this fresco\u0027s bizarre imagery, but at the moment he simply felt trapped in a nightmare he had yet to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirector Sato was standing next to him with her hands on her hips, frowning up at the distant ceiling. Langdon sensed she was having the same reaction many had when they first stopped to examine the painting at the core of their nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUtter confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re not alone, Langdon thought. For most people, The Apotheosis of Washington got stranger and stranger the longer they looked at it. \"That\u0027s George Washington on the central panel,\" Langdon said, pointing 180 feet upward into the middle of the dome. \"As you can see, he\u0027s dressed in white robes, attended by thirteen maidens, and ascending on a cloud above mortal man. This is the moment of his apotheosis . . . his transformation into a god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato and Anderson said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nearby,\" Langdon continued, \"you can see a strange, anachronistic series of figures: ancient gods presenting our forefathers with advanced knowledge. There\u0027s Minerva giving technological inspiration to our nation\u0027s great inventors--Ben Franklin, Robert Fulton, Samuel Morse.\" Langdon pointed them out one by one. \"And over there is Vulcan helping us build a steam engine. Beside them is Neptune demonstrating how to lay the transatlantic cable. Beside that is Ceres, goddess of grain and root of our word cereal; she\u0027s sitting on the McCormick reaper, the farming breakthrough that enabled this country to become a world leader in food production. The painting quite overtly portrays our forefathers receiving great wisdom from the gods.\" He lowered his head, looking at Sato now. \"Knowledge is power, and the right knowledge lets man perform miraculous, almost godlike tasks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato dropped her gaze back down to Langdon and rubbed her neck. \"Laying a phone cable is a far cry from being a god.\" \"Perhaps to a modern man,\" Langdon replied. \"But if George Washington knew that we had become a race that possessed the power to speak to one another across oceans, fly at the speed of sound, and set foot on our moon, he would assume that we had become gods, capable of miraculous tasks.\" He paused. \"In the words of futurist Arthur C. Clarke, `Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato pursed her lips, apparently deep in thought. She glanced down at the hand, and then followed the direction of the outstretched index finger up into the dome. \"Professor, you were told, `Peter will point the way.\u0027 Is that correct?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am, but--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chief,\" Sato said, turning away from Langdon, \"can you get us a closer look at the painting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson nodded. \"There\u0027s a catwalk around the interior of the dome.\" Langdon looked way, way up to the tiny railing visible just beneath the painting and felt his body go rigid. \"There\u0027s no need to go up there.\" He had experienced that seldom-visited catwalk once before, as the guest of a U.S. senator and his wife, and he had almost fainted from the dizzying height and perilous walkway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need?\" Sato demanded. \"Professor, we have a man who believes this room contains a portal that has the potential to make him a god; we have a ceiling fresco that symbolizes the transformation of a man into a god; and we have a hand pointing straight at that painting. It seems everything is urging us upward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually,\" Anderson interjected, glancing up, \"not many people know this, but there is one hexagonal coffer in the dome that actually swings open like a portal, and you can peer down through it and--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a second,\" Langdon said, \"you\u0027re missing the point. The portal this man is looking for is a figurative portal--a gateway that doesn\u0027t exist. When he said, `Peter will point the way,\u0027 he was talking in metaphorical terms. This pointing-hand gesture--with its index finger and thumb extended upward--is a well-known symbol of the Ancient Mysteries, and it appears all over the world in ancient art. This same gesture appears in three of Leonardo da Vinci\u0027s most famous encoded masterpieces--The Last Supper, Adoration of the Magi, and Saint John the Baptist. It\u0027s a symbol of man\u0027s mystical connection to God.\" As above, so below. The madman\u0027s bizarre choice of words was starting to feel more relevant now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen it before,\" Sato said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen watch ESPN, Langdon thought, always amused to see professional athletes point skyward in gratitude to God after a touchdown or home run. He wondered how many knew they were continuing a pre-Christian mystical tradition of acknowledging the mystical power above, which, for one brief moment, had transformed them into a god capable of miraculous feats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s of any help,\" Langdon said, \"Peter\u0027s hand is not the first such hand to make an appearance in this Rotunda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato eyed him like he was insane. \"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon motioned to her BlackBerry. \"Google `George Washington Zeus.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato looked uncertain but started typing. Anderson inched toward her, looking over her shoulder intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon said, \"This Rotunda was once dominated by a massive sculpture of a bare-chested George Washington . . . depicted as a god. He sat in the same exact pose as Zeus in the Pantheon, bare chest exposed, left hand holding a sword, right hand raised with thumb and finger extended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato had apparently found an online image, because Anderson was staring at her BlackBerry in shock. \"Hold on, that\u0027s George Washington?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Langdon said. \"Depicted as Zeus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at his hand,\" Anderson said, still peering over Sato\u0027s shoulder. \"His right hand is in the same exact position as Mr. Solomon\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I said, Langdon thought, Peter\u0027s hand is not the first to make an appearance in this room. When Horatio Greenough\u0027s statue of a naked George Washington was first unveiled in the Rotunda, many joked that Washington must be reaching skyward in a desperate attempt to find some clothes. As American religious ideals changed, however, the joking criticism turned to controversy, and the statue was removed, banished to a shed in the east garden. Currently, it made its home at the Smithsonian\u0027s National Museum of American History, where those who saw it had no reason to suspect that it was one of the last vestigial links to a time when the father of the country had watched over the U.S. Capitol as a god . . . like Zeus watching over the Pantheon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato began dialing a number on her BlackBerry, apparently seeing this as an opportune moment to check in with her staff. \"What have you got?\" She listened patiently. \"I see . . .\" She glanced directly at Langdon, then at Peter\u0027s hand. \"You\u0027re certain?\" She listened a moment longer. \"Okay, thanks.\" She hung up and turned back toward Langdon. \"My support staff did some research and confirms the existence of your so-called Hand of the Mysteries, corroborating everything you said: five fingertip markings--the star, the sun, the key, the crown, and the lantern--as well as the fact that this hand served as an ancient invitation to learn secret wisdom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad,\" Langdon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be,\" she replied curtly. \"It appears we\u0027re now at a dead end until you share whatever it is you\u0027re still not telling me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027am?\" Sato stepped toward him. \"We\u0027ve come full circle, Professor. You\u0027ve told me nothing I could not have learned from my own staff. And so I will ask you once more. Why were you brought here tonight? What makes you so special? What is it that you alone know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been through this,\" Langdon fired back. \"I don\u0027t know why this guy thinks I know anything at all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon was half tempted to demand how the hell Sato knew that he was in the Capitol tonight, but they\u0027d been through that, too. Sato isn\u0027t talking. \"If I knew the next step,\" he told her, \"I\u0027d tell you. But I don\u0027t. Traditionally, the Hand of the Mysteries is extended by a teacher to a student. And then, shortly afterward, the hand is followed up with a set of instructions . . . directions to a temple, the name of the master who will teach you--something! But all this guy left for us is five tattoos! Hardly--\" Langdon stopped short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSato eyed him. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon\u0027s eyes shot back to the hand. Five tattoos. He now realized that what he was saying might not be entirely true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor?\" Sato pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon inched toward the gruesome object. Peter will point the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earlier, it crossed my mind that maybe this guy had left an object clenched in Peter\u0027s palm--a map, or a letter, or a set of directions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t,\" Anderson said. \"As you can see, those three fingers are not clenched tightly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" Langdon said. \"But it occurs to me . . .\" He crouched down now, trying to see up under the fingers to the hidden part of Peter\u0027s palm. \"Maybe it\u0027s not written on paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tattooed?\" Anderson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you see anything on the palm?\" Sato asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon crouched lower, trying to peer up under the loosely clenched fingers. \"The angle is impossible. I can\u0027t--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for heaven\u0027s sake,\" Sato said, moving toward him. \"Just open the damned thing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson stepped in front of her. \"Ma\u0027am! We should really wait for forensics before we touch--\" \"I want some answers,\" Sato said, pushing past him. She crouched down, edging Langdon away from the hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon stood up and watched in disbelief as Sato pulled a pen from her pocket, sliding it carefully under the three clenched fingers. Then, one by one, she pried each finger upward until the hand stood fully open, with its palm visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced up at Langdon, and a thin smile spread across her face. \"Right again, Professor.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lost-symbol-robert-langdon-3/page-7.html","bookId":1515,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:38:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:38:41 AM"}
