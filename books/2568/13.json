The only reason he even bothered was because Dick’s lover, Anton, was still asleep and the phone would wake him up. He slipped out of bed, took the portable phone, and clicked it on as he went into the living room. He slouched down into a leather armchair and immediately his dog leapt into his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have one minute and then I’m going back to sleep, Newt, and unless this involves Brad Pitt and gratuitous nudity, I am probably going to fire you. Just so you know.” Dick Hangood was the editor and co-owner of the Black Marsh Sentinel, a small paper that came out three times a week in the town just south of Pine Deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillard Fowler Newton said just fourteen words: “The guy Malcolm Crow shot and killed last night was the Cape May Killer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDick Hangood sat up in the chair so fast he sent his Pomeranian flying off his lap and onto the hardwood floor where—in a fit of pique—he began savaging Anton’s socks, which were lying atop his shoes by the sofa. “Newton,” he said tiredly, “if you are jerking my chain—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dick…I interviewed someone who was involved in what happened the other night.” He was stretching that. Mike Sweeney had told him about the Cape May Killer connection, but Mike was on the periphery of what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Hangood shifting gears into true newsman mode was an effort, but he managed it. “Who else knows about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean, what other papers are there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m serious—no one. The cops have been keeping this hush-hush. What I mean is…some other reporters know about the cop killings, but no one else knows about the Cape May Killer angle. I’ve been following the story all day,” Newton said urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHangood was still trying to find sense in this. “But the chief already issued a statement about the shooting at the Guthrie place. No one said anything about it being related to Cape May.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I know. That’s why this is what we in the news business call a scoop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t get smart with me, Newt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wake up, Dick…this is the real thing. We have to go to press right now. We have to get this out in a couple of hours. We’ll never have another chance—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up and let me think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s more…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Early this morning two police officers were murdered out at the Guthrie farm. I saw the bodies, Dick. I have pics. Long range, sure, but pics. And I, um…overheard some conversations between the two lead cops. I know the whole story, Dick, and how it ties back in with the Cape May thing. I have it all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHangood felt like the floor was tilting under him. His mouth moved like a Kissing Gourami for several seconds before he managed to say, “Newt—if this is on the level, if this is what you say it is—then this story is going to be picked up on every news service in the world. You could get a Pulitzer for this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewton said nothing. He was hyperventilating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(9)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I gotta take a leak,” Polk said to Toombes and ambled off down the hall. She barely shrugged. He went down past the men’s room, looked over his shoulder to make sure Toombes was out of his line of sight, and then cut into the fire tower. He closed the door and pulled his cell phone out of his pocket, punched in a number, and waited. Vic Wingate answered on the third ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vic, it’s Jim.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You get yourself switched like I told you to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, they got me guarding Crow all day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He talk to anyone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just the doctor. Saul Weinstock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did they talk about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t in the room then, but it couldn’t have been much of anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you don’t know when they’re going to do the autopsy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, Vic, I do. It’s scheduled for this afternoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence at Vic’s end. “That soon, huh? Shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s an ongoing criminal investigation. Has to be done fast. That a problem?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course it’s a problem, numb-nuts. We can’t let Ruger get sliced up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not, Vic? He’s dead, I don’t see how he’s important to the Man at this point. He’s out of the game, far as I can see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic laughed. “Yeah, well, you’ve never been too swift at the best of times, Jimmie, my boy. Trust me when I tell you that Ruger is not out of the game.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But, I don’t get it—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. You don’t get it, and you’d better wake up every day from now on and pray thanks that you continue to not get it. Now shut up for a second and let me think. We have to find a way to get that Jew doctor to postpone the autopsy for at least a full day. You understand me, Jimmie? A full day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I damn well said so. And because the Man wants it that way—or is that not enough of a reason for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sure, it’s cool. I was just asking—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, don’t. Look, they’re bringing in some new stiffs for the doctors to play with. If this goes the way I want it to, then they’ll autopsy them first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because it’ll be part of an active investigation. Ruger’s old news, as far as they’re concerned. When these other bodies come in they’ll be shifting gears—but it might take the better part of the day before that happens, so I need you to stall the Jew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolk licked his lips. “Yeah, okay, Vic. I’ll think of something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t get caught, either. You may be be a dickhead, but for the moment you’re useful. You get caught, then you’re no use to me—or to the Man. No damn use at all, you reading me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hear you, Vic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good, now get your ass in gear.” He broke the connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolk leaned against the cold cinder block wall of the fire tower and stared at nothing for two whole minutes, then he pushed himself away and straightened his clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother of God,” he breathed and went back into the hall, but a bad plan was already forming in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(1)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tow-Truck Eddie came home from the hospital his mind was racing like the engine of his wrecker. He locked the front door, closed all of the blinds, and yanked the curtains shut, bathing the house in gray-brown darkness despite the sun outside. He peered around the corners of each curtain to make sure that no one outside could see in, and whenever he was uncertain he used strips of duct tape to seal the edges of the curtains to the wall. He finished, paused to consider, and then went and taped up every window in the house, basement to attic. It took three thick rolls of duct tape. That was okay, he had plenty. Lately he’d been using it to pull all of the hair off his arms and legs and torso. For his privates he used a razor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the house was secure, he double-checked the locks on the front and back doors, stripped off his police uniform, and went upstairs to the little shrine he had made to contain the first of the holy relics he would collect. The shrine was a low, flat wooden cabinet that had started out as an IKEA entertainment center but which had been called to a higher purpose by Eddie’s needs. He crossed himself seven times as he knelt in front of the shrine, then he opened the doors and removed the vessel that contained the Eucharist, which he placed on top of the cabinet. He went through the entire ritual of blessing the elements, taking his time and getting each step precisely right. Error was sinful, even if by accident. He used a bottle of Evian to fill his chalice—an old boxing trophy he’d won back in his twenties, before he knew who he truly was—and then he lifted the ciborium, which contained the Eucharist. That it was really a Tupperware container did not matter. One day he would have elements made from gold, but for now humility in all things was correct. He took a deep breath, fighting the rush of excitement that shivered upward from where his knees pressed into the floor and where his upturned heels dug into his buttocks. Gooseflesh covered him like a contour map of the Holy Land as he pried off the lid and removed the Eucharist. He blessed it and holding it in both hands lifted it toward heaven. After two days the knotty muscle of Tony Macchio’s heart had begun to smell a bit. Bitter and strong, like a man’s heart should be. After all, this was the heart of the Baptizer, whom God had directed him to kill so that his energies could be released and consumed by the new Messiah, by Tow-Truck Eddie, who was the Sword of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a knife and cut a thick slice, praying all the while, phrasing it as formally as he could. “This is the body of Thy servant, sacrificed for Thee and in remembrance of my own sacrifice on the cross in the land of the Jews. This is the flesh that makes the seal of the Final Covenant. I, the Son of Man, the Son of Heaven’s King, the righteous and unyielding Sword of God, bless this flesh in Your Holy Name. All glory to God the most high!” Then he ate the meat, chewing it slowly in order to explore the nuance of the taste, and when he had eaten, he took the cup, and after he had blessed it, he drank. He set the cup down and lowered his forehead to the floor and wept for the glory of God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was finished, Tow-Truck Eddie returned the vessels to their places, took the cup and knife to the bathroom and washed them seven times each, put everything in its place, and left the room that held the shrine. Still naked and now fully erect, he went down to the basement where he kept his weights and by candlelight he pushed his body to its absolute limit, clanking the barbells, pyramiding the weights so that he lifted heavier weights each time while decreasing the reps, keeping himself in the haze of the burn, loving the bite of lactic acid in his bulging muscles, watching the veins pop and harden, delighting in the shine of sweat on his skin. Twice he ejaculated while lifting, both times while imagining the death of the Beast, the demon in his sham of a child’s body, writhing and twisting in Tow-Truck Eddie’s powerful hands. Each time, at the point where his dreaming mind heard the snap of bones in the Beast’s throat, he came, spurting come in gooey ropes over his belly. Both times he stopped, washed himself, prayed for forgiveness, and did seven Our Fathers before going back to his weights. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-man-s-song-pine-deep-2/page-13.html","bookId":2568,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:10 PM"}
