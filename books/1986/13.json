The fact she\u0027d stood between the two of us to protect me would be funny if it didn\u0027t piss me off a little. It made me want to go out and beat the shit out of someone so she could see I wasn\u0027t some spoiled rich kid who\u0027s never had a busted lip or black eye. She\u0027d met Rock, Dewayne and Preston. Could she not tell I didn\u0027t exactly run around with the country club crowd? I flipped the last pancake and reached to get the butter out of the fridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She moved her stuff. You make her do that?\" Cage asked from behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess we were going to get that private confrontation after all. I pulled out a stick of butter and turned around closing the door behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t make her do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCage snarled and glanced back at my bathroom door. This was the first time she\u0027d showered in my bathroom too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally she used Cage\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why Low? You could\u0027ve had any damn chic in this town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy\u0027d you have to go and mess with Low?\" When he said stupid shit like that it made me question his belief she was special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting the butter down I reached for a knife to slice off some pats to put on our pancakes. Without looking back up at him for fear I\u0027d lose my temper I responded, \"You of all people should know how special she is. Girls like her aren\u0027t easy to find. From the moment I opened that door,\" I stopped slicing and looked up at him. I wanted him to see my face when I told him this. I needed him to believe me. \"I knew she was going to get under my skin. Then the more I got to know her. The more I watched her and talked to her I wanted to get closer to her. And as much as you hate to hear this she wants to get close to me too.\" Cage let out a hard laugh and turned to go back to his bedroom. I went back to slicing the butter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to believe you won\u0027t hurt her. But I know you will. I\u0027m going to stand back and let this play out. Because in the end, she\u0027ll come running back to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis door slammed behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wrong. But I wasn\u0027t going to argue with him about it anymore. As long as he stood back and left us alone I was good. That was more than I could have hoped for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the table and poured us both coffee adding some cream and sugar to Low\u0027s. I also placed a glass of orange juice beside her plate of pancakes. I wasn\u0027t sure if she liked coffee with her meal. I liked cold milk with my pancakes so I poured her a glass of that too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to my bathroom opened and she stepped out dressed in the clothes she\u0027d had on earlier but this time her hair hung damp and loose down her back. The ends curled just a little when wet. Her face was scrubbed clean of any makeup and she was beautiful. Big green eyes taking in the table then lifting to meet my appreciative gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. That looks really good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out her chair and waved my hand for her to have a seat. Giggling she made her way over and stopped right in front of me. Standing on her tip toes she kissed me softly then leaned back and whispered, \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slid into her seat and I pushed her chair in then walked over to my side and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever had a guy pull my chair out and push me to the table before. I always thought it would be kind of awkward but you made it look as smooth as it appears on television.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirked then reached for the syrup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I worked for Jax Stone for a few summers at his vacation house on the island. One of my jobs was serving their food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled his mother\u0027s chair out a million times.\" Her mouth made a small o shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how you know Sadie then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and once again I was surprised that my chest didn\u0027t ache at the mention of Sadie\u0027s name. Damn if that didn\u0027t make me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, Marcus,\" she giggled and I looked up to see what was so funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you give me three drinks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I laughed and shrugged, \"Wasn\u0027t sure what you\u0027d want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill ow bit her bottom lip still smiling then reached for the milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With sweet stuff, I like milk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll remember that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillow\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to work tonight but Tawny called and asked me to watch Larissa for a couple of hours this afternoon. Marcus hadn\u0027t argued with me like Cage would have. He seemed to understand family craziness and gave me a ride over there. He\u0027d made me promise to call him as soon as I was ready to leave. He was going job hunting today and he had a paper to write for one of his online courses. Leaving him was still hard. I was already addicted to him. Not exactly healthy behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs usual Tawny was running late. She\u0027d promised I\u0027d have time to go home and change before work but it looked like I\u0027d be going to work as is. Glancing at my phone for the tenth time in like five minutes I let out a frustrated growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy couldn\u0027t she just call or text when she was running late?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of gravel crunching under tires outside ended my frustration and I went to close Larissa\u0027s door so Tawny wouldn\u0027t wake her up from her nap. I\u0027d go outside to call Marcus after I\u0027d dealt with Tawny. I didn\u0027t want her listening in on our conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking by the window I stopped. Instead of Tawny\u0027s piece of junk Ford Taurus there was a very expensive black car in the driveway. That couldn\u0027t be good. Turning around I went to the door expecting a knock when it opened and in walked my sister followed by an older guy. Much older.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can go now,\" Tawny said sauntering into the house and glancing at me as if I were the hired help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, okay,\" I stared back at the strange man. Was this her new sugar daddy? Whoever it was I was getting an introduction before I left. If Tawny was going to bring strange men around my niece I wanted to know who they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m late and you\u0027ve got work. Why\u0027re you just standing there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man frowned slightly at Tawny and took a step toward me holding out his hand, \"hello, I\u0027m Jefferson.\" That\u0027s all I get? One name? What was he freaking Usher? I don\u0027t think so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will ow, Tawny\u0027s sister,\" I replied shaking his hand as firmly as I could. A smile tugged at his lips and he was instantly familiar. How odd. I\u0027d never met this man before. I studied his face carefully. What was it about him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay now you two have met. You can leave,\" the irritation in Tawny\u0027s voice was unmistakable. She didn\u0027t want me here. Well now I was curious. So too bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you dating my sister?\" I asked looking back up at Jefferson the one named old guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you old enough to be her father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"WILLOW\" Tawny screeched storming back into the room and grabbing my arm so tightly her nails bit into my flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I have a right to know what and who he is exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re bringing him around MY niece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re bringing him around MY niece.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out,\" she seethed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked my arm out of her hold and glared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not until I get answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Low so help me God I am going to\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lowlow,\" Larissa\u0027s small voice interrupted my sister and we both turned to see her standing at her door. Blonde curls sticking up in a disarray from her nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey sleepy head you\u0027re awake,\" I replied walking toward her. Little arms raised up in the air for me to pick her up and I gently lifted her and rested her on my hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mama,\" she mumbled in a sleepy voice pointing to Tawny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep Mama is home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dada\" she pointed to Jefferson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head snapped around and my eyes locked with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly I took in his nose and eyes. The way his bottom lip was slightly larger than his top one. Could this be him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding Larissa tightly against me I shifted my questioning gaze to my sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a sigh and rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. You\u0027ll find out soon enough anyway,\" she hissed,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jefferson is Larissa\u0027s dad. But he\u0027s still married and in the process of a divorce. Once it\u0027s final Larissa and I\u0027ll be moving out. You can have this place once we\u0027re out. I don\u0027t ever want to set foot in it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d broken up a marriage. Larissa was this man\u0027s love child. Oh. Shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close your mouth Low and give me Larissa. Then leave, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked toward Tawny in a daze. I\u0027d always wondered if that was the case but hearing her admit it was like someone had slapped me. Tawny reached for Larissa and Larissa buried her head in my chest and clung to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said loudly. Tears were in her little voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give her to me Low,\" Tawny was angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to Mama now sweet girl. I have to go to work,\" I said gently easing her small head back to look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lowlow,\" she announced wrapping her arms tightly around my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, your Lowlow but your Lowlow needs to go to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour,\" I paused and stared up at Jefferson ignoring the sick knot in my stomach, \"Daddy is here to see you.\" I felt like I was going to throw up. My sweet baby girl was the product of adultery. It made me want to scream to the top of my lungs. This was so unfair. I hated what Tawny had done yet I couldn\u0027t wish it\u0027d never happened. Holding Larissa in my arms I could never wish she didn\u0027t exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lowlow,\" Larissa repeated patting my chest. I turned my attention back to her and she was giving her father a toothless smile while introducing me to him. Tears burned my eyes and I forced them back. Crying would upset her and I needed her to let me leave. Although running out the door with her wrapped tightly in my arms was tempting. I wanted her away from the truth that would haunt her for the rest of her life. I knew what that stigma felt like. The dad that only visited you when he could get away from his real family. Being the product of an affair. That was me. It had shadowed me my entire life. Not being good enough for my dad to want me all the time. And then the visits had just stopped one day. He\u0027d moved his family away and I never saw or heard from him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no doubt in my mind Jefferson would do the same thing to Larissa. He\u0027d tell my gull ible stupid sister that he was leaving his wife but he never would. She\u0027d never leave this house. Larissa would grow up here while one man after another walked in and out of her mother\u0027s life. She\u0027d cry herself to sleep for the daddy who\u0027d not wanted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give her to me and just go,\" Tawny demanded ripping Larissa from my arms. She knew what I was thinking. She hated me for it too. The fury flashing in her eyes didn\u0027t scare me. The pain she\u0027d eventually face when this man never came through for them and eventually left them alone was what scared me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MY LOWLOW,\" Larissa howled as her small arms reached for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shush Larissa. That\u0027s enough,\" Tawny scolded only causing Larissa to scream louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to grab her back but the longer I stood here the worse this would get. Instead I blew her a kiss, \"Love you my pretty girl.\" Then taking a page out of Marcus\u0027s play book I said, \"Remember act like a princess. Princesses don\u0027t scream.\" She paused and thought about it a minute while little tears rolled down her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skiutles,\" she said frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s right they say Skittles,\" I assured her then waved goodbye, \"I\u0027ll see you soon, okay.\" I turned and rushed out the door before the tears came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d walked about a mile when I saw Marcus\u0027s truck slow down beside me. He was out of it and over to me immediately. I knew I looked a mess. I hadn\u0027t called him because I\u0027d needed to cry and vomit. Walking helped calm me down some and clear my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Low, what\u0027s wrong?\" He asked pulling me into his arms. I shook my head and willed myself not to lose it again. I couldn\u0027t tell Marcus any of this. My world wasn\u0027t something he\u0027d understand. It was ugly. I didn\u0027t want the taint that had followed me all my life to be a part of my relationship with him. He\u0027d see me differently if he knew. He\u0027d see Larissa differently. If I wanted us to work I couldn\u0027t share this part of me with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you call me? I was writing and glanced at the time and realized you should have called an hour ago. I came as fast as I could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled back from his chest and swallowed the lump in my throat. The acidic taste from puking burned my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got in a fight with Tawny. She\u0027s an ass. Larissa cried because I was leaving. I hate to leave her like that.\" Marcus nodded and his thumbs caressed my cheeks as he held my face. I really hoped he didn\u0027t try to kiss me. I needed to brush the vomit from my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Family can suck,\" he agreed. Then he turned and opened the truck door and lifted me up into the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time, call me. Please,\" he pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and forced a smile. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/because-of-low-sea-breeze-2/page-13.html","bookId":1986,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:58 AM"}
