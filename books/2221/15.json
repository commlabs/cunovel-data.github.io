She circled the light silver sports car, examining it carefully before speaking to me across the roof while shielding her eyes against the setting sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not a cop, are you?” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t think so. This car—if you’re a cop and you drive up to 367 Grove Street in this, Internal Affairs would be all over your ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let the comment slide, although she was right. You don’t see many luxury sports cars in the parking lot of the St. Paul Police Department. I thumbed my key chain to unlock the doors. When we were both safely inside the Audi, Karen said, “I wish I had a car like this. How much does a car like this cost?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fifty thousand dollars.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, maybe someday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snapped my seat belt into place, and Karen did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where to?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, we could make this a lot easier on ourselves. Just make some phone calls, call the house, call Scottie’s employers, call his mom…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren sighed significantly. “His job first,” she said. “See if he’s been in today. Then the halfway house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fired up the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a gun?” Karen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can get one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No guns.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if …?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No guns,” she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re the boss,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since when?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled away from the curb. Bobby and Shelby were watching from the window as I drove off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren directed me to I-94 and told me to take the Dale Street exit and hang a left. As I drove, she said, “If you’re not a cop, what are you doing here? Why are you doing this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Call it a favor for a friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A favor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do a lot of favors like this, McKenzie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Depends on how you define ‘a lot.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t go all Bill Clinton on me,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I do a lot of favors for friends. Usually it’s no big deal. Sometimes it involves an element of, ahh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Danger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncertainty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because they can’t do it for themselves and I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They can’t call the cops? They can’t call—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An officer of the court?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren hesitated for a beat and said, “I guess I had that coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you didn’t,” I told her. “You’re just trying to do your job, and your job has rules.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m guessing that you’re the guy who bends them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You told me why people call you for favors. You didn’t tell me why you do them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I used to be a cop. I quit when I became independently wealthy. Only the thing is, I liked being a cop. I liked helping people. I saw a lot of terrible things when I was in harness; I was forced to do some of those terrible things myself, yet I always slept well at night. When my head hit the pillow and I looked back on the day, no matter how crummy the day was, I could always say, ‘The world’s a little bit better place because of what I did.’ It made me feel good; made me feel useful. I used to tell people that I liked being a cop so much that I would have done it even if they didn’t pay me. Now they don’t have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you help friends, even at the risk of your own life, because you think you’re making the world a better place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds pretentious as all hell, doesn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Depends on how you define ‘as all hell.’ ” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/madman-on-a-drum-mac-mckenzie-5/page-15.html","bookId":2221,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:45:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:45:11 PM"}
