And though she appears to be human herself, Eden is an alien, a Raka, distinguished by her golden hair and skin, and gifted with the ominous ability to kill without remorse -- and with total accuracy. That is, until the fateful night she has one shot to eliminate her target, a human slaver -- and misses. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\"Failure\" is not in Eden\u0027s vocabulary. Neither is \"partner\" -- but that\u0027s what she is forcibly assigned after recovering from her disastrous mission. A sexy, steely-nerved human agent, Lucius Adaire enjoys nothing more than sparking the fury -- and rousing the desire -- of the fiery female assassin too proud to admit defeat. Locked in an assignment they cannot afford to lose, Lucius and Eden find themselves bound in two high-stakes, heart-pounding games: the sensual web of kill or be killed, and the erotic dance of seduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/enslave-me-sweetly-alien-huntress-2.jpg","author":"Gena Showalter","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/enslave-me-sweetly-alien-huntress-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:28 AM"}
