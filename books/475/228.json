Waiting requires patience, and patience is a rare virtue. It is fine to know that God builds hedges around His people--when the hedge is looked at from the viewpoint of protection.But when the hedge is kept around one until it grows so high that he cannot see over the top, and wonders whether he is ever to get out of the little sphere of influence and service in which he is pent up, it is hard for him sometimes to understand why he may not have a larger environment--hard for him to \"brighten the corner\" where he is. But God has a purpose in all HIS holdups. \"The steps of a good man\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eare ordered of the Lord,\"(Psalm37:23) \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOn the margin of his Bible at this verse George Mueller had a notation, \"And the stops also.\" It is a sad mistake for men to break through God\u0027s hedges. It is a vital principle of guidance for a Christian never to move out of the place in which he is sure God has placed him, until the\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePillar of Cloud moves.--Sunday School Times \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen we learn to wait for our Lord\u0027s lead in everything, we shall know the strength that finds its climax in an even, steady walk. Many of us are lacking in the strength we so covet. But God gives full power for every task He appoints. Waiting, holding oneself true to His lead--this is the secret of strength. And anything that falls out of the line of obedience is a waste of time and strength. Watch\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor His leading.--S. D. Gordon \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMust life be a failure for one compelled to stand still in enforced inaction and see the great throbbing tides of life go by? No; victory is then to be gotten by standing still, by quiet waiting. It is a thousand times harder to do this than it was in the active days to rush on in the columns of stirring life. It requires a grander heroism to stand and wait and not lose heart and not lose hope, to submit to the will of God, to give up work and honors to others, to be quiet, confident and rejoicing, while the happy, busy multitude go on and away. It is the grandest life \"having done all, to stand.\"--J. R. Miller　\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e八月十六日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「我曾耐性等候耶和华。」（诗四十1）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e你知道吗？等候比前进困难得多。等候需要忍耐，忍耐是一件难得的美德。神在祂的子民的四周都在建筑篱笆保护他们。当篱笆越筑越高，甚至连顶也看不见的时候，我们就要发急──极欲知道以后有没有机会能从这个幽闭的势力范围里出去，我们不能明白为甚么我们不能有一个较大的环境。但是神在祂一切工作上都有目的的。「义人的脚步，被耶和华立定。」（诗卅七23） \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e在穆勒的圣经上，这一节经文旁边注着：「义人的止步也被耶和华立定。」但是我们却常常喜欢穿出神为我们所建筑的篱笆外去，这实在是一个极大的错误。一个基督人如果已经确实知到是神将他放在他的地位上的，他千万不可以轻易活动；直到云柱移动了，他纔可以移动这是极重要的。──译自主日学报\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e甚么时候我们学会了每件事情等待神的引导，甚么时候我们就会知道只有在安静中，我们的灵力纔会达到最高点。我们中间有许多人缺乏这种安静的力量。但是如果神指定我们去做一件工作，祂必定会给我们够用的力量。耐性等候，遵行神的引导──这是得能力的秘诀。在神旨意之外的，都是浪费。让我们等候神的引导罢. --戈登\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e在神的引导没有来到之先，我们实行不动，坐看良机错失，结果岂不是一个极大的失败吗？不；胜利就是在不动中、静候中得到的。这要比活动艰难千倍。这个需要更大的勇气去站住、等候、不丧胆、不绝望；绝对服从神的旨意；将工作和荣誉让给他人；别人都快快活活、忙忙碌碌在工作，自己却能安安静静，带着信心而欢乐。这纔是最伟大的生活──「成就了一切还能站立得住」（弗六13）。──密勒\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5312.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:47:02 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:47:02 AM"}
