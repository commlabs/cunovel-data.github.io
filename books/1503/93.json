A similar situation appeared once again, and the immense pressure on Zhou Weiqing’s body was relieved somewhat, making him feel a lot more comfortable after the mixed Wind Attribute Heavenly Energies had been filtered twice. Alas, the total amount and power was just too huge, and the amount absorbed by the two large Death Acupuncture Point energy whirlpools was only a very small portion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGritting his teeth, Zhou Weiqing focused his will with all his might, using his original Heavenly Energy to stimulate and lead the mixed Heavenly Energy directly towards the Yongquan Death Acupuncture Point. At this point, he just wanted to break through the Yongquan Death Acupuncture Point, making use of that to once again filter the remaining mixed Heavenly Energy. If he failed, he would have to try to reverse the flow and attempt to absorb all the mixed Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang*! The vast amounts of Heavenly Energy smashed savagely into the Yongquan Acupuncture Point. Alas, with a marked difference from the ease of the first time Zhou Weiqing tried to break through his Clavicle Acupuncture Point, the breaking through of the Yongquan Death Acupuncture Point encountered an unexpected immense resistance and was extremely difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn indescribable pain lanced through both his feet, Zhou Weiqing felt a large amount of blood rush backward along his legs, and once again he spat out a large mouthful of blood. This time, blood seeped out from the pores of his skin, covering his entire body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe backlash this time was just too fierce, the Yongquan Acupuncture Point had barely forced open a little, and Zhou Weiqing did not know what problems would arise if he actually forced it open with brute force. Alas, like an arrow nocked on a bow which had to be released, he was already at the point of no return now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more! Zhou Weiqing steeled his nerve and ruthlessly focused himself again. With a deep breath, he once took control of the mixed Heavenly Energy, which had became wilder after that first burst, and viciously slammed down in a second attempt of breaking through the Yongquan Death Acupuncture Point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang*! This time, Zhou Weiqing almost leapt up from the ground, as a cloud of blood spurted out from his pores once again, from the feet all the way up to the thighs, every inch of his flesh seemed to be covered with blood; it was as if his legs’ meridians had been completely ruptured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing felt as though the soles on both his feet had been opened up with a huge hole respectively, and a large amount of Heavenly Energy was gushing out, the acute pain filling his entire body, reminding him of period of time when he was breaking through his first Death Acupuncture Point, the Clavicle Acupuncture Point, but this time is was actually a lot more serious and severe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not good!” Shangguan Bing\u0027er cried out in alarm, and without any other considerations, she swiftly moved and arrived beside Zhou Weiqing in a quick flash. When Zhou Weiqing started his attempted breakthrough, she had already known that his target was the sole’s Yongquan Death Acupuncture Point. Both her hands gathered Heavenly Energy, and she placed them onto Zhou Weiqing’s Yongquan Acupuncture Points respectively, trying to help him seal up the shattered Death Acupuncture Point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her palm came into contact with his sole, that very instant, Shangguan Bing\u0027er’s entire \u0026nbsp;body convulsed, and she immediately felt two bouts of rich and pure Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy flow from Zhou Weiqing’s Yongquan Acupuncture Point, flooding into her body. She attempted to prevent it, but the two bouts of Heavenly Energy had seemed to lock onto her body, and she was unable to do anything. The Heavenly Energy crashed into her body, right into her meridians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing\u0027er gave a muffled groan as her whole body shuddered, but she refused to give up, both hands holding onto Zhou Weiqing’s foot with all her strength, unwilling to be shaken away by so easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could be said both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing\u0027er were suffering extreme pain, and at this moment, the black tiger tattoos which had subsided earlier reappeared once again on Zhou Weiqing’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black word ‘King’ reappeared on his forehead once again, giving forth a dignified aura, and Zhou Weiqing’s Yongquan Death Acupuncture Point on his right foot was once again sealed up instantaneously, forming an energy whirlpool almost immediately after. Although the process on the left leg was much slower, but it was clearly in the midst of healing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling the change of Zhou Weiqing body, the Shangguan Bing\u0027er gave a sigh of relief and relaxed. However, her body had just born the huge stress from the immense amount of Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy, and in addition to the previous exhaustion, darkness overcame her vision and she fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the left foot’s Yongquan Death Acupuncture Point was gradually sealed up, Zhou Weiqing’s pain also subsided like melting snow, but the mixed Heavenly Energy in his body was still moving around fiercely and restlessly. At this point, without any external stimulation, the revolution of the energy whirlpools at the four Death Acupuncture Point that had originally been broken through was going at top speed, quickly absorbing the wild mixed Heavenly Energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the left foot’s Yongquan Death Acupuncture Point was also fully sealed, and as the energy whirlpool formed, an indescribably comfortable feeling spread all over Zhou Weiqing’s body, into every corner possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his fifth Death Acupuncture Point broken through, without a doubt, Zhou Weiqing’s \u0026nbsp;cultivation level had also entered the fifth level of Heavenly Jing Energy. Not only that, when the five energy whirlpools revolved simultaneously, Zhou Weiqing discovered that the absorption of Heavenly Energy from the environment had actually doubled!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving finally broken through the Yongquan Death Acupuncture Point also meant that Zhou Weiqing had finally completed the first section of the Immortal Deity Technique, all the five Death Acupuncture Points on his limbs. Currently, when the five energy whirlpools on the Five Death Acupuncture Points were revolving, he could feel the whirlpools expanding their reach and growing larger. If we were to liken the four Death Acupuncture Points energy whirlpools to the size of a pigeon’s egg, then with five Death Acupuncture Points now, these energy whirlpools had expanded nearly unceasingly, and in just a short period of time, it had reached every corner of the body. In other words, just the ten energy whirlpools from the five Death Acupuncture Points would be able to reach every single point in his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the black tiger tattoos had not subsided yet, but from Zhou Weiqing’s skin, rings of creamy white light was slowly combining and linking together with the tattoos, forming an invisible energy shield around his skin; this was actually a symbol that the first portion of the Immortal Deity Technique had been completed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Immortal Deity Technique was definitely a mysterious yet extremely abnormal cultivation method. From the speed of cultivation, it was definitely faster than any other Cultivation Technique in the world, but it should definitely not be as fast as what Zhou Weiqing had accomplished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn just two months, Zhou Weiqing had actually successfully broken through to this crucial fifth Death Acupuncture Point, which should have been totally impossible no matter what happened. However, under all the various unbelievable chances that had occurred, he had also Devoured a massive amount of Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy from outside, and needed the support of this fifth Death Acupuncture Point. As such, he had been stuck between a rock and a hard place, and had gone through the attempt in breaking through, and had even succeeded unexpectedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the present Zhou Weiqing was still only a single jeweled cultivation level, but having completed the first portion of the Immortal Deity Technique meant that he had truly taken the first step down this cultivation path, a road of no return. Of course, that also meant that he would also truly be able to obtain all the various extra advantages from the insanely strong Immortal Deity Technique. At the same time, the drawback would be that the following cultivation would be even more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the five Death Acupuncture Points’ energy whirlpools absorbed Heavenly Energy from the environment unceasingly, Zhou Weiqing did not even need to focus much on cultivation, and he found that his fifth level Heavenly Jing Energy was already completely filled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing\u0027er, who was fainted at his feet, did not realise that at that point, a large portion of the Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy that had been filtered and purified by Zhou Weiqing’s Immortal Deity Technique had actually been suffused into her body, and most of what Zhou Weiqing absorbed, was only the bit that came from the Direwolf King.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough his Devour ability was extremely strong, but the Devoured energy had to be used up quickly, unless he was a lot stronger than the amount that had been absorbed, otherwise he would not be able to absorb much of the energy. Perhaps, this was the world’s way of balancing the scales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-4-chapter-23-04\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-4-chapter-24-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-4-chapter-23-05","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
