Colin, meet my wife. Now let go of her, Colin, before I smash your face in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara was appalled by the threat. Colin laughed. \"I wonder why you don\u0027t like me holding your wife,\" he drawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t let go of Sara\u0027s hand but kept his gaze fully directed on his friend. Nathan, he decided, looked extremely uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara\u0027s comment turned his attention back to her. \"Nathan doesn\u0027t like anything, sir,\" she announced with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he like you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded before Nathan could order Colin to quit his teasing. \"Oh, yes, he likes me very much,\" she said matter-of-factly. She tried to extricate her hand from his grasp, but Colin held tight. \"Sir, are you deliberately trying to provoke Nathan\u0027s temper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly nodded. \"Then I believe we have something in common,\" Sara said. \"I always provoke his temper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin threw back his head and laughed. Sara hadn\u0027t thought her remark was that amusing, and she wondered if he wasn\u0027t laughing about something else altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally let go of her hand. She immediately clasped her hands behind her back to keep them safe from his grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan noticed that action and found his first smile. Then Colin soured it. \"You didn\u0027t need a reprieve after all,\" he told Nathan. \"Sooner would have been better than later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave it alone,\" Nathan ordered. He knew Colin was referring to his past remark that he wanted to leave the chore of collecting his bride until the last possible minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, have we met before?\" Sara asked. \"You did mention that from a distance…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he shook his head at her she stopped her question. \"I happened to see you one afternoon, but alas, I wasn\u0027t given the opportunity to make my presence known to you. I was on a mission, you see, to determine if a certain possession would fit through a window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not amused, Colin,\" Nathan muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin\u0027s grin indicated he was vastly amused. He decided that he\u0027d prodded his friend enough for the moment. \"Let me move those papers from the chair, Lady Sara, and you can sit down and tell me all about your voyage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t a happy story, Dolphin,\" Jimbo interjected. Since there weren\u0027t any other chairs available, he leaned against the wall. His gaze was directed on Sara. \"We met with one sorry disaster after another, didn\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara gave him a dainty shrug. \"I thought it was a lovely voyage,\" she announced. \"Very uneventful, as a matter of fact. Jimbo,\" she added, \"it\u0027s impolite to snort when you don\u0027t agree with someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uneventful, Sara?\" Matthew asked. He grinned at Colin. \"The enemy stalked us at every turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What enemy stalked us?\" Sara asked. \"Oh, you must mean those horrid pirates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were only a small part of the mischief,\" Matthew remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara turned back to Colin. \"Pirates attacked the ship, but we chased them away quick enough. As for the rest of the voyage, I declare it was quite peaceful. Don\u0027t you agree, Nathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned at him to let him know his rude denial wasn\u0027t appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re forgetting the parasols,\" he reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin thought he\u0027d lost track of the conversation. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara\u0027s parasols turned out to be our greatest enemies,\" Matthew explained. \"There were three of them… or was it four? I can\u0027t remember. I tend to block unpleasant memories. I get the shivers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will someone explain?\" Colin demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t significant,\" Sara blurted out. She wasn\u0027t about to let her men drag out her venial sins like soiled linen to be scrubbed clean in front of company. \"Matthew\u0027s just jesting with you. Isn\u0027t he, Nathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worry in her gaze wasn\u0027t lost on her husband. \"Yes,\" he agreed with a sigh. \"He was just jesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin let the topic drop when he noticed how relieved Sara looked. He decided to wait until he and Nathan were alone to find out the story behind the parasols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the stack of papers from the chair and hurried over to the far side of the office. After placing the stack on top of the cabinet he went back to his chair, sat down, and propped his feet up on the edge of the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara watched him closely and couldn\u0027t help but notice that he hadn\u0027t limped at all. \"Nathan, Colin doesn\u0027t have a—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t raise your voice to me in front of your associate,\" she ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What don\u0027t I have?\" Colin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara sat down, adjusted the folds in her gown, and then smiled at Colin. She could feel Nathan\u0027s frown. \"A surly nature,\" she announced. \"I can\u0027t imagine why you and Nathan are such good friends. You seem very different to my way of thinking, sir. Yes, you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin grinned. \"I\u0027m the civil one in the partnership,\" he told her. \"Is that what you\u0027re thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dare not agree, of course, for it would make me disloyal to my husband,\" she replied. She paused to smile at Nathan, then added, \"But you notice that I\u0027m not disagreeing either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin was noticing a whole lot more than that. Nathan couldn\u0027t seem to take his gaze off his wife. There was a warm glint in his eyes Colin had never seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to call me sir,\" Colin said to Sara. \"Please call me Colin, or even Dolphin like the men do, if that will suit you.\" A mischievous look came into his eyes, and he glanced over at Nathan before asking, \"And what might I call you, Lady Sara, that isn\u0027t quite so formal? After all, you are part of this enterprise now. Does Nathan have a special nickname for you that I might also use?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan thought the question was ridiculous. He didn\u0027t particularly like the way Colin was fawning over his wife. He trusted his friend completely, of course, and aside from that fact, Nathan would never allow himself to care too much about his wife, at least not to the point where he was actually jealous. Odd, though, he was still getting damned irritated. \"Colin, I call her wife,\" he announced. \"You can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin leaned further back in his chair. \"No, I don\u0027t suppose I can,\" he drawled. \"Pity you haven\u0027t given her any other nicknames.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\" Sara asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like sweetheart, or love, or even—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, Colin,\" Nathan interrupted, \"will you quit this game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara straightened her shoulders. She was frowning at her husband. Nathan thought it was because he\u0027d accidentally slipped in a blasphemy. He almost apologized, then caught himself in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Colin, he has never called me by any endearments,\" Sara announced. She sounded properly appalled. Nathan rolled his eyes heavenward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if I did,\" Nathan said, \"you damned well couldn\u0027t. Partners or not, Colin, you aren\u0027t calling my wife sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would it bother you?\" Colin innocently prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that was his game, Nathan thought. He\u0027s trying to find out just how much I care about Sara. He shook his head at his friend, then added a glare so that Colin would be sure to get his message to let the topic drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan does have a special nickname he uses when he addresses me,\" Sara announced then, drawing her husband\u0027s attention. \"You have my permission to use it, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" Colin asked. He caught the surprised look on Nathan\u0027s face and became all the more curious. \"And what might that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, Sara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d heard correctly. \"Did you say—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan usually addresses me as Damn It Sara. Don\u0027t you, dear?\" she asked her husband. \"Colin, you may also—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, Nathan muttered, \"Damn it, Sara, don\u0027t push me. I…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven he saw the humor then and joined in the laughter. Then Matthew once again reminded them that there was business to attend to and that they\u0027d best get on with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe teasing banter ended. Sara sat quietly while she listened to Colin give Nathan a catch-up on the firm\u0027s activities. She smiled when Colin announced that they had five more contracts to ship supplies to the Indies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan, does that mean we\u0027re…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we aren\u0027t rich yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked crestfallen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll all be rich when you—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what my duty is,\" she blurted out. \"You don\u0027t have to explain it in front of my staff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan smiled. Colin shook his head. \"I haven\u0027t followed any of that,\" he admitted. \"What is the duty you have to perform that will make us rich?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the way Lady Sara blushed, Colin concluded the matter was of a personal nature. He remembered that Nathan had told him the king\u0027s treasure wouldn\u0027t be handed over until Sara gave her husband an heir. Because of Sara\u0027s obvious discomfort, however, Colin decided to let the topic drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the love of God,\" Matthew muttered, \"quit this chitchat. I\u0027m itching to get going, Colin. I\u0027ve got some personal dealings to settle before the week\u0027s out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going somewhere?\" Colin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, heavens, Matthew, you haven\u0027t told Colin about Nora,\" Sara interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is Nora?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara was happy to explain. She hadn\u0027t realized the details she\u0027d given until she was finishing up her explanation. \"I cannot say more, Colin, about the quickness of the wedding, for to do so would damage my aunt\u0027s reputation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara, you already told him everything,\" Nathan interjected dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his position behind the desk Colin had a clear view of the street beyond the open doorway. Sara had just begun to explain why she hadn\u0027t truly revealed her aunt\u0027s unusual circumstances when a black carriage swayed to a stop across the street. There were five men on horseback escorting the vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin recognized the seal on the side door. It was the Earl of Winchester\u0027s family crest. He gave Nathan a barely perceptible nod, then returned his attention to Sara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan immediately moved away from the ledge, motioned to Jimbo and Matthew, and then casually walked outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara didn\u0027t pay any attention to the men. She was determined to convince Colin that her aunt was a decent woman and that she would never have become so passionately involved with Matthew if she hadn\u0027t loved him with all her heart. She also wanted his promise not to repeat a word of what she\u0027d inadvertently blurted out about her aunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as soon as he gave her the promise she wanted she started to turn around to see what her husband was doing. Colin stopped her by asking another question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara, what do you think of our office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t wish to injure your feelings, Colin, but I do believe it\u0027s rather drab. It could be very attractive, though. We need only paint the walls and add drapes. I\u0027d be happy to supervise this task. Pink would be a lovely color, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said, in such a cheerful tone of voice that she wasn\u0027t at all offended. She became a little uneasy, however, when he opened the center drawer of the desk and took out a pistol. \"Pink\u0027s a woman\u0027s color,\" Colin said then. \"We\u0027re men. We like dark, ugly colors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin indicated he was jesting with her. Besides, she reasoned, although she didn\u0027t know him at all well, she was certain he wouldn\u0027t shoot her just because he didn\u0027t care for the color she\u0027d suggested. Nathan wouldn\u0027t let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to that, where was her husband? Sara stood up and started for the doorway. She spotted Nathan standing between Jimbo and Matthew across the street. The trio was blocking the door of a black carriage. Sara couldn\u0027t see the seal. Jimbo\u0027s large bulk blocked it. \"Who are they talking to, I wonder. Do you know, Colin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come and sit down, Sara. Wait for Nathan to come back inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to do just that when Jimbo shifted positions and she saw the crest. \"That\u0027s my father\u0027s carriage,\" she cried out in surprise. \"How in heaven\u0027s name did he know so soon that we were back in London?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin didn\u0027t answer her, for Sara had already rushed out the doorway. He shoved the pistol into his pocket and hurried after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated at the curb. Her stomach suddenly tightened up. Oh, God, she hoped her father and Nathan were getting along. And who were those other men?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t borrow trouble,\" she whispered to herself. She took a deep breath, picked up her skirts, and rushed across the street just as her father climbed out of the carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe earl of Winchester was considered by many to be a distinguished-looking gentleman. He still had a full head of hair, though most of it was silver-colored, and his belly was more firm than round. He stood two inches below six feet in height. He had the same shade of brown eyes Sara did, but that was the only resemblance they shared. Her father\u0027s nose was eagle-sized. When he frowned, or squinted against the sun, as he was doing at that moment, his eyes disappeared behind narrow slits. His lips, when pressed together, were as thin as a finely drawn line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara wasn\u0027t afraid of her father, but he did worry her, for the simple reason that he wasn\u0027t at all predictable. She never knew what he was going to do. Sara hid her concern and rushed forward dutifully to embrace her father. Nathan noticed how the earl stiffened in response to Sara\u0027s touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so surprised to see you, Father,\" Sara began. She stepped back and took hold of Nathan\u0027s arm. \"How did you know we were back in London so soon after our arrival? Why, our trunks haven\u0027t even left the ship yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father quit frowning at Nathan long enough to give her an answer. \"I\u0027ve had my men watching the water since the day you left, Sara. Now come along with me. I\u0027m taking you home where you belong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anger in her father\u0027s voice alarmed her. She instinctively moved closer to her husband. \"Home? But Father, I\u0027m married to Nathan. I must go home with him. Surely you realize…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped trying to explain when the carriage door opened and her older sister Belinda climbed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod\u0027s truth, Sara was sorry to see her. Belinda was smiling. That wasn\u0027t a good sign. The only time Belinda ever appeared to be happy was when there was trouble brewing. She smiled a lot then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelinda had gained a considerable amount of weight since Sara had last seen her. The gold-colored walking dress she wore was straining at the seams. Her sister was heavy-boned and given to fat anyway, and the extra pounds she\u0027d put on had settled around her midriff. She looked more pregnant than not. As a child Belinda had been the pretty sister. The men in the family doted on her. She had curly sun-yellowed hair, a dimple in each cheek, and adorable blue eyes. As she\u0027d grown into womanhood, however, the dimples had been swallowed up in her overly rounded cheeks. Her glorious hair had turned into a mousy brown. The darling of the Winchester family wasn\u0027t the center of attention any longer. Belinda\u0027s answer to that change in status was to console herself with food. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-33.html","bookId":1790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM"}
