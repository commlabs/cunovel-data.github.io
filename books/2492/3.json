The suspense would kill me and I wouldn\u0027t be able to get it outta my head during judo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of,\" she corrected and I stared at her until she responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s been a snag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised an eyebrow, like elaborate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since she\u0027s sixteen and this is a permanent order, she has to have five character witnesses.\" I opened my mouth to protest and she held up her hand. \"No, it can\u0027t be you and the gang. It has to be others that are also sixteen and over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The J\u0027s, Mom. And me in about two weeks,\" I said, giving an unconscious glance at the set of wheels that hung in the driveway. Impatiently waiting for my driving greatness. Yeah, that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Yes, that makes some sense but it\u0027s not as clearcut as all that. Your father can elaborate on the specifics, sweet pea,\" she said, stepping to ruffle my hair and I did the lean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the banana bread, Mom,\" I said, seeing the hurt riding her eyes. I just wasn\u0027t up to the daily maul anymore. I was older now, I didn\u0027t want the Mom love-fest anymore. She wasn\u0027t getting it though. I felt a stab of guilt and said, \"Gotta get to judo or my sensei is going to ride my butt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was an understatement, I thought, grabbing my gear pack and shoving my pulse into it. I gave Onyx a pat and another crumb I\u0027d stolen and slammed the door closed behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I sailed past my car on the way to my bike I was tempted to stroke its sleek sides (sleek to me) as I hunkered down on old faithful. This bike had gotten me to more yard jobs than I cared to admit. Of course, that\u0027d been on the days Bry couldn\u0027t pick me up. It had been our group. Pimped out for the rich folks all summer, to landscape their yards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been sucky to get assigned the Hamilton residence. Big time. Dad had needed to give me The Lecture that I remembered as I rode:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb, you understand that you\u0027re sometimes going to have to work for people that you don\u0027t like, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, responding, \"Like Carson\u0027s stupid dad. Yeah, I gotcha on that one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad frowned. \"I didn\u0027t say anything about IQ son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brows sailed up and he did a small chortle, covertly looking around for Mom. \"Alright, alright,\" he held up a palm to ward off the inevitable, \"he isn\u0027t going to win any chess matches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI barked out a laugh and he continued, \"This will be a real challenge but as long as he doesn\u0027t require anything illegal from you, it will be a terrific way to prove that you have the internal fortitude to see a task through to completion. Regardless of the personal undertone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal undertone!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded my arms over my chest. \"K, but I don\u0027t know if I can do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just keep us abreast of whatever transpires, are we clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Dad. Crystal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb, swivel your hips, move with fluidity. Too jerky,\" Sensei Anderson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to kick his ass. Sweat was dripping all over the mat and he was drilling me on turns. I was completely past that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw my look and smiled. \"Think you can take me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at my instructor and knew I couldn\u0027t. Maybe he was five-nine. But he was two hundred pounds of muscle. What Gramps would\u0027ve called a brick shithouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sensei,\" I said through my teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you better hustle your ass on the mat... \" he folded his arms across his chest and got beside me, mirroring my moves, both of us moving together, side-by-side in synchronicity. \"What do I have to do to make you passionate about this? Do you need some incentive, Hart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly growled, my stomach on fire, my nerve endings raw. He\u0027d really been riding me lately. Bleating like a sheep about excellence and all that happy crap. I was tired. Couldn\u0027t he see I was trying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep going,\" he said, stopping beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I moved I saw with each turn his grin growing wider. Finally he let up on the suspense of his thoughts. \"Heard you got a girlfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy step faltered and I jammed it back into place with an effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sensei.\" Where was this going?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear she\u0027s a real hottie,\" he said with feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout thinking, I swiveled into sensei, taking my forward momentum and jabbing my hand like a plank into the soft tissue of his throat. Not a death blow, no. But a nice, sharp jab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came at me in a flurry of defensive jabs, the breath locked in his throat. Even without breathing-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blocked what I could but he was faster, stronger, older. He foot-swept me and I landed flat on my back with a resounding smack that echoed in the dojo. The other kids stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensei Anderson sucked in a lungful. \"Take a break, students.\" His hand palmed the tender part of his esophagus where a red welt had blossomed. He\u0027d have a mark I thought with some satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached a hand out to me and I hesitated, then took a cautious grip. He jerked me to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that\u0027s what I\u0027ve been talking about, Hart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got right in his grill, a flavor of pissed off beating in my brain with a steady rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled again. \"That was just to show you what kind of intensity I\u0027m wanting out of you,\" he pointed to his head. \"It\u0027s mental with you, Hart. You\u0027ve got the physique.\" He walked a circle around me, looking at me from head to toe. \"How tall are you now, kid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"Six foot something...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked a brow. \"You\u0027re sixteen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, embarrassed a little as I thought about my hottie girlfriend picking me up today because she was that month older than me, license already in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied my expression. \"Soon, though?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Yeah, Halloween.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really,\" he said on a chuckle. \"That\u0027s the height of irony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, hilarious,\" I said, scowling at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen Hart. I am sure your girlfriend is hot,\" I felt my hands clench into fists. His eyes flicked down, catching the subtle tightening. \"But I\u0027m not interested. I was poking at you, proving a point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, what?\" I thought him bringing in Jade like that had been low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you need to move that one hundred and ninety pounds with purpose. Don\u0027t shuffle around like some old broad. Get your ass in gear. I\u0027m not going to advance you until I see some moves at that level. Period. You got me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t get your first dan until you\u0027re sixteen. But if I don\u0027t see you bring a pair to the mat, it\u0027s not happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh, I was gonna have to bring it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft honk sounded and I looked outside the glass doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Jade was there in the driver\u0027s seat of Andrea\u0027s beat up pickup truck and could taste my birthday on my tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutonomy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a great feeling. Soon, I\u0027d be picking her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That the girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned, giving him steady eyes. He stared back. \"Yeah,\" I answered shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a speculative look. \"Remember this: she\u0027s your weakness. You have her around and you\u0027ll never keep your focus.\" Then he smiled like sun coming from behind clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And God help the poor sucker that lays hands on her,\" he said, only half-joking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, no shit Sherlock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bowed to Sensei Anderson, our gazes locked, taking the measure of each other. Then turning, I slipped on my flip flops and flung open the door, feeling the last of the late afternoon warmth on my face. The sweat on my body chilled with the temperature change. The first kiss of true autumn was in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI covered my brow with my hands to see Jade better and a hoop of silver twinkled in the light that hit her face, her green eyes sitting like jewels in the face that I loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree cars stood outside Kent Refuse now. Mia\u0027s, Bry\u0027s (I know, can we say-unbelievable?) and Alex\u0027s. The J\u0027s were sixteen, Jade too. It was just Tiff and I that were the holdouts. Even Sophie had turned sixteen last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Alex get out of his car. It was hilarious, really. He\u0027d been a scrawny nothing with the Body ability and it had been a shocker, built like he was. But now that ability had grown fangs and here he was before us, larger-than-life. The pain of his growth spurt was on him now as he moved with rigidity. The doctors said it was normal for a teen with this ability but even though all us guys would love to be his size, there was no way we\u0027d want to go through the growing pains that were kickin\u0027 his ass to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stomped over to our group and Jonesy gave him a clap on the back. Alex flinched. \"Hey Jones, can you lighten up on the greetings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn narrowed his eyes on Jonesy. \"He\u0027s hyper-sensitive right now. I explained that pretty thoroughly on like... a hundred different occasions, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had, actually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, so, I can\u0027t give you a love tap without you going all girl on me?\" Jonesy quizzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, ya clown, speak for yourself,\" Tiff muttered, kicking a stone with her shoe, her tie dye hoodie a screaming nightmare to the eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBry sorta hid a smile and Mia looked between Jonesy and Tiff with keen interest. After all, half the fun of the group was Jonesy trying not offend and doing it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of clowns...\" I began and both Tiff and Jade gave me quick looks. \"I forgot to mention that there\u0027s a boatload of gnomes at one of the houses we landscaped this summer.\" My eyebrows lifted and Tiff repressed a shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade wrapped her arms around herself. \"Where?\" she asked unwillingly as I sucked her in against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got a guess,\" Sophie said, walking up with Buddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole group fell silent. The biggest damn question in the universe was WHY would Sophie bring a proven spawn of the enemy to the hideaway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy\u0027s face fell into angry lines and before he could rant Buddy chimed in, \"Carson\u0027s dad has a whole herd of gnomes in his yard.\" He looked expectantly at everyone and Tiff snapped a bomb-worthy bubble that made Jade jump a foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy turned accusing eyes to Sophie. \"Listen Soph, this is for the group. Our group. You\u0027ve obviously moved on so why don\u0027t you go away. Don\u0027t go away mad, just go away,\" he said rudely, folding his arms across his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie\u0027s face crumpled and he caught the expression, regret etched where anger had been. He\u0027d let his ego mouth overload his canary ass again, as Gramps would have said. John dumped his forehead into his hands. Alex and Bry looked around anywhere but at the two of them and Buddy moved toward Jonesy, Sophie on the verge of tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop slingin\u0027 mud, Jones,\" Buddy said, his fists clenching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy was like a locomotive without a handbrake, he skidded to a reluctant stop in front of Buddy, their toes touching, their chests a millimeter apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReplay, I thought, despairing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex walked over there and separated the two of them with a finger on each chest. Just that touch threw them four feet back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy rubbed his chest and Buddy gave Alex a considering look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched his wheels turn sluggishly and decide against taking Alex on. Good thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex used a finger to shove his glasses up on his nose and looked down at Buddy from his considerable six-four and said, \"We\u0027re not all warm and fuzzy about a Carson associate so no offense,\" he shrugged his massive shoulders, the muscles cording and flexing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUs guys watched him move with fascination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy glared and Sophie huffed. Alex turned to Jonesy. \"You could do better with treating a female nicer. Get over yourself and maybe Buddy can go away and Sophie can stay.\" Alex lifted an eyebrow at his equitable solution skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJones dropped his hand from his chest and gave Sophie a glare, unrepentant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade stepped forward. \"Listen... Jonesy, Sophie, let\u0027s call a truce. This is the place we\u0027ve been hanging out at for almost two years. You guys can move past your,\" she paused here significantly, \"stuff, to get along with the group, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie and Jonesy looked at each other and finally Sophie gave a stiff nod and her Rock-with-Lips boyfriend sighed in frustration. He whispered something in her ear and she responded, arms moving a mile a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Buddy seethed. \"As long as I know it\u0027s \u0027cuz the girls are the priority. Not him,\" he pointed at Jonesy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, baby. He totally isn\u0027t,\" Sophie said with a look and a smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaby?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven I could see that was for Jonesy\u0027s benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade sighed against me. They were too stubborn for their own good by far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy leaned down and kissed Sophie on the lips and all us guys saw Jonesy tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuddy gave a mock salute at the group that looked like its focus was all for Jonesy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-screams-death-4/page-3.html","bookId":2492,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:46:03 PM"}
