Her face was twisted in terror, her beautiful features distorted by fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as they should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. Very good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slower woman was a few steps behind and constantly looking over her shoulder, as if she were expecting something or someone with murderous intent to be hunting her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as he’d planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, come on, keep running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if they heard him, the women raced forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis throat tightened and his fists balled in nervous anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a few more steps!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasping, the slower woman paused, one hand splayed over her chest as she leaned over to catch her breath beneath the streetlamp. Rain poured down from the heavens. Her hair was wet, falling in dripping ringlets around her face, her white jacket soaked through. Again she glanced furtively behind her, past the empty sidewalks and storefronts of this forgotten part of the city. God, she was beautiful, as was the first one, each a fine female specimen that he’d picked precisely for this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart was pumping wildly, anticipation and adrenaline firing his blood as an anticipatory grin twisted his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. This is so good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilently he watched as from the corner of his eye, the first woman raced past him just as he’d hoped. Eyes focused ahead, she was seemingly oblivious to his presence, but in his heart he knew she realized he was there, observing her every movement, catching each little nuance of fear. He saw determination and horror in the tense lines of her face, heard it in her quick, shallow breaths and the frenzied pounding of her footsteps as she flew past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafely down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced his full attention to the second woman, the target. She twisted her neck, turned to look his way, as if she felt him near, as if she divined him lurking in the deep umbra surrounding the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart missed a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t see me. Do not! Do not look at me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression, at this distance, was a little blurry, but he sensed that she was scared to death. Terrified. Exactly what he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel it. Experience the sheer terror of knowing you’re being stalked, that you are about to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lower lip trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! Finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatisfaction warmed his blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if she heard a sound, she stiffened, her head snapping to stare down the darkened alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s it. Come on. Come on!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened and suddenly she started running again, this time in a sheer panic. She slipped, lost a high heel, and she kicked off the other, never missing a step, her bare feet still slapping the wet pavement frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted slightly, giving himself a better view, making sure that he didn’t miss a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was running right on target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment a dark figure stepped from a shadowed doorway to stand right in front of the woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreaming, she veered a bit, slipped, and nearly lost her balance, only to keep on running, angling away from the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assassin raised his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlam! Blam! Blam!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree shots rang out, echoing along the empty street, fire spitting from the gun’s muzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stumbled and reeled, her face a mask of fear as she twisted and fell onto the pavement. Her eyes rolled upward, blood trickling from the corner of her mouth. Another spreading red stain bloomed darkly through her white jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect, he thought, satisfied at last as he viewed her unmoving body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, after years of planning, he’d pulled it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShondie Kent looked dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she lay in the street he waited, focusing on the body, noticing how it neither twitched nor moved in any way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExquisite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom years of experience he counted silently. Five, four, three, two, one. Still no movement, the “corpse” in place, the street empty, rain and a bit of fog visible. The camera had zoomed in on the open mouth, glazed eyes, and dark blood on the white blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatisfied that the shot was flawless, he yelled, “Cut!” and punched the air from his director’s chair. He felt ridiculously triumphant that the death scene had finally worked. Man, what a relief! They’d shot the scene over and over the day before, never getting the action and ambience to meld to his satisfaction. Something had always been missing. But today after several failed attempts, finally everything had worked like clockwork, the actors and crew were spot-on, the energy on the set was right for this, the climax to the end of the scene. “That’s it!” he yelled, then added under his breath, “Thank God,” because truth to tell, the scene had been a bitch. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-she-s-gone-west-coast-3/page-1.html","bookId":2675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:06 AM"}
