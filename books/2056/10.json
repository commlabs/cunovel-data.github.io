I plucked it off and went inside, surprised to find Vincent there again. I\u0027d figured his angel business would be keeping him busy elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s it all going?\" I asked. I rummaged through my cupboards, looking for food. I\u0027d skipped breakfast. \"I mean, if you can tell me without having to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat at my kitchen table, leafing through newspapers. \"Ah, well, still can\u0027t give you details, of course, but I can say that...um, well, progress isn\u0027t being made as quickly as we\u0027d like. There\u0027s leftover lasagna in the refrigerator if you want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the refrigerator door. Sure enough. \"Wow. Did one of the angels conjure this up for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if you consider Yasmine\u0027s cooking a type of conjuring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI uncovered the casserole dish. It looked great. There might be magic afoot after all. I put a piece in the microwave and set the timer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting down across from him, I peered at the spread out newspapers and remembered finding them left out the other day. \"You sure like your news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grimaced. \"Most of it\u0027s depressing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing at the headlines, I had to agree with him. Murder. Corruption. Theft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hear about the cop shooting the other day?\" I asked. \"That one was really depressing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent turned his attention away from a story about domestic abuse. \"No, what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This cop was outside a convenience store and claims someone was inside shooting his partner. So, he ran in, gun in hand, and started shooting. He ended up killing his partner himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent frowned. \"Huh. I hadn\u0027t heard that one,\" he murmured. From the distracted look in his eyes, his mind had clearly latched onto something I wasn\u0027t privy to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a sidelong glance. \"That mean anything to you? Maybe to this mission from God you\u0027re on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis easy smile returned. \"You\u0027re good but not that good. You know I can\u0027t say anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe microwave dinged, and I retrieved my food. As I stabbed a piece of cheesy pasta, I recalled what he\u0027d said about Yasmine\u0027s cooking. My curiosity got the better of me. As it often did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vince...\" I began slowly, carefully keeping my eyes on my food. \"I know it\u0027s none of my business...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"I always love it when people introduce topics like that - and then go ahead and dive in anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlushing, I shut my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" he said, clearly entertained. \"Go ahead. What were you going to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...well, nothing really. It\u0027s just, I mean, it doesn\u0027t matter to me...but I just sort of noticed that you and Yasmine seem, um, close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis levity faded. I quickly looked up and met his eyes apologetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I blurted out. \"Forget I said anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...it\u0027s, I don\u0027t know.\" He folded up the newspaper, staring at it without really seeing it. \"Yeah, I guess. I\u0027ve known her for a long time, and after a while, it\u0027s easy to...well, she\u0027s easy to like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, she is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few pregnant moments passed. When he spoke again, I heard affection in his voice. \"I first met her at this fair in Akron, of all places...about, oh, fifteen years ago. Not sure what she was doing there - you never do with them - but I found her walking away from a concession stand. She had this giant tower of cotton candy. I swear, it was taller than she was. And, since I could tell she was an angel, it made the situation that much more absurd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story made me smile too. It also shed light on why he was here with the A-Team. I could tell she was an angel. He was another gifted human, like Erik and Dante, who could sense the immortal world. \"And you went and talked to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hadn\u0027t planned to, but then the cotton candy started to fall over, so I went to help her and ended up eating half of it myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s sweet,\" I said. \"Er, no pun intended.\" It didn\u0027t matter that in the last few months, I\u0027d fucked one guy in an office chair, used a leather whip on another, and gone down on another in the back room of a seedy club. I still loved romantic stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She started asking for my help after that, off and on, once she realized what I could do. It was supposed to just be that...nothing more than her, you know, professional cases. But after a while, we couldn\u0027t help it. We\u0027re together all the time now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed another piece of lasagna. It was divine. Seriously. \"Do any of the other angels know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right. Joel barely tolerates me now...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But obviously, you guys aren\u0027t, um, you can\u0027t be - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but it doesn\u0027t matter. It doesn\u0027t have to be physical. Really, it\u0027s ironic. Angels are creatures of love. They\u0027re supposed to love everyone. They\u0027re just not supposed to love one person so much more than another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s stupid,\" I stated adamantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To you, maybe. And to me, I suppose. But to her...well, she devotes her entire existence to the service of a power and cause bigger than all of us. To be so in love with something - or someone else - is distracting. You can\u0027t serve two masters without eventually betraying one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down again, turning over his words. \"And yet you guys still stay together. Sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"In as much as we can. Maybe I should move on with my life, but, honestly, there\u0027s no one else I want to be with. I accept what she is. It\u0027s why I love her. I\u0027d rather be with her in a limited capacity than none at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoosebumps rose on the back of my neck. He\u0027d just stated a variant of what Seth used to tell me all the time, back when I would continually urge him to leave me and find someone else. I\u0027d accepted his choice by now and honestly couldn\u0027t imagine not having him in my life. But still. Sometimes I didn\u0027t entirely get how he could be okay with everything between us; hearing another person support such a choice was refreshing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though reading my mind, Vincent gently asked, \"Am I hitting too close to home? Carter mentioned a boyfriend...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Yes. I don\u0027t know. He - Seth, my boyfriend - says the same thing as you. That if it can\u0027t be any other way...well, then this is the way he wants it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. And thus, life goes on.\" Vincent started gathering up the newspapers. \"I tell you though, I think your side and hers are both so fucked up, it\u0027s not even funny. Why the rules? Why does a succubus always have to take away someone\u0027s life when she\u0027s with them? Why can\u0027t you have the choice? And why can\u0027t Yasmine make love? Why can\u0027t she be in love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood question. I don\u0027t think Vincent really expected an answer, but I had to give one anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because that\u0027s the way it is. The way the system works. The way it\u0027s always worked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The system is fucked-up,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it and nodded. \"No arguments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, he reached for his coat and slipped it on. \"You\u0027re okay for a succubus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent left, off to do whatever it was one did with a posse of angels. I almost envied him because I had something to do that I wasn\u0027t looking forward to at all. It was another necessary evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to get Tawny a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that debacle of a dance lesson, I\u0027d told her I\u0027d help. I might not be able to do much about my mysterious energy loss or angelic romances, but I sure as hell could do something to expedite Niphon\u0027s departure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove down to Seatac, a city that owes its entire existence to the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. It\u0027s more of a shadow, really, spreading around the airport in a blanket of long-term parking lots and cheap hotels. It also has a couple of strip clubs because really, what else are out-of-town businessmen supposed to do in their downtime?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late afternoon, so business was slow when I stepped inside Low Blow. A few bored-looking men sat scattered throughout the place, which was dingy and in need of some serious redecorating. Or, well, any decorating. A couple of the guys glanced up with interest as I walked through. Apparently, I held more appeal than the poor brunette trying her damnedest to fuck a pole in time to the dulcet sounds of Pink Floyd\u0027s \"Young Lust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to speak to the bartender, but a voice behind me interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ho...ly...shit. I don\u0027t believe it. I don\u0027t fucking believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and looked into the long, narrow face of Simon Chesterfield, the proud proprietor of this dive. Between his face and lanky body, he always reminded me of a weasel. His black mustache never quite seemed able to grow in completely, and he dressed in brand name clothes that were always one size too small. He was chummy with the local Hellish players, and rumor had it he was in line to be an imp, eventually selling his soul for immortality and the chance to be a diabolical salesman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You finally come to dance for me, doll?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a sleazy guy who ran a sleazy establishment, Simon actually had a legitimate appreciation for dance. I\u0027d once seen him trying to choreograph his strippers and had been impressed by his sense of aesthetics and rhythm. His employees hadn\u0027t really caught on. Such talents were kind of wasted here, and I used to wonder why he didn\u0027t take his business to one of the more affluent suburbs where he could get a higher caliber of dancers. The reason he stayed, I\u0027d later learned, was that this was a better venue for all sorts of other shady business he conducted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Simon had a sharp eye and knew what a good dancer I was. He\u0027d been on me for years to come work for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to talk,\" I explained. \"Business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what I do.\" With a sweeping gesture, he pointed to a doorway beside the bar. \"Let\u0027s go to my office then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis \u0027office\u0027 was barely a broom closet, but it had a stool for me to sit on. Resting my heels on a mid-level bar, I brought my knees up to my chest. It made my gray linen skirt slide up a bit. Simon watched with an interest that was more professional than personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck, woman. You come dance for me, and I could make a killing.\" He shook his head and collapsed into a rolling faux leather chair. \"A succubus on my stage. Fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head to the side. \"It\u0027s funny you mention that because that\u0027s kind of why I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think my innocent tone set his alarms off. He eyed me suspiciously. \"I thought you said you didn\u0027t want a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me. We just got a new succubus, and she\u0027s looking for a gig. Didn\u0027t you hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...\" He frowned. \"And she wants to dance? Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep,\" I said glibly. \"She can\u0027t wait to take her clothes off.\" Wasn\u0027t that the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon leaned back in the chair and put his feet on the desk. Casual pose or not, he was still on guard. \"What\u0027s the catch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does there have to be a catch? You should be excited about this. We\u0027re doing you a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re offering to drop a succubus into my lap. That sounds too good to be true, so it is too good to be true.\" He paused, still thinking. \"And why are you here instead of her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m altruistic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Georgina,\" he said warningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I admitted. \"She\u0027s kind of...new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How new?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really new. Still under warranty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s still a catch here somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...she\u0027s...\" I spun through my mental rolodex of adjectives. \"Inept.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised one narrow eyebrow. \"Inept?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s still learning how to get men.\" Since Simon probably wanted sexy women working for him, I figured it wasn\u0027t worth mentioning that Tawny wasn\u0027t so much learning as she was still trying to find her way to class. \"And she\u0027s a, um, bad dancer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you be a little more specific on what level of bad we\u0027re dealing with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember Gigli?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus. So, why do you think I\u0027d want to take on a shitty dancer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Simon,\" I exclaimed. \"All your dancers are shitty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all of them,\" he said. \"And it\u0027s not like I\u0027m trying to get more. We have standards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a pointed look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alright, alright.\" He ran a hand through his gelled black hair. \"What do I get in return?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I was the indignant one. \"What do you mean? You\u0027re getting a succubus dancer. What else do you need?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting a succubus charity case. I\u0027m the one doing you a favor.\" His eyes were shrewd. Yeah. He\u0027d make a good imp someday. He was this close to breaking out a contract. \"I want you. Dance for me two nights this week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Simon, there is nothing in this world that\u0027s going to get me to dance here, not even a succubus charity case. Pick something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, fine.\" He pondered. \"You. I want you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I just told you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. Not as a dancer. As in right now. On the desk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. That kind of want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, if I\u0027ve gotta hire a bad succubus, I might as well fuck a good one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting logic. Aren\u0027t you worried about your soul?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me like he couldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d had the audacity to ask such a thing. It was similar to the look I\u0027d given him when he said Low Blow had standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noted.\" I stood up. \"But not this body. Pick another shape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon snorted. \"You think I\u0027m interested in a pinup girl crossed with an Ann Taylor model? Fuck that. I want a sixteen-year-old version of Liza Minnelli. In a school girl\u0027s uniform.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared. \"I have no idea what that would look like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started undoing his pants. \"You\u0027re a smart girl. Figure it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing again, I shape-shifted, taking on a small body with a black pixie haircut. Baby smooth skin. Green plaid skirt with matching vest. Simon grunted his approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, I rested my hands on the desk and bent over, thrusting my ass out toward him. I hoped it would be over soon. If I could just get the weasel comparison out of my head, this would probably be a lot easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt his hands slide along my legs as he pushed the skirt up. Suddenly, he froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A thong? Are you insane, woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a sick bastard,\" I told him. The thong changed to white cotton panties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t I know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed the panties down and thrust forward. Well, I guess it was a thrust. Simon wasn\u0027t that well-endowed. I was on the verge of saying something like, \"Are you there yet?\" Alas, the Tawny situation was too dire. I couldn\u0027t risk Simon changing his mind about her for the sake of a joke, no matter how funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, whatever Simon lacked in size, he made up for in enthusiasm. He gripped my hips, nails digging into my bare flesh as he pounded away. I had to keep a fierce hold on the desk. Eventually, seeking variety, Simon flipped me over to my back. He unfastened my blouse and bra, exposing small, perky breasts that had just \"blossomed into womanhood.\" Eyes on them and not my face, he grabbed my legs and spread them so that my ankles practically rested on his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to the task at hand, and when he finally came, I have to admit I welcomed the energy burst. It wasn\u0027t a lot - the guy practically worked for Hell already - but I needed it. Simon pulled out of me, and I sat up, mildly sated from an energy standpoint, if not a physical one. I honestly hadn\u0027t done much but lie there the whole time, but he regarded me as though we\u0027d just gone through the entire Kama Sutra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely worth putting up with an inept succubus,\" he said happily, pulling his pants back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to say that he might want to withhold judgment until he actually met Tawny, but instead, I just smiled. I knew when to keep my control switch on. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-10.html","bookId":2056,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:56:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:56:54 PM"}
