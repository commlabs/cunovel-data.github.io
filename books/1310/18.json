DON RAMON ORTEGA.","content":"\u0026nbsp;The object which had so startled the Dutch boy was the figure of a middle-aged man, sprawled at full length on the floor matting. His hands were secured behind him and his feet were bound at the ankles with twisted towels. Over the lower part of his face another towel had been tied, thus effectually preventing outcry. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Carl’s own troubles faded into the background. As he slowly got the whip hand of himself, he struck another match and stepped to the man’s side. The man gurgled incoherently behind the gag and his dark eyes pleaded for immediate release.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Dere is some tricky bizness here, I guess!” exclaimed Carl. “Don’d be schared of me,” he added to the man, “I’m a friendt, und I vill help you.

In the glow that presently flooded the room, the Dutch boy returned to the man, knelt down beside him, and removed the towels.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man, attempting to rise, fell helplessly back again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Vas you hurt?” asked Carl solicitously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Hurt?” echoed the man, speaking good English, although with a very perceptible foreign accent. “Not at all, se?or; only my limbs—they are so cramped from confinement that I cannot stand. Soon they will be all right. But who are you?” Suspicion suddenly flamed in his dark eyes. “How does it happen that113 you know of my trouble and have come here?

The don, after giving a cautious look outside, closed the door and returned to Carl.

Some one rang the bell at the gate. I went out and admitted”—anger throbbed in the Spaniards voice—“Don Carlos Valdez! He is what you Americans call a trouble maker. I call him a pestilence, an evil specter who stalks through the devoted countries and helps revolutionists overthrow established governments. I am Spanish, but I love law and order! I hate violence and bloodshed! I am for peace! But Don Carlos is always for war, and more war, for in that he finds unholy profit. Well, it was he who called on me to-night. He declared that he wanted a passport, for he was going abroad. I told him to go to my secretary, at the legation. He said he had been there, but that the secretary was not in. I could not refuse him the passport if his intentions were peaceable and he paid the fee, so he came back into the house with me. As I seated myself and leaned over the table, the demon struck me from behind. I fell unconscious. When I recovered, I was bound as you saw me, and I have lain so for hours. But Don Carlos had not left when I regained consciousness. He and I have long been at swords’ points, and he taunted me with the base plans he intended to carry out.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Don Ramon writhed in his chair in a spasm of fierce anger.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Vat vas he going to do?” asked Carl.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He has designs on the submarine!” proceeded the116 don. “He thinks the boat would be valuable to the revolutionists to the south of us. They are threatening Port Livingston, at the mouth of the Izaral, and are seeking to secure the fort there. The lawful authorities of the state will send ships of war to defeat the revolutionists, and Don Carlos wants the submarine to destroy the war vessels.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Carl gasped, then he added soothingly, “Don’d you be exzited.

We must prevent him from carrying out his contemptible designs. I have told you so much, because it was necessary that you should understand. Come! Let us go at once to Bob Steele!

He returned presently with a pair of white duck trousers, and Carl climbed117 into them. They were too long and too narrow, but the Dutch boy contrived to make them serve.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now,” said Carl, “get der key of der front gate und lead der vay.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The don took a key from the drawer of the table.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Come,” said he, hurrying from the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Id’s a funny bizness,” remarked Carl, following, “dot dis Carlos feller vouldt leaf der door oben und lock der gate.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The gate locks itself when it is closed,” explained the don.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’d t’ink, anyvay, dere is mooch use vorryin’ aboudt der boat,” proceeded Carl, as the don unlocked the gate. “Dot Carlos feller vill haf his hants full pulling der vool ofer Bob Steele’s eyes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You do not know Carlos as well as I,” answered Don Ramon ominously. “He is plausible, he has many tricks, and then he is impersonating me!

Carl had not seen either of his chums at supper, and he had not spent much time looking for them. The serenade had been uppermost in Carl’s mind, and he had been afraid Bob or Dick might propose something that would interfere with his plans.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the hotel office they learned that Bob and Dick had gone out to the submarine early in the evening to arrange some stores that had been taken aboard.
