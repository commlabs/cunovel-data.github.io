It seems as though marks would only permit themselves to be swindled by men who appeared to be rich. A threadbare pinstripe might do for a sneak thief, but a confidence man had to come on strong if he wanted to score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he could bide his time. Tulsa wasn’t exactly the place he would choose for a vacation, but the telegram from Lou Farmer had indicated that Lou had a mark hanging fire in Denver that might be ripe any day. A trip to Miami or New York was out until the mark fell one way or the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron hauled himself up from the bed and stripped for a shower. He was thirty-five but in better physical shape than when he’d been twenty and working the short con in railway stations, grifting hard for ten bucks here and twenty bucks there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d come a long way in fifteen years. A grifter’s money went quickly, but Baron had a growing bank account in New York and a healthy stack of dough in the stock market. Not in the kind of wild moose pasture that he sold to the marks, but a solid mutual fund that grew steadily and paid a nice dividend. A few more heavy scores and he’d be able to lay off for the rest of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe toweled himself dry after the shower and shaved with a straight razor, applying a few drops of aftershave lotion and a few more of an expensive cologne that he liked. He dressed again, changing to a pair of charcoal slacks and a light brown cashmere sport jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe locked the suitcase and left it in the closet, not really worried that the lock would be broken. It didn’t matter if it was; the money was snug in the case’s false bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too early for dinner and he walked leisurely through downtown Tulsa. It was amazing, he thought to himself, the way the average guy never noticed what was happening. He spotted a cannon mob grifting the other side of the street, working their way through the pockets of passing shoppers. Baron picked out the hook easily and watched him work, dipping easily into a mark’s back pocket and passing the wallet to one of the other members of the mob in a second. Smooth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust for the hell of it he crossed the street at the end of the block and doubled back the other way. The cannons were moving toward him and he let one of the prat men bump him gently while he pretended to study the display in a shoe store. Only because he was concentrating was he able to feel the wire’s hand dip into his pocket, reaching for his wallet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron said: “Nix.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe half-whispered the word so that nobody but the wire would hear it. But the wire got the message. Instantly the hand was withdrawn and the wallet remained where it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron smiled to himself and moved on. Again the prat man jostled him, this time mumbling “sorry” under his breath. Baron’s smile widened. The thief was indicating he was sorry he had made Baron for a mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was always a source of pleasure to him the way a thief could communicate to another thief without a mark ever catching on. He and Farmer and the others in his outfit could talk over the head of a mark forever. And just the one word, “nix,” had put the cannon mob wise to who he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron glanced at his watch. It was 6:30 now and he was hungry. He walked to the curb and caught a cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take me to the best steakhouse in town,” he told the driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the restaurant he had a double shot of Jack Daniels on the rocks and a rare sirloin an inch and a half thick. He finished off with a pony of drambuie, inhaling the rich vapor of the cordial and enjoying the warm feeling as it trailed down his throat to his stomach. He paid the check and tipped the waiter generously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bought a paper at a corner newsstand and glanced at the entertainment page. There were only a few nightclubs in Tulsa and none of them seemed particularly appealing. How would he spend the evening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman would be pleasant. He considered taking the bellhop up on his offer but gave up the idea. Later, perhaps, but not tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead he caught a cab back to his hotel and wandered into the bar. He’d just have a few drinks and then catch a full night’s sleep. If there was a woman to be picked up he would pick her up, and if there wasn’t he wouldn’t be too disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the bar he took the furthest stool from the door and ordered a shot of Jack Daniels with a water chaser. He tossed off the shot and was lifting the glass of water to his lips when he spotted the blonde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw her before she saw him. She was tall, just a few inches shorter than he was. And her hair was long and golden. The plain black cocktail dress emphasized her high, full breasts and her long, tapered legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was good, too, except for a slightly hard look about it. Looks, he decided. Plenty of looks, but not a hell of a lot of class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomatically he wondered what angle she was working. She didn’t come on like a hustler, but it was a cinch she was pushing her looks in one way or another. He sipped the chaser and waited for her to make her play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t have long to wait. Her eyes surveyed the room rapidly and she walked directly to him, taking the seat beside him. She ordered a grasshopper and the bartender mixed the drink in a hurry and brought it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron paid for her drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” she said, smiling at him. “Are you with the convention?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “I’m working the C out of Philly,” he said, deciding to fill her in right away so she could save her time. If she was a pro she’d know enough to make her pitch straight instead of playing games; if she was in the rackets she would leave him alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t seem to have heard him. “I came down with my husband for the convention,” she said. “You know, the auto merchants are having this convention. It started yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My husband had this meeting tonight,” she said. “He won’t be back until one or two in the morning. It gets boring for a girl, just sitting alone in a room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled; she didn’t waste her time. He made her grift at once—it had to be the badger game the way she was planting her story. She would take him to her room and then her husband would come on with a gun, pretending to be furious. The hubby would threaten to kill him and settle for a cash settlement, and that would be that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she wasn’t being very smooth about it. She should pretend to be more reluctant and make him do a little more of the work. Otherwise the mark wouldn’t swallow the bait whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dick Baron,” he said. “I just got finished working the rag in Dallas.” Now she would have to realize he was in the know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she seemed totally oblivious to what he had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m lonely,” she said. “And I’ve got a bottle up in my room. Would you like to come up with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost broke out laughing. Now he had the whole picture. She was working the badger game, all right, but she wasn’t a professional at it. That’s why her approach was so lousy and why she was missing the lines he was throwing at her. She was a crook, but an amateur crook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if there was one thing Baron couldn’t stand it was an amateur crook. They didn’t know the ropes and all they did was make things rough for the smart boys. Here was this blonde now, working like a slave to con a con man. How dumb could you get?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” he said, deciding to play along. “Let’s go upstairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way to the elevator she took his arm, which was another mistake. She should let him do all the work—that way he’d believe she was a straight chick taking a first fling. It would make him hotter for her and at the same time scare him silly when her partner came on the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My name’s Sally English,” she said. “My husband and I are from Cedar Rapids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and she tightened her grip on his arm. “I suppose you think I’m a tramp,” she went on. “I’m not, not really. Don’t you think I’m a tramp?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you’re swell,” he said, thinking that anybody who made such a mess out of a simple badger dodge ought to starve to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never done this before,” she said. “I mean, pick up somebody I never met before and take him to my room. But I get so lonely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the elevator she leaned against him and he could feel the warmth of her flesh through the thin cocktail dress. Hell, maybe he’d wind up making it with her if he played it right. She might be dumb, but she was certainly built for action. The top of her head was inches from his nose and he could smell her perfume. It was cheap stuff and she used a little too much of it. But there was no denying that it increased his desire for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer room was on the floor beneath his. She led him inside and closed the door but didn’t turn the lock, explaining that her husband couldn’t possibly get home before one or two. Again, that was part of the pattern—but she shouldn’t have bothered with the explanation. She was being too damned obvious about the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fished around in the dresser and came up with a fifth of blended rye, pouring tumblers full for each of them. He wondered idly whether she might be working it solo, planning on drugging him and picking his pocket. It was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt any rate he had better things to do than swill cheap rye. When she wasn’t looking he emptied his glass on the rug beneath the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped his arm around her and she turned to him, fastening her mouth on his. He kissed her and her tongue probed his mouth. Even if she played the rest of it wrong she knew what to do once she was in the bedroom, he decided. That one kiss had been enough to make him ache with desire for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly she stood up and reached behind her to unzip the dress. He stood up and helped, noting with approval that she wasn’t wearing a bra. Everything under the dress was hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to draw in his breath. She had a superb body—firm and young and vibrantly alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, right on schedule, a key turned in the lock, the door opened, and hubby walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron was perfectly calm as he looked first at the man and then at the girl. The man should have had a gun; it would have made the situation more convincing. Outside of that the pair were effective actors. The girl was cringing against the wall. The man had fury blazing in his eyes and his hands were knotted into fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cut it,” Baron snapped, suddenly angry at the amateur quality of the whole thing. “It doesn’t work this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man advanced on him, swearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron decided he had had just about enough of the whole thing. Besides, he wanted the girl, wanted her as he hadn’t wanted a woman in a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe meant to have her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe met the man’s rush neatly, blocking a punch and countering with a right to the chest. The man sagged and Baron chopped him savagely on the side of the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a chop, properly done, kills a man. Baron had killed a man in just such a fashion several years back when he had to play it heavy for a change. This time he held back slightly with the blow. The man crumpled to the floor, alive but unconscious. He would remain unconscious for at least twenty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron turned to the girl. She was cowering against the wall, her eyes wide with terror that was quite probably genuine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t expect that, did you? You ought to learn to tell who’s a mark and who isn’t.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-night-stands-and-lost-weekends/page-4.html","bookId":2318,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM"}
