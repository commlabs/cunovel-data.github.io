{"id":94172,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u003cp\u003eWait here, Guen, \" Catti-brie whispered to the panther,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;both of whom stared at the wider area, a chamber rela\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tively clear of stalagmites, that loomed up ahead. Many goblin voices came from that chamber. Catti-brie guessed that this was the main host, probably growing nervous since their scouting party hadn\u0027t returned. Those few surviving gob\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;lins were likely coming fast behind her, the young woman knew. She and Guen had done a fine job in prodding them on their way,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;had sent them running in the opposite direction down the corridor,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but they likely had already turned about. And that fight had occurred less than an hour\u0027s hike from this spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no other apparent way around the chamber, and Catti-brie understood without even seeing the goblin horde that there were simply too many of the wretches to fight or scare off. She looked down to her ebon skinned hands one last time, took some comfort in their accurate drow appearance, then straightened her thick hair, showing stark white now instead of its normal auburn,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and plush robes, and defiantly strode forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closest goblin sentries fell back in terror as the drow priest\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ess casually entered their lair. Numbers alone kept the group from running off altogether, for, as Catti-brie had guessed, more than a hundred goblins were camped here. A dozen spears came up,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;angled in her direction, but she continued to walk steadily toward the center of the cavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoblins gathered all around the young woman, cutting off any retreat. Others crouched facing the tunnel from which Catti-brie had emerged, not knowing if other drow would come strolling through. Still, the sea of flesh parted before the unexpected visitor; Catti\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;brie\u0027s bravado and disguise had apparently put the creatures off their collective guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached the chamber\u0027s halfway point, could see the corridor continuing on across the way, but the sea closed around her, giving ground more slowly and forcing the woman turned drow to slow her pace as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she was stopped, goblin spears pointing her way from every direction, goblin whispers filling the room. \"Gund ha, moga moga, \" she demanded. Her command of the Goblin tongue was rudimentary at best, and she wasn\u0027t quite sure if she had said,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"move aside and let me pass, \" or \"move my mother into the ditch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hoped it was the former.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moga gund, geek ik moon\u0027ga\u0027woon\u0027ga!\" rasped one huge goblin,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;nearly as large as a man, and it shifted through the horde to stand right before Catti-brie. The young woman forced herself to remain calm, but a large part of her wanted to cry out for Guenhwyvar and run away, and a smaller part wanted to break out in laughter. This was obviously the goblin leader, or the tribe\u0027s shaman, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the creature needed a few fashion tips. It wore high black boots, like those of a nobleman, but with the sides cut out to allow for its wide, ducklike feet. A pair of women\u0027s pantaloons, ringed with wide frills, served as its breeches, and, though it was obviously male, the beast wore a woman\u0027s underpants and corset, as well,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;complete with cups for very ample breasts. Several mismatched necklaces, some gold, some silver, and one strand of pearls, circled its skinny neck, and a gaudy ring adorned every crooked finger. Catti-brie recognized the goblin\u0027s headdress as religious, though she wasn\u0027t quite certain of the sect. It resembled a sunburst trimmed with long gold ribbons, but Catti-brie was fairly sure that the goblin had it on backward, for it leaned forward over the ugly creature\u0027s sloping brow, one ribbon dangling annoyingly before the goblin\u0027s nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt, the goblin thought itself the height of thieving fash\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ion, dressed in the clothing of its tribe\u0027s unfortunate victims. It con\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tinued to ramble in its high pitched voice, too fast for Catti-brie to make out more than a single word here or there. Then the creature stopped, abruptly, and pounded a fist against its chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do ye speak the surface tongue?\" Catti-brie asked, trying to find some common ground. She fought hard to hold her nerve, but expected a spear to plunge into her back at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goblin leader regarded her curiously, apparently not under\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;standing a word she had said. It scanned the woman up and down,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;its red glowing eyes finally coming to rest on the locket that hung about Catti-brie\u0027s neck. \"Nying so, wucka, \" it remarked, and it pointed to the locket, then to Catti-brie, then swept its hand about to indicate the far exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad the locket been a normal piece of jewelry, Catti-brie will\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ingly would have given it over in exchange for passage, but she needed the magic item if she was to have any chance of locating Drizzt. The goblin repeated its demand, its tone more urgent, and the young woman knew that she had to think fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn sudden inspiration, she smiled and stuck an upraised finger before her. \"Nying, \" she said, thinking that to be the goblin word for gift. She clapped her hands sharply twice before her and called out,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Guenhwyvar!\" without looking back over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA startled cry from the goblins at the back end of the chamber told her that the panther was on its way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in with calm, Guen, \" Catti-brie called. \"Walk to me side without a fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe panther stalked slowly and steadily, head down and ears flattened. Every so often, Guenhwyvar let out a low growl, just to keep the closest goblins on their heels. The crowd parted widely,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;giving the magnificent cat a large open path to the drow priestess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Guenhwyvar was at Catti-brie\u0027s side, nuzzling the woman\u0027s hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nying, \" Catti-brie said again, pointing from the panther to the goblin. \"Ye take the cat and I walk out the passage, \" she added,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;motioning as best she could with her hands to convey the message. The ugly goblin fashion king scratched its head, shifting the head\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;piece awkwardly to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, go over and make nice, \" Catti-brie whispered to Guen\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;hwyvar. She pushed the cat away with her leg. The panther looked up to her, seemed more than a little annoyed by it all, then padded over to the goblin leader and plopped down at its feet (and the blood drained from the monster\u0027s face!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nying, \" Catti-brie said again, motioning that the goblin should reach down and pet the cat. The creature eyed her incredulously, but gradually, with her coaxing, the goblin mustered the nerve to touch the cat\u0027s thick fur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goblin\u0027s pointy toothed smile widened, and it dared to touch the cat again, more solidly. Again it dipped, and again, and each stroke went more firmly over the panther\u0027s back. Through it all, Guenhwyvar leveled a withering stare at Catti-brie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, ye\u0027re to stay here with this friendly goblin, \" Catti-brie instructed the cat, making sure that her tones did not give away her true meaning. She patted her belt pouch, the one holding the fig\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;urine, and added, \"I\u0027ll be calling ye, don\u0027t ye doubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Catti-brie straightened and faced the goblin leader squarely. She slapped a hand against her chest, then snapped it straight out and pointed to the far exit, her expression a scowl. \"I go!\" she declared and took a step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, the goblin leader seemed as though it would move to hinder her, but a quick glance to the powerful cat at its feet changed the creature\u0027s mind. Catti-brie had played the game perfectly; she had allowed the overly proud goblin leader to retain its dignity, had kept herself appearing as a potentially dangerous enemy, and had strategically placed six hundred pounds of fighting ally right at the goblin leader\u0027s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nying so, wucka, \" the goblin said again, pointing to Guenhwy\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;var, then to the far exit, and it gingerly stepped aside so that the drow could pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie swept across the rest of the chamber, backhand slap\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ping one goblin that didn\u0027t get far enough out of her path. The crea\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ture came right back at her, sword raised, but Catti-brie didn\u0027t flinch, and a cry from the goblin leader, still with the panther curled about its ankles, stopped the goblin\u0027s response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie laughed in its ugly face, showed it that she held her own dagger, a magnificent, jeweled thing, ready under the folds of her beautiful robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made it to the narrower tunnel and continued walking slowly for many steps. Then she stopped, glanced back, and pulled out the panther figurine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the chamber, the goblin leader was showing off its new acquisition to the tribe, explaining how it had outsmarted a \"stupid drow female thing, \" and had taken the cat as its own. It didn\u0027t mat\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ter that the other goblins had witnessed the whole affair; in goblin culture, history was recreated almost daily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leader\u0027s smug smile waned quickly when a gray mist rose up about the panther, and the cat\u0027s material form began to melt away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goblin wailed a stream of protests and curses and dropped to its knees to grab the fast fading cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge paw shot out of the mist, hooked around the leader\u0027s head, and yanked the wretch in. Then there was only mist, the sur\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;prised and not too smart goblin leader going along with the pan\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ther on a ride to the Astral Plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remaining goblins hooted and ran all about, bumping into and falling over each other. Some thought to take up the chase for the departing drow, but by the time they began to organize, Catti\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;brie was long gone, running with all speed along the corridor and thinking herself positively clever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnels were familiar to him, too familiar. How many times had young Drizzt Do\u0027Urden traveled these ways, usually serving as the point in a drow patrol? Then he had Guenhwyvar with him; now he was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe limped slightly, one of his knees still a bit weak from the svirfneblin nooker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t use that as an excuse to remain in Blingdenstone any longer, though. He knew that his business was pressing, and Belwar, though the parting stung the burrow warden, had not argued with Drizzt\u0027s decision to be on his way, an indication to Drizzt that the other svirfnebli wished him gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been two days ago, two days and about fifty miles of winding caverns. Drizzt had crossed the trails of at least three drow patrols on his way, an unusually high number of warriors to be out so far from Menzoberranzan, and that led credence to Belwar\u0027s claim that something dangerous was brewing, that the Spider Queen was hungry. On all three of those occasions, Drizzt could have tracked down the drow group and attempted to link up. He thought of concocting some story that he was an emissary from a merchant of Ched Nasad. All three times, Drizzt had lost his nerve,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;had kept moving instead toward Menzoberranzan, putting off that fateful moment when he would make contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the tunnels were too familiar, and that moment was nearly upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe measured every step, maintaining perfect silence, as he crossed into one wider way. He heard some noise up ahead, a shuffle of many feet. Not drow feet, he knew; dark elves made no noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger scaled the uneven wall and moved along a ledge half a dozen feet up from the main floor. Sometimes he found him\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;self grasping with fingertips and pulling himself forward, his feet dangling, but Drizzt was not hindered, and he did not make a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe froze in place at the din of more movement ahead. Fortu\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;nately, the ledge widened once more, freeing his hands, and he gin\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;gerly slipped his scimitars free of their sheaths, concentrating to keep Twinkle from flaring with inner light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlurping sounds led him around a bend, where he viewed a host of short, huddled humanoids, wearing ragged cloaks with cowls pulled over their faces. They spoke not at all, but milled about aimlessly, and only their floppy feet showed Drizzt that they were goblins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoblin slaves, he knew by their movements, by their slumped posture, for only slaves carried such a weight of broken resignation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt continued to watch silently for a while, trying to spot the herding drow. There were at least four score goblins in this cavern,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;lining the edge of a small pond that the drow called Heldaeyn\u0027s Pool, scooping water up under their low pulled cowls as though they had not drunk in many days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey probably had not. Drizzt spotted a couple of rothe, small Underdark cattle, milling nearby, and he realized that this group probably was out of the city in search of the missing creatures. On such trips, slaves were given little or nothing to eat, though they carried quite a bit of supplies. The accompanying drow guards,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;though, ate handsomely, usually right in front of their starving slaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crack of a whip brought the goblins back to their feet and shuffling back from the pool\u0027s edge. Two drow soldiers, one male,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;one female, came into Drizzt\u0027s view. They talked casually, the female every so often cracking her whip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother drow called out some commands from the other side of the cavern, and the goblins began to fall into a rough line, more of an elongated huddle than any organized formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt knew that the most opportune moment was upon him. Slavers were among the least organized and least regimented of Menzoberranzan\u0027s extracity bands. Any slaver contingent usually comprised dark elves from several different houses and a comple\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ment of young drow students from each of the Academy\u0027s three schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt quietly slipped down from the ledge and walked around the jutting wall, flashing the customary hand signal greetings (though his fingers felt awkward going through the intricate rou\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tine) to the drow in the cavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female pushed her male escort forward and stepped to the side behind him. Immediately the male\u0027s hand came up, holding one of the typical drow hand crossbows, its dart coated, most likely,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;with a powerful sleeping potion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho are you? the female\u0027s hand asked over the male\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All that is left of a patrol group that ventured near Blingden\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;stone, \" Drizzt answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should go in near Tier Breche, then, \" the female answered aloud. Hearing her voice, so typical of drow females, voices that could be incredibly melodic or incredibly shrill, sent Drizzt\u0027s thoughts cascading back to those long years past. He realized then,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;fully, that he was just a few hundred yards from Menzoberranzan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not wish to \u0027go in\u0027 at all, \" Drizzt answered. \"At least, not announced.\" The reasoning made perfect sense, Drizzt knew. If he had indeed been the only survivor of a lost patrol, he would have been vigorously interrogated at the drow Academy, probably even tortured until the masters were certain that he played no treacher\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ous role in the patrol\u0027s fate, or until he died, whichever came first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is the first house?\" the female asked, her eyes locked on Drizzt\u0027s lavender glowing orbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baenre, \" Drizzt answered immediately, expecting the test. Spying dark elves from rival cities were not unknown in Menzober\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ranzan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their youngest son?\" the female asked slyly. She curled her lips up in a lewd and hungry smile, Drizzt realized as she continued to stare deeply into his unusual eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy fortunate coincidence, Drizzt had attended the Academy in the same class as House Baenre\u0027s youngest son, as long as ancient Matron Baenre had not reared another child in the three decades Drizzt had been gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Berg\u0027inyon, \" he answered confidently, dropping his hands in a cocky cross at his belt (and putting them near his scimitars).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" the female asked again, and she licked her lips,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;obviously intrigued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one who matters, \" Drizzt replied, and he matched her smile and the intensity of her stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female patted her blocking male on the shoulder and her fingers mOtioned for him to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm Ito be off this miserable duty? he responded silently with his hands, a hopeful expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bol will take your place this day, \" the female purred,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;labeling Drizzt with the drow word that described something mysterious or intriguing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male smiled widely and moved to put his hand crossbow away. Noticing that it was cocked and ready, and looking up to take note that a whole herd of goblins stood nearby, he widened his smile instead and lifted the weapon to fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt offered no reaction, though it pained him to see even goblins treated so miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, \" the female said, putting her hand over the male\u0027s wrist. She reached up and removed the dart from the hand crossbow, then replaced it with another. \"Yours would put the creature to sleep, \" she explained, and she cackled in laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male considered her for just a moment, then apparently caught on. He took aim at a goblin loitering near the water\u0027s edge and fired. The goblin jerked as the small dart jabbed into its back. It started to turn about, but toppled instead, into the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt gnawed at his lips, understanding, by the goblin\u0027s futile flopping, that the dart the female had supplied was coated with a paralyzing potion, one that left the doomed creature fully conscious. The goblin had little control of its limbs and would surely drown,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and, worse, it would know its cruel fate. It managed to arch its back enough so that its face came above the water level, but Drizzt knew that it would tire long before the wicked potion expired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male laughed heartily, replaced the hand crossbow in its small holster, which lay diagonally across his lower chest, and walked off down the tunnel to Drizzt\u0027s left. Before he had gone even a dozen steps, the female began cracking her whip and called for the few drow guards to get the caravan moving, down the tunnel to the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, she turned a cold glare on Drizzt. \"Why are you standing there?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt pointed to the goblin in the pool, floundering badly now,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;barely able to keep its mouth out of the water. He managed a laugh,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;as if he was enjoying the macabre spectacle, but he seriously consid\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;ered rushing over and cutting the evil female down at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the way out of the small cavern, Drizzt looked for opportu\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;nities to get over to the goblin, to pull the creature out of the water so that it would have a chance to get away. The female drow never stopped eyeing him, though, not for an instant, and Drizzt under\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;stood that she had more on her mind than simply including him in the slave caravan. After all, why hadn\u0027t she taken the break when the new slaver unexpectedly arrived?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dying goblin\u0027s last splashes followed Drizzt out of that place. The renegade drow swallowed hard and fought away his revulsion. No matter how many times he witnessed it, he would never get used to the brutality of his kin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Drizzt was glad of that. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/starless-night-legacy-of-the-drow-2/page-15.html","bookId":2128,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:02 PM"}
