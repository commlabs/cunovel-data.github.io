I was certain it had very little to do with John the Baptist and more to do with Mike the asshole, but I let the painting be the reason I was overwhelmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce looked down on me with a soft smile. He wiped my tear. I smiled back, \"Thank you for showing me this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"No, thank you.\" He pointed, \"Do you want to see another amazing one? The ability of the painter is remarkable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. He pulled me gently to a dark painting with a man lost in his own reflection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Narcissus.\" I read. It was older than the one before. It looked as if it was mocking vanity maybe, like the man was stuck staring at himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked, not speaking, just taking everything in. There was a stone archway that looked like a reproduction, sculptures, paintings, and carvings. They started to blend into each other until we reached the tapestries. They were like rugs held on looms high in the air. The art made of thread was impressive in both size and detail. I felt like a different person with Luce. Someone who could be quiet inside of herself and just appreciate the things around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe linked our fingers into each other\u0027s at some point, walking like lovers in Rome, people we weren’t. He pulled me out another door to a long corridor of arches. It was so big, and yet, ornate. I felt like I could be that backpacking student who was seeing everything before her life started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked us to a column and pressed my back against it, looking down on me. My heart was in my throat. He ran a hand down my cheek, \"You are so beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed hard, \"I can\u0027t do this. I\u0027m so sorry, Luce. I am still recovering from something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"France?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s engaged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at his waist, \"I know. I made a mistake coming here. My sister and his best friend back home, they bought me the ticket to come see him and set it up. I didn’t know he was engaged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted my chin, \"You deserve someone so much better than a man who would even look at a gold digger like Daniela.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"I think I drove him to Daniela, unfortunately. France is the greatest guy in the world, but he makes terrible choices when he\u0027s upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce smiled, \"We will get a gelato and you will tell me this terrible story of the breaking of Mike France.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"Deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI linked my arm into his and pointed at the pillars, \"If we\u0027re both still single in six months, can I get a rain check for that pillar kiss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, \"Yes. But I don’t think I can wait six months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed harder, feeling the blush taking over my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunday Night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela passed me a hot chocolate, which to Italians is a thick and delightful thing you dip your biscotti into. You didn’t drink it, so much as savor it, with baked goods. She dumped some Frangelico into both our small cups and winked at me, \"It\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turned out, it was pretty hard to dislike her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sweet. I saw the money grubbing she did, but she was no different than the girls I had always hung out with. She was like a soul sister to me, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy life had been spent in pursuit of a man to marry me and buy me expensive things and get me into the right circles—oh and love me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela looked excited as we waited for the teams to hit the ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you watch a lot of hockey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"No. Not so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned, \"But you\u0027re American.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"I\u0027m more of an after-party sort of girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, \"The after-parties are fun. That is where I met Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced, \"Yikes. They are usually pretty nasty. One time when Mike and I were about nineteen, he came home for Christmas from wherever the hell he was. We went to a party and one of the guys he was teammates with, came up and asked me to take his wife out for a smoke. I smoked at the time. So I asked her to come with me. She was excited someone was even talking to her. I had my smoke and she got into a conversation with another girl. I left her there on the deck and went back inside to go to the washroom. I opened the door to find her husband screwing some random chick in the washroom. I closed the door and went back out onto the deck. He came out about twenty minutes later and wrapped his arm around her, like nothing had happened. I learned then, the difference between puck fucks and wives. I also lost a lot of respect for the players.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dipped my biscotti and took a bite. She looked disturbed, \"That doesn’t happen now though?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"It happens every day. Why do you think there are so many divorces with sports players? They are surrounded by adoring fans who want to give them everything and anything they could possibly want.\" I wrinkled my nose, \"That\u0027s why Mike is still single. His best friend Will is the same. He won\u0027t marry until he knows he is almost done with the game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed hard. I felt the tiniest bit of remorse, but it was washed down with the delicious biscotti and the vision of the players as they skated out onto the ice. They looked sexy in their gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anthems were sung and the announcer got the game going. The puck dropped and it was on. I didn’t realize how much I did enjoy watching hockey until it was the second period. I was out of my seat screaming as Mike was on a breakaway. He scored. Daniela and I hugged each other and jumped up and down in our heeled boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game ended with a win, Italy over Germany 6—3. We waited in the seats for a few minutes. The game was over and the box was quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally touched my hand, \"I want you to know I love him. I know he is like a brother to you, and you watch out for him and worry. But you don’t have to. I adore him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, it was the fake plastic one my mom taught me, \"I\u0027m glad.\" I wasn’t. I was dying inside, but he had chosen to be with her, even when I had professed my love for him. Even when I had flown to Rome. Even when he saw the sash and knew the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had chosen her, and if I wanted him to still be my France, I had to accept his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood, \"We can wait downstairs in the heat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe box we were in was warm enough, but I could sense the awkwardness coming from us both and agreed. We walked with only the sound of our heels clicking on the floor. I had bought myself boots with Luce. He had showed me where the Italians buy their footwear, all designer but discounted. I had gotten a pair of grey A. Testoni platform, knee-high boots for three hundred euros. It was a steal. The pair I had gotten the last time I was in Rome had cost me eight hundred. They were a mixture of leather and suede.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela nodded at them when we got downstairs, \"Those are beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"Thanks. I went shopping with Luce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled wide, \"He is a beautiful man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Yikes. He is trouble, I can tell. Smooth and sweet and dresses well. He scored three of the goals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to Boston to play too. When the owners came to speak with Michael, they saw him play. Offered him a huge contract too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, \"How old is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip, \"Oh.\" He was four years younger than I was. \"I wonder why he never got scouted when he was young?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened, \"He was in a terrible accident. He has a huge scar on his leg. He was in rehab for it for two years. He was drafted as a young man, but he never made it to America. Now he\u0027s older and still playing just as well, if not better. They want him now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"That facial hair and confidence definitely make him look older.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nudged me, \"He is not too young for you. Besides, that is an Italian way. Older woman, younger man. Very common.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could count the days to my 29th birthday. Five years older. What was I thinking? She had me distracted from France. She was good. Too good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to hate her and destroy her, but I couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group of the foreigners came from the dressing room together. They had to stop and sign autographs. Girls were crying and kissing cheeks and making a spectacle. Daniela tried to look stoic, but I could see the annoyance on her face. I had created the doubt that now sat in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance came over to us, looking confused. Daniela wrapped her arms around him. He hugged her to him, but I could see the way he wasn’t all in. He was half-assing the hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTex grinned at me, \"Ready to drink some wine, Jack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance made a face but I ignored him and nodded, \"I am if you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce walked up, inspecting my boots, \"They look lovely.\" I almost melted into his green eyes. I nodded, \"Thanks for helping me pick them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut Tex off and looped my arm into his, \"Tell me about this obsession you have with wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him lead me out to the cab. Some of the Italians on the team were joining our group suddenly. Tex nudged me, \"We invited the team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance sighed, \"Red wine tasting as our after-party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela poked him, \"I think it\u0027s a marvelous idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced down at her, maybe catching the glare of doubt in her eyes, and shrugged, \"Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got to the hotel, Romeo had a magnificent spread. He had red wines, white wines, and blush wines set up at three separate tables. He was grinning from ear to ear as we walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Croix, welcome to our wine tasting. I have selected, what we here at the Boscolo Aleph, consider our best wines. Some are top shelf and others are surprisingly good for their cost level and popularity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a member of the hotel staff at each table to pour the wine and discuss it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela\u0027s face was glowing, \"This is a smart after-party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance glared at me, \"Leave it to you to wreck my last night with the guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuck my tongue out at him, \"We aren’t even close to even.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce was hovering over me, \"Which should I taste first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my back on France and took Luce\u0027s arm, \"White.\" We strolled over to the table to taste the best whites I had ever had. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-24.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
