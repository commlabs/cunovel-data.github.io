But two slayers from Georgia came to help us out until we’ve rebuilt our team.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while, I’d thought the zombie problem existed only in my home state of Alabama. I’d since learned differently. There were zombies all over the world. Slayers, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should have shared this info long before now. You are such a pain, Coleslaw,” I said. Better, but that nickname wasn’t the winner, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but I’m your pain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, my irritation drained away. How did he do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does Mr. Ankh know you’re here?” Since my grandfather had died and my grandparents’ house had been torched, Nana and I had moved in with Mr. Ankh and his daughter, Reeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Ankh—Dr. Ankh to everyone outside his circle of trust—knew about the zombies and did all the medical work on the slayers. Reeve had no idea what was going on, and we were supposed to keep her in the dark. Or else. Her father wanted her to have as normal a life as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was normal, exactly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I gave Ankh’s security the finger,” Cole said with a twinge of pride. “He would feel the need to tell your grandmother, and I don’t want to be kicked out and have to sneak back in. I just want to be with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re planning to stay here all night and hold me, Coley Guacamole?” Ugh. I shouldn’t have gone there. That one reeked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe barked out a laugh. “I liked King Cole better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not actually a surprise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It just fits me so well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure you think so.” I gave a gentle tug on his nipple ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I doubt I’m the only one. And yes, I’m staying.” He curled his fingers over mine, pried my grip loose and brought my knuckles to his mouth for a kiss. A second later, there was a flash of panic in his eyes. One I didn’t understand and must have misread. Because he said, “Just so you know, you can call me anything you want—just as long as you always call me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Your Mark...Get Set...STOP!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up alone, drenched in sweat and gasping for breath, another dream of the accident hovering at the back of my mind. I’d seen my mother reaching for me. Felt the unusual heat of her touch. Heard her yell at me. Then I’d watched as the zombies finished eating my dad, glided to our car and jerked her out, ready for dessert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d fought against their hold, her expression panicked. She’d called my name again. “Alice! Alice!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d struggled to reach her, begging the creatures not to hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I wanted to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was I seeing this? It hadn’t happened. Not really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I woken up in the car and just didn’t remember? Could this be my mind’s way of reminding me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom had ended up outside, next to my dad, even though she’d been in the car when I’d lost consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cole,” I said, patting the space next to me. I needed his arms around me, strong and sure. He would comfort me, whatever the answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mattress was disappointingly cold. He was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought...yeah, I remembered hearing him speak to me before he’d taken off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m supposed to believe you? Just like that,” he’d said, his tone angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he hadn’t been speaking to me. There’d been a tense pause before he’d snapped, “Stop calling me, Justin. I told you a long time ago I’m done with you. There’s nothing you can do or say to change that.” Another crackling pause. “No, I don’t want to hear the info you’ve got.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew of only one Justin. Either Cole had been on the phone with a boy he’d sworn never to speak with again, or my mind had played tricks on me. Right now I wasn’t exactly in a mind-trusting mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGingerly I sat up to gaze around the room. Bright sunlight slanted through the window. The ice-blue comforter draping the four-poster bed was wrinkled, and one of the pillows was stained with flecks of black from Cole’s face paint. Oops. I’d have to clean that off before I left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis weapons were no longer piled on the floor, and neither were his clothes. In fact, the only other sign that he’d been here was the note on my nightstand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m at the gym. Call me and I’ll come for you. X C\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumming with sudden happiness, I brushed my teeth, showered and dressed in my winter workout clothes. I dialed his cell, and...went straight to voice mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m awake and ready,” I said. “You can come get me anytime.” I didn’t have a car. Or a license. Only a permit. If I didn’t hear from him soon, I’d walk. The gym was at a barn a few miles away. “I hope you’re prepared to have your butt handed to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I hung up, I noticed there were eleven texts waiting for me. All from my best friend, Kat. I grinned as I read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne: Frosty SUCKS!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo: Have I mentioned Frosty sucks it raw??\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree: How do U feel about murder? 4 or against?? Before U answer, know that I have good reason!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour: If 4, do U know good place 2 hide body??\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest described the many ways she’d like to kill him. My favorite involved a bag of Skittles and a silk scarf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMmm. Skittles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach rumbled, and I set my phone on the nightstand. I’d call Kat after breakfast, when she was more likely to be awake and I was more likely to be lucid, and find out what happened. There was a good chance Frosty had simply failed to call her after the fight last night, and she’d worried. I wasn’t sure how to comfort her about that. She’d made it clear the zombies weren’t a topic of conversation she welcomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, though, I cleaned every inch of my room. I refused to let Mr. Ankh’s housekeeper do it for me. I wasn’t a sponge and wasn’t going to take anything for granted. I was determined to give back, somehow. Thankfully, water and hand soap removed the paint from the pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma’s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned, and oh, glory, there she was. My eight-year-old sister. Her spirit anyway. What she’d taught me: death is never the end. “You’re here,” I said, my heart soaring. She’d visited me before, but every time felt like the first time—shocking and unreal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at me, and I wanted so badly to hug her close and never let go. “I only have a moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore the clothes she’d died in: a pink leotard and tutu. The dark hair she’d inherited from our mother was pulled into two pigtails, swinging over her delicate shoulders. Golden eyes that had always watched me with adoration were bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d once told me she wasn’t a ghost, but a witness. Ghosts—not that they existed—were spirits of the dead that retained their memories and haunted. A myth probably born from zombie sightings. Witnesses were spirits that aided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to warn you that you’ll be seeing less of me,” she said, the smile slipping. “Visiting you is becoming more difficult. But. If you call for me, I will find a way to reach you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More difficult how?” I asked, concerned for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My tie to this world is fading.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what that meant. One day I was going to lose her for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be sad,” she said. “I hate when you’re sad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced my features to brighten. “No matter what, I’ll know you’re out there, watching over me. There’s no reason to be sad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly.” Beaming, she blew me a kiss. “I love you. And seriously, don’t forget to call for me if you need me.” Then she was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy features fell and, I was sure, dimmed. I could have curled into a ball and cried, but I refused to let myself worry about any tomorrows without her. I’d deal with her loss when it came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling my hair into a ponytail, I headed to the kitchen. I expected to find the housekeeper. Instead I found Reeve, Nana and Kat seated at the table, sipping from steaming mugs of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—something’s going on,” Reeve was saying, twining a lock of dark hair around her finger. “Dad put more security cameras in both the front and backyard—and we already had a thousand to begin with! Worse, he’s put up so many lamps, my blackout curtains are no longer able to do their job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNana and Kat shifted uncomfortably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has he said anything to either of you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well...” Nana hedged. She moved her gaze through the room, as if hoping a distraction would present itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali! You’re out of bed a week early.” Her chair skidded behind her as she stood. She closed the distance between us and drew me in for a hug. “I’m not sure I approve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat buffed her nails and smiled, not looking at all like a girl on the verge of committing a violent crime. She did look tired, though. There were dark circles under her eyes, and her cheeks were hollowed, as if she hadn’t eaten in days. “I would have been up two weeks early, but we can’t all have my amazing bounce-back, can we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed Nana’s cheek and returned Kat’s smile. The girl had a healthy (and justifiable) ego and wasn’t afraid to show it. Me? I’d always been the girl with her head ducked as she questioned her worth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d faced death and won, I reminded myself—I should probably get over that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut...just then, I kind of thought Kat was using her ego as a shield to hide her physical weakness. She suffered from degenerative kidney disease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here?” I asked her. “Not that I’m not thrilled to see you. I so am.” More than thrilled, actually. From the very beginning, she’d never cared what I looked like or how socially awkward I could be. She’d just accepted me and rolled. “I thought you preferred to sleep till two on weekends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I came to see you, naughty girl that you are. You never answer your phone or respond to my mind-blowing texts anymore. My plan was to lecture you until you promised to have your phone surgically attached to your hand, but I decided to have some coffee first.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-zombie-glass-white-rabbit-chronicles-2/page-3.html","bookId":2521,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:05 PM"}
