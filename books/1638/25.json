Blood sprayed and hit the floor as Diego collapsed, clutching the wound with a look of shock on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado leapt over to Diego as he shot at Bonifacio, who ducked out into the corridor and ran for cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado waved the gun at the bodyguards. \"Back up. Back up.\" They were hired help -- their hearts weren\u0027t into the idea of a close-range shoot-out, luckily. Only Bonifacio was insane enough to fire inside a damn spaceship, Delgado thought. He grabbed Diego\u0027s collar and pulled him out of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekitchen and down the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonifacio fired down at him from the cockpit, the bullets sparking off the metal bulkheads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado fired back as he dragged Diego to the airlock. This was all messed up. Very messed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego moaned as Delgado pulled him into the lock and cycled into the habitat\u0027s lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA very loud bang startled him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airlock seal broke as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistancia abruptly cut loose, her engines firing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAir whistled out of cracks in the warped airlock. Red alarm lights blinked, and Delgado kicked at the door leading into the habitat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wouldn\u0027t open, of course -- with the outer seal broken emergency systems had kicked in. As long as the simple sensors on the outside detected loss of air the inner door was locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado grabbed the emergency phone, and got Bonifacio\u0027s voice. \"I just used an emergency Security Council code to override communications from your airlock,\" Bonifacio said flatly. \"And I canceled the airlock\u0027s alarm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strobing lights shut off. It would look like a false trigger.

Almost as good as a bullet, Delgado thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down next to Diego, holding a hand to his chest. Diego stared up at the ceiling, his breathing irregular and gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Diego,\" Delgado said, looking down at his old friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego bubbled blood up from his mouth, but said nothing. Delgado closed his eyes and bit his lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready the air seemed to be getting thinner. Delgado lay down, breathing shallowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he reached down into his right shoe and tugged out the small beacon Adriana had given him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado opened the casing and pressed the red switch. A small green light flickered on, and started pulsating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter THIRTY-SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMETISETTE ORBIT, 23 LIBRAE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReth lay curled up on the uncomfortable slab, thinking about the warmth and closeness of a Kig-Yar nest, and how far away such things were from him at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurt everywhere, thanks to his treatment by the Sangheili.

Little different from the Jiralhanae and their violent approaches to everything in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon the Prophets would listen to all Kig-Yar, Reth thought.

Things were so close to being finished. Soon his human agent would have the location to Earth for him. Once Reth had that, then the army of Unggoy he\u0027d gathered on Metisette would be ready to be unleashed on the Rubble. The asteroids would make wonderful Kig-Yar nesting grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unggoy, where are you? You must attend me. Are you not believers in the mission the Prophet of Truth himself gave to me, and thus to you?\" Reth collapsed to the ground in front of the energy bars that kept him jailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he had the Rubble, he thought through a haze, and the location to Earth, the humans\u0027 Exodus Project would provide him the vehicle he needed to then bring the Unggoy to attack the human homeworld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA daring plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Kig-Yar plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA plan the Prophet of Truth had agreed to when Reth presented it after returning with the secret of the Rubble and the humans\u0027 desire to trade. He\u0027d kept it a secret from his own Shipmistress, a violation that would have gotten him castrated if found out, but it had paid off handsomely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unggoy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they\u0027d been discovered, the Jiralhanae were returning to broadcast the news about the discovery of the Rubble to a different Prophet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kig-Yar couldn\u0027t stop them. But they could move the plan up, so that they wouldn\u0027t look like traitors, trading with the humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it was time to destroy the humans and their homeworld and show the Prophets that it was the Kig-Yar, not the Sangheili or Jiralhanae, who were the most cunning and loyal and holy subjects of the Covenant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shuffling steps of two furtive Unggoy soldiers got Reth to focus on the ground in front of his long face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sangheili kills us if we release you,\" one of the Unggoy protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ll risk your chance at joining in the Great Journey because you\u0027re scared of these Sangheili,\" Reth hissed. His ribs hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Unggoy shuffled their feet again, methane snorting out from their masks as they looked back and forth at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you risk the Sangheili destroying the Redoubt, and all you\u0027ve built on Metisette?\" Reth asked. \"Will you see all the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnggoy on that planet punished, when they\u0027ve been following the right Path?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey glanced at each other again. \"Our nipple brothers would be all killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Unggoy sucked food from a shared tube, a nipple, Reth remembered. \"Yes, your nipple brothers would all die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was enough to get them to free him. One of the Unggoy tapped at the controls for Reth\u0027s cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReth smiled as the energy bars disappeared. He rolled out of the cell before the Unggoy changed their minds. \"Quick, you must help me escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two Unggoy grabbed him under his arms as he wobbled, prompting Reth to grunt in pain. Together, all three hobbled down the corridor until Reth had them stop near a service panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sangheili may have taken the ship by force, and cowed the Unggoy, but Reth still had some tricks of his own. He shut down the ship\u0027s computer system with an override password.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the Sangheili raced to reboot the system, he had the Unggoy drag him to an escape pod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes later the cylindrical pod shot out of the ship, veering back toward Metisette at top speed, as the Sangheili coasted with a dead ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time, Reth thought bitterly while rooting around the pod for a medical kit, to show the Sangheili that Kig-Yar could fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter THIRTY\u0026gt;SEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE RUBBLE, 23 LIBRAE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike flew the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetya through the Rubble, flipping the ship end over end for sudden deceleration, and weaving his way around docking tubes and asteroids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the confines of the airlock, braced against Mike\u0027s radical maneuvers, Jai swore. \"I don\u0027t see why\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m in the airlock for the quick rescue, Adriana. He\u0027s your pet Insurrectionist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shove it,\" Adriana muttered over the suit radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai stiffened. \"Is that how you talk to rank?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When rank stops whining I\u0027ll modify my behavior,\" Adriana said. \"Besides, I need to be in the medical bay in case Delgado\u0027s hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we\u0027re trusting an Insurrectionist AI and rushing to help an Insurrectionist. You see anything wrong with this?\" Jai asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother voice crackled in his ear. The AI. Juliana. \"Technically the Rubble is a collection of people with many different backgrounds. Only a small percentage of them are actually Insurrectionist as you understand it -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can it,\" Jai muttered, as Mike flipped the ship again, making his stomach lurch. Mike fired the engines to dodge docking tubes. \"Anything new about Delgado?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The airlock the signal emanated from is still throwing me error codes from the broken seal,\" Juliana reported. \"You\u0027re still the closest ship. An emergency crew is outside the lock on the habitat side, but can\u0027t get at it, of course. I\u0027ve broken the communications block on the airlock, but no one inside is responding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai thought about that. A broken airlock and silence. \"Doesn\u0027t sound too promising.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Juliana replied. \"It doesn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coming in on the lock,\" Mike shouted. Jai felt the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetya shudder like it never had before, and he was pressed against the side of the airlock despite the artificial gravity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was glad he wasn\u0027t looking at this from the cockpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMetal ground on metal as Mike forced the wrecked airlock against theirs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re go on your command,\" Mike reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai faced the thick metal door with its yellow stripes and red warning symbols and notices. \"Do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airlock sprung open with a gust of air. Then the habitat\u0027s airlock ground open with a tiny puff of air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai forced his way through the moment the gap was large enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo men lay on the floor of the airlock\u0027s nonslip metal surface. Delgado, a gun in one hand and the other bloody, lay over the stomach of a man with a bad chest wound. Blood pooled the floor around them, freezing as the vacuum sucked air and warmth out even faster now that a bad seal was in place between ship and habitat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai threw Delgado over a shoulder of his gray MJOLNIR armor, and picked up the other body as gently as possible, aware that he could be making the chest wound worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cycled through back into the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetya, thudding his way past bulkheads into the tiny cramped offshoot to the crew quarters where Adriana stood ready by a large metal table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up. \"Two? Who\u0027s the other one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuliana flickered into being over a nearby shelf. \"That\u0027s Diego Esquival.\" Her voice sounded muted, as if she were shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdriana shook her head as she checked him over, while Jai held him in his arms still. \"He\u0027s dead.\" She pulled Delgado off Jai\u0027s shoulder and set him on the table. \"But Delgado\u0027s got a pulse. Store the other man into one of the cryogenic pods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai walked Diego\u0027s body around the table and to one of the three pods. Once he set it down and closed the lid, the automated systems kicked in. Diego was frozen in his last minute, for all the good it did him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he turned around, Adriana had an oxygen mask on Delgado and the computers reading his vitals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado stirred and opened his eyes, the oxygen taking effect. He tried to sit up, but Adriana put a hand on his chest to keep him in place. \"You\u0027re back on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetya,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diego?\" Delgado groaned, looking around. \"What about Diego?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai and Adriana glanced at each other, and Delgado saw it. He seemed to fall back in on himself, shaking his head and looking off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn that bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What bastard?\" Juliana asked from the corner of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado twisted to see her better, and his mouth fell open. \"You!\" Warring emotions crossed his face. Jai figured the man had wondered if the AI was not to be trusted, but that the revelation still caught Delgado off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, me.\" Juliana grinned. The hologram folded its arms. \"What happened, Delgado?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonifacio happened.\" Delgado all but spit the name out. \"He took\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistancia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also shot Diego.\" Delgado bit his lip, and slowly sat, holding his knees to do it with a grunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew Bonifacio was a sketchy man. I have watched him smuggle things into the Rubble. I know of ten different caches he uses. He\u0027s definitely running those covenant guns to the colonies. He campaigned hard for that Security Council spot,\" Juliana said as Adriana and Jai watched the exchange. \"But to do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado looked at the AI. \"We have to catch him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not even trying to run,\" Juliana said. \"Your ship is slowly coasting through the Rubble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonifacio thinks I\u0027m dead. He\u0027s taking his time, so he doesn\u0027t alarm anyone.\" The group looked at each other, and Delgado caught the glances. He raised his voice. \"Oh come on, I would not have done this. Why the hell would I risk my life to break an airlock? And do you think I shot Maria\u0027s brother? Re-ally?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai tapped the table. \"Juliana, he makes a good point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado turned around to him. \"And since when are you and the Rubble\u0027s AI all working together? When the hell did that start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the Jackals started getting too close to the data,\" Jai said, staring Delgado down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuliana was quiet, her eyes closed. \"Okay Delgado. I think you are right. We have a big problem.\" She opened her eyes to look at the three people staring back at her, and the equations streaming across her holographic body suddenly flashed bright red. \"Kig-Yar ships are withdrawing all throughout the Rubble. They\u0027re en route for Metisette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told us the Jackals were up to something, like an invasion. Could this be it?\" Jai said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their encryption is good. I can\u0027t break it just yet. But communications traffic is up and that can tell me something. I\u0027ve never seen activity like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelgado says Bonifacio is stealing the data. And this is happening at the same time as the largest movement of Kig-Yar ships we\u0027ve seen since they first started arriving to make a presence on the Rubble. It has to be related.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" Delgado said. \"We were right -- all they wanted was the data. They\u0027re making a move now, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuliana continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Distancia is moving in the direction her flight plan indicated, but could make a break for it the moment it gets clear of the Rubble to wherever the Kig-Yar want it to. We have to get to it and stop Bonifacio. And prepare for whatever it is the Kig-Yar are up to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai nodded. \"Our first priority is Bonifacio.\" They had to focus on that; that was Gray Team\u0027s mission. Adriana met his eyes, then nodded. She agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once we have that secured, Juliana, you have our assistance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AI had her eyes closed again.
