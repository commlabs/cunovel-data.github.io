Because the truth was she didn\u0027t know; she just had a very strong suspicion. They still had to put the sequence together, to verify that things had happened in a certain order, the chain of causation. They didn\u0027t know for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are close to a finding,\" Casey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Needless to say, we\u0027re eager to hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will announce it tomorrow,\" Casey said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the lights, she saw Richman\u0027s startled reaction. He hadn\u0027t been expecting that The little bastard was trying to see where she was going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet him try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the table from her, Reardon turned aside, and Malone whispered in his ear. Reardon nodded turned back to Casey. \"Ms. Singleton, if you know now, why wait?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because this was a serious accident, as you yourself said.There\u0027s already been a great deal of unwarranted speculation from many sources. Norton Aircraft feels it is important to act responsibly. Before we say anything publicly, we have to confirm our findings at flight Test using the same aircraft that was involved in the accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will you flight test?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tomorrow morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" Reardon sighed regretfully. \"But that\u0027s too late for our broadcast. You understand that you\u0027re denying your company the opportunity to respond to these serious charges.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey had her answer ready. \"We\u0027ve scheduled the flight test for five A.M.,\" she said. \"We\u0027ll hold a press conference immediately afterward - tomorrow at noon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noon,\" Reardon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression was bland, but she knew he was working it out Noon in LA was 3:00 P.M. in New York. Plenty of time to make the evening news in both New York and Los Angeles. Norton\u0027s preliminary finding would be widely reported on both local and network news. And Newsline, which aired at 10:00 P.M. Saturday night, would be out-of-date. Depending on what emerged from the press conference, the Newsline segment, edited the night before, would be ancient history. It might even be embarrassing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReardon sighed. \"On the other hand,\" he said, \"we want to be fair to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally,\" Casey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNORTON ADMINISTRATION\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:15P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Richman said. \"I think she may be planning something.

Flight Test will only make the story worse. She has no idea what caused the accident And she has no idea what will happen if she takes that Transpacific plane up. They probably can\u0027t reproduce the event And there may be problems nobody knows about\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e_ \"That aircraft went through very severe G-force loads,\" Marder said. \"It may have undetected structural damage. Anything can happen, when they take that plane up.\" Marder made a dismissive wave. \"This changes nothing. Newsline airs from ten to eleven Saturday night. Early Saturday evening I\u0027ll notify the Board that some bad publicity is coming our way, and we have to schedule an emergency meeting Sunday morning. Hal can\u0027t get back from Hong Kong in time. And his friends on the Board will drop him when they hear about a sixteen-billion-dollar deal. They\u0027ve all got stock. They know what the announcement will do to their shares. I\u0027m the next president of this company, and nobody can do a thing to stop it. Not Hal Edgarton. And certainly not Casey Singleton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWAR ROOM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:20 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cameras were packed up; the white foam sheets removed from the ceiling, the microphones unclipped; the electrical boxes and camera cases removed. But the negotiations dragged on. Ed Fuller, the lanky head of Legal, was there; so was Teddy Rawley, the pilot; and two engineers who worked on FT, to answer technical questions that arose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Newsline, Malone now did all of the talking; Reardon paced in the background, occasionally stopping to whisper in her ear. His commanding presence seemed to have vanished with the bright lights; he now appeared tired, fretful, and impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone began by saying that since Newsline was doing an entire segment on the Norton N-22, it was in the interest of the company to allow Newsline to film the flight test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey said that presented no problem. Flight tests were documented with dozens of video cameras, mounted both inside and outside the plane; the Newsline people could watch the entire test on monitors, on the ground. They could have the film afterward, for their broadcast\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Malone said. That wouldn\u0027t be sufficient. Newsline\u0027s crews had to actually be on the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey said mat was impossible, that no airframe manufacturer had ever allowed an outside crew on a flight test. She was, she said, already making a concession to let them see the video on the ground\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot good enough, Malone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd Fuller broke in to explain it was a question of liability. Norton simply couldn\u0027t allow uninsured nonemployees on the test. \"You realize, of course, there is inherent danger in flight test. It\u0027s simply inescapable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone said that Newsline would accept any risk, and sign waivers of liability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd Fuller said he would have to draw up the waivers, but that Newsline\u0027s lawyers would have to approve them, and there wasn\u0027t time for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone said she could get approval from Newsline\u0027s lawyers in an hour. Any time of the day or night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuller shifted ground. He said if Norton was going to let Newsline see the flight test, he wanted to be sure that the results of that test were accurately reported. He said he wanted to approve the edited film.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone said that journalistic ethics forbade that, and in any case there wasn\u0027t time. If the flight test ended around noon, she would have to cut film in the truck and transmit it to New York at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuller said the problem for the company remained. He wanted the flight test portrayed accurately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went back and forth. Finally Malone said she would include thirty seconds of unedited comment on the outcome of the flight by a Norton spokesperson. This would be taken from the press conference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuller demanded a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey compromised on forty seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have another problem,\" Fuller said. \"If we let you film the flight test, we don\u0027t want you to use the tape you obtained today, showing the actual incident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way, Malone said. The tape was going to be aired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You characterized the tape as having been obtained from a Norton employee,\" Fuller said. \"That\u0027s incorrect. We want the provenance accurately stated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we certainly got it from someone who works for Norton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Fuller said, \"you didn\u0027t\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s one of your subcontractors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not I can provide you with the IRS definition of a subcontractor, if you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a fine point...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have already obtained a sworn statement from the receptionist, Christine Barron. She is not an employee of Norton Aircraft. She is not, in fact, an employee of Video Imaging. She is a temp from an agency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the point here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want you to state the facts accurately: that you obtained the tape from sources outside the company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone shrugged. \"As I said, this is a fine point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s the problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone thought for a minute. \"Okay,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuller slid a piece of paper across the table. \"This brief document conveys that understanding. Sign it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone looked at Reardon. Reardon shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone signed it. \"I don\u0027t understand what all the fuss is about.\" She started to push it back to Fuller, and paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Two crews, on the aircraft, during the flight test. Is that our agreement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Fuller said. \"That was never the agreement. Your crews will watch the test on the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That won\u0027t work for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey said that the Newsline crews could come to the test area; they could film the preparations, the takeoff and landing. But they couldn\u0027t actually come on the plane during the flight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Malone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeddy Rawley cleared his throat. \"I don\u0027t think you understand the situation, Ms. Malone,\" he said. \"You can\u0027t be walking around filming inside the airplane, during a flight test. Everybody on board has to be strapped in in a four-point harness. You can\u0027t even get up to pee. And you can\u0027t have lights or batteries, because they generate magnetic fields that might disrupt our readings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t need lights,\" she said. \"We can shoot available light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand,\" Rawley said. \"It can get pretty hairy up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why we have to be mere,\" Malone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd Fuller cleared his throat. \"Let me be entirely clear, Ms. Malone,\" he said. \"Under no circumstances is this company going to allow your film crew on board that aircraft. It is absolutely out of the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone\u0027s face was rigid, set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027am,\" Rawley said, \"you\u0027ve got to realize, there\u0027s a reason we test over the desert. Over large uninhabited spaces?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean it might crash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean we don\u0027t know what might happen. Trust me on this: you want to be on the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone shook her head. \"No. We must have our crews on board.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027am, there\u0027s going to be big G-forces - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey said, \"There\u0027ll be thirty cameras all over the plane. They\u0027ll cover every possible angle - cockpit, wings, passenger cabin, everywhere. You\u0027re getting exclusive use of the film. No one will know your cameras aren\u0027t getting the footage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone glowered, but Casey knew that she had made the point. The woman only cared about the visuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to place the cameras,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-uh,\" Rawley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to be able to say our cameras are on board,\" Malone said. \"I have to be able to say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, Casey hammered out a compromise. Newsline would be allowed to position two locked-down cameras, anywhere in the plane, to cover the test flight They would take the feed directly from these cameras. In addition, they would be allowed to use footage from other cameras mounted in the interior. Finally, Newsline would be allowed to shoot a stand-up with Reardon outside Building 64, where the assembly line was located.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorton would provide transportation for the Newsline crews to the Arizona test facility later in the day; would put them up in a local motel; would transport them to the test facility in the morning; and back to LA in the afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone pushed the paper back to Fuller. \"Deal,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReardon was looking fretfully at his watch as he left with Malone to shoot the stand-up. Casey was alone with Rawley and Fuller in the War Room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuller sighed. \"I hope we\u0027ve made the right decision.\" He turned to Casey. \"I did what you asked, when you called me earlier from the video company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Ed,\" she said. \"You were perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I saw the tape,\" he said. \"It\u0027s dreadful. I\u0027m afraid that whatever the flight test shows, that tape will be the only thing anybody remembers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey said, \"If anybody ever sees that tape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My concern,\" Fuller said, \"is that Newsline will run that tape no matter what.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they won\u0027t,\" Casey said. \"Not when we get through with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuller sighed. \"I hope you\u0027re right. High stakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"High stakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeddy said, \"You better tell them to bring warm clothing. You, too, babe. And another thing: I watched that woman.

That airplane exceeded its design G-loads by a hundred and sixty percent. That guy subjected the airframe to forces it was never built to withstand. And tomorrow I\u0027m going to go up and do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Doherty checked the fuse,\" she said, \"they\u0027ve X-rayed and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, he checked,\" Teddy said. \"But not thoroughly. Ordinarily, we\u0027d go over that fuselage for a month, before we put it back in active service. We\u0027d X-ray every join on the plane. That hasn\u0027t been done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saying,\" Teddy said, \"that when I put that aircraft through those same G-force loads, there\u0027s a chance that the airframe will fail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You trying to scare me?\" Casey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m just telling you.

But so important is this test to the future of Norton Aircraft, so confident are they of the outcome, that they have agreed to allow our crews to film. So today, for the first time, we will be seeing footage of the actual plane involved in Flight 545, the controversial Norton N-22 aircraft. Critics say it\u0027s a deathtrap. The company says it\u0027s safe.

Here, in this building where the aircraft is made, workers are confident that it is a safe, reliable aircraft. But critics of the N-22 remain unconvinced. Will there be another harvest of death in the skies? Only time will tell. This is Martin Reardon, for Newsline, Burbank, California.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Too corny? Too much on the money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great, Marty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already unclipping his mike, removing the radio pack from his belt. He pecked Jennifer on the cheek. \"I\u0027m out of here,\" he said, and sprinted to the waiting car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer turned to her crew. \"Pack up, guys,\" she said. \"We\u0027re going to Arizona.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSATURDAY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNORTON TEST FACILITY YUMA, ARIZONA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:45 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thin streak of red was starting to appear behind the flat range of the Gila Mountains to the east. The sky overhead was deep indigo, a few stars still visible. The air was very cold; Casey could see her breath. She zipped up her windbreaker and stamped her feet, trying to stay warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the runway, lights shone up at the Transpacific wide-body, as the FT team finished installing the video cameras. There were men on the wings, around the engines, by the landing gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Newsline crew was already out, filming the preparations. Malone stood alongside Casey, watching them. \"Jesus it\u0027s cold,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey went into the Right Test Station, a low Spanish-style bungalow beside the tower. Inside, the room was filled with monitors, each displaying the feed from a single camera. Most of the cameras were focused on specific parts - she found the camera on the right locking pin - and so the room had a technical, industrial feeling. It was not very exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t what I expected,\" Malone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey pointed around the room. \"There\u0027s the cockpit. High mount down. Cockpit, facing back at the pilot. You see Rawley there, in the chair. The interior cabin, looking aft Interior cabin, looking forward. Looking out on right wing. The left wing, Those are your main interiors. And we\u0027ll also have the chase plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chase plane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An F-14 fighter follows the widebody all through the flight, so we\u0027ll have those cameras, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone frowned. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said, in a disappointed voice. \"I thought it would be more, you know, glitzy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re still on the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone was frowning, unhappy. \"These angles on the cabin,\" she said. \"Who will be in there, during the flight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean the seats will be empty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. It\u0027s a test flight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That isn\u0027t going to look very good,\" Malone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s how it is on a test flight,\" Casey said. \"This is how it\u0027s done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it doesn\u0027t look good,\" Malone said. \"This isn\u0027t compelling. There should be people in the seats. At least, in some of them. Can\u0027t we put some people on board? Can\u0027t I go on board?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey shook her head. \"It\u0027s a dangerous flight,\" she said. \"The airframe was badly stressed by the accident. We don\u0027t know what will happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone snorted. \"Oh, come on. There aren\u0027t any lawyers here. How about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey just looked at her. She was a foolish kid who knew nothing about the world, who was just interested in a look, who lived for appearances, who skimmed over surfaces. She knew she should refuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, she heard herself say, \"You won\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re telling me it\u0027s not safe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you that you won\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going on,\" Malone said. She looked at Casey, her expression an open challenge. \"So: How about you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her mind, Casey could hear Marty Reardon\u0027s voice, as he said, Despite her repeated insistence that the N-22 was safe, Norton\u0027s own spokesperson, Casey Singleton, refused to board the plane for the flight test. She said that the reason she wouldn\u0027t fly on it was...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey didn\u0027t have an answer, at least not an answer that would work for television. Not an answer that would play. And suddenly the days of strain, the effort to try and solve the incident, the effort to contrive an appearance for television, the effort to make sure she didn\u0027t say a single sentence that could be taken out of context, the distortion of everything in her life for this unwarranted intrusion of television, made her furious. She knew exactly what was coming. Malone had seen the videos, but she didn\u0027t understand they were real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Casey said. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went out to the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eABOARD TPA 545\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:05 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer shivered: it was cold inside the airplane, and under fluorescent lights, the rows of empty seats, the long aisles, made it seem even colder. She was faintly shocked when she recognized, in places, the damage that she had seen on the videotape. This was where it happened, she thought. This was the plane. There were still bloody footprints on the ceiling. Broken luggage bins. Dented fiberglass panels. And a lingering odor. Even worse, in some places the plastic panels had been pulled off around the windows, so that she could see the naked silver padding, the bundles of wires. It was suddenly all too clear that she was in a big metal machine. She wondered if she had made a mistake, but by then Singleton was gesturing for her to take a seat, right in the front of the center cabin, facing a locked-down video camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer sat beside Singleton and waited as one of the Norton technicians, a man in coveralls, tightened the shoulder harness around her body. It was one of those harnesses like the stewardesses wore on regular flights. Two green canvas straps came over each shoulder, meeting at the waist. Then there was another wide canvas strap that went across her thighs. Heavy metal buckles clamped it all in place. It looked serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in coveralls pulled the straps tight, grunting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez,\" Jennifer said. \"Does it have to be that tight?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027am, you need it as tight as you can stand it,\" the man said. \"If you can breathe, it\u0027s too loose. Can you feel the way it is now?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how you want it when you put it back on. Now here\u0027s your release here...\" He showed her. \"Pull that now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do I need to know - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Case of emergency. Pull it, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled the release. The straps sprang away from her body, the pressure released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And just do it up again yourself, if you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer put the contraption back together, just as he had done it before. It wasn\u0027t difficult. These people made such a fuss about nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now tighten it, please, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled the straps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tighter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I need it tighter, I\u0027ll tighten it later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma\u0027am,\" he said, \"by the time you realize you need it tighter, it\u0027ll be too late. Do it now, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlongside her, Singleton was calmly putting the harness on, cinching it down brutally. The straps dug into Singleton\u0027s thighs, pulled hard on her shoulders. Singleton sighed, sat back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe you ladies are prepared,\" the man said. \"You have a pleasant flight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, and went out the door. The pilot, that Rawley character, came back from the cockpit, shaking his head. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airframe/page-23.html","bookId":2409,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM"}
