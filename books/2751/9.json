He claimed them, and once the luggage was in hand, he proceeded directly out the glass doors and into one of the most beautiful spring days he had ever seen. When they\u0027d left New York, it had been dreary and twenty-five degrees. But in Tulsa, the sun was out and the temperature must have been at least sixty-five. He stood, soaking up the vitamin D until Julia emerged from the airport, removing the scarf, freeing her hair to billow in the Oklahoma wind. Strands blew across her face, and he wanted to brush them away, but before he could say or do a thing, he heard a raspy voice behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s tall,\" the woman said. \"That\u0027s good, Jules.

She had pushed aside piles of fabric samples and magazines to make room for Lance in the backseat. \"It\u0027s a project,\" Nina had explained. What kind of project, Lance certainly wasn\u0027t going to ask, because he wanted Nina to stay as focused on the road as possible. Maybe it was the way his six-two body had been folded into the tiny car, but when they began to swerve between semis, he knew for a fact that he might die there, in the back of a bug, surrounded by pieces of velvet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ro-Ro\u0027s coming,\" Nina said casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia wheeled around in the front seat and nearly kicked the car out of gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" she yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Nina snapped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ro-Ro doesn\u0027t come to birthday parties,\" Julia argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ro-Ro sends recycled cards and dingy five-dollar bills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Ro-Ro?\" Lance asked from the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia buried her head in her palm then bolted upright again and exclaimed, \"Ro-Ro doesn\u0027t come to birthday parties!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she\u0027s coming to this one,\" Nina said with resolve. \"She knows, doesn\u0027t she?\" \"That\u0027s my bet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Ro-Ro?\" Lance asked again, but the women had evidently forgotten he existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, how does she know?

Nina insisted on letting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is the biggest problem my career has ever faced, and instead of leaving him in New York\"—Julia gestured to where Lance stood beside the car—\"I let him follow me home,\" she exclaimed, rolling her eyes skyward, finishing a five-minute monologue on \"the Lance Situation.\" She looked to Nina for sympathy, but all she saw was her best friend\u0027s outstretched hand. \"I\u0027m not wearing the ring, or did you notice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did notice, and I\u0027m proud,\" Julia said, and gave herself a mental slap for not being more sensitive.

You meet a hot guy. Great. Worse ways to spend a day. People think you\u0027ve got feelings for the hot guy. Hardly a national crisis. Besides\"—she stopped and gestured to Lance, who stood dutifully beside the car—\"he pumps the gas.

Lance looked around and understood why she was confused. The subdivision was like a maze, each structure nearly identical to the one that stood beside it, all of them in the last stages of completion, each one reeking of decay as muddy, un-sodded yards oozed into piles of shingles and scrap lumber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is going on here?\" Lance asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Contractor went bankrupt,\" Nina told him. \"There are only three or four houses in the whole subdivision that are done.

They eased their way through the half-finished carnage of dream homes until they made another twist and saw one house that had daffodils dotting the flowerbeds and an abandoned tricycle standing sentry in the yard. Orange and white helium-filled balloons were tied to the mailbox and drifted in the breeze, but there wasn\u0027t another car in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Nina said as she pulled the VW up the slight incline of the garage slab and shifted into park. \"We\u0027re early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nine\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWAY #56: Always enjoy the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether it\u0027s the wedding of two old college friends or the\u0026nbsp; -as.\u0026nbsp; birthday of someone from work, your lack of a date should I never keep you from attending important celebrations.

Then she recognized the strange feeling in her stomach: relief. Maybe she was simply glad that Steve had placed his family over his firm for at least a few hours that weekend, but deep down, Julia realized the feeling was probably due to the fact that of all the people she could count on not to notice the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLance debacle and not to care, her brother-in-law was at the top of the list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia, welcome back,\" Steve said, as if ushering her inside his office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like the hat,\" Nina said as she followed Julia inside. \"Hi there,\" Lance said, and held out his hand. \"I\u0027m Lance \"Welcome, Lance,\" Steve said, shaking his hand. \"Come on in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the grand foyer, their footsteps echoed on the marble floor, despite the gorgeous rugs and wall hangings that Nina had sold to Caroline at cost, earning her a place in Steve\u0027: penny-pinching heart forever. A staircase curved to the second story and the formal living room stretched out beneath a cathedral ceiling, and Julia had to wonder for the millionth time( how her sister and brother-in-law had wound up here. It look like a page from a magazine, and it had been Julia\u0027s experience! that only two-dimensional people live in such two-dimensional rooms. But the chandelier kept blazing, and all six thousand square feet of it kept gathering dust—despite Caroline\u0027s constant efforts otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve led the way through a formal dining room that Julia had never seen anyone use.
