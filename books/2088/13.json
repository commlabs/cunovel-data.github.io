He was staring at me and not the wolf. I looked back. The thing was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my eyes. Tried again. Still gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wolf ran off, along with all the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... but... I hit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you certain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf had jerked, jumped, fallen. \"Yes, 1 hit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently, not well enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich wasn\u0027t like me. What I hit, I hit very well indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you shoot, Officer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you see that thing?\" I shuddered, remembering those eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolves had light eyes -\u0026nbsp; yellow, greenish, hazel. This one\u0027s had been brown -\u0026nbsp; nothing to write home about except for the unusual flash of white and their expression. A calculated hatred and too human intelligence. I never would have thought intelligence could be evident in the eyes, but I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I saw it,\" Mandenauer answered. \"I was waiting for the others to show themselves before I shot. They were all infected, Officer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced. I\u0027d screwed up and now we had nothing to show for our hours of patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know they were all infected?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were coming in like a Special Forces operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how would you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer peered down his long, bony nose. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecial Forces? Him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re losing it, Mandenauer. How could a group of wolves, supervirus or not, use Special Forces tactics? How could they get to us up here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will never know now that you scared them off before I could adequately gauge what they were planning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stifled the urge to apologize. This guy was nuts. Wolves with human intelligence? Even after I\u0027d seen those eyes, I found that hard to swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe amount of planning he was talking about was beyond an animal, enhanced or not. How did they devise their strategy, by drawing pictures in the dirt with their paws?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought wolves rarely attacked people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are more than wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than wolves? What did that mean? I could ask, but then he\u0027d probably tell me. I needed to talk to Clyde and a few others before I started questioning Mandenauer. I was having serious doubts about his sanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter flicking the safety on my rifle, I reached for the rope used to lower weapons to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" Mandenauer sat on the floor of the tree stand with his back against one plank wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is your work now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the woods where the wolves had disappeared. \"But -\u0026nbsp; \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that they know we are here they may be back. It isn\u0027t safe to be on the ground until morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean we have to sit up here all night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and snuggled his shoulders into the corner. \"Wake me if they return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he closed his eyes and went to sleep, just like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorning came -\u0026nbsp; eventually. But none of the wolves did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI observed a lot of wildlife that night, but nothing out of the ordinary. A raccoon or three, an opossum, a doe and two fawns tripped through just before dawn. Man-denauer slept through everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the sun spread bright fingers of light across the floor of the tree stand, I kicked Mandenauer\u0027s boot. He came awake in an instant. I could tell by his face he knew where he was. I wouldn\u0027t have. The only people I knew who could come out of a deep sleep and function immediately were ex-military. The longer I knew Man-denauer the more interesting he became.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced into the clearing. \"Nothing,\" he stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t bother to answer what hadn\u0027t been a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe lowered our rifles to the ground, then followed them down, returning to town in silence. Mandenauer must have gotten a car from somewhere, since he\u0027d met me at the station, so instead of dropping him at his cabin, I took him back where I had found him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZee was already gone and a new fresh face sat in her place. I wondered where they\u0027d gotten this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe appeared to be all of twelve years old -\u0026nbsp; fine blond hair, huge blue eyes, porcelain pale skin -\u0026nbsp; she would have been pretty except for that nose. Poor thing had a beak like a hawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning, Jessie,\" she chirped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had neglected to tell her she should never talk to me before breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde must have been waiting for us, because he barreled out of his office almost as soon as we walked in. \"Gonna make my day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youngster murmured, \"Sudden Impact.\" Maybe she was smarter than she looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir,\" I answered. Set to launch into an explanation of how it was all my fault, I was shocked when Mandenauer put a heavy, staying hand on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This will take time,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde chewed hard and fast on his first chew of the morning. \"I went to Miss Larson\u0027s house. Nothing unusual there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any indication of why she might have been out on the road at three a.m.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None. I doubt we\u0027ll ever know the answer to that. Hell, maybe she just couldn\u0027t sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate loose ends,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, me, and the rest of the free world.\" Clyde stalked back into his office and slammed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Mandenauer and tamped down on the urge to say, \"No shit.\" The old man was staring at the door to Clyde\u0027s office with a contemplative expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t do well with change. Rabid wolves, citizens eating each other, that\u0027s new around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm. Then we\u0027d best obtain some results for the sheriff. I will meet you tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same bat time, same bat channel,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer appeared confused. His knowledge of classic television trivia was no doubt sorely lacking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at least he didn\u0027t ask me to explain. 1 was not in the mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I was, was tired and sore from lounging in that tree stand all night. I wanted food and my pillow, but I had one phone call to make before I could go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer headed for the parking lot; 1 headed for what passed as my office -\u0026nbsp; a desk among all the other desks -\u0026nbsp; but at least no one else was in the room. Then I looked up the number for the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Officer Jessie McQuade of the Miniwa, Wisconsin, PD,\" I began. \"I... Uh, well, you see, we have a tiny problem here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did I explain something that sounded like I\u0027d read it in a fantasy novel? One that had a cheesy, car-toonish, snarling, slavering wolf on the cover?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and told the switchboard operator everything that I knew. To the woman\u0027s credit, she didn\u0027t collapse into giggles right away. Who knows what she did after she transferred my call to Dr. Hanover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elise Hanover.\" The voice on the other end of the line was clipped -\u0026nbsp; all business and very busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began my story all over again, but she interrupted me after only a moment. \"Yes, yes. I know about the new rabies strain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I\u0027m working on that problem right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn impatient sigh drifted several hundred miles. \"Officer, what is it you want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did I want to know\u0027 ? That Mandenauer wasn\u0027t a psycho with a gun? That he hadn\u0027t made up this rabies crap so he could go bonkers in our forest and start killing every wolf that he saw? I guess I knew that now. But as long as I had an expert on the line...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this a terrorist infiltration?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Hanover snorted. \"Like I\u0027d tell you if it was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax,\" she said. \"Everything that goes to hell in our country isn\u0027t the result of a terrorist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, tell it to the media.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence met my snarl. I waited for the click of the phone or the request for my superior\u0027s phone number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead the doctor chuckled. \"You\u0027re a woman after my own heart, Officer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, uncertain what to say to that. I wasn\u0027t used to female friendliness. The two words were mutually exclusive in my book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d spent my childhood with the boys. I liked them - still did. Boys didn\u0027t smile in your face and stab you in the back. They kicked your ass; then they were done. I prefer my hostility out in the open where I can see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy only girlfriend was Zee, and she wasn\u0027t much of a girl. But her hostility was definitely out in the open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZee was a woman after my own heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I sat there like a lump too long, Dr. Hanover filled in the silence. \"The virus is a result of nature, Officer. You\u0027ve heard, I\u0027m sure, that certain infections are becoming resistant to antibiotics because of overuse of medication?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I also know that infections are different from viruses and antibiotics aren\u0027t worth dick if you have the flu. Since rabies is basically the flu on acid, what difference does resistance to antibiotics make?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None whatsoever. I was using an analogy. The rabies virus is mutating to get around the vaccine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was told if anyone else was bitten we should use the rabies vaccine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For humans, that\u0027s true. The only help for animals is a bullet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those I got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\" I could not have heard her right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silver bullets work best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was my turn to snort. \"Doctor, have you been watching too many Lon Chaney movies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was either too young to remember the Wolf Man -\u0026nbsp; hell, I was too young, except I liked black-and-white horror movies -\u0026nbsp; or too much of a brainiac to watch movies at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind,\" I said. \"You\u0027re kidding me about the silver bullets, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, but no. We\u0027ve discovered the mutated virus reacts negatively to silver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead is dead in my book. What difference does it make how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be surprised. I\u0027ve had reports of animals with a nonkill wound dying if a silver bullet was used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat can it hurt? Dead is dead, right?\" I heard the amusement in her voice as she threw my own words back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the hell do I get silver bullets? Werewolves \u0027 R\u0027Us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try the Internet. You can buy anything there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone went dead in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silver bullets.\" I shook my head. That\u0027d be the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see myself trying to explain why my rifle was loaded with silver -\u0026nbsp; to Clyde, to Bozeman, to John Q. Public, even to Mandenauer. They\u0027d lock me up and throw away the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d take my chances with the lead variety, thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy radio crackled. \"Jessie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new dispatcher. Why hadn\u0027t she just shouted for me? She had to know I was three doors down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and walked to the front of the building. She appeared frazzled; the buttons on her switchboard were lit up like a meteor shower. Someone was chattering into her headphones. I could hear them from five feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced into Clyde\u0027s office. He was taking a call and, if the wide sweeps of his hands and the scowl on his face were any indication, he was in the middle of an argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessie!\" The dispatcher beckoned. \"I need you to go out on a call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nuh-uh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised a brow and glanced at her name tag. She wasn\u0027t wearing one. Zee must not think the kid would last through the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved a hand at the switchboard. \"We just got slammed. There\u0027s a three-car pileup on the highway and a domestic disturbance on Grand. I sent everyone available; then another call came in.\" She bit her lip. \"Clyde said if I disturbed him I should find another job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced into his office again. He was still arguing. He caught me staring and turned his back. Odd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\" I saw my blueberry bagel and cool soothing sheets slipping away, but there was nothing I could do about it. \"Where and what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe beamed. \"The university. One of the professors\u0027offices was ransacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose?\" I asked, but I already knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-13.html","bookId":2088,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM"}
