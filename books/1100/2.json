{"id":28919,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"\u0026nbsp;At the tail of the line we encountered two Bedouins, who were in charge of the caravan, and Joseph at once addressed them. \u0026nbsp;The men were mounted, one on a very sorry-looking jade, but the other on a good stout Arab barb. \u0026nbsp;They had guns slung behind their backs, coloured handkerchiefs on their heads, and they wore the striped bernouse. \u0026nbsp;The parley went on for about ten minutes, during which the procession of pilgrims wound out of sight; and it ended in our being accompanied by the two Arabs, who thus left their greater charge to take care of itself back to the city. \u0026nbsp;I understood afterwards that they had endeavoured to persuade Joseph that we might just as well go on alone, merely satisfying the demand of the tariff. \u0026nbsp;But he had pointed out that I was a particular man, and that under such circumstances the final settlement might be doubtful. \u0026nbsp;So they turned and accompanied us; but, as a matter of fact, we should have been as well without them. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The sun was beginning to fall in the heavens when we reached the actual margin of the Dead Sea. \u0026nbsp;We had seen the glitter of its still waters for a long time previously, shining under the sun as though it were not real. \u0026nbsp;We have often heard, and some of us have seen, how effects of light and shade together will produce so vivid an appearance of water where there is no water, as to deceive the most experienced. \u0026nbsp;But the reverse was the case here. \u0026nbsp;There was the lake, and there it had been before our eyes for the last two hours; and yet it looked, then and now, as though it were an image of a lake, and not real water. \u0026nbsp;I had long since made up my mind to bathe in it, feeling well convinced that I could do so without harm to myself, and I had been endeavouring to persuade Smith to accompany me; but he positively refused. \u0026nbsp;He would bathe, he said, neither in the Dead Sea nor in the river Jordan. \u0026nbsp;He did not like bathing, and preferred to do his washing in his own room. \u0026nbsp;Of course I had nothing further to say, and begged that, under these circumstances, he would take charge of my purse and pistols while I was in the water. \u0026nbsp;This he agreed to do; but even in this he was strange and almost uncivil. \u0026nbsp;I was to bathe from the farthest point of a little island, into which there was a rough causeway from the land made of stones and broken pieces of wood, and I exhorted him to go with me thither; but he insisted on remaining with his horse on the mainland at some little distance from the island. \u0026nbsp;He did not feel inclined to go down to the water’s edge, he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I confess that at this moment I almost suspected that he was going to play me foul, and I hesitated. \u0026nbsp;He saw in an instant what was passing through my mind. \u0026nbsp;“You had better take your pistol and money with you; they will be quite safe on your clothes.” \u0026nbsp;But to have kept the things now would have shown suspicion too plainly, and as I could not bring myself to do that, I gave them up. \u0026nbsp;I have sometimes thought that I was a fool to do so.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I went away by myself to the end of the island, and then I did bathe. \u0026nbsp;It is impossible to conceive anything more desolate than the appearance of the place. \u0026nbsp;The land shelves very gradually away to the water, and the whole margin, to the breadth of some twenty or thirty feet, is strewn with the débris of rushes, bits of timber, and old white withered reeds. \u0026nbsp;Whence these bits of timber have come it seems difficult to say. \u0026nbsp;The appearance is as though the water had receded and left them there. \u0026nbsp;I have heard it said that there is no vegetation near the Dead Sea; but such is not the case, for these rushes do grow on the bank. \u0026nbsp;I found it difficult enough to get into the water, for the ground shelves down very slowly, and is rough with stones and large pieces of half-rotten wood; moreover, when I was in nearly up to my hips the water knocked me down; indeed, it did so when I had gone as far as my knees, but I recovered myself; and by perseverance did proceed somewhat farther. \u0026nbsp;It must not be imagined that this knocking down was effected by the movement of the water. \u0026nbsp;There is no such movement. \u0026nbsp;Everything is perfectly still, and the fluid seems hardly to be displaced by the entrance of the body; but the effect is that one’s feet are tripped up, and that one falls prostrate on to the surface. \u0026nbsp;The water is so strong and buoyant, that, when above a few feet in depth has to be encountered, the strength and weight of the bather are not sufficient to keep down his feet and legs. \u0026nbsp;I then essayed to swim; but I could not do this in the ordinary way, as I was unable to keep enough of my body below the surface; so that my head and face seemed to be propelled down upon it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I turned round and floated, but the glare of the sun was so powerful that I could not remain long in that position. \u0026nbsp;However, I had bathed in the Dead Sea, and was so far satisfied.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Anything more abominable to the palate than this water, if it be water, I never had inside my mouth. \u0026nbsp;I expected it to be extremely salt, and no doubt, if it were analysed, such would be the result; but there is a flavour in it which kills the salt. \u0026nbsp;No attempt can be made at describing this taste. \u0026nbsp;It may be imagined that I did not drink heartily, merely taking up a drop or two with my tongue from the palm of my hand; but it seemed to me as though I had been drenched with it. \u0026nbsp;Even brandy would not relieve me from it. \u0026nbsp;And then my whole body was in a mess, and I felt as though I had been rubbed with pitch. \u0026nbsp;Looking at my limbs, I saw no sign on them of the fluid. \u0026nbsp;They seemed to dry from this as they usually do from any other water; but still the feeling remained. \u0026nbsp;However, I was to ride from hence to a spot on the banks of Jordan, which I should reach in an hour, and at which I would wash; so I clothed myself, and prepared for my departure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seated in my position in the island I was unable to see what was going on among the remainder of the party, and therefore could not tell whether my pistols and money was safe. \u0026nbsp;I dressed, therefore, rather hurriedly, and on getting again to the shore, found that Mr. John Smith had not levanted. \u0026nbsp;He was seated on his horse at some distance from Joseph and the Arabs, and had no appearance of being in league with those, no doubt, worthy guides. \u0026nbsp;I certainly had suspected a ruse, and now was angry with myself that I had done so; and yet, in London, one would not trust one’s money to a stranger whom one had met twenty-four hours since in a coffee-room! \u0026nbsp;Why, then, do it with a stranger whom one chanced to meet in a desert?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thanks,” I said, as he handed me my belongings. \u0026nbsp;“I wish I could have induced you to come in also. \u0026nbsp;The Dead Sea is now at your elbow, and, therefore, you think nothing of it; but in ten or fifteen years’ time, you would be glad to be able to tell your children that you had bathed in it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall never have any children to care for such tidings,” he replied.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The river Jordan, for some miles above the point at which it joins the Dead Sea, runs through very steep banks,—banks which are almost precipitous,—and is, as it were, guarded by the thick trees and bushes which grow upon its sides. \u0026nbsp;This is so much the case, that one may ride, as we did, for a considerable distance along the margin, and not be able even to approach the water. \u0026nbsp;I had a fancy for bathing in some spot of my own selection, instead of going to the open shore frequented by all the pilgrims; but I was baffled in this. \u0026nbsp;When I did force my way down to the river side, I found that the water ran so rapidly, and that the bushes and boughs of trees grew so far over and into the stream, as to make it impossible for me to bathe. \u0026nbsp;I could not have got in without my clothes, and having got in, I could not have got out again. \u0026nbsp;I was, therefore obliged to put up with the open muddy shore to which the bathers descend, and at which we may presume that Joshua passed when he came over as one of the twelve spies to spy out the land. \u0026nbsp;And even here I could not go full into the stream as I would fain have done, lest I should be carried down, and so have assisted to whiten the shores of the Dead Sea with my bones. \u0026nbsp;As to getting over to the Moabitish side of the river, that was plainly impossible; and, indeed, it seemed to be the prevailing opinion that the passage of the river was not practicable without going up as far as Samaria. \u0026nbsp;And yet we know that there, or thereabouts, the Israelites did cross it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I jumped from my horse the moment I got to the place, and once more gave my purse and pistols to my friend. \u0026nbsp;“You are going to bathe again?” he said. \u0026nbsp;“Certainly,” said I; “you don’t suppose that I would come to Jordan and not wash there, even if I were not foul with the foulness of the Dead Sea!” \u0026nbsp;“You’ll kill yourself, in your present state of heat;” he said, remonstrating just as one’s mother or wife might do. \u0026nbsp;But even had it been my mother or wife I could not have attended to such remonstrance then; and before he had done looking at me with those big eyes of his, my coat and waistcoat and cravat were on the ground, and I was at work at my braces; whereupon he turned from me slowly, and strolled away into the wood. \u0026nbsp;On this occasion I had no base fears about my money.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then I did bathe,—very uncomfortably. \u0026nbsp;The shore was muddy with the feet of the pilgrims, and the river so rapid that I hardly dared to get beyond the mud. \u0026nbsp;I did manage to take a plunge in, head-foremost, but I was forced to wade out through the dirt and slush, so that I found it difficult to make my feet and legs clean enough for my shoes and stockings; and then, moreover, the flies plagued me most unmercifully. \u0026nbsp;I should have thought that the filthy flavour from the Dead Sea would have saved me from that nuisance; but the mosquitoes thereabouts are probably used to it. \u0026nbsp;Finding this process of bathing to be so difficult, I inquired as to the practice of the pilgrims. \u0026nbsp;I found that with them, bathing in Jordan has come to be much the same as baptism has with us. \u0026nbsp;It does not mean immersion. \u0026nbsp;No doubt they do take off their shoes and stockings; but they do not strip, and go bodily into the water.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As soon as I was dressed I found that Smith was again at my side with purse and pistols. \u0026nbsp;We then went up a little above the wood, and sat down together on the long sandy grass. \u0026nbsp;It was now quite evening, so that the short Syrian twilight had commenced, and the sun was no longer hot in the heavens. \u0026nbsp;It would be night as we rode on to the tents at Jericho; but there was no difficulty as to the way, and therefore we did not hurry the horses, who were feeding on the grass. \u0026nbsp;We sat down together on a spot from which we could see the stream,—close together, so that when I stretched myself out in my weariness, as I did before we started, my head rested on his legs. \u0026nbsp;Ah, me! one does not take such liberties with new friends in England. \u0026nbsp;It was a place which led one on to some special thoughts. \u0026nbsp;The mountains of Moab were before us, very plain in their outline.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Moab is my wash-pot, and over Edom will I cast out my shoe!” \u0026nbsp;There they were before us, very visible to the eye, and we began naturally to ask questions of each other. \u0026nbsp;Why was Moab the wash-pot, and Edom thus cursed with indignity? \u0026nbsp;Why had the right bank of the river been selected for such great purposes, whereas the left was thus condemned? \u0026nbsp;Was there, at that time, any special fertility in this land of promise which has since departed from it? \u0026nbsp;We are told of a bunch of grapes which took two men to carry it; but now there is not a vine in the whole country side. \u0026nbsp;Now-a-days the sandy plain round Jericho is as dry and arid as are any of the valleys of Moab. \u0026nbsp;The Jordan was running beneath our feet,—the Jordan in which the leprous king had washed, though the bright rivers of his own Damascus were so much nearer to his hand. \u0026nbsp;It was but a humble stream to which he was sent; but the spot probably was higher up, above the Sea of Galilee, where the river is narrow. \u0026nbsp;But another also had come down to this river, perhaps to this very spot on its shores, and submitted Himself to its waters;—as to whom, perhaps, it will be better that I should not speak much in this light story.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Dead Sea was on our right, still glittering in the distance, and behind us lay the plains of Jericho and the wretched collection of huts which still bears the name of the ancient city. \u0026nbsp;Beyond that, but still seemingly within easy distance of us, were the mountains of the wilderness. \u0026nbsp;The wilderness! \u0026nbsp;In truth, the spot was one which did lead to many thoughts.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We talked of these things, as to many of which I found that my friend was much more free in his doubts and questionings than myself; and then our words came back to ourselves, the natural centre of all men’s thoughts and words. \u0026nbsp;“From what you say,” I said, “I gather that you have had enough of this land?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Quite enough,” he said. \u0026nbsp;“Why seek such spots as these, if they only dispel the associations and veneration of one’s childhood?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But with me such associations and veneration are riveted the stronger by seeing the places, and putting my hand upon the spots. \u0026nbsp;I do not speak of that fictitious marble slab up there; but here, among the sandhills by this river, and at the Mount of Olives over which we passed, I do believe.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He paused a moment, and then replied: “To me it is all nothing,—absolutely nothing. \u0026nbsp;But then do we not know that our thoughts are formed, and our beliefs modelled, not on the outward signs or intrinsic evidences of things,—as would be the case were we always rational,—but by the inner workings of the mind itself? \u0026nbsp;At the present turn of my life I can believe in nothing that is gracious.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah, you mean that you are unhappy. \u0026nbsp;You have come to grief in some of your doings or belongings, and therefore find that all things are bitter to the taste. \u0026nbsp;I have had my palate out of order too; but the proper appreciation of flavours has come back to me. \u0026nbsp;Bah,—how noisome was that Dead Sea water!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The Dead Sea waters are noisome,” he said; “and I have been drinking of them by long draughts.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Long draughts!” I answered, thinking to console him. \u0026nbsp;“Draughts have not been long which can have been swallowed in your years. \u0026nbsp;Your disease may be acute, but it cannot yet have become chronic. \u0026nbsp;A man always thinks at the moment of each misfortune that that special misery will last his lifetime; but God is too good for that. \u0026nbsp;I do not know what ails you; but this day twelvemonth will see you again as sound as a roach.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We then sat silent for a while, during which I was puffing at a cigar. \u0026nbsp;Smith, among his accomplishments, did not reckon that of smoking,—which was a grief to me; for a man enjoys the tobacco doubly when another is enjoying it with him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, you do not know what ails me,” he said at last, “and, therefore, cannot judge.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps not, my dear fellow. \u0026nbsp;But my experience tells me that early wounds are generally capable of cure; and, therefore, I surmise that yours may be so. \u0026nbsp;The heart at your time of life is not worn out, and has strength and soundness left wherewith to throw off its maladies. \u0026nbsp;I hope it may be so with you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “God knows. \u0026nbsp;

how they were essentially true to us, but teased us almost to frenzy by their continual begging. \u0026nbsp;They begged for our food and our drink, for our cigars and our gunpowder, for the clothes off our backs, and the handkerchiefs out of our pockets. \u0026nbsp;As to gunpowder I had none to give them, for my charges were all made up in cartridges;

but for our Bedouins, who had duly received their forty shillings a piece, we had no further use. \u0026nbsp;On our road down to Jerusalem we had much chat together, but only one adventure. \u0026nbsp;Those pilgrims, of whom I have spoken, journey to Jerusalem in the greatest number by the route which we were now taking from it, and they come in long droves, reaching Jaffa in crowds by the French and Austrian steamers from Smyrna, Damascus, and Constantinople. \u0026nbsp;As their number confers security in that somewhat insecure country, many travellers from the west of Europe make arrangements to travel with them. \u0026nbsp;On our way down we met the last of these caravans for the year, and we were passing it for more than two hours. \u0026nbsp;On this occasion I rode first, and Smith was immediately behind me; but of a sudden I observed him to wheel his horse round, and to clamber downwards among bushes and stones towards a river that ran below us. \u0026nbsp;“Hallo, Smith,” I cried, “you will destroy your horse, and yourself too.” \u0026nbsp;But he would not answer me, and all I could do was to draw up in the path and wait. \u0026nbsp;My confusion was made the worse, as at that moment a long string of pilgrims was passing by. \u0026nbsp;“Good morning, sir,” said an old man to me in good English. \u0026nbsp;I looked up as I answered him, and saw a grey-haired gentleman, of very solemn and sad aspect. \u0026nbsp;He might be seventy years of age, and I could see that he was attended by three or four servants. \u0026nbsp;I shall never forget the severe and sorrowful expression of his eyes, over which his heavy eyebrows hung low. \u0026nbsp;“Are there many English in Jerusalem?” he asked. \u0026nbsp;“A good many,” I replied; “there always are at Easter.” \u0026nbsp;“Can you tell me anything of any of them?” he asked. \u0026nbsp;“Not a word,” said I, for I knew no one; “but our consul can.” \u0026nbsp;And then we bowed to each other and he passed on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I got off my horse and scrambled down on foot after Smith. \u0026nbsp;I found him gathering berries and bushes as though his very soul were mad with botany;

but the desire to do so never comes till I have well eaten and drunken. \u0026nbsp;A bottle of French wine, three or four cutlets of goats’ flesh, an omelet made out of the freshest eggs, and an enormous dish of oranges, was the banquet set before me; and though I might have found fault with it in Paris or London, I thought that it did well enough in Jaffa. \u0026nbsp;My poor friend could not join me, but had a cup of coffee in his room. \u0026nbsp;“At any rate take a little brandy in it,” I said to him, as I stood over his bed. \u0026nbsp;“I could not swallow it,” said he, looking at me with almost beseeching eyes. \u0026nbsp;“Beshrew the fellow,” I said to myself as I left him, carefully closing the door, so that the sound should not shake him;

but I did love him, as though he were a younger brother. \u0026nbsp;I felt a delight in serving him, and though I was almost old enough to be his father, I ministered to him as though he had been an old man, or a woman.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the following morning we were stirring at daybreak, and found that the vessel was in sight. \u0026nbsp;She would be in the roads off the town in two hours’ time, they said, and would start at eleven or twelve. \u0026nbsp;And then we walked round by the gate of the town, and sauntered a quarter of a mile or so along the way that leads towards Jerusalem. \u0026nbsp;I could see that his eye was anxiously turned down the road, but he said nothing. \u0026nbsp;We saw no cloud of dust, and then we returned to breakfast.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The steamer has come to anchor,” said our dirty Polish host to us in execrable English. \u0026nbsp;“And we may be off on board,” said Smith. \u0026nbsp;“Not yet,” he said; “they must put their cargo out first.” \u0026nbsp;I saw, however, that Smith was uneasy, and I made up my mind to go off to the vessel at once. \u0026nbsp;When they should see an English portmanteau making an offer to come up the gangway, the Austrian sailors would not stop it. \u0026nbsp;So I called for the bill, and ordered that the things should be taken down to the wretched broken heap of rotten timber which they called a quay. \u0026nbsp;Smith had not told me his story, but no doubt he would as soon as he was on board.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I was in the act of squabbling with the Pole over the last demand for piastres, when we heard a noise in the gateway of the inn, and I saw Smith’s countenance become pale. \u0026nbsp;It was an Englishman’s voice asking if there were any strangers there; so I went into the courtyard, closing the door behind me, and turning the key upon the landlord and Smith. \u0026nbsp;“Smith,” said I to myself, “will keep the Pole quiet if he have any wit left.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man who had asked the question had the air of an upper English servant, and I thought that I recognised one of those whom I had seen with the old gentleman on the road; but the matter was soon put at rest by the appearance of that gentleman himself. \u0026nbsp;He walked up into the courtyard, looked hard at me from under those bushy eyebrows, just raised his hat, and then—said, “I believe I am speaking to Mr. Jones.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” said I, “I am Mr. Jones. \u0026nbsp;Can I have the honour of serving you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was something peculiarly unpleasant about this man’s face. \u0026nbsp;At the present moment I examined it closely, and could understand the great aversion which his nephew felt towards him. \u0026nbsp;He looked like a gentleman and like a man of talent, nor was there anything of meanness in his face; neither was he ill-looking, in the usual acceptation of the word; but one could see that he was solemn, austere, and overbearing; that he would be incapable of any light enjoyment, and unforgiving towards all offences. \u0026nbsp;I took him to be a man who, being old himself, could never remember that he had been young, and who, therefore, hated the levities of youth. \u0026nbsp;To me such a character is specially odious; for I would fain, if it be possible, be young even to my grave. \u0026nbsp;Smith, if he were clever, might escape from the window of the room, which opened out upon a terrace, and still get down to the steamer. \u0026nbsp;I would keep the old man in play for some time; and, even though I lost my passage, would be true to my friend. \u0026nbsp;There lay our joint luggage at my feet in the yard. \u0026nbsp;If Smith would venture away without his portion of it, all might yet be right.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My name, sir, is Sir William Weston,” he began. \u0026nbsp;I had heard of the name before, and knew him to be a man of wealth, and family, and note. \u0026nbsp;I took off my hat, and said that I had much honour in meeting Sir William Weston.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And I presume you know the object with which I am now here,” he continued.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not exactly,” said I. \u0026nbsp;“Nor do I understand how I possibly should know it, seeing that, up to this moment, I did not even know your name, and have heard nothing concerning either your movements or your affairs.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sir,” said he, “I have hitherto believed that I might at any rate expect from you the truth.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sir,” said I, “I am bold to think that you will not dare to tell me, either now, or at any other time, that you have received, or expect to receive, from me anything that is not true.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He then stood still, looking at me for a moment or two, and I beg to assert that I looked as fully at him. \u0026nbsp;There was, at any rate, no cause why I should tremble before him. \u0026nbsp;I was not his nephew, nor was I responsible for his nephew’s doings towards him. \u0026nbsp;Two of his servants were behind him, and on my side there stood a boy and girl belonging to the inn. \u0026nbsp;They, however, could not understand a word of English. \u0026nbsp;I saw that he was hesitating, but at last he spoke out. \u0026nbsp;I confess, now, that his words, when they were spoken, did, at the first moment, make me tremble.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have to charge you,” said he, “with eloping with my niece, and I demand of you to inform me where she is. \u0026nbsp;You are perfectly aware that I am her guardian by law.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I did tremble;—not that I cared much for Sir William’s guardianship, but I saw before me so terrible an embarrassment! \u0026nbsp;And then I felt so thoroughly abashed in that I had allowed myself to be so deceived! \u0026nbsp;It all came back upon me in a moment, and covered me with a shame that even made me blush. \u0026nbsp;I had travelled through the desert with a woman for days, and had not discovered her, though she had given me a thousand signs. \u0026nbsp;All those signs I remembered now, and I blushed painfully. \u0026nbsp;When her hand was on my forehead I still thought that she was a man! \u0026nbsp;I declare that at this moment I felt a stronger disinclination to face my late companion than I did to encounter her angry uncle.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Your niece!” I said, speaking with a sheepish bewilderment which should have convinced him at once of my innocence. \u0026nbsp;She had asked me, too, whether I was a married man, and I had denied it. \u0026nbsp;How was I to escape from such a mess of misfortunes? \u0026nbsp;I declare that I began to forget her troubles in my own.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, my niece,—Miss Julia Weston. \u0026nbsp;The disgrace which you have brought upon me must be wiped out;

but, till told by you, he knew nothing of my secret. \u0026nbsp;Nor would he have known it,” she added, looking down upon the ground. \u0026nbsp;As to that latter assertion, I was at liberty to believe as much as I pleased.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Pole now came to the door, informing us that any who wished to start by the packet must go on board, and therefore, as the unreasonable old gentleman perceived, it was necessary that we should all make our arrangements. \u0026nbsp;I cannot say that they were such as enable me to look back on them with satisfaction. \u0026nbsp;He did seem now at last to believe that I had been an unconscious agent in his niece’s stratagem, but he hardly on that account became civil to me. \u0026nbsp;“It was absolutely necessary,” he said, “that he and that unfortunate young woman,” as he would call her, “should depart at once,—by this ship now going.” \u0026nbsp;To this proposition of course I made no opposition. \u0026nbsp;“And you, Mr. Jones,” he continued, “will at once perceive that you, as a gentleman, should allow us to proceed on our journey without the honour of your company.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was very dreadful, but what could I say; or, indeed, what could I do? \u0026nbsp;My most earnest desire in the matter was to save Miss Weston from annoyance; and under existing circumstances my presence on board could not but be a burden to her. \u0026nbsp;And then, if I went,—if I did go, in opposition to the wishes of the baronet, could I trust my own prudence? \u0026nbsp;It was better for all parties that I should remain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sir William,” said I, after a minute’s consideration, “if you will apologise to me for the gross insults you have offered me, it shall be as you say.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. Jones,” said Sir William, “I do apologise for the words which I used to you while I was labouring under a very natural misconception of the circumstances.” \u0026nbsp;I do not know that I was much the better for the apology, but at the moment I regarded it sufficient.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Their things were then hurried down to the strand, and I accompanied them to the ruined quay. \u0026nbsp;I took off my hat to Sir William as he was first let down into the boat. \u0026nbsp;He descended first, so that he might receive his niece,—for all Jaffa now knew that it was a lady,—and then I gave her my hand for the last time. \u0026nbsp;“God bless you, Miss Weston,” I said, pressing it closely. \u0026nbsp;“God bless you, Mr. Jones,” she replied. \u0026nbsp;And from that day to this I have neither spoken to her nor seen her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I waited a fortnight at Jaffa for the French boat, eating cutlets of goat’s flesh, and wandering among the orange groves. \u0026nbsp;I certainly look back on that fortnight as the most miserable period of my life. \u0026nbsp;I had been deceived, and had failed to discover the deceit, even though the deceiver had perhaps wished that I should do so. \u0026nbsp;For that blindness I have never forgiven myself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe End\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2908/80038.html","bookId":1100,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:06:53 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:06:53 AM"}
