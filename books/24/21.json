{"id":694,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER II HORN","content":"\"No, sir,\" said Mudd, \"he don\u0027t take scarcely anything in the bar of the hotel, but he was sitting last night till closing-time in the Bricklayer\u0027s Arms.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, that\u0027s where he was,\" said Bobby. \"How did you find out?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, sir,\" said Mudd, \"I was in there myself in the parlour, having a drop of hot water and gin with a bit of lemon in it. It\u0027s a decent house, and the servants\u0027 room in this hotel don\u0027t please me, nor Mr. Anderson\u0027s man. I was sitting there smoking my pipe when in he came to the bar outside. I heard his voice. Down he sits and talks quite friendly with the folk there and orders a pint of beer all round. Quite affable and friendly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, there\u0027s no harm in that,\" said Bobby. \"I\u0027ve often done the same in a country inn. Did he stick to beer?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He did,\" said Mudd grimly. \"He\u0027d got that ten-pound note I was fool enough to let him[Pg 201] have. Yes, he stuck to beer, and so did the chaps he was treating.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The funny thing is,\" said Bobby, \"that though he knows we have his money—and, begad, there\u0027s nearly eleven thousand of it—he doesn\u0027t kick at our taking it—he must have known we cut open that portmanteau—but comes to you for money like a schoolboy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s what he is,\" said Mudd. \"It\u0027s my belief, Mr. Robert, that he\u0027s getting younger and younger; he\u0027s artful as a child after sweets. And he knows we\u0027re looking after him, I believe, and he doesn\u0027t mind, for it\u0027s part of his amusement to give us the slip. Well, as I was saying, there he sat talking away and all these village chaps listening to him as if he was the Sultan of Turkey laying down the law. That\u0027s what pleased him. He likes being the middle of everything; and as the beer went down the talk went up—till he was telling them he\u0027d been at the battle of Waterloo.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good Lord!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They didn\u0027t know no different,\" said Mudd, \"but it made me crawl to listen to him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The bother is,\" said Bobby, \"that we are dealing, not only with a young man, but with the sort of young man who was young forty years ago. That\u0027s our trouble, Mudd; we can\u0027t[Pg 202] calculate on what he\u0027ll do because we haven\u0027t the data. And another bother is that his foolishness seems to have increased by being bottled so long, like old beer, but he can\u0027t come to harm with the villagers, they\u0027re an innocent lot.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are they?\" said Mudd. \"One of the chaps he was talking to was a gallows-looking chap. Horn\u0027s his name, and a poacher he is, I believe. Then there\u0027s the blacksmith and a squint-eyed chap that calls himself a butcher; the pair of them aren\u0027t up to much. Innocent lot! Why, if you had the stories Mr. Anderson\u0027s man has told me about this village the hair would rise on your head. Why, London\u0027s a girl-school to these country villages, if all\u0027s true one hears. No, Mr. Robert, he wants looking after here more than anywhere, and it seems to me the only person who has any real hold on him is the young lady.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Miss Rossignol?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, Mr. Robert, he\u0027s gone on her in his foolish way, and she can twist him round her finger like a child. When he\u0027s with her he\u0027s a different person, out of sight of her he\u0027s another man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look here, Mudd,\" said the other, \"he can\u0027t be in love with her, for there\u0027s not a girl he sees he doesn\u0027t cast his eye after.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe,\" said Mudd, \"but when he\u0027s with her he\u0027s in love with her; I\u0027ve been watching him and I know. He worships her, I believe, and if she wasn\u0027t so sensible I\u0027d be afeard of it. It\u0027s a blessing he came across her; she\u0027s the only hold on him, and a good hold she is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is a blessing,\" said Bobby. Then, after a pause, \"Mudd, you\u0027ve always been a good friend of mine, and this business has made me know what you really are. I\u0027m bothered about something—I\u0027m in love with her myself. There, you have it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"With Miss Rossignol?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, you might choose worse,\" said Mudd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But that\u0027s not all,\" said Bobby. \"There\u0027s another girl—Mudd, I\u0027ve been a damn fool.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ve all been fools in our time,\" said Mudd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know, but it\u0027s jolly unpleasant when one\u0027s follies come home to roost on one. She\u0027s a nice girl enough, Miss Delyse, but I don\u0027t care for her. Yet somehow I\u0027ve got mixed up with her—not exactly engaged, but very near it. It all happened in a moment, and she\u0027s coming down here; I had a letter from her this morning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Lord!\" said Mudd, \"another mixture. As if there wasn\u0027t enough of us in the business!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s a good name for it, \u0027business.\u0027 I feel as if I was helping to run a sort of beastly factory, a mad sort of show where we\u0027re trying to condense folly and make it consume its own smoke—an illicit whisky-still, for we\u0027re trying to hide our business all the time, and it gives me the jim-jams to think that at any moment a client may turn up and see him like that. I feel sometimes, Mudd, as fellows must feel when they have the police after them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t talk of the police,\" said Mudd, \"the very word gives me the shivers. When is she coming, Mr. Robert?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Miss Delyse? She\u0027s coming by the 3.15 train to-day to Farnborough station, and I\u0027ve got to meet her. I\u0027ve just booked her a room here. You see how I am tied. If I was here alone she couldn\u0027t come, because it wouldn\u0027t be proper, but having him here makes it proper.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you told her the state he\u0027s in?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. She doesn\u0027t mind; she said she wished everyone else was the same—she said it was beautiful.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were talking in Bobby\u0027s room, which overlooked the garden of the hotel, and glancing out of the window now, he saw Cerise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he detached himself from Mudd. He reached her as she was passing through the little[Pg 205] rambler-roofed alley that leads from the garden to the bowling-green. There is an arbour in the garden tucked away in a corner, and there is an arbour close to the bowling-green; there are several other arbours, for the hotel-planner was an expert in his work, but these are the only two arbours that have to do with our story.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bobby caught up with the girl before she had reached the green, and they walked together towards it, chatting as young people only can chat with life and gaiety about nothing. They were astonishingly well-matched in mind. Minds have colours just like eyes; there are black minds and brown minds and muddy-coloured minds and grey minds, and blue minds. Bobby\u0027s was a blue mind, though, indeed, it sometimes almost seemed green. Cerise\u0027s was blue, a happy blue like the blue of her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They had been two and a half days now in pretty close propinquity, and had got to know each other well despite Uncle Simon, or rather, perhaps, because of him. They discussed him freely and without reserve, and they were discussing him now, as the following extraordinary conversation will show.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s good, as you say,\" said Bobby, \"but he\u0027s more trouble to me than a child.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Said Cerise: \"Shall I tell you a little secret?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You will promise me surely, most surely, you will never tell my little secret?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I swear.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is in loff with me—I thought it was maman, but it is me.\" A ripple of laughter that caught the echo of the bowling-alley followed this confession.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Last night he said to me before dinner, \u0027Cerise, I loff you.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what did you say?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then the dinner-gong rang,\" said Cerise, \"and I said, \u0027Oh, Monsieur Pattigrew, I must run and change my dress.\u0027 Then I ran off. I did not want to change my dress, but I did want to change the conversation,\" finished Cerise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then with a smile, \"He loffs me more than any of the other girls.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, how do you know he loves other girls?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have seen him look at girls,\" said Cerise. \"He likes all the world, but girls he likes most.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you in love with him, Cerise?\" asked Bobby, with a grin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" said Cerise candidly. \"Who could help?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How much are you in love with him, Cerise?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I would walk to London for him without my shoes,\" said Cerise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, that\u0027s something,\" said Bobby. \"Come into this little arbour, Cerise, and let\u0027s sit down. You don\u0027t mind my smoking?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not one bit\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s good to have anyone love one like that,\" said he, lighting a cigarette.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He draws it from me,\" said Cerise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I must say he\u0027s more likeable as he is than as he was; you should have seen him before he got young, Cerise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He was always good,\" said she, as though speaking from sure knowledge; \"always good and kind and sweet.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He managed to hide it,\" said Bobby.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah yes—maybe so—there are many old gentlemen who seem rough and not nice, and then underneath it is different.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How would you like to marry uncle?\" asked he, laughing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If he were young outside as he is young inside of him—why, then I do not know. I might—I might not.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the unfortunate young man, forgetting all things, even the approaching Julia, let his voice fall half a tone; he wandered from Uncle;[Pg 208] Simon into the question of the beauty of the roses.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The conversation flagged a bit, then he was holding one of her fingers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then came steps on the gravel. A servant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The fly is ready to take you to the station, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was three o\u0027clock.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1832/53122.html","bookId":24,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:31:01 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:31:01 AM"}
