The word was lodged in Yan Tovis’s throat like shards of glass. She could taste blood in her mouth, and all that had seeped down into her stomach seemed to have solidified into something fist-sized, heavy as stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shore invited her, reached out and clawed at her with its need. A need it yearned to share with her. You stand with me, Queen. As you once did, as you shall do again. You are the Shake and the Shake are of the Shore, and I have tasted your blood all my life .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen, I thirst again. Against this enemy, there shall be Rightness upon the Shore, and you will stand, and you will yield not a step .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was betrayal, long ago. How could the Liosan forget? How could they set it aside? Judgement, the coarse, thorn-studded brambles of retribution, they could snag an entire people, and as the blood streamed down each body was lifted higher, lifted from the ground. The vicious snare carried them into the righteous sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReason could not reach that high, and in the heavens madness spun untamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRightness rages on both sides of the wall. Who can hope to halt what is coming? Not the Queen of Darkness, not the queen of the Shake. Not Yedan Derryg – oh no, my brother strains for that moment. He draws his wretched sword again and again. He smiles at the Lightfall’s lurid play on the blade. He stands before the silent shrieking insanity of hatred made manifest, and he does not flinch .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, and this was the impossible contradiction, her brother had not once in his life felt a single spasm of hatred – his soul was implacably incapable of such an emotion. He could stand in the fire and not burn. He could stand before those deformed faces, those grasping hands, and … and … nothing .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Yedan, what waits within you? Have you surrendered completely to the need of the Shore? Are you one with it? Do you know a single moment of doubt? Does it? She could understand the seductive lure of that invitation. Absolution through surrender, the utter abjection of the self. She understood it, yes, but she did not trust it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen that which offers blessing predicates such on the absolute obeisance of the supplicant … demands, in fact, the soul’s willing enslavement – no, how could such a force stand tall in moral probity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shore demands our surrender to it. Demands our enslavement in the glory of its love, the sweet purity of its eternal blessing .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is something wrong with that. Something … monstrous. You offer us the freedom of choice, yet avow that to turn away is to lose all hope of glory, of salvation. What sort of freedom is that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had held that her faith in the Shore set her above other worshippers, those quivering mortals kneeling before fickle carnate gods. The Shore was without a face. The Shore was not a god, but an idea, the eternal conversation of elemental forces. Changeable, yet for ever unchangeable, the binding of life and death itself. Not something to be bargained with, not a thing with personality, mercurial and prone to spite. The Shore, she had believed, made no demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now here she was, feeling the desiccated wind rising up from the bone strand, watching her brother speaking to Pithy, seeing her brother less than a stride away from Lightfall’s terrible fury, drawing his sword again and again. And the First Shore howled in her soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere! Blessed Daughter, I am here and with me you belong! See this wound. You and I shall close it. My bones, your blood. The death underfoot, the life with sword in hand. You shall be my flesh. I shall be your bone. Together we will stand. Changeable and unchangeable .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFree and enslaved .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure edged up on her right, and then another on her left. She looked to neither.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one on the right crooned something melodic and wordless, and then said, ‘Ween decided, Queen. Skwish to stand with the Watch, an mine to stand with you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘An the Shore an the day,’ added Skwish. ‘Lissen to it sing!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePully moaned again. ‘Y’ain knelled afore the Shore, Highness. Y’ain done it yet. An be sure y’need to, afore the breach comes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Een the queen’s got to srender,’ said Skwish. ‘T’the Shore.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrumbled bones into chains. Freedom into slavery. Why did we ever agree to this bargain? It was never equal. The blood was ours, not the Shore’s. Errant fend, even the bones came from us!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmpty Throne, my certainty is … gone. My faith … crumbles .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t my people deserve better?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePully snorted. ‘Single droppa Shake inem, they hear the song. They yearn t’come, t’stand—’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-65.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
