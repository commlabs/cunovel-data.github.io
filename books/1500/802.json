Persephone not only possessed beauty and intelligence, her acting skills could also be said to be unmatched.

Only, when their eyes moved past Persephone’s hands that seemed perfect even with the gloves on, as well as the enormous pistol strapped to her thigh, what flashed past their eyes wasn’t a look of shock, but fear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThat pistol was a bit similar to a Magnum, but it was far more than a single size larger than a Magnum, its 30mm caliber completely machine gun ammunition. Its cylinder could only carry three rounds of bullets, the bullets all handmade, special bullets, every one of them unique. Under close distance, this toy was completely unmatched.
