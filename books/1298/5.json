{"id":27214,"no":5,"title":"ACT IV","content":"The Wimpole Street laboratory. Midnight. Nobody in the room. The clock on the mantelpiece strikes twelve. The fire is not alight: it is a summer night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently Higgins and Pickering are heard on the stairs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [calling down to Pickering] I say, Pick: lock up, will you. I shan\u0027t be going out again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PICKERING. Right. Can Mrs. Pearce go to bed? We don\u0027t want anything more, do we?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. Lord, no!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eliza opens the door and is seen on the lighted landing in opera cloak, brilliant evening dress, and diamonds, with fan, flowers, and all accessories. She comes to the hearth, and switches on the electric lights there. She is tired: her pallor contrasts strongly with her dark eyes and hair; and her expression is almost tragic. She takes off her cloak; puts her fan and flowers on the piano; and sits down on the bench, brooding and silent. Higgins, in evening dress, with overcoat and hat, comes in, carrying a smoking jacket which he has picked up downstairs. He takes off the hat and overcoat; throws them carelessly on the newspaper stand; disposes of his coat in the same way; puts on the smoking jacket; and throws himself wearily into the easy-chair at the hearth. Pickering, similarly attired, comes in. He also takes off his hat and overcoat, and is about to throw them on Higgins\u0027s when he hesitates.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PICKERING. I say: Mrs. Pearce will row if we leave these things lying about in the drawing-room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. Oh, chuck them over the bannisters into the hall. She\u0027ll find them there in the morning and put them away all right. She\u0027ll think we were drunk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PICKERING. We are, slightly. Are there any letters?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. I didn\u0027t look. [Pickering takes the overcoats and hats and goes down stairs. Higgins begins half singing half yawning an air from La Fanciulla del Golden West. Suddenly he stops and exclaims] I wonder where the devil my slippers are!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eliza looks at him darkly; then leaves the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Higgins yawns again, and resumes his song. Pickering returns, with the contents of the letter-box in his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PICKERING. Only circulars, and this coroneted billet-doux for you. [He throws the circulars into the fender, and posts himself on the hearthrug, with his back to the grate].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [glancing at the billet-doux] Money-lender. [He throws the letter after the circulars].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eliza returns with a pair of large down-at-heel slippers. She places them on the carpet before Higgins, and sits as before without a word.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [yawning again] Oh Lord! What an evening! What a crew! What a silly tomfoollery! [He raises his shoe to unlace it, and catches sight of the slippers. He stops unlacing and looks at them as if they had appeared there of their own accord]. Oh! they\u0027re there, are they?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PICKERING [stretching himself] Well, I feel a bit tired. It\u0027s been a long day. The garden party, a dinner party, and the opera! Rather too much of a good thing. But you\u0027ve won your bet, Higgins. Eliza did the trick, and something to spare, eh?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [fervently] Thank God it\u0027s over!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eliza flinches violently; but they take no notice of her; and she recovers herself and sits stonily as before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PICKERING. Were you nervous at the garden party? I was. Eliza didn\u0027t seem a bit nervous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. Oh, she wasn\u0027t nervous. I knew she\u0027d be all right. No, it\u0027s the strain of putting the job through all these months that has told on me. It was interesting enough at first, while we were at the phonetics; but after that I got deadly sick of it. If I hadn\u0027t backed myself to do it I should have chucked the whole thing up two months ago. It was a silly notion: the whole thing has been a bore.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PICKERING. Oh come! the garden party was frightfully exciting. My heart began beating like anything.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. Yes, for the first three minutes. But when I saw we were going to win hands down, I felt like a bear in a cage, hanging about doing nothing. The dinner was worse: sitting gorging there for over an hour, with nobody but a damned fool of a fashionable woman to talk to! I tell you, Pickering, never again for me. No more artificial duchesses. The whole thing has been simple purgatory.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PICKERING. You\u0027ve never been broken in properly to the social routine. [Strolling over to the piano] I rather enjoy dipping into it occasionally myself: it makes me feel young again. Anyhow, it was a great success: an immense success. I was quite frightened once or twice because Eliza was doing it so well. You see, lots of the real people can\u0027t do it at all: they\u0027re such fools that they think style comes by nature to people in their position; and so they never learn. There\u0027s always something professional about doing a thing superlatively well.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. Yes: that\u0027s what drives me mad: the silly people don\u0027t know their own silly business. [Rising] However, it\u0027s over and done with; and now I can go to bed at last without dreading tomorrow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eliza\u0027s beauty becomes murderous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PICKERING. I think I shall turn in too. Still, it\u0027s been a great occasion: a triumph for you. Good-night. [He goes].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [following him] Good-night. [Over his shoulder, at the door] Put out the lights, Eliza; and tell Mrs. Pearce not to make coffee for me in the morning: I\u0027ll take tea. [He goes out].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eliza tries to control herself and feel indifferent as she rises and walks across to the hearth to switch off the lights. By the time she gets there she is on the point of screaming. She sits down in Higgins\u0027s chair and holds on hard to the arms. Finally she gives way and flings herself furiously on the floor raging.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [in despairing wrath outside] What the devil have I done with my slippers? [He appears at the door].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA [snatching up the slippers, and hurling them at him one after the other with all her force] There are your slippers. And there. Take your slippers; and may you never have a day\u0027s luck with them!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [astounded] What on earth—! [He comes to her]. What\u0027s the matter? Get up. [He pulls her up]. Anything wrong?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA [breathless] Nothing wrong—with YOU. I\u0027ve won your bet for you, haven\u0027t I? That\u0027s enough for you. I don\u0027t matter, I suppose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. YOU won my bet! You! Presumptuous insect! I won it. What did you throw those slippers at me for?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. Because I wanted to smash your face. I\u0027d like to kill you, you selfish brute. Why didn\u0027t you leave me where you picked me out of—in the gutter? You thank God it\u0027s all over, and that now you can throw me back again there, do you? [She crisps her fingers, frantically].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [looking at her in cool wonder] The creature IS nervous, after all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA [gives a suffocated scream of fury, and instinctively darts her nails at his face]!!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [catching her wrists] Ah! would you? Claws in, you cat. How dare you show your temper to me? Sit down and be quiet. [He throws her roughly into the easy-chair].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA [crushed by superior strength and weight] What\u0027s to become of me? What\u0027s to become of me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. How the devil do I know what\u0027s to become of you? What does it matter what becomes of you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. You don\u0027t care. I know you don\u0027t care. You wouldn\u0027t care if I was dead. I\u0027m nothing to you—not so much as them slippers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [thundering] THOSE slippers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA [with bitter submission] Those slippers. I didn\u0027t think it made any difference now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A pause. Eliza hopeless and crushed. Higgins a little uneasy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [in his loftiest manner] Why have you begun going on like this? May I ask whether you complain of your treatment here?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. No.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. Has anybody behaved badly to you? Colonel Pickering? Mrs. Pearce? Any of the servants?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. No.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. I presume you don\u0027t pretend that I have treated you badly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. No.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. I am glad to hear it. [He moderates his tone]. Perhaps you\u0027re tired after the strain of the day. Will you have a glass of champagne? [He moves towards the door].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. No. [Recollecting her manners] Thank you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [good-humored again] This has been coming on you for some days. I suppose it was natural for you to be anxious about the garden party. But that\u0027s all over now. [He pats her kindly on the shoulder. She writhes]. There\u0027s nothing more to worry about.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. No. Nothing more for you to worry about. [She suddenly rises and gets away from him by going to the piano bench, where she sits and hides her face]. Oh God! I wish I was dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [staring after her in sincere surprise] Why? in heaven\u0027s name, why? [Reasonably, going to her] Listen to me, Eliza. All this irritation is purely subjective.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. I don\u0027t understand. I\u0027m too ignorant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. It\u0027s only imagination. Low spirits and nothing else. Nobody\u0027s hurting you. Nothing\u0027s wrong. You go to bed like a good girl and sleep it off. Have a little cry and say your prayers: that will make you comfortable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. I heard YOUR prayers. \"Thank God it\u0027s all over!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [impatiently] Well, don\u0027t you thank God it\u0027s all over? Now you are free and can do what you like.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA [pulling herself together in desperation] What am I fit for? What have you left me fit for? Where am I to go? What am I to do? What\u0027s to become of me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [enlightened, but not at all impressed] Oh, that\u0027s what\u0027s worrying you, is it? [He thrusts his hands into his pockets, and walks about in his usual manner, rattling the contents of his pockets, as if condescending to a trivial subject out of pure kindness]. I shouldn\u0027t bother about it if I were you. I should imagine you won\u0027t have much difficulty in settling yourself, somewhere or other, though I hadn\u0027t quite realized that you were going away. [She looks quickly at him: he does not look at her, but examines the dessert stand on the piano and decides that he will eat an apple]. You might marry, you know. [He bites a large piece out of the apple, and munches it noisily]. You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel. Most men are the marrying sort (poor devils!); and you\u0027re not bad-looking; it\u0027s quite a pleasure to look at you sometimes—not now, of course, because you\u0027re crying and looking as ugly as the very devil; but when you\u0027re all right and quite yourself, you\u0027re what I should call attractive. That is, to the people in the marrying line, you understand. You go to bed and have a good nice rest; and then get up and look at yourself in the glass; and you won\u0027t feel so cheap.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eliza again looks at him, speechless, and does not stir.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The look is quite lost on him: he eats his apple with a dreamy expression of happiness, as it is quite a good one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [a genial afterthought occurring to him] I daresay my mother could find some chap or other who would do very well—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. We were above that at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [waking up] What do you mean?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. I sold flowers. I didn\u0027t sell myself. Now you\u0027ve made a lady of me I\u0027m not fit to sell anything else. I wish you\u0027d left me where you found me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [slinging the core of the apple decisively into the grate] Tosh, Eliza. Don\u0027t you insult human relations by dragging all this cant about buying and selling into it. You needn\u0027t marry the fellow if you don\u0027t like him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. What else am I to do?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. Oh, lots of things. What about your old idea of a florist\u0027s shop? Pickering could set you up in one: he\u0027s lots of money. [Chuckling] He\u0027ll have to pay for all those togs you have been wearing today; and that, with the hire of the jewellery, will make a big hole in two hundred pounds. Why, six months ago you would have thought it the millennium to have a flower shop of your own. Come! you\u0027ll be all right. I must clear off to bed: I\u0027m devilish sleepy. By the way, I came down for something: I forget what it was.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. Your slippers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. Oh yes, of course. You shied them at me. [He picks them up, and is going out when she rises and speaks to him].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. Before you go, sir—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [dropping the slippers in his surprise at her calling him sir] Eh?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. Do my clothes belong to me or to Colonel Pickering?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [coming back into the room as if her question were the very climax of unreason] What the devil use would they be to Pickering?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. He might want them for the next girl you pick up to experiment on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [shocked and hurt] Is THAT the way you feel towards us?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. I don\u0027t want to hear anything more about that. All I want to know is whether anything belongs to me. My own clothes were burnt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. But what does it matter? Why need you start bothering about that in the middle of the night?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. I want to know what I may take away with me. I don\u0027t want to be accused of stealing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [now deeply wounded] Stealing! You shouldn\u0027t have said that, Eliza. That shows a want of feeling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m only a common ignorant girl; and in my station I have to be careful. There can\u0027t be any feelings between the like of you and the like of me. Please will you tell me what belongs to me and what doesn\u0027t?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [very sulky] You may take the whole damned houseful if you like. Except the jewels. They\u0027re hired. Will that satisfy you? [He turns on his heel and is about to go in extreme dudgeon].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA [drinking in his emotion like nectar, and nagging him to provoke a further supply] Stop, please. [She takes off her jewels]. Will you take these to your room and keep them safe? I don\u0027t want to run the risk of their being missing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [furious] Hand them over. [She puts them into his hands]. If these belonged to me instead of to the jeweler, I\u0027d ram them down your ungrateful throat. [He perfunctorily thrusts them into his pockets, unconsciously decorating himself with the protruding ends of the chains].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA [taking a ring off] This ring isn\u0027t the jeweler\u0027s: it\u0027s the one you bought me in Brighton. I don\u0027t want it now. [Higgins dashes the ring violently into the fireplace, and turns on her so threateningly that she crouches over the piano with her hands over her face, and exclaims] Don\u0027t you hit me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS. Hit you! You infamous creature, how dare you accuse me of such a thing? It is you who have hit me. You have wounded me to the heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA [thrilling with hidden joy] I\u0027m glad. I\u0027ve got a little of my own back, anyhow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [with dignity, in his finest professional style] You have caused me to lose my temper: a thing that has hardly ever happened to me before. I prefer to say nothing more tonight. I am going to bed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LIZA [pertly] You\u0027d better leave a note for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee; for she won\u0027t be told by me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e HIGGINS [formally] Damn Mrs. Pearce; and damn the coffee; and damn you; and damn my own folly in having lavished MY hard-earned knowledge and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe. [He goes out with impressive decorum, and spoils it by slamming the door savagely].\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eliza smiles for the first time; expresses her feelings by a wild pantomime in which an imitation of Higgins\u0027s exit is confused with her own triumph; and finally goes down on her knees on the hearthrug to look for the ring. \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1548/45983.html","bookId":1298,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 1:49:25 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 1:49:25 AM"}
