I mean - don\u0027t be surprised if he doesn\u0027t show any emotion.\" She desperately wanted Jeff to like Kemal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff sensed her anxiety. \"Don\u0027t worry, darling. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s a wonderful boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here it comes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked up and watched the small speck in the sky grow larger and larger until it became a shining 747.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana squeezed Jeff\u0027s hand tightly. \"He\u0027s here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe passengers were deplaning. Dana watched anxiously as they exited one by one. \"Where\u0027s - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there he was. He was dressed in the outfit that Dana had bought him in Sarajevo, and his face was freshly washed. He came down the ramp slowly, and when he saw Dana, he stopped. The two of them stood there, motionless, staring at each other. And then they were running toward each other, and Dana was holding him, and his good arm was squeezing her tightly, and they were both crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana found her voice, she said, \"Welcome to America, Kemal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. He could not speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kemal, I want you to meet my friend. This is Jeff Connors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff leaned down. \"Hello, Kemal. I\u0027ve been hearing a lot about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal clung to Dana fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be coming to live with me,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal nodded. He would not let go of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana looked at her watch. \"We have to leave. I\u0027m covering a speech at the White House.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a perfect day. The sky was a deep, clear blue, and a cooling breeze was blowing in from the Potomac River.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood in the Rose Garden, with three dozen other television and newspaper reporters. Dana\u0027s camera was focused on the president, who stood on a podium with Jan at his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresident Oliver Russell was saying, \"I have an important announcement to make. At this moment, there is a meeting of the heads of state of the United Arab Emirates, Libya, Iran, and Syria, to discuss a lasting peace treaty with Israel. I received word this morning that the meeting is going extremely well and that the treaty should be signed within the next day or two. It is of the utmost importance that the Congress of the United States solidly support us in helping this vital effort.\" Oliver turned to the man standing next to him. \"Senator Todd Davis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenator Davis stepped up to the microphone, wearing his trademark white suit and white, broad-brimmed leghorn hat, beaming at the crowd. \"This is truly a historic moment in the history of our great country. For many years, as you know, I have been striving to bring about peace between Israel and the Arab countries. It has been a long and difficult task, but now, at last, with the help and guidance of our wonderful president, I am happy to say that our efforts are finally coming to fruition.\" He turned to Oliver. \"We should all congratulate our great president on the magnificent part he has played in helping us to bring this about...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana was thinking, One war is coming to an end. Perhaps this is a beginning. Maybe one day we\u0027ll have a world where adults learn to settle their problems with love instead of hate, a world where children can grow up without ever hearing the obscene sounds of bombs and machine-gun fire, without fear of their limbs being torn apart by faceless strangers. She turned to look at Kemal, who was excitedly whispering to Jeff. Dana smiled. Jeff had proposed to her. Kemal would have a father. They were going to be a family. How did I get so lucky? Dana wondered. The speeches were winding down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cameraman swung the camera away from the podium and moved into a close-up of Dana. She looked into the lens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Dana Evans, reporting for WTE, Washington, D.C.\"\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-best-laid-plans/page-25.html","bookId":2367,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:22 AM"}
