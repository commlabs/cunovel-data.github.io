Then, there was a crash from the room next to us, metal and glass like something big and heavy had been knocked over. Amy screamed. Molly barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to my feet once more, wearing the Anna monster like a writhing backpack. I found a wall and slammed backward into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t budge. Somebody was screaming my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a door burst open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ANNA!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a new voice, a man’s voice, with an accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blast of light flooded the room. Everyone froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in the doorway was a Latino guy who I thought looked like Marc Anthony. I knew I had seen him before but in my state of panic, couldn’t place where. He was holding a huge flashlight and he whipped it around the room, first finding Amy, who was still standing next to the dead computer and squinting at the sudden brightness. Then he spotlighted John, who was pointing his shotgun right at my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the light found me, and I felt the tentacle loosen from around my neck. The Anna thing slithered to the floor, and in the harsh shadows of the beam I saw a filthy nightgown tangled around a nightmare wad of tentacles that looked like they were made of knotted clumps of black hair. Somewhere in the center of it was a pair of eyes on either side of a sideways mouth and clicking mandibles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man with the flashlight said, “Anna. Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tentacles started twisting and bundling together, fusing and melting and re-forming. In a few seconds, there was the little girl again. She straightened her nightgown and sniffled and started crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man said again, “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you’re all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the shadows I could see John looking back and forth, between me, the guy, and Anna. He was still pointing the shotgun at me, he realized, and he pointed it at the floor instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo me, the guy said, “Are you all right? You’re David, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She … turned into a … thing…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that. Did she hurt you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The light went off and she got me around the neck…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did she hurt you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna sobbed and said, “He hurt me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy said, “Now Anna, you scared him. You turned and you scared him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t mean to! The lights went out and I c-couldn’t h-help it…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anna, you need to say you’re sorry to David.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna did not agree with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anna…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe defiantly said, “I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo me, he said, “Do you accept her apology, as heartfelt as it clearly wasn’t?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no words. “I … she turned into a … thing…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna started crying in earnest once more. Amy said, “Hey. David.” I turned and out of the darkness, an object came hurtling toward me. I flinched, threw up my hands and squealed. A filthy, stuffed bear bounced off my gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found it on the floor. Handling it like I was passing a piece of meat into a tiger cage, I kneeled and extended the bear toward Anna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flung herself toward me, utilizing her preternatural, little-girl speed. I had no time to react. She flew at me, and threw her arms around my neck. She pressed her wet face against mine and hugged me. She said, “I’m sorry I scared you, Walt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s, uh, okay.” I put an arm around her, and for the tenth time in a week felt like I had become numb to the ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna pried herself away from me, plucked Mr. Bear from my hands and navigated her way through the wrecked room, over to the flashlight man. He kneeled down to catch her, and gave her a kiss on the forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “I … don’t understand. Is she…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is my daughter, Anna. She’s eight years old.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you are…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Carlos.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e50 Minutes Until the Aerial Bombing of Undisclosed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn, reading the expression on my face, said, “You two know each other?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos answered for me, saying, “We were over in quarantine together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “And you are … you’re like her? Right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Not like her. What I mean is, she’s not like me. She won’t hurt you. She hasn’t hurt anybody. Not like me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you are the one who—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not in front of her. But yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you want us to believe that we’re safe. From you, I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is a lot about this situation that you do not understand. In quarantine, they were using you to sort the infected from uninfected, right? But you can’t really do it. Not like I can. Me, I can see them, as easy as telling man from woman. I can see it at a glance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. But I don’t under—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There isn’t time. Let me just say that … I can tell you what I know, but you don’t want to know it. About who is and isn’t infected, I mean. And when I say you don’t want to know, I’m not trying to up the suspense. I am saying that you don’t want to know. It won’t make doing what you need to do any easier. It won’t make it easier for you to live in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to ask a question, but stopped myself. I tried to absorb what he was saying. Finally, I said, “Dr. Marconi … he, uh, hinted to me that there may be more infected than everybody thinks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s say he’s right. Let’s say he’s really, really right. Now we got to ask ourselves what that word means. ‘Infected.’ Infected like me? Or like my Anna here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no answer. I tried to weigh the implications of this, and couldn’t begin to. Molly had joined Anna, and the little girl was scratching her behind the ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or infected like Dr. Bob Tennet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean he’s—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s something else altogether. When I look at him, you know what I see? A black cloud. I don’t even see a man. Do you understand what I’m saying? He’s not a man. And maybe neither am I and maybe that doesn’t mean anything anymore. But I’m going to say this to you, David, and to your friends here—Tennet is more dangerous than a million of me. He and the people he works for, they figured out how to use a signal, inaudible sound waves, to affect people like me. Turn us, make us lose control. I’m telling you, when left to myself, I can control it. The parasite, it whispers in my ear but I can overcome it. You just got to have the will, to put that cockroach in its place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “So we’re supposed to just turn our backs on you and walk out. Knowing all of the people who are—” I glanced down at Anna “—who are, uh, gone, because of you. I’m supposed to just let that go. And you’re going to just, what, go back to work next week? Everything back the way it was?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m all she’s got. Her mother is gone. And she has to deal with her … condition on top of that. Well, she’s going to have a life, the life a little girl should have. And she’s going to learn how to live with this. Who else is going to teach her? Who else will understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded at John and said, “So, what, you want your friend to shoot me with his sawed-off five-barrel shotgun? And then Anna either gets rounded up by the government and dissected in a laboratory, or torn to pieces by that mob out there? No, you won’t do that to her. I know you won’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned and rubbed my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, “Okay, can somebody quickly just summarize for the shotgun department who it’s okay and not okay to shoot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos said, “The world doesn’t make it that simple for us, friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “Yeah, if somebody tries to make a video game based on this situation, I’m telling you right now I’m not fucking buying it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos stood, and took Anna’s hand in his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “And I still don’t … I mean, I didn’t think children could get infected.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dummy, she’s not infected like the rest. She’s been this way for years. This isn’t new. How can you, of all people, not know that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I … I guess I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, “Well, I’m lost.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “Marconi. He had infected patients he was studying, but he had this theory that some of them would literally never turn, that the parasite could just … live there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, “So, what, we just accept that? These invisible bugs multiplying inside people and we just shrug and move on? Knowing that any day any random person can just murder the shit out of a roomful of people?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos just shrugged and said, “That’s been the situation for longer than you know. Way longer. And you need to ask yourself, are you even sure all of you are uninfected?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy said, “We’re sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you? Your man there, he spent a lot of time in town, in quarantine, in the basement of this place. He can’t even account for his own whereabouts for the last week or so. You a hundred percent sure he came out of all that clean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn shrugged and said, “Eh, he wasn’t all that clean before. No offense, Dave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you, John.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Amy, Carlos said, “I’m not joking, you know. How would you truly know—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “She knows what I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But if you were infected you would deny it—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carlos. She knows what I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. Then he nodded and said, “All right, then. Now are you going to let my Anna, and all the rest like her, get burned up in the hellfire they rain down on this place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy said, “We have to stop the bombs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my eyes and sighed. “How can that possibly be our responsibility?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, “There’s a way. Everything Tennet said in his press conference is bullshit. The streets out there aren’t full of shambling hordes. They’re full of all-American types carrying hunting rifles and protecting women and children. The reason Tennet had to lie is because he knew he’d never sell the public on those people being zombies. We just got to show them.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/this-book-is-full-of-spiders-john-dies-at-the-end-2/page-66.html","bookId":2488,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:47 PM"}
