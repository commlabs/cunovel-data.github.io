He lost his personal savings, obviously—just like Vanessa,” Liam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But she’s doing all right?” Sean asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes—maybe because she wasn’t the director of the project. Who knows why certain people wind up suffering and others don’t?” Liam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, say we take on Jay Allen. It might not be a bad thing,” David said. “If we’ve agreed we’re following this trail, why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me a timetable, and I’ll get it all legit through the Bahamian authorities,” Liam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll set up a schedule tomorrow,” Sean said. “We’ll take Jay Allen on with us, mainly because I’d like to interview him when we get to Haunt Island but also because I’d like to have a lot of footage edited on a daily basis, seeing how we’re moving on. It will be great if it’s not something we have to do ourselves, since it’s so time-consuming. I’d like to start with Marty, dressed up in his pirate best, telling the tale of the Santa Geneva, Mad Miller, Kitty Cutlass and poor Dona Isabella. That will explain Vanessa’s script—and the quest we’re heading out on, to find the truth. Marty is a great character. He can also tell some of the pirate lore and history in general without becoming dry—or downright boring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It sounds like a plan to me. Set it up,” David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean saw Vanessa and Jay stand; they headed together over to the table where Liam, David and Sean were sitting together. “David, Liam, this is Jay Allen. He and Sean just met. He’s applying for work on the project.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was clear, but there was no emotion in it. She was angry and covering it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay offered his hand. The introduction was acknowledged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m heading on out for the evening. I hope you’ll consider me for your crew. I truly can never explain just how much this project means to me,” Jay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We may find nothing. We may just rehash the same old, same old,” David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d like to be aboard, just for my own peace of mind, retrace every step—and see if there wasn’t something of importance that we never gave to the police,” Jay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words sounded reasonable, and they would certainly appeal to David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, like I said, I’m out of here,” Jay said. “I’m at Paradise Inn, and—” he paused to write a number on a cocktail napkin “—this is my cell number.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Plan on meeting us here tomorrow at one o’clock,” Sean said. “We’re going to do an interview with a friend who’s an expert in pirate lore and Key West history. I’m going to have you edit the footage and we’ll see what we get.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay brightened and grabbed Sean’s hand, pumping it. “Great. Great. You won’t regret it, I swear. I can stand in as well, in almost any capacity. Whatever you need. Thank you. Thank you.” He looked around the table, animated, humble and grateful. “Thank you, thank you all.” He turned to Vanessa. “Nessa, want a walk back to your place?” he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “You’re south, I’m north. I’m fine. But thanks. I’m going to hang around a few more minutes,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing is too far south or north around here, you know,” Jay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine, really. Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay nodded to her, and nodded toward the table again. He backed away. “My equipment or—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ours, thanks,” Sean said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay nearly knocked into a table as he left, still looking at them all the while, as if they would change their minds if he didn’t. Finally, he was out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid had already risen to drag a chair over to their table for Vanessa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she sat, David said, “Well, this is interesting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “I had no idea he knew anything about this, or that he was anywhere nearby at the moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” Sean murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” Liam said quickly, “you two are old friends?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “Micanopy is not a big place,” she said. “We went through twelve years of school together— I’ve known him since I was four or five. He is a good filmmaker, and he’s serious when he says that he’ll do anything, anything at all. That’s why our initial project had seemed so exciting. It was mainly our money, and we were willing to do what it took to get the movie made. And it is true, he’s excellent at editing. He has the instinct for it, which, in my mind, at least, is one of the hardest parts of any production. Slow, hard, tedious—and amazingly important to a final project. Honestly, I admit, I was angry that he suddenly showed up and wanted me to…introduce him to you all, but…he is good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded so damned honest. Sean didn’t know why he still felt a strange twist inside. He wanted to trust her. Maybe he wanted to trust her too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn’t left, Sean knew, because she had felt the need to talk to the three of them. Was she protesting too much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like a drink?” David asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “Thanks, no. I’m going to head out, too. I just wanted to…I wanted to talk to you for a few minutes, try to explain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s fine. We’ll see what he’s worth on the project tomorrow,” David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want me to come, too?” Vanessa asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, that’s not necessary,” Sean said quickly. “You proved your ability today.” He stood. “I’ll walk you back,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “That’s not necessary. I’ve walked Duval alone a…a zillion times. I’ll be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t going to because it was necessary. I was going to walk you down because I wanted to,” Sean said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, then, sure. I’ll just say good-night to Katie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked to the stand. A man of about sixty was onstage. He was doing a damned good Sinatra imitation with his version of “Fly Me to the Moon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed Katie on the cheek; Katie looked up and waved to Sean. She was smiling. He walked to the computer area himself and kissed his sister on the top of the head. “Tomorrow, kiddo,” he told her. “Ready?” he asked Vanessa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked through the high-top tables in the karaoke area and said good-night to David and Liam. “Can you grab the tab?” Sean asked David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it. I’m not too worried—I know the owner,” David said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean waved a hand and walked Vanessa out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe south end of Duval was quiet as they walked along. Down by the inn where Vanessa was staying, there would still be activity at Sloppy Joe’s, Captain Tony’s, Rick’s, Irish Kevin’s and maybe a few more. It would probably be a mild crowd though. On Friday and Saturday nights, it was a wild crowd. When any of the festivals was going on, anything went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really didn’t know anything about Jay looking to join on,” Vanessa said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. That’s what you’ve said. Several times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you don’t believe me,” she said flatly, turning her blue eyes on him. The woman really looked like a damned angel. Her hair was like a halo, blond, and bleached lighter by the sun. Not really an angel. She wasn’t delicate, he had learned that by watching her in action. She was really just about perfect. Too perfect. He felt jealous, though he barely knew her. He wanted to strangle Jay Allen because he seemed to be so close to her. He wanted to know if—in the years of their friendship—they had ever been intimate. Information he had no right to. He barely knew her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted her. She was gorgeous, she was sensual, she was lithe, athletic. He was imagining far too much about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant he had to stay the hell away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, it’s not that I don’t believe you, it just seems all too opportune,” he said. “But my partner agrees that it’s interesting, and we’ll see how Jay does tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should be there,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “Let’s see how he stands on his own, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were coming closer to the northern end of Duval, where revelers were still out. Too many people for a real conversation. All seemed to be having fun—a few were inebriated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch out,” he murmured. A group, nicely dressed and not composed of teenagers, seemed to be having a bit of a problem navigating the streets. He thought a tall stout man was about to run into Vanessa. He took her hand and pulled her out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here we are,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “The stairway is up the back, through the garden gate.” She rummaged in a pocket for her key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll walk you around,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed through a little walkway. It led to the back. There was nice foliage along the way, but the inn was basic, just some rooms over a storefront. No charming tables and chairs outside, no pool, nothing but access to the rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean knew that it was filled with spring-breakers and bachelor and bachelorette parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m surprised you chose this place,” he told her. “It gets awfully loud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted the loud,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the activity—cops around most of the time, lots of people at all hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you afraid?” he asked her, frowning and setting his hands on her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m not really afraid. But I like people and noise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “All right. But you do know my sister well, so it seems. She owns the house we grew up in, though I’m living there now and Katie has moved in with David. Both places are huge. You’re on the project now. You’re welcome to come stay at either.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-night-bone-island-trilogy-2/page-17.html","bookId":2287,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:52:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:52:42 PM"}
