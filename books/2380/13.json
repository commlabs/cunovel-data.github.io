I want this party to be over-the-top.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re so excited,” Naomi gushed. “I can’t wait to try on the Zac Posen dress Mona picked out for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna shot them a taut smile. This really didn’t make any sense. Everyone at Rosewood knew Riley and Naomi had been talking about Hanna behind her back. And wasn’t it just last year that Mona had vowed she’d despise Naomi forever after Naomi gossiped that Mona had gotten skin grafts? Hanna had fake-friended Naomi for that—she’d pretended she and Mona were in a fight, won Naomi’s confidence, then pilfered a cheesy love letter Naomi had written to Mason Byers from Naomi’s notebook. Hanna posted the letter anonymously on Rosewood Day’s intranet the very next day, everyone laughed, and all was right again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, Hanna had an epiphany. Of course! Mona was fake-friending! It completely made sense. She felt a little better, realizing what was going on, but she still wanted confirmation. She eyed Mona. “Hey, Mon, can I talk to you for a sec? Alone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t right now, Han.” Mona looked at her Movado watch. “We’re late for our fitting. C’mon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, Mona strolled out of the restaurant, her three-inch heels clacking against the shiny walnut floor. The others followed. Hanna reached over to grab her enormous Gucci purse, but the zipper had come undone and the entire contents spilled under the table. All her makeup, her wallet, her vitamins, the Hydroxycut she’d stolen ages ago from GNC but was a little too scared to take…everything. Hanna scrambled to pick it all up, her eyes on Mona and the others as they snaked away. She knelt down, feverishly trying to stuff everything into her bag as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hanna Marin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna jumped. Above her was a familiar, tall, floppy-haired waiter. “It’s Lucas,” he reminded her, fiddling with the cuff on his white button-down, the Rive Gauche uniform. “You probably don’t recognize me because I look so French in this outfit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” Hanna said wearily. “Hey.” She’d known Lucas Beattie forever. In seventh grade, he’d been popular—and, bizarrely, for a second, he’d liked Hanna. Word had gotten around that Lucas was going to send Hanna a red heart-shaped box of candy on the schoolwide Candy Day. A boy sending you a heart-shaped box of candy meant love, so Hanna got really excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, a few days before Candy Day, something changed. Lucas was suddenly a dork. His friends started to ignore him, girls began to laugh at him, and a rampant rumor that he was a hermaphrodite swirled. Hanna couldn’t believe her luck, but she secretly wondered if he’d gone from popular to a loser all because he’d decided to like her. Even if she was Ali D’s friend, she was still a fat, dorky, clumsy loser. When he sent her the candy, Hanna hid it in her locker and didn’t thank him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s up?” Hanna asked blandly. Lucas had pretty much stayed a loser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not much,” Lucas responded eagerly. “What’s up with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna rolled her eyes. She hadn’t meant to start a conversation. “I have to go,” she said, looking toward the courtyard. “My friends are waiting for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually…” Lucas followed her toward the exit, “your friends forgot to pay the bill.” He whipped out a leather booklet. “Unless, um, you were getting it this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Hanna cleared her throat. Nice of Mona to mention it. “No problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas swiped her AmEx and gave her the bill to sign, and Hanna strode out of Rive Gauche without adding a tip—or telling Lucas good-bye. The more she thought about it, she was excited that Naomi and Riley were part of Mona’s court. Around Rosewood, party court girls competed over who could get the birthday girl the most glamorous gift. A day pass to the Blue Springs Spa or a Prada gift card didn’t cut it, either—the winning gift had to be totally over the top. Julia Rubenstein’s best friend had hired male strippers to perform at an after-party for a select few—and they’d been hot strippers, not muscle-heads. And Sarah Davies had convinced her dad to hire Beyoncé to sing “Happy Birthday” to the girl-of-honor. Thankfully, Naomi and Riley were about as creative as the newborn panda at the Philadelphia Zoo. Hanna could out-glam them on her worst day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard her BlackBerry humming in her bag and pulled it out. There were two messages in her mailbox. The first, from Mona, had come in six minutes ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere R U, bee-yotch? If you’re any later, the tailor’s going to get pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Mon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the second text, which had arrived two minutes later, was from a blocked number. That could only be one person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Hanna, We may not be friends, but we have the same enemies. So here are two tips: One of your old friends is hiding something from you. Something big. And Mona? She’s not your friend, either. So watch your back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHELLO, MY NAME IS EMILY. AND I’M GAY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night at 7:17 Emily pulled into her driveway. After she’d run out of the natatorium, she’d walked around the Rosewood Bird Sanctuary for hours. The busily chirping sparrows, happy little ducks, and tame parakeets soothed her. It was a good place to escape from reality…and a certain incriminating photo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery light in the house was on, including the one in the bedroom that Emily and Carolyn shared. How would she explain the photo to her family? She wanted to say that kissing Maya in that picture had been a joke, that someone was playing a prank on her. Ha ha, kissing girls is gross!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn’t true, and it made her heart ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house smelled warm and inviting, like a mixture of coffee and potpourri. Her mother had turned on the hallway Hummel figurines cabinet. Little figurines of a boy milking a cow and a lederhosen-clad girl pushing a wheelbarrow slowly rotated. Emily made her way down the floral wallpapered hallway toward the living room. Both her parents were sitting on the flowered couch. An older woman sat on the love seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother gave her a watery smile. “Well, hello, Emily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily blinked a few times. “Um, hi…” She looked from her parents to the stranger on the love seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to come in?” her mother asked. “We have someone here to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older woman, who was wearing high-waisted black slacks and a mint-green blazer, stood and offered her hand. “I’m Edith.” She grinned. “It’s so nice to meet you, Emily. Why don’t you sit down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s father bustled into the dining room and dragged another chair over for her. She sat down tentatively, feeling jumpy. It was the same feeling she used to get when her old friends played the Pillow Game—one person walked around the living room blindfolded, and, at a random moment, the others bombarded her with pillows. Emily didn’t like playing—she hated those tense moments right before they started smacking her—but she always played anyway, because Ali loved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m from a program called Tree Tops,” Edith said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your parents told me about your problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bones in Emily’s butt pressed into the bare wood of the dining room chair. “Problem?” Her stomach sank. She had a feeling she knew what problem meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course it’s a problem.” Her mother’s voice was choked. “That picture—with that girl we forbade you to see—has it happened more than once?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily nervously touched the scar on her left palm that she’d gotten when Carolyn accidentally speared her with the gardening shears. She’d grown up striving to be as obedient and well behaved as possible, and she couldn’t lie to her parents—at least not well. “It’s happened more than once, I guess,” she mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother let out a small, pained whimper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith pursed her wrinkly, fuchsia-lined lips. She had an old-lady mothball smell. “What you’re feeling, it’s not permanent. It’s a sickness, Emily. But we at Tree Tops can cure you. We’ve rehabilitated many ex-gays since the program began.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily barked out a laugh. “Ex…gays?” The world started to spin, then recede. Emily’s parents looked at her self-righteously, their hands wrapped around their coffee cups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your interest in young women isn’t genetic or scientific, but environmental,” Edith explained. “With counseling, we’ll help you dismiss your…urges, shall we say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily gripped the arms of her chair. “That sounds…weird.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emily!” scolded her mother—she’d taught her children never to disrespect adults. But Emily was too bewildered to be embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not weird,” Edith chirped. “Don’t worry if you don’t understand it all now. Many of our new recruits don’t.” She looked at Emily’s parents. “We have a superb track record of rehabilitation in the greater Philadelphia area.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily wanted to throw up. Rehabilitation? She searched her parents’ faces, but they gave her nothing. She glanced out to the street. If the next car that passes is white, this isn’t happening, she thought. If it’s red, it is. A car swept past. Sure enough, it was red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith placed her coffee cup on its saucer. “We’re going to have a peer mentor come talk to you. Someone who experienced the program firsthand. She’s a senior at Rosewood Senior High, and her name’s Becka. She’s very nice. You’ll just talk. And after that, we’ll discuss you joining the program properly. Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily looked at her parents. “I don’t have time to talk to anybody,” she insisted. “I have swimming in the mornings and after school, and then I have homework.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother smiled tensely. “You’ll make time. What about lunch tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith nodded. “I’m sure that would be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily rubbed her throbbing head. She already hated Becka, and she hadn’t even met her. “Fine,” she agreed. “Tell her to meet me at Lorence chapel.” There was no way Emily was talking with Little Miss Tree Tops in the cafeteria. School was going to be brutal enough tomorrow as it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith brushed her hands together and stood up. “I’ll make all the arrangements.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stood against the foyer wall as her parents handed Edith her coat and thanked her for coming. Edith navigated down the Fieldses’ stone path to her car. When Emily’s parents turned back to her, they had weary, sober looks on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom, Dad…” Emily started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother whirled around. “That Maya girl has a few tricks up her sleeve, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily backed up. “Maya didn’t pass that picture around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Fields eyed Emily carefully, then sat down on the couch and put her head in her hands. “Emily, what are we going to do now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean, we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother looked up. “Don’t you see that this is a reflection on all of us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t make the announcement,” Emily protested. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-pretty-little-liars-3/page-13.html","bookId":2380,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:33 AM"}
