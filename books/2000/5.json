Insignificant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it matters to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel myself shutting down. I close my eyes tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarmth. Music. Flying free in the blue sky…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafe. I’m safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to fuck some sense into you,” he hisses in my ear. “You need teaching a lesson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come to my office, Mia. It’s time for a lesson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForbes’ fingers roughly and painfully pull out of me, dragging me back to the now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a spilt stupid second, I think he’s changed his mind—that maybe he isn’t going to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he reaches for the zipper on his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this moment, it’s difficult to say what I feel. Realization, mainly. This is really going to happen to me. He’s going to take from me the last shred of dignity I have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly if I let it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop this, Mia! Stop being weak and fight back! You stop this, and there will be no more pain. No more hurt. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForbes is struggling with his zipper. He moves off me, just a fraction, but I take full advantage of that fraction. Using courage I didn’t know I had until now, I bring my knee up as hard as I can and slam it into his balls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sound like garbled agony emits from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand drops from my throat, releasing me as both his hands go to his crotch, holding the pain I just created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow you know how it feels you bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slide down the wall, gasping for the air I so desperately need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForbes staggers a little to the side, face lined with pain, then he drops to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Mia, go!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m moving. Running through my apartment. I grab my keys off the table, and I’m out the door, flying down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t stop to look behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe street is quiet. No one around. I unlock my car in the race toward it. Slamming the door shut, my hand shakes as I try to get the key in the ignition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit! I can’t get it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of my eye, I see Forbes come stumbling out of the building, hand still holding his crotch, and I don’t know if it’s sheer luck driving this moment, but the key suddenly punches in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn the ignition, shift into gear, and slam my foot down, getting me out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the end of the street in a matter of seconds, I turn left and race off down the street. I feel wet on my hand as I push my hair off my face. Pulling it back, I find it smeared with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a quick glance in the rear-view mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyebrow is split open and the blood from the wound is running down my face, dripping onto my clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” I wince, instantly feeling the pain from the knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to clean it up, but I can’t stop. Not now. I can’t risk Forbes catching up with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he will, undoubtedly, be coming after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press my sleeve against the cut to soak up the blood and press down harder on the gas, firing me onward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I know it, I’m on the I-90 with absolutely no idea where I’m going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have nowhere to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo friends to turn to. No family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s only me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive down the I-90 for an undetermined amount of time. I’m just staring ahead, foot on the gas pedal, putting as much distance between me and Forbes as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt starts to rain, so visibility becomes poor, and my eye is starting to shut. It isn’t easy driving as I am, but with the rain pouring down, I’m going to have to pull off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of stopping terrifies me, but at the moment, I don’t have a choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, I see a sign for a service station coming up in a mile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the turn comes up, I pull off and follow the road round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI park my car into the lot just outside the service motel. Shutting the engine off, I check my doors are still locked, then I examine my eye in the rear-view mirror. It’s looking bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach into the glove compartment and get out the hand wipes I keep in there. That’s when I spot my handbag sitting in the foot well where I’d dropped it earlier. Relief fills me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve got money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no way I can go back to my apartment. When Forbes gets bored of looking for me, that’s the first place he’ll go to wait. Looks like this motel is going to be my bed for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my bag onto the passenger seat. The papers about my mother are still there. I gently touch them with my fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cell starts to ring, making me jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForbes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith trembling fingers, I cancel the call and switch my cell off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clean my face using the hand wipes. On closer examination, I see the cut is really deep. I’ll need to tape it. What it really needs is stitches, but I’m not up for stitching myself at the moment, and going to the ER is out of the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can live with the scar. It’s not my first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere should be some tape in the first-aid kit in the trunk of the car. Always prepared. That’s me. I could do with an icepack. I’ll see what the motel has.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my overly large sunglasses from my bag and put them on to cover my eye. I don’t care that it’s raining. I hang my bag on my shoulder, open the door and step into the bouncing rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePopping the trunk, I get the first-aid kit and shove it in my bag before I head to the reception of the motel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female, a middle-aged clerk barely looks at me as she checks me in, which is good because I must look a complete state wearing sunglasses, soaked through to my panties and blood on my clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hands me over a key card with barely a word, so I thank her and head straight to the room. Stopping on the way, I grab a can of soda from the machine. It’ll work as a makeshift icepack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the door, and I’m greeted with the stench of stale air freshener. Walking into the room, I shut the door behind me, locking it. I remove my sunglasses and put them in my bag, which I drop on the bed as I sit down. The mattress is hard and uncomfortable. I rest the cold can of soda against my eye using one hand. With the other, I curl my fingers around the edge of the bed and grip the comforter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I just let go. I cry the tears I’ve needed to cry all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve no clue how long I sit here for, crying, but when I’m finally dried eyed, I go to the bathroom and strip my clothes off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe urge to eat and purge is overwhelming right now, but fear of going back outside keeps me in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear is driving my every decision right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wash my blood stained shirt in the sink and hang it to drip dry over the towel rail. I turn the shower on hot and climb underneath. I just need to get the stench and feel of Forbes off me, then I’ll be okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll be okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears sting my eyes at the reminder of what just happened to me. A lump lodges in my throat, sticking there like dry wood. I suck in a deep breath to stop the tears from starting again as I pick up the hotel soap to wash myself with. When I feel as near to clean as I’m going to, I grab a towel and wrap my hair up. Then my body. I hate that I can’t brush my teeth. I’ll have to buy a toothbrush and paste in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go back into the room and get the first-aid kit from my bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clean the cut using an antiseptic wipe, then tape it up. I take a couple of Advil from the kit and swallow them down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really don’t want to put the clothes I was wearing back on, but they’re all I have to wear. I leave my panties off and just put my bra back on, wrapping the towel around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing back onto the bed, I tuck my legs underneath me as I stare down at my bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ‘Giveaway Mia’ contract and my mother’s address are still in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t believe that she’s alive. More so, that she signed me away. Just like that. With the press of a pen to paper, she was no longer my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow does that even work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mix of emotions I feel is confusing. I’m angry. No, I’m raging. She has been out there all this time while I had to endure growing up with Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe abandoned me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left me with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she know the kind of man he really was? The person she was actually leaving her child with? Did she willingly just walk away leaving me there with that monster of a man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to believe she didn’t know because the thought that she did is just too painful to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t think about it now. I don’t want to think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo much has happened to me today. I can barely process it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing all thoughts from my mind, I straighten a leg out, and using my toes, I push my bag off the edge of the bed. I switch the light off and climb under the covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing my eyes, I listen to the sound of the distant traffic on the interstate, trying to focus on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if Forbes is looking for me. What if he finds me here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn that thought, I get out of bed, grab the heavy chair from the desk, and drag it over to the door, propping it up underneath the door handle. I should have hidden my car behind the motel instead of leaving it upfront, but I’m not going out there now to move it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, I’m too far out of Boston. Forbes won’t think I’ll have gone this far. I never leave Boston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought makes me sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never left Boston. Not once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe life I had existed within the city limits. While my mother lived a whole other life, without me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing back into bed, I turn the TV on using the remote control and focus on the screen instead of focusing on what is going on in my own mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside my head is not a place I want to be right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wake feeling disorientated. My head is throbbing, and I can hear a television on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize I’m in the motel room I slept in last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday’s events come flooding back. Forbes tried to rape me. He sexually assaulted me. My mother – she’s alive. She signed me away. She left me with Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart and stomach start to ache, painfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I make the mistake of rubbing my eyes. “Shit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press my head back into the pillow and ride out the wave of pain, and grief until it all settles into a dull ache in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t move again until my bursting bladder forces me out of bed. When I’m done using the bathroom, I check my eye in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, it’s bad. Swollen and black and my eye is bloodshot to hell. No amount of cover-up will conceal this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess I’ll be wearing my sunglasses for the next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop a couple of Advil to take the edge off the pain, and go back to bed. Resting my back against the headboard, I start channel hopping. I’m trying to focus on the television, and ignore the noise and questions in my mind, but it’s not working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I need to decide what the hell I’m going to do. I can’t just stay here in a motel room, off the I-90, in god knows where. But I can’t go back to my apartment either. Or Boston for that matter. Forbes will be waiting for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what do I do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could go to Colorado and find my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way. She abandoned me. She left me with Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you don’t know her reasons. You know what Oliver was like. How terrifying he was. What if she had no choice but to leave?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bang my head back against the headboard. “Goddammit! No!” I mutter into the silence. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trouble/page-5.html","bookId":2000,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM"}
