This was different. Every class taught her something useful, something that would help her when she ran the company. The courses included accounting, management, international trade and business administration. Once a week David telephoned to see how she was getting along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love it,\" Kate told him. \"It\u0027s really exciting, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day she and David would be working together, side by side, late at night, all by themselves. And one of those nights, David would turn to her and say, \"Kate, darling, I\u0027ve been such a blind fool. Will you marry me?\" And an instant later, she would be in his arms...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that would have to wait. In the meantime, she had a lot to learn. Resolutely, Kate turned to her homework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe business course lasted two years, and Kate returned to Klipdrift in time to celebrate her twentieth birthday. David met her at the station. Impulsively, Kate flung her arms around him and hugged him. \"Oh, David, I\u0027m so happy to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled away and said awkwardly, \"It\u0027s nice to see you, Kate.\" There was an uncomfortable stiffness in his manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It\u0027s - it\u0027s just that young ladies don\u0027t go around hugging men in public.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him a moment. \"I see. I promise not to embarrass you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they drove to the house, David covertly studied Kate. She was a hauntingly beautiful girl, innocent and vulnerable, and David was determined that he would never take advantage of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Monday morning Kate moved into her new office at Kruger-Brent, Ltd. It was like suddenly being plunged into some exotic and bizarre universe that had its own customs and its own language. There was a bewildering array of divisions, subsidiaries, regional departments, franchises and foreign branches. The products that the company manufactured or owned seemed endless. There were steel mills, cattle ranches, a railroad, a shipping line and, of course, the foundation of the family fortune: diamonds and gold, zinc and platinum and magnesium, mined each hour around the clock, pouring into the coffers of the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost too much to take in. Kate sat in David\u0027s office listening to him make decisions that affected thousands of people around the world. The general managers of the various divisions made recommendations, but as often as not, David overruled them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you do that? Don\u0027t they know their jobs?\" Kate asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course they do, but that\u0027s not the point,\" David explained. \"Each manager sees his own division as the center of the world, and that\u0027s as it should be. But someone has to have an overall view and decide what\u0027s best for the company. Come on. We\u0027re having lunch with someone I want you to meet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid took Kate into the large, private dining room adjoining Kate\u0027s office. A young, raw-boned man with a lean face and inquisitive brown eyes was waiting for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Brad Rogers,\" David said. \"Brad, meet your new boss, Kate McGregor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrad Rogers held out his hand. \"I\u0027m pleased to meet you, Miss McGregor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brad is our secret weapon,\" David said. \"He knows as much about Kruger-Brent, Limited, as I do. If I ever leave, you don\u0027t have to worry. Brad will be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I ever leave. The thought of it sent a wave of panic through Kate. Of course, David would never leave the company. Kate could think of nothing else through lunch, and when it was over she had no idea what she had eaten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter lunch, they discussed South Africa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to run into trouble soon,\" David warned. \"The government has just imposed poll taxes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what does that mean?\" Kate asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means that blacks, coloreds and Indians have to pay two pounds each for every member of their family. That\u0027s more than a month\u0027s wages for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate thought about Banda and was filled with a sense of apprehension. The discussion moved on to other topics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate enjoyed her new life tremendously. Every decision involved a gamble of millions of pounds. Big business was a matching of wits, the courage to gamble and the instinct to know when to quit and when to press ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Business is a game,\" David told Kate, \"played for fantastic stakes, and you\u0027re in competition with experts. If you want to win, you have to learn to be a master of the game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was what Kate was determined to do. Learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate lived alone in the big house, except for the servants. She and David continued their ritual Friday-night dinners, but when Kate invited him over on any other night, he invariably found an excuse not to come. During business hours they were together constantly, but even then David seemed to have erected a barrier between them, a wall that Kate was unable to penetrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn her twenty-first birthday, all the shares in Kruger-Brent, Ltd., were turned over to Kate. She now officially had control of the company. \"Let\u0027s have dinner tonight to celebrate,\" she suggested to David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Kate, I have a lot of work to catch up on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate dined alone that night, wondering why. Was it she, or was it David? He would have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to know how she felt about him, how she had always felt about him. She would have to do something about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe company was negotiating for a shipping line in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you and Brad go to New York and close the deal?\" David suggested to Kate. \"It will be good experience for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate would have liked for David to have gone with her, but she was too proud to say so. She would handle this without him. Besides, she had never been to America. She looked forward to the experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closing of the shipping-line deal went smoothly. \"While you\u0027re over there,\" David had told her, \"you should see something of the country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate and Brad visited company subsidiaries in Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh and New York, and Kate was amazed by the size and energy of the United States. The highlight of Kate\u0027s trip was a visit to Dark Harbor, Maine, on an enchanting little island called Islesboro, in Penobscot Bay. She had been invited to dinner at the home of Charles Dana Gibson, the artist. There were twelve people at dinner and, except for Kate, they all had homes on the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This place has an interesting history,\" Gibson told Kate. \"Years ago, residents used to get here by small coasting vessels from Boston. When the boat landed, they\u0027d be met by a buggy and taken to their houses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many people live on this island?\" Kate asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About fifty families. Did you see the lighthouse when the ferry docked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s run by a lighthouse keeper and his dog. When a boat goes by the dog goes out and rings the bell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate laughed. \"You\u0027re joking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am. The funny thing is the dog is deaf as a stone. He puts his ear against the bell to feel if there\u0027s any vibration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate smiled. \"It sounds as if you have a fascinating island here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might be worth your while staying over and taking a look around in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn an impulse, Kate said, \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spent the night at the island\u0027s only hotel, the Islesboro Inn. In the morning she hired a horse and carriage, driven by one of the islanders. They left the center of Dark Harbor, which consisted of a general store, a hardware store and a small restaurant, and a few minutes later they were driving through a beautiful wooded area. Kate noticed that none of the little winding roads had names, nor were there any names on the mailboxes. She turned to her guide. \"Don\u0027t people get lost here without any signs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. The islanders know where everythin\u0027 is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate gave him a sidelong look. \"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the lower end of the island, they passed a burial ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you stop, please?\" Kate asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped out of the carriage and walked over to the old cemetery and wandered around looking at the tombstones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJOB PENDLETON, DIED JANUARY 25, 1794, AGE 47. The epitaph read: Beneath this stone, I rest my head in slumber sweet; Christ blessed the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJANE, WIFE OF THOMAS PENDLETON, DIED FEBRUARY 25, 1802, AGE 47.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were spirits here from another century, from an era long gone. CAPTAIN WILLIAM HATCH DROWNED IN LONG ISLAND SOUND, OCTOBER 1866, AGE 30 YEARS. The epitaph on his stone read: Storms all weathered and life\u0027s seas crossed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate stayed there a long time, enjoying the quiet and peace. Finally, she returned to the carriage and they drove on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it like here in the winter?\" Kate asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cold. The bay used to freeze solid, and they\u0027d come from the mainland by sleigh. Now a\u0027 course, we got the ferry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rounded a curve, and there, next to the water below, was a beautiful white-shingled, two-story house surrounded by delphinium, wild roses and poppies. The shutters on the eight front windows were painted green, and next to the double doors were white benches and six pots of red geraniums. It looked like something out of a fairy tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who owns that house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the old Dreben house. Mrs. Dreben died a few months back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who lives there now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody, I reckon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know if it\u0027s for sale?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guide looked at Kate and said, \"If it is, it\u0027ll probably be bought by the son of one of the families already livin\u0027 here. The islanders don\u0027t take kindly to strangers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the wrong thing to say to Kate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hour later, she was speaking to a lawyer for the estate. \"It\u0027s about the Dreben house,\" Kate said. \"Is it for sale?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lawyer pursed his lips. \"Well, yes, and no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s for sale, but a few people are already interested in buying it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old families on the island, Kate thought. \"Have they made an offer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m making one,\" Kate said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said condescendingly, \"That\u0027s an expensive house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name your price.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifty thousand dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go look at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inside of the house was even more enchanting than Kate had anticipated. The large, lovely hall faced the sea through a wall of glass. On one side of the hall was a large ballroom, and on the other side, a living room with fruitwood paneling stained by time and an enormous fireplace. There was a library, and a huge kitchen with an iron stove and a large pine worktable, and off of that was a butler\u0027s pantry and laundry room. Downstairs, the house had six bedrooms for the servants and one bathroom. Upstairs was a master bedroom suite and four smaller bedrooms. It was a much larger house than Kate had expected. But when David and I have our children, she thought, we\u0027ll need all these rooms. The grounds ran all the way down to the bay, where there was a private dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate turned to the lawyer. \"I\u0027ll take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to name it Cedar Hill House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could not wait to get back to Klipdrift to break the news to David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way back to South Africa, Kate was filled with a wild excitement. The house in Dark Harbor was a sign, a symbol that she and David would be married. She knew he would love the house as much as she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the afternoon Kate and Brad arrived back in Klipdrift, Kate hurried to David\u0027s office. He was seated at his desk, working, and the sight of him set Kate\u0027s heart pounding. She had not realized how much she had missed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid rose to his feet. \"Kate! Welcome home!\" And before she could speak, he said, \"I wanted you to be the first to know. I\u0027m getting married.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/master-of-the-game/page-15.html","bookId":2358,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:36 AM"}
