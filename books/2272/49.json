Hopefully no one will ever tell her that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbara had extracted the arsenic that killed Thorne from rat poison. As a librarian, she had Internet access and lots of time to read, and the method wasn’t hard to come by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarry Levine finally wrote a book. It was on the Poe Killings, and it was published by Brook Avery, in his first venture into book publishing.
