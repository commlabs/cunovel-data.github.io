That was when he\u0027d decided to call it quits. He\u0027d done so, but not without regret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he\u0027d checked on Funny Face and her dam, Cliff went back to the house to return the phone call. He studied the name—Janet Webb—and didn\u0027t recognize it or the number. He was mildly curious when the voice on the other end announced that he\u0027d reached the local animal shelter. He asked for Janet and was placed on hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Janet Webb.\" The woman\u0027s clipped, professional voice caught him off guard. It sounded as if he\u0027d interrupted some important project and she resented the intrusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cliff Harding, returning your call,\" he said in like tones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Harding.\" Her voice softened into cordiality. \"I appreciate your calling me back. I know you\u0027ve heard about our Dog and Bachelor Auction next week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did hear mention of it.\" Cliff could hardly ignore the upcoming event; there were posters all over town, frequent articles in the paper—and even in the Seattle news. Cliff would be happy to make a contribution, but he wasn\u0027t interested in participating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were disappointed to learn you haven\u0027t volunteered to be one of our bachelors.\" Her tone grew even friendlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, well—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t allow him to finish. \"Your name\u0027s come up more than once and from several different people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m honored, but—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you won\u0027t mind if I add you to the list, then.\" Her voice was triumphant—as though she\u0027d successfully outwitted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman was nothing if not persistent. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis adamant refusal gave her pause. \"Is there any particular reason, Mr. Harding, that you don\u0027t want to support the animal shelter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth to remind her that he did support the shelter, but, again, wasn\u0027t allowed to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One would assume that all animals would hold a place in a horseman\u0027s heart. One would assume that a horseman—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke in. \"I believe my trainer, Cal Washburn, is one of the bachelors—on my recommendation.\u0027\u0027 Cal wasn\u0027t likely to forgive him for that anytime soon. Volunteering Cal was supposed to serve a double purpose: to get Cliff off the hook and to give Cal some exposure to local society, specifically female society. He was a young man, after all. To Cliff\u0027s surprise, he\u0027d eventually agreed to participate, as long as he wasn\u0027t expected to do any public speaking. Cliff assured him all he\u0027d have to do was to stand up on stage and listen to the women fight over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I see Mr. Washburn on the list,\" Janet said. \"But what about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m flattered you\u0027d ask me personally, but I\u0027m sorry— no.\" Even for charity, he had his limits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" Janet said in a severe voice. \"What if I told you that your participation could have a very big impact on the shelter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone who prefers to remain anonymous has offered to make a large donation if 1 can convince you to volunteer for the auction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Cliff was sure he\u0027d misunderstood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true. As I said, someone\u0027s offered a substantial donation to the shelter if you\u0027ll be one of our bachelors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff was both amused and chagrinned. \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not at liberty to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could only be Grace, Cliff reasoned, but she didn\u0027t have the money to make that kind of offer. \"Male or female?\" he pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Webb laughed nervously. \"As 1 said, I\u0027m not at liberty to reveal the source, Mr. Harding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How substantial a donation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor am I at liberty to reveal the amount.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, completely perplexed by the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Harding, I sincerely hope you\u0027ll have a change of heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff thought about it and sighed. \"I suppose I can volunteer.\" He wasn\u0027t happy about it, nor did he appreciate being coerced, but he didn\u0027t want to take money away from the shelter. In any case, there was no help for it now; he\u0027d given his word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, he wandered outside to talk to Cal. \"I don\u0027t suppose you know anything about that phone call?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trainer shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone offered a donation to the shelter if I agreed to be part of the auction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal\u0027s eyes widened. \"Y-you g-gonna d-do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff nodded, shrugging his shoulders. \"Hey—you didn\u0027t have anything to do with this, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal shook his head again. \"G-grace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace\u0027s involvement had been his first assumption, too, but it didn\u0027t make sense, and not just because of the money. Cliff had recently seen her at the Saturday Farmers\u0027 Market, talking to Stan Lockhart, Olivia\u0027s ex-husband. The instant she\u0027d seen him she looked guilty. Cliff suspected she\u0027d started dating the other man. The idea of her with Stan bothered him, but Cliff had to put the matter out of his mind. If Grace wanted to see her best friend\u0027s ex-husband—well, it wasn\u0027t any of his business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he didn\u0027t know how he could have misjudged Grace this badly. She wasn\u0027t the woman he\u0027d first believed, not nearly the honest, straightforward person he\u0027d thought, and the realization troubled and saddened him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up to find Cal struggling to hide a grin. \"Wipe that off your face,\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal laughed outright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCal laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon Cliff was chuckling, too. He couldn\u0027t imagine who\u0027d pay for him to be one of the bachelors, but it might be interesting to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon walked Maryellen and Katie out to the car and buckled their daughter into her protective carrier in the back seat. Maryellen found it harder and harder to head off to work each morning when she longed to spend the day with her husband and child. Jon and Maryellen had agreed she\u0027d quit her job by the end of the year, sooner if they could manage it financially. Maryellen was hoping to get pregnant again, too. She wanted no more than two or three years between Katie and this new baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the driver\u0027s side door and Jon came over to take her in his arms. \"I hate seeing you and Katie leave me every morning,\" he murmured, echoing her own regrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen slipped her arms around her husband, resting her head on his chest. \"I hate leaving you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t be much longer,\" he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen nodded. They kissed goodbye and then she climbed into the car and drove into Cedar Cove. Kelly, her younger sister, provided day care for Katie and had done so since Maryellen\u0027s return to work the year before. The arrangement worked well for both of them. The extra income helped her sister, and Maryellen felt relieved that her daughter was with family. Kelly\u0027s son, Tyler, was wonderful with his cousin and looked after Katie as if she were his little sister. Kelly and her husband, Paul, wanted a second child; although she\u0027d only mentioned it to Maryellen once, Kelly seemed to be having trouble getting pregnant again. Maryellen sympathized but didn\u0027t feel she could discuss the subject unless Kelly brought it up first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time to think about her family once she arrived at the HarborStreetArtGallery. Summers were their busy season, with plenty of tourist activity and consequently lots of drop-in traffic. Maryellen preferred it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of years earlier she\u0027d broken off her relationship with Jon in an effort to hide the fact that she was pregnant with his child. In order to avoid seeing her—at least before he knew about the pregnancy—he\u0027d moved his work from the local gallery to a well-known Seattle one. His career had grown ever since. His work was back in the Harbor Street\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egallery now, but it sold out almost as quickly as he could bring it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen knew that Jon had outgrown their gallery, although he was willing to provide a few pieces because of Maryellen and out of loyalty to the owners, who\u0027d given him his start. The demands on his time and talent kept him increasingly busy. Maryellen was looking forward to managing his career and getting his work displayed in galleries all across North America. She had plenty of ideas, including reproductions in both poster-size and as cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt noon, Jon called and they chatted briefly. They couldn\u0027t be apart for more than a few hours without missing each other and craving contact, even if that was only five minutes on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m working in my darkroom this afternoon,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, she shouldn\u0027t call him unless absolutely necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time will you be home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at the question because she got there within the same ten-minute period every afternoon. \"Five-thirty-one,\" she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cute, Maryellen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can be even cuter if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I want is you. All of you, all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good to know because I\u0027m more than willing to give you all of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon laughed. \"I\u0027ll be waiting for my two favorite women at five-thirty-one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, aye, captain.\" Maryellen smiled as she replaced the receiver, warmed by their brief conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short while later, while her assistant was on her lunch break, an older couple came into the gallery. The building itself, more than a century old, was a historic site in Cedar Cove. As always, the wide wooden floorboards creaked as she moved out of her small office to greet the customers. The walls of the gallery displayed a variety of artwork— paintings and photographs—by several local artists, but the three pieces Jon had brought in earlier that week had already been sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen watched as the man and woman, arms linked, glanced about the room. They didn\u0027t seem typical of the normal tourist traffic. The man wore slacks and a short-sleeved plaid shirt, while the woman had on a rather old-fashioned shirtwaist dress. It looked as if they were on a church outing rather than visiting a small town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" Maryellen said warmly. \"Welcome to the HarborStreetArtGallery. Is there anything I can help you find?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello.\" The woman smiled and turned to her husband, apparently waiting for him to speak. When he didn\u0027t, she said, \"We\u0027ve heard there\u0027s a very talented nature photographer from this area whose work is displayed here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be Jon Bowman.\" It never failed to thrill Maryellen when a customer inquired about him. \"I\u0027m afraid the gallery has sold out of Mr. Bowman\u0027s photographs. I\u0027ll have more in later in the month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" The woman was clearly disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His photographs are also available in a gallery in Seattle. I\u0027d be more than happy to give you their name and phone number if you\u0027d like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded eagerly. \"Yes, by all means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen walked over to her desk and retrieved a business card from the gallery that displayed Jon\u0027s photographs. The man, who was quite tall and formal in his manner, accepted the card. He bowed his head in thanks and stared at it intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about him caught Maryellen\u0027s attention, but she couldn\u0027t figure out exactly what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman moved closer to her husband. \"We heard correctly then? Jon—Mr. Bowman does live in the area?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he does. As it happens, I\u0027m his wife.\" Maryellen said this with a great deal of pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you might be,\" the man said, speaking for the first time. His tone was low, a bit gruff, as if he didn\u0027t speak often. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-20.html","bookId":1944,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM"}
