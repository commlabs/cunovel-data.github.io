De\u0027Unnero took it with a look of surprise etched upon his face. \"The man can write?\" he asked incredulously. \"A mere soldier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other man bristled, but that only made the Bishop snort all the louder. De\u0027Unnero had made no secret of his feelings that the soldiers, city\u0027s and King\u0027s, were inferior when measured against the Abellican brothers. Whenever his patrols went out onto the streets, whether their mission was to find gemstones or simply to enforce the laws of the Bishop, the accompa-nying monks, whatever their rank and experience, always held jurisdiction over the highest ranking soldiers. Obviously, the soldiers weren\u0027t enamored of this fact, but De\u0027Unnero, so entrenched in power, with both King and Father Abbot standing behind him, hardly cared. In fact, he made it a point to enjoy the situation. He did now, with his messenger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did you read it?\" he asked the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not, me lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you have read it?\" De\u0027Unnero asked slyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was told to deliver it to yerself with all speed,\" the soldier replied, and he shuffled his feet uncomfortably, a motion De\u0027Unnero noticed and enjoyed. \"And so I rode hard to Caer Tinella, so hard that me poor horse had to be put down. They give me another, and just as hard, I rode to yer court. Three hunnerd miles, me lord, though I left the side o\u0027 Captain Kil-ronney barely a week ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you are to be commended,\" the Bishop assured the soldier, then held up the rolled parchment before the man\u0027s eyes and said more force-fully, \"but did you read it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, me lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you have read it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier did not immediately answer, and so the Bishop, smiling wickedly, pulled the ribbon from the parchment and unrolled it so that the penned side was exposed to the soldier\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man winced, but dutifully held his ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it say? \" the Bishop demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier gnashed his teeth, but did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I canno\u0027, me lord!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe\u0027Unnero backed off at once, walked over to his desk, and slid comfort-ably to sit on the edge, turning the parchment around carefully. \"Your cap-tain writes well,\" he started to say, noting the smooth and steady sweep of Kilronney\u0027s lettering, but he stopped short, his eyes widening as the meaning of the words began to come clear to him, as he began to realize that the outlaw Nightbird was apparently slipping through his fingers again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a growl, the Bishop tossed the parchment across the desk, his angry gaze falling over the messenger, who, he noted, had backed a couple of steps closer to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave me!\" the Bishop barked. The man was more than ready to comply, turning quickly and, without consciously considering the act, step-ping before he could even reach for the door, and banging into it, hard, before finally managing to stagger around it and out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe\u0027Unnero grabbed the tiger\u0027s paw from his pocket and nearly fell into its magic, running out full for the northland. He put the stone back, though, reminding himself of his duties - duties the Father Abbot would view as more important, even if De\u0027Unnero disagreed with that estimate -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and produced instead his soul stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkwart should hear of this, he decided. He would make the Father Abbot see things his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkwart tried to concentrate on his prayers, but every other line came to him, in that strengthening voice within his mind, as \"Let him go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pray thee, Lord, that the sacred stones forever hold thy power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pray thee, Lord, that you guide my hand through thine eternal plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShow to me wickedness, that I might dispatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShow to me goodness, that I might revel in thy glory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet him go!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so it went throughout those evening prayers immediately following Markwart\u0027s latest talk with Bishop De\u0027Unnero, the talk in which De\u0027Un-nero had begged to be sent after the man called Nightbird, in which the Bishop\u0027s spirit had screamed at Markwart that not only Nightbird but also the five conspirator heretics might slip away, beyond their grasp forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet him go!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Father Abbot leaned back from the kneeling stool, giving up all attempts at prayer. \"Why the Barbacan?\" he asked aloud. Whatever could Nightbird and the five rogue monks want in that forlorn and blasted place? Markwart had seen the Barbacan, had gone there spiritually, inhabiting the body of Brother Francis when the expedition had reached its destination, and he saw nothing practical to gain from a journey to a place that had been utterly destroyed in the collision between Avelyn and the demon dactyl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they plan to build a shrine?\" the Father Abbot asked, and he chuckled at the thought, for how long could such a structure, could any human-built structure, survive in the wilds of the monster-infested northland? But perhaps that was their plan, he mused. To build a shrine and organize pilgrimages, as had been done in the past for other saintly heroes. The mere thought of that brought another smile to the Father Abbot\u0027s withered old lips. He pictured hundreds of eager, misguided fools, on the road to pay homage to a murdering heretic, only to be slaughtered on their way by marauding monsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat perfect justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the voice in his head did not agree, and showed him a different scene, one where the outpouring for Avelyn - or at least, against the pres-ent incarnation of the Abellican Church - proved so great that the road was tamed, and pilgrimages common and successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then came another teaser:Perhaps they do not have all the stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkwart was nodding his head before the refrain began again.Let him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, it was time, the Father Abbot realized, to unleash De\u0027Unnero, to give the Bishop his greatest reward and let him settle this issue of Nightbird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd time to alter the course of Palmaris, to show a gentler side of the Abellican Church before the King\u0027s visit, before his own visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few moments later, the Father Abbot knocked on the door of Brother Francis Dellacourt\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man, who had obviously been asleep, opened the door a crack, then threw it wide when he recognized the caller. Markwart swept into the room, motioning for Francis to close the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancis complied, and then rushed back to stand before Markwart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bishop De\u0027Unnero has found a road he must travel,\" the Father Abbot explained, \"a real one, and not a spiritual path,\" he added, seeing the con-fusion on Francis\u0027 sleepy face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the city - \" Francis began, but Markwart cut him short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go quickly to Palmaris,\" he ordered. \"Use whatever magics might help you, take a solid supply of gemstones - whatever you deem necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Necessary?\" Francis echoed, but his question was, in truth, more a reflection of his general confusion, and that Markwart would allow him to take any gemstones at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are to serve as headmaster of St. Precious and as interim bishop of Palmaris while Bishop De\u0027Unnero is away,\" Markwart explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancis swayed and seemed as if he was about to faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will soon journey to your side, to meet with King Danube as he, too, comes to the critical city,\" Markwart went on. \"You are not to change any of Bishop De\u0027Unnero\u0027s policies, but do loosen the grip. By compari-son to Marcalo De\u0027Unnero, the folk of the city should speak favorably of Brother Francis Dellacourt.\" Markwart paused to listen to the voice in his head, then repeated, \"They should speak favorably ofMaster Francis Dellacourt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the sway, and this time, Francis had to sit on the edge of his bed or fall over onto the floor. \"But the procedures to elevate me to master are lengthy,\" he reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have discussed this before,\" Markwart said sternly. \"Why are you so surprised?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To master and then to interim bishop?\" Francis asked incredulously. \"It is so fast, and at a time of such crisis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A crisis is the only time such a thing could be done,\" Markwart ex-plained. \"The other abbots will not question me, not when they understand you are simply a pawn for the betterment of our grasp of Palmaris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancis blinked repeatedly, trying to digest the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, I will portray you as such,\" Markwart said with a laugh, and he dropped a comforting hand on Francis\u0027 shoulder. \"A mere pawn, though we two both know the truth of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancis nodded numbly. \"I fear that I am not worthy of your expecta-tions,\" he admitted, lowering his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkwart laughed at him. \"I have no expectations,\" he said, his voice changing, growing suddenly grave, bordering on ominous. \"Little will be required from you in this matter. You are to go to Palmaris and allow things to play out as Bishop De\u0027Unnero has begun them. The less the people - even your fellows at St. Precious - see of you and hear of you, the better. Just loosen the grip. Cut back the patrols and tax demands and instruct the preachers to temper their rhetoric.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I to lead in any rituals?\" Francis asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" came the sharp retort. \"To do so could only invite criticism, and that you cannot afford if I am to further solidify your position - as master or as bishop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancis let his gaze fall to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fear not, for you will have your day, and sooner than you believe,\" Markwart promised him. \"Headmaster will lead, very swiftly, to abbot of St. Precious, do not doubt; and it might be that the time will soon come for Bishop De\u0027Unnero to be replaced permanently. The King might well demand that of me, at least. How convenient for me to have Headmaster Francis already in place as logical successor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe overwhelmed Francis nodded and asked nothing more, and so Markwart left him alone with his thoughts. The last statement, along with Markwart\u0027s pointedly telling him that he should compare favorablyto De\u0027Unnero, led him to believe that the Bishop had fallen far from Markwart\u0027s graces, or would be on the road out of Palmaris for a very long time. In any case, the other thing that Brother - soon-to-be-Master -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Francis understood was that Markwart\u0027s description to the other abbots of him as a pawn would prove to be a lot closer to the truth than the Father Abbot wanted him to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Francis was soon able to dismiss all of those unsettling notions. The important thing was that he, despite his helping the five renegade monks, was still playing a vital role in the direction of the Order, even if that role would be only as Markwart\u0027s pawn. Jojonah and Braumin had forgiven him his crime against Grady Chilichunk, that was true, but Father Abbot Mark-wart had never blamed him in the first place. To Francis now that lack of guilt to absolve was preferable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have considered your information most carefully,\" the spirit of the Father Abbot said to De\u0027Unnero in the Bishop\u0027s private quarters at Chasewind Manor later that same night. \"You are certain that Nightbird means to go north?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the words of Shamus Kilronney,\" De\u0027Unnero replied. \"I see no reason for the soldier to lie to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are resentments in Palmaris,\" Markwart warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shamus Kilronney is a man of the King, and never the Baron,\" De\u0027Un-nero was quick to answer. \"I chose him as my spy because I trust his loy-alty to King and Crown, and therefore, to me, as bishop and King\u0027s voice in Palmaris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is good,\" said Markwart. \"And what of these other men, the six you spoke of? Can we be certain that they are our missing brethren?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is likely that Brother Braumin and the other four heretics are among them,\" De\u0027Unnero said. \"As to the identity of the sixth man, I cannot attest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will find out,\" Markwart instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have spies - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No spies!\" the Father Abbot roared. \"De\u0027Unnero alone will find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of anger and confusion came over the startled Bishop\u0027s face, but then his eyes widened as the meaning of the Father Abbot\u0027s words came clear to him. \"Am I to go?\" he dared to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For years you have asked for the chance to fight the one named Night-bird,\" Markwart explained. \"Your arguments have at last convinced me that Marcalo De\u0027Unnero alone might bring this one to justice. Do not fail me in this! The return of the stolen gemstones and the death of Avelyn\u0027s proteges will strengthen our position within the Church, and thus, the posi-tion of the Church will be strengthened within the state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what am I to do with Braumin and the heretics, if it is indeed them?\" De\u0027Unnero asked breathlessly, practically panting at the possibili-ties looming before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be preferable if we have one or more of them,\" Markwart rea-soned, \"that we might extract a confession before putting them all to the stake. When you slay Nightbird, his woman companion, and that filthy cen-taur beast, use Kilronney to help capture the rogues. If they resist, then kill them as well. All I charge you with is the return of the heads of the two closest to Avelyn and the gemstones. We can always go back for Braumin and his stooges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a glorious victory lies before us, my friend,\" Markwart continued, \"one that will play the King\u0027s hand for him. He will not dare speak against us when we walk down the streets of Palmaris with our gruesome trophies, proclaiming that the evil is purged to the cheers of thousands!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have told you all along that the one called Nightbird is mine for the taking,\" De\u0027Unnero replied with confidence. \"I understand my role now, the calling that God brought to me when he led me to St.-Mere-Abelle and drove my body through hours of training. This hunt is the task for which Marcalo De\u0027Unnero was born, and in it I shall not fail!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkwart didn\u0027t doubt him for a minute, as was reflected by the wicked laughter of his spirit. De\u0027Unnero, so intense, rubbing his fingers together eagerly, did not join in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When may I go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as you are prepared for the road,\" Markwart replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prepared?\" De\u0027Unnero scoffed. \"What preparations must I make?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little matter of food and transport,\" the spirit of the Father Abbot replied sarcastically. \"Are you to ride horseback or in a wagon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ride?\" the Bishop echoed. \"I will run, will find my food as I go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pray tell me,\" Markwart prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bishop grew more animated. He moved around the edge of his bed, extending his hand toward the Father Abbot, showing the spirit his tiger\u0027s paw gemstone. \"It is incredible,\" he admitted. \"Like you with the soul stone, I have found a new level with the tiger\u0027s paw. When I fell into the magic in pursuit of Baron Bildeborough, it affected more than my limb. Iwas the tiger, Father Abbot, in body and in heart; surely such a creature will have little trouble with the winter terrain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkwart, caught by surprise, paused to digest the startling information. He wondered if De\u0027Unnero, too, had found this inner voice, the voice of God; his pride made him hope that the man had not!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then he understood, for the voice told him the truth of the matter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe\u0027Unnero had found the higher level of stone use because of his intense emotional state when he had set out after the Baron. That intense level would be useful now, Markwart thought; again the voice showed him the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still, you have preparations to make,\" he said to De\u0027Unnero. \"Who is your second?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pitiful sort named Brother Talumus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you trust him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him that you are leaving, but that he is to take no action nor inform anyone,\" Markwart instructed. \"Tell him to deflect any questions con-cerning your whereabouts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe\u0027Unnero shook his head. \"Questions and issues will be raised daily,\" he explained. \"The road is long before me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Brother Francis will leave this very morning for St. Precious to serve in your stead,\" Markwart explained. \"That one is trustworthy, and too insignificant to cause any problems for either of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow De\u0027Unnero was smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One last issue,\" Markwart went on, listening again to that voice in his head. \"What has happened to the merchant Crump?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He remains in the dungeons of St. Precious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Repentant?\" Markwart asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly,\" replied the Bishop. \"That one is far too proud and stubborn to admit the error of his actions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then parade him out publicly tomorrow morning,\" the Father Abbot instructed. \"Accuse him loudly of treason, and let the fool speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will deny it to the word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then execute him in the name of the King,\" Markwart said callously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven brutal De\u0027Unnero was taken aback by that command. But only for a moment, and then a grim smile made its way across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now open your mind to me,\" Markwart instructed. \"I will show you the manner in which you might best use your favored gemstone, in which you might easily attain again that highest level of magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey joined then, spirit to spirit, and Markwart gave the Bishop the needed information. When they were done, De\u0027Unnero could readily bring forth the tremendous level of power - the one he had found when in pur-suit of Baron Bildeborough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May the speed of God\u0027s own legs carry you swiftly,\" Markwart said, a traditional parting when haste was needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer, De\u0027Unnero held up the tiger\u0027s paw for Markwart\u0027s spirit to see. \"Indeed they shall,\" he said. \"Indeed they shall.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-demon-apostle-the-demonwars-saga-3/page-24.html","bookId":2169,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:09 PM"}
