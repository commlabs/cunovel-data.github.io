Jesus Christ—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Ellis, you would not be making fun of me if someone possessed by a demonic spirit had thrown you twenty-five feet across a room and then tried to slash you into a bloody pulp.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain it took me a long time to start breathing regularly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was reduced to: “You’re right. I’m sorry. I’m just very tired. I don’t know. I’m not making fun of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller kept staring at me, as if deciding something. He asked if I had the diagram of the house. I had quickly drafted a crude one on Four Seasons stationery, and when I pulled it out of my jacket pocket my hand was shaking so badly that I dropped it on the table as I was handing it to him. I apologized. He glanced at the sketch and placed it next to his notepad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to ask you some things,” he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clasped my hands together to make them stop shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When do these manifestations take place, Mr. Ellis?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At night,” I whispered. “They take place in the middle of the night. It’s always around the time of my father’s death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When is that? Specifically.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. Between two and three in the morning. My father died at two-forty a.m. and this seems to be the time when . . . things happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long pause that I couldn’t stand and had to question. “What does that mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And do you know the time of your birth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller was scrawling notes along the pad. He didn’t look at me when he asked this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” I swallowed hard. “It was at two-forty in the afternoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller was studying something he had written down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does any of that mean?” I asked. “Beyond a coincidence?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It means this is something to take seriously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is that?” I asked in the voice of a believer, in the voice of a student seeking answers from the teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because spirits who show themselves between night and dawn want something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what that means. I don’t get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It means they want to frighten you,” he said. “It means they want you to realize something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to cry again but I was able to control it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of this is very comforting, is it? I heard the writer ask me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mentioned in one of the interviews I glanced at that you based this fictional character, this Patrick Bateman, on your father—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I had, yes—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—and you say this Patrick Bateman has been contacting you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes, this is true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were you and your father close?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. No. We weren’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller was studying something on the notepad. It was bothering him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And there are children in the house? Whose are they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I have two,” I said. “Well, actually, only one of them is mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller looked up suddenly. He didn’t respond but was staring at me, clearly troubled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I asked. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s strange,” Miller said. “I don’t feel from you that you do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t feel what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That you have a child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest ached. I flashed on Robby holding me in the car after school, and how tightly he gripped me last night because he thought I would protect him. Because he thought that I was now his father. I didn’t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller moved on. “Is there a fireplace in the house?” he asked suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShamefully, I had to think about this. I had been in the house for five months and I had to think about whether there was a fireplace in the house. If there was one it had never been used. This forced me to realize that there were two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes, we do. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller paused, studying the notepad, and murmured offhand, “It’s just an entrance point. That’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I ask you something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller said yes while flipping a page in the notepad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if . . . what if this unexplained presence . . . doesn’t want to leave?” I swallowed. “What happens then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller looked up. “I have to let them know that I am helping them move on to a better place. They are actually quite grateful for any assistance.” He paused. “These are souls in distress, Mr. Ellis.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-116.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
