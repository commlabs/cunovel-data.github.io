She didn’t tell you, did she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what?” I let out a strange laugh. “You don’t really have a spotted dick, do you? I mean, I thought up that scenario because you’ll only do it in the dark and that’s really the only part of your body you haven’t shown off in public to, like, everyone. It was just a...theory.” My eyes began to grow wide as I realized how strangely he was watching me. “But, wow...” I blew out a long breath. “It’s true, isn’t it? You honestly have a spotted—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Birthmark,” he growled. “One fucking birthmark.” When he glanced away, I noticed how pale he was. “One...really big birthmark.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I was right?” I laughed out loud. “That’s incredible. I am so awesome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis scowl totally disagreed with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat and calmed down because the topic clearly unsettled him. “Sorry. I just...I knew there had to be a reason you’d only do it in the dark, and...” I shook my head. “Does that actually work? I mean, none of the girls I overheard gossiping about you in the bathroom mentioned it, and they mentioned everything else, so I’m sure they would’ve. I can’t believe no one you’ve been with before has ever seen it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged one of those uncomfortable, I-don’t-want-to-talk-about-it shrugs and wouldn’t meet my gaze. “Two other girls have seen it…besides Blondie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy back straightened. “And why has Zoey seen your penis?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth to answer but paused when he saw my face. His lips quirked into a smirk. “Are you jealous? Of Blondie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffed and sent him a glower. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, totally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin only grew. “She walked in on me in the shower once; thought I was Hamilton.” Smile suddenly dimming, he glanced away. “To say the least, she totally flipped out. So did the other two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know why it bothered me that three women had seen his penis, but it really, really did. I pulled back, my chest tight with pain, even as I forced casualness into my voice. “Oh, yeah? How’d they freak out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you think?” His gaze was hard and penetrating. Then he gave a hard, sniff-like, self-derisive laugh and shrugged. “The first time was...well, my first time. I didn’t even think about hiding it or being ashamed. I didn’t know it was a fucking abnormality. Everyone in my family knew about it and had seen me run around naked when I was younger. No one ever told me, ‘Hey, this could totally freak out some girl later on in your life.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, she didn’t see it until after you two had...?” I motioned with my hands, wondering why I was talking about this with him while we were naked and in bed together, arguing about completely unrelated, more-important things…like our possible future together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’d she do?” I think the only reason I could ask was because I knew it had ended badly for him. If I had known he’d had a good time with her, I wouldn’t have been able to ask at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She screamed. Then she demanded to know what the hell was wrong with me and if it was contagious and...you know.” He glanced away, pale and serious. “All that shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. “What a bitch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze zipped back to me. “She was only sixteen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat still didn’t excuse her in my book. She’d traumatized my Oren. The bitch must die...in my head anyway. I pictured myself pushing her off the side of a bridge and listening to her scream all the way down until...oops, she wasn’t screaming anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yikes, I really did have issues, didn’t I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the next girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tianna,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI seized up inside, not liking that I knew one of his past sluts’ names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTianna, Tianna. The big, fat bitch-anna, I sang in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She gave good head,” he went on, and yep, I really didn’t like knowing that. But he didn’t seem to know I was in the room anymore; he was trapped in a memory. “And she seemed okay with doing it in the dark until one night she pulled her cell phone out and turned on the light so she could see what she was doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And she flipped out, too,” I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOren nodded. “Oh, yeah. Big time. Called me a freak and threatened to cut off my pecker if I’d given her an STD. All kinds of lovely shit. I actually had to blackmail that one to keep her trap shut about it.” He let out a small, depressed sigh. “She still really hates me.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-55.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
