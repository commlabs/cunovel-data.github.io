She was amazing. Life was amazing. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eI lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eOur love could conquer all. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eUntil it didn\u0027t. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eSo I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIt shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eOr so I thought. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eYears later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before.
