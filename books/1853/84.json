Gavin was seated at the kitchen table and Carter had his back to him, loading things in the dishwasher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, candy after breakfast. And I\u0027m Santa Claus,\" Carter muttered quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re Santa Claus?!!\" Gavin asked excitedly, standing up on his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter whipped around to face him with a panicked look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? No. Well, technically... Wait, no. No, no, no. I am not Santa Claus. That was just a figure of speech,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s a finger of peach?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" Carter muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin pointed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Awwwwww, you said shit,\" he accused, making sure to whisper the bad word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So did you,\" Carter argued. \"Don\u0027t tell your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me what?\" I asked, walking through the doorway with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter sighed. \"You heard that didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked up to Gavin and scooped him off of the chair and into my arms for a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about,\" I told him as I kissed both of Gavin\u0027s cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you sleep last night, little man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed me as hard as he could until I had to pry his arms from around my neck so I could breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I slept good. But you crawled into my bed wif me last night and told me never to talk to kings with smiley faces,\" he told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter laughed while I groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Gavin one last squeeze and then set him down on his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run into your room and find your shoes, okay? We\u0027re going to see Aunt Liz and Uncle Jim in a little bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a cheer of excitement and ran out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over to Carter and leaned my body into his while he lounged against the kitchen counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look good wearing my shirt,\" he said as he wrapped his arms around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed his chin and looked up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I look even better wearing your tighty underoos,\" I said with a laugh as I reached back and lifted up a corner of his shirt so he could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you found those. My boxers made me chafe at work so I thought I\u0027d try…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" I interrupted him. \"I\u0027ll make sure everyone knows you wear big boy undies now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and wrapped my arms around his neck. He bent down and gave me a sweet kiss, sucking my top lip into his mouth and making my toes curl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are my clothes?” I asked between kisses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your shirt is in the garbage. You threw it there last night when we got here and you saw the blood all over it. You said you couldn’t possibly ever wear something again that reminded you of how you almost died in a horrific accident. I took your jeans from you before you did the same to them. They’re in the dryer right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and sighed while Carter tightened his hold on me and placed another kiss on my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move in with me,” he said suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips stayed against mine and I opened my eyes so I could see him. He stared at me so intently there was no way I misheard him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" he continued quickly. \"I love Gavin. I love waking up to both of you in this house with me. I don\u0027t want to miss seeing him tie his shoes for the first time or write his name. I don\u0027t want to wake up in the morning and not see you drooling on the pillow next to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and smacked his arm, the conversation immediately turning lighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, I need a woman here to be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen making me chicken pot pies every night,\" he said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then we\u0027ve obviously never met if you want me to take on that role.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood there in the kitchen, wrapped in each other\u0027s arms with Carter’s junior jockey\u0027s creeping up my ass, and I realized I had never been happier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows went up and his face lit up with a huge smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes? Really?\" he asked. “I thought for sure I’d have to resort to bribery or extortion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded my head and laughed. \"Yes! We will move in with you so I can monitor the stupid shit you say and punch you in the kidney when you suggest I should be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few hours later, Liz and I were just finishing our paperwork at her kitchen table. Jim and Carter were sitting at the table with us carrying on their own conversation while Gavin and Jim\u0027s eight-year-old little cousin Melissa played.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin was currently in the living room watching a movie, but Melissa had been running through the kitchen at warp speed, yelling as loud as she could for the past fifteen minutes. Carter and I passed each other secret looks every so often about the conversation we had in the car on the way over here. We weren\u0027t going to discipline Gavin at all the entire time at their house. We would let Liz and Jim take over and see what they did. I had first hand experience on the type of care-givers they were since they were my best friends, so this was mostly for Carter’s benefit. I knew for a fact that Liz and Jim were wonderful with kids and Carter would be more than willing to assign them as Gavin’s back-up guardians after today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, we wouldn\u0027t need to discipline Gavin anyway. He was being very well behaved. Melissa, on the other hand, reminded me yet again while some animals in the wild eat their young. She was a terror. After her twenty-seventh pass through the kitchen, waving her hands above her head and screaming, Liz finally had enough. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-84.html","bookId":1853,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:55 PM"}
