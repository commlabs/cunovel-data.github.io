PENN STANDS TREAT—A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE—HOW TO PRESERVE THE HAIR.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The first colony of Pennsylvania was founded in 1682 by Wm. Penn, a Quaker gentleman of steady habits, who, with remarkable foresight settled at Philadelphia, because he thought it an eligible place to hold a Centennial Exhibition. He took out naturalization papers, and began by studying the prejudices of the natives with a view to getting upon the good side of them. He smoked the calumet of peace with them and treated them to hard 75cider, under the mellowing influence of which they said he was like “Onas.” How well he deserved this compliment the reader will comprehend at once by reference to the accompanying illustration. The coincidence of resemblance is indeed striking, though it must be admitted he is not unlike a cigar sign either.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PENN’S TREATY WITH THE INDIANS\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 76Wm. Penn bought property in Philadelphia, where he resided for thirty-six years, getting along very well with the neighbors.
