Kelsey didn\u0027t seem to think they could do much to establish the connection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He may be right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo feminine hygiene commercials played through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You worked with Kelsey before—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before I got demoted,\" Ozzie supplied. \"Yeah. Kelsey used to be on city vice. I was county gang task force. We crossed paths.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was less than enthusiastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You trust Kelsey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie worked his mouth like he was tasting the question. \"This guy you saw with Hector Mara, the guy with the black fingernails and the trench coat. You know who that was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chich Gutierrez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelsey told you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027d been hearing things about Hector Mara buying heroin from a guy named Chich Gutierrez. I guessed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie didn\u0027t seem to like that. \"By himself Chich would be nothing — a joke. Look at the way the guy dresses, for Christ\u0027s sake. But the fact that he\u0027s always compared himself to Sanchez, always tried to act that bad... it makes him unpredictable. Chich goes the extra mile to prove he\u0027s got what he hasn\u0027t got, you know? You chew on an inferiority complex like that long enough, it turns you dramatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two nights ago, Del Brandon told me Zeta Sanchez had been trying to move heroin through RideWorks back in \u002793. Del said that\u0027s why he was so anxious to push Zeta out of the business. You ever hear anything about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie\u0027s eyes fixed on the woman in the low-cut evening dress. She was weeping and the doctor was comforting her. \"You wanted to know how I got demoted. You going to get sore now if I tell you the truth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, then rested his head back in the pillows. \"Fall of \u002792, I started having some ideas along the lines you just described. I figured you take a guy like Zeta Sanchez, with connections to the gangs, big-time access to the heroin pipeline, you put him together with a guy like old Jeremiah Brandon who\u0027s got a ready-made distribution network — things are going to happen. You use the carnival circuit, you could move a good amount of stash pretty much anywhere in the nation with very little trouble. So I started asking around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And something went wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at me, anger simmering in his eyes. \"About the same time, there was a big internal affairs bust going down. Some of the deputies working at the jail were smuggling in drugs for the prison gangs. Others were getting paid to look the other way. Sixteen deputies were fired. Five criminally prosecuted. A few higher-ranking people in the department were implicated, too, but there wasn\u0027t enough proof to fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were one of the ones implicated?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forced reassignment. Three scumbag cons came forward and fingered me. Guys I had never even heard of, but you can bet your ass they all knew Zeta Sanchez. They got reduced sentences for their cooperation. I went down in the departmental housecleaning. After that, nobody listened to me much on the subject of Zeta Sanchez and RideWorks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no truth to the allegations against you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pretend you didn\u0027t need to ask that question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the television, two men in cardigans were lighting each other\u0027s cigarette. Ozzie flicked his thumb against his forefinger, mimicking them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think it\u0027s still happening?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What — smack running through RideWorks? Del Brandon couldn\u0027t think his way off one of his own merry-go-rounds, kid. He couldn\u0027t handle something that big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hector and Chich were worried about Zeta Sanchez coming back to town. Del Brandon was too. He was also real worried about his brother Aaron, who was reading articles about how to sic the IRS on your relatives to take over a family business. Maybe Del and Hector and Chich got together and killed two birds with one stone — framed Sanchez for Aaron Brandon\u0027s murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie laughed. \"Mr. Navarre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really want to get Zeta Sanchez off the hook, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think he killed Aaron Brandon. Call me old-fashioned. I think that means we should look for whoever did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys like Zeta Sanchez — you can\u0027t go soft for them. They\u0027re Attila the rat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attila the what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie held up the TV remote and punched the volume down to zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something from when I was a kid in the fifties, down in Harlingen. I never told you this story? My mom was a waitress, worked a lot at night so she wanted to get me a pet. Only she couldn\u0027t afford a dog or anything, so she came home one night with these two dime-store rats — the little kind, one black and one white.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rats?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Only we found out pretty quick they weren\u0027t both males. A week went by and they had a litter of little pink things, looked like grubs. My mom said we\u0027d have to drown them, but we never did. They grew into gray adult rats, then had babies and pretty soon the babies had babies. I woke up one morning and the original two rats were gone. Nothing left but little patches of hair in the wood shavings. Their kids had eaten them. My mom didn\u0027t know what to do. The rats kept having babies, and eating them, and eating the weaker adults. Most horrible time in my childhood, waking up every morning and dreading to look in that cage, wondering what I\u0027d find. Finally, there was only one rat left — he must\u0027ve been fourth or fifth generation — and he\u0027d eaten all the other rats. This fat, mean little fucker had made a bed out of their fur. I\u0027m not kidding you. I named him Attila. My mom said we had to let him go, that Attila was big and mean enough to survive in the world, so we let him loose in the alley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s pretty intense for a young kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t see me keeping pets, Navarre. The thing is — every time you look at a veterano like Zeta Sanchez or Hector Mara, somebody who made it through the gang life and got past the age of twenty, you\u0027re looking at Attila the rat. You\u0027re looking at the end product of generations of truly efficient cannibalism. They\u0027ve made themselves a bed out of all the weaker ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that simple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie shook his head sadly. \"What do you hear from George Berton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m seeing him later tonight. I get the feeling Hector Mara might be trying to tell him something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Ozzie about Hector\u0027s comments at the Poco Mas — how Hector seemed to be considering some kind of offer George had made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie thought about that. His eyes closed. They stayed that way for half a minute before opening again. \"I got to get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me know how it goes with George. You mind getting the drapes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got them. The room dipped into cool darkness. Ozzie turned the television off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the tree,\" Ozzie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him no problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, Tres — I owe you. Pulling me out of the line of fire the other day. Don\u0027t think I\u0027ve forgotten that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay, Ozzie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not.\" He shifted, tugged the covers over his bare belly. \"It\u0027s not. You need anything — you need anything at all, you come find me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Ozzie. I\u0027ll do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerson mumbled something I couldn\u0027t make out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left him in the dark, swathed in downy beige comforters, the bedroom quiet except for the ping of carbonation in his Sprite can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went into the living room to reclaim my boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t planning on meeting the SWAT team at Hector Mara\u0027s farmhouse that afternoon. I just got lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I pulled over at the Y in the road where Hector\u0027s property sat, the shoulder was already crowded with police vans, lights flashing. SWAT members with black flak suits and assault rifles milled around in the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith typical April fickleness, the sunny morning had turned into an overcast afternoon — fiberglass-yellow clouds, air as moist and warm as dog\u0027s breath. Ana DeLeon and Kelsey were having a chat with a squad sergeant over by the banana trees as I walked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remembered the reinforcements this time, did we, Kelsey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey pointed at me without speaking, balled his other fist, then gestured to the SWAT sergeant to follow him. The two men walked toward the nearest patrol unit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Navarre.\" DeLeon\u0027s voice was weary with the sound of recently jettisoned adrenaline. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up the drive at the Mara property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door of the L-shaped cinder-block house had been busted off its hinges. Several of the windows were broken. SWAT members stood on the porch, a uniformed officer leaning in the doorway writing up a report. There was a similar scene at the white mobile home. They must\u0027ve smashed open Hector\u0027s chicken coops, too, because the fields were now overrun with poultry. Wild bantams were pecking around the base of the apple tree. A Rhode Island Red was perched on a broken tricycle seat. There was even a rogue peacock strolling down the driveway, dragging a strip of pink toilet paper in its plumage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me guess,\" I said. \"You followed up on my message. Mara was gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeLeon wore a navy blazer and skirt and a cream blouse. In the afternoon light, her face seemed softer, her eyes not quite so severe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t flatter yourself, Navarre. What got us out here was some work by the ATF. They finished tracing the Solidox in the pipe bomb — got it down to the exact hardware store, got an ID on the buyer from one of the clerks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hector Mara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just got through busting up his mobile home— found some things we missed on the first search. Or maybe they just weren\u0027t there the first time — some wiring. A timer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty clear, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one thing we did not find is Mr. Mara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed toward the cinder-block L. \"Can I take a look?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing there. We went through it pretty thoroughly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I take a look?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeLeon considered, then let her dissatisfaction with me collapse in a kind of tired apathy. \"With me present, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked up the drive, past the peacock, past a couple of uniformed cops complaining about the humidity and the woes of polyester uniforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That friend we spoke about,\" I told DeLeon. \"He could maybe track down Mara. If Mara\u0027s still in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not dealing with Arguello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You figure Lieutenant Hernandez will give you more time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeLeon kept walking, occasionally slipping on the gravel in her heels. \"Not likely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because nothing here points away from Sanchez. It just means Hector was helping him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice and simple,\" I said. \"And it stinks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeLeon stopped at the porch. The SWAT team had moved on. The bullet-riddled door lay flat across the entrance like a broken drawbridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeLeon pushed her hair behind her ear, turned slowly, and looked out across the fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You doing all right?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her eyebrows, gave me the little head shake women do when they\u0027re addressing a man who\u0027s acting like a three-year-old. \"Just fine. And you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched two SWAT guys out in the field, trampling Hector Mara\u0027s tidy garden. They were kicking the heads off cabbages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeLeon smoothed her skirt. \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m on edge.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-24.html","bookId":2418,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM"}
