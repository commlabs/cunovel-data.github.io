The Empyreans of humanity ruled their own domains, scattered across the various great worlds. But, the monster race had a singular Empyrean ruler, the Monster Emperor, that stood above all others. The entire monster race had to submit to this person. In truth, there were very few monster Empyreans; their numbers could not compare to the humans’ at all. As for this Monster Prince, he was the grandson of the current Monster Emperor, and these two World Kings were the Monster Emperor’s officials.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the arena, the Monster Prince laughed. “In my future, I am destined to become a Monster Empyrean.

That was the same concept as the current Lin Ming calling himself Empyrean Heretical God or Empyrean Azure Dragon.
