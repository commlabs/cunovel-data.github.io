His entire right arm was experiencing sharp pain. Countless muscle fibers were showing signs of tearing, and the bones in the entire right side of his body were aching dully from the recoil. In that instant, Su, who had just exhausted the last bit of his stamina, felt the urge to sit down on the floor. He slowly stretched his body out. Then, he put on his clothes, leaving this completely empty combat training area.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhile walking home, Peperus’ shouting continued to repeat itself at the bottom of Su’s heart. He felt as if there was a large rock weighing down on his chest.

His left eye suddenly began to burn with a deep green flame, and his expression became more and more cold. He could feel an incredibly cold and intense killing intent inside of his residence, one that poured at him in a completely undisguised manner.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s eyebrows jumped.

To the side of the door was the living room, and ahead was a short hallway. Around the corner was a staircase that led upstairs. Only a small desk lamp was lit in the living room, so everything inside the room was rather dusky. This normally safe, warm, and quiet residence now seemed like the lair of a vicious beast, one that was full of undefiable dignity. Just standing inside of it made Su feel as if he was suffocating.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s pupils suddenly began to contract. His body slightly bent down, assuming a stance that allowed him to erupt with power at any moment.

He walked towards those long legs that originally possessed unmatched temptation, but were now full of domineeringness. What he didn’t understand was why these perfect legs possessed such deep killing intent. Su’s precise memory that was comparable to intelligence systems told him who the owner of these legs was.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHe walked all the way up until he could touch those long legs just by reaching out his hands, and then Su turned to look around the corner of the wall. Sure enough, what he saw was Persephone’s face that had a smile that was yet not a smile.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHer eyes looked like tears were going to flow out. She was biting a strand of gray hair that was hanging down, rubbing it between the gaps of her snow white teeth. Her fine porcelain-like skin was dyed with a glaring redness. However, not even her fatal beauty was enough to smother the undisguised killing intent exuding from the tip of her brows!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen he saw Persephone, Su, who was originally going to relax, no longer felt that way.

This was the stance that left him with the most flexibility in dealing with various situations, a posture that could deliver a fatal blow at any time to an enemy. Sweat continuously poured out from his temples. Su felt far less pressure even when he was faced against Martham or Pandora!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Phoney.” Su softly said.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone sat on on a chair in a crooked manner, her crossed legs still stepping on the opposing wall, completely cutting off Su’s path. Her body reeked strongly of alcohol, and her right hand was playing with a small and exquisite alcohol bottle. There was still a bit of alcohol left inside, enough for one last gulp.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Phoney?” Su cried out again.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone raised her head and drained the remaining alcohol in one gulp. She then tossed the alcohol bottle onto the ground, causing it to shatter to pieces before suddenly standing up! The moment she stood up, the pressure caused by the abrupt movement even stirring up a large gust of wind within the main hall.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You are…” Su was a bit stunned.

Then, as if he was being pulled by a formless rope, he began to fly towards Persephone! A green flame suddenly began to burn in Su’s eye. His short blade hacked out like lightning, hacking apart the force field surrounding Persephone and piercing towards her ribs! However, right when the blade was several centimeters from reaching Persephone, Su suddenly released a grunt and stopped his body’s instinctive counter attack.

Only after that did she look at Su who was lying on his back while staring at the ceiling with a stupefied expression.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Su, that…\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eum…\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e” Persephone’s face was still heart shakingly red.

The cold appearance that she had put up with difficulty was ruined just like that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“That damn Helen, what a rotten plan this was!” Persephone fiercely cursed inwardly. At the same time, she blamed her own foolishness. She clearly already decided not to listen to Helen’s advice anymore, so after everything was done, why did she all of a sudden decide to smoke a cigarette? She always disliked cigarettes! Moreover, the thing she hated the most was that she actually decided to listen to Helen’s advice on this type of stuff! It was just like listening to someone who had never seen the sea describe what an ocean wave looked like and what angle to enjoy it from!

I don’t understand at all…” A hint of panic immediately flew past Persephone’s face, and then she clenched her teeth. She loosened her shoulders, and then threw caution to the wind, fiercely saying, “Alright, it’s already over! What are you trying to say? Regardless of what you think, I am going to tell you that today’s matter has nothing to do with the drug’s effects!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOnly, when she loosened her shoulders, the string of reactions immediately made Su’s eyes became as sharp as a blade. His body that had been exhausted to its limit became stirred up again, as if it wasn’t tired at all.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen she saw Su walking over with seemingly malicious intentions, Persephone began to chew on her gray hair again.

The powerful disparity in strength made the weaker side lose all authority and get completely trampled on. Meanwhile, this general that already had a round of experience only used ten minutes to end this battle.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAll of Persephone’s clothes, both inner and outer, were torn into cloth strips. Of course, Su was no exception to this either. She fetched Su’s reserve uniform without any hesitation and put it on, completely ignoring the fact that this was Su’s only reserve uniform. Either way, she was about the same height as Su, and apart from the upper clothes being a bit tight, there weren’t any other parts that wouldn’t fit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter looking at the morning light that was gradually illuminating the sky, Persephone who still carried some ferocity left Su with some words that left him torn between laughter and tears. “From today onwards, as long as you can defeat me, I will let you be on top!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-3-chapter-8-3\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-3-chapter-9-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-3-chapter-8-4","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM"}
