She took it from him carefully, her gaze resting upon a photo of a woman with bright red hair and eyes the same color as Carmine’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven couldn’t breathe. It was the face she had seen repeatedly in her dreams, the angel in white that glowed in the sunlight. Emotion ripped through her, her voice a broken whisper. “She’s an angel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine took the frame from her, but instead of placing it back into the box, he set it on his desk. “She is,” he said quietly. “Now, anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreams filtered into Haven’s sleep that night. It was a dark, cloudless night, the glow of the moon illuminating the scene in her mind. She was back in Blackburn again, a fresh-faced little girl with nappy hair, trying to squeeze by to see out of the stables. “What’s going on, Mama?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing that concerns you, baby girl,” her mama said quietly as she tried to shoo Haven away. “Go lie down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’m not tired,” Haven argued. “Please, Mama? I want to see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing’s happening,” she said. “It’s all over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven gave up on trying to go around, instead getting on the ground and scurrying between her legs. She could faintly make out the outline of a car with the trunk open. On the ground beside it, motionless, lay a person. “It’s Miss Martha!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hush,” her mama said. “You don’t want them to hear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, Mama.” Haven tried to whisper, but she couldn’t help herself. She watched as Miss Martha was placed into the trunk, her eyes closed like she was sleeping. “Where’s Miss Martha going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Away from here,” her mama answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s away from here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot,” she said. “There’s a whole world out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Miss Martha going out there to the world?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Miss Martha’s gone to Heaven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s Heaven?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mama sighed. “Heaven’s the greatest place you can imagine. People don’t hurt anymore when they go to Heaven. There’s peace there. It’s beautiful. Everyone’s beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven smiled excitedly. “Will I get to go to Heaven?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “Someday an angel will come to take you away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the darkness erupted in blinding light. Haven shielded her eyes. She could feel the sun burning her as she ran, air fanning her sweaty skin. She pretended to fly, like Miss Martha did to Heaven the night before, and slammed into something in her path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalling to the ground, she could barely make out the form in the blinding light. She was confused until a soft voice shattered the silence. “You’re awfully dirty, little one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blindness cleared as the form knelt down to look at her. Sheer beauty, love, and compassion. Up until then, Haven hadn’t seen an angel, but she was sure one had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e28\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was encased in bright light when Carmine woke up. His head pounded, his eyes burned. He blinked a few times as he sat up, realizing he was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStretching, he popped two Tylenol to squelch the hangover before strolling out of the room. As soon as he reached the second floor, his footsteps wavered when Haven stepped into the hallway with his father. Her eyes met his the same time Vincent noticed him. “Do you need laundry done again?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two days in a row you’ve walked around with barely any clothes on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at himself. “My, uh . . . goods are covered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’m glad at least that much sank in over the years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. “What, you think you’re too young to be a grandfather?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As a matter of fact, yes,” he said. “I’m only forty-one. But frankly, I’m just as worried about you picking up something as I am about you impregnating someone. For a while, every time you said the words, ‘what’s this?’ I feared you would expose yourself to show me something suspicious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine laughed. “Well, thanks for the concern, but I assure you my dick’s in fantastic shape.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent shook his head as he glanced at Haven. “You’re excused, child. I’m sure you have things to attend to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe practically bolted for the steps as Vincent turned back to Carmine. “Go get dressed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why? It’s not like I’m indecent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t say you were indecent, but I have a free day, so I thought we’d go shooting like old times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gaped at him. “Vincent DeMarco cleared his schedule to spend time with little ol’ me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent sighed. “Go before I change my mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuckling, Carmine headed upstairs and threw on some clothes. He was in the bathroom brushing his teeth when Haven walked in. “Are you and Dr. DeMarco going away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, rinsing out his mouth. “We’re gonna go play with our guns.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll be safe, won’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, he’s not going to shoot me or anything,” he said. “I tested him a few times, and he even pointed a gun at me once, but he couldn’t pull the trigger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of making her feel better, her panicked expression only grew. “He pointed a gun at you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax, he’s probably pointed a gun at everyone at some point,” he said as he finished getting ready. “You gonna miss me, tesoro?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I always miss you when you aren’t here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put on his coat. “Give it a few more months and you’ll be tired of my ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great to hear, but what’s that shit they say? Absence makes the heart grow fonder? Me leaving means you’ll love me more when I get back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outdoor firing range was a few miles outside of town in the Swannanoa Valley. The field, about four hundred yards in length, had a covered pavilion with various-sized targets. They’d visited it a few times during the years but hadn’t been back since the incident with Nicholas . . . since Carmine went away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine had been a decent shot since he was a kid, but Vincent’s aim was impeccable, his hand as steady as a professional marksman’s. His bullet ripped straight through the bull’s-eye effortlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent reloaded his M1 Garand after expelling all the rounds and held it out to Carmine. “Do you want to try the rifle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine took it and hesitated before handing his pistol to his father. Aiming, Carmine fired once and smirked when it hit the target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was luck,” Vincent said, loading the pistol and firing it. He hit the farthest target, unloading the rounds into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fucking show-off,” Carmine said, taking another shot and hitting the target again. “See, that wasn’t luck. That was skill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not so bad,” Vincent conceded. “Nicholas can attest to that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine rolled his eyes as his father exchanged weapons with him again. He shot at the target, the atmosphere thick with unspoken words. Vincent unceremoniously fired off a few more rounds before lowering his weapon and staring off into space. Carmine realized it then . . . this wasn’t just a casual shooting trip. This wasn’t just father/son bonding time. There was something on Vincent’s mind, something that would be talked about before Carmine would be allowed to go back home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Carmine would be allowed to go back home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what you wanna talk about?” Carmine said, knowing he’d have to crack first. “Nicholas?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Vincent said. “Unless he’s the reason you’ve been in a good mood lately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine stared at his father as those words sank in. He knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t help it,” Carmine said, the stress making his voice quiver. “It’s not like I set out for this to happen. It just . . . did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent remained silent, his lack of response grating on Carmine’s nerves. “Come on, I know you have an opinion—no need to hold back. I can take it. Tell me how fucking disgusted you are that your son would go as low as to fall for a damn sla—” He faltered, unable to finish the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whether or not you say it doesn’t change anything,” Vincent said. “It doesn’t make the girl more or less of one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine waited for something more. “Is that all you have to say? I said I can take it. Tell me it’s wrong, that it’ll never work because people like us don’t belong together. Tell me she’s not good enough for me. Tell me she could never love me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what you want to hear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe narrowed his eyes. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent casually glanced at his watch like he was unaffected by the conversation. “Why don’t we get some lunch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine cocked an eyebrow. “It would be easier to kill me here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill you? What kind of person do you take me for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, fuck. I thought you might be the kinda person to hurt an innocent girl. Good to know I was wrong about that shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a man who makes mistakes, a man who doesn’t expect to be forgiven for them, but a man who does expect his children to be respectful,” he said sharply. “If you want to talk this out using our anger, we can, but I hoped we could discuss it like adults.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine hesitated. “Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, are you going to apologize for throwing that in my face?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine scoffed. “I’ll apologize for saying it when you apologize for doing it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent and Carmine were seated as soon as they reached the restaurant and both ordered the first thing on the menu. After the waiter brought their food, Vincent turned to his son. “I want you to listen carefully, Carmine. What the two of you have is harmless right now, but I don’t want to hear about it. You may care for the girl, but she isn’t yours. You’re probably going to hate me for saying this, but I’m in control. The first time she neglects what I tell her, I’ll put a stop to it all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarmine clenched his jaw as his anger boiled over, and Vincent held his hand up to stop the impending explosion. “I’m not going to harm her, but I’ll send her away if you force my hand. I’m not giving you my blessing, but I’m not forbidding it either. I’m smart enough to pick and choose my battles, and I have more important ones to fight right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at his father. “Fair enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent turned his attention to his food. “I just wonder if you know what you’re getting into.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’m kinda sorta hoping the asshole who owns her won’t own her forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent’s eyes snapped in his direction. “That’s a nice piece of information to have, but it wasn’t what I was talking about. Why do you think I asked you to teach her to drive, Carmine? Why I asked you to take her grocery shopping?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sempre-forever-1/page-39.html","bookId":2784,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:27:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:27:53 PM"}
