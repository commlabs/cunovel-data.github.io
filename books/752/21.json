{"id":41986,"no":21,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"Having made up her mind that a meeting was inevitable, Ivy made no more efforts to avoid one. By her absence on his first visit she had clearly shown Jerry how matters stood, and if he was fool enough to come again....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was, of course. Ivy, unromantically on her knees at her usual business of scrubbing the kitchen boards, felt no annoyance at being so discovered, made no hasty grabs at her rolled-up sleeves, or at the loosening knob of her hair. She would not have done so for a more favoured lover, for none of her courtships had been of the kind that encourages neatness and daintiness in a woman, that leads to curlings and powderings. She knew that men liked her for her youth and health and [85] bigness, for her cheeriness and strength, and as all these things were natural to her she had no need to trouble herself with fakes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hullo, Jerry,” she said, without looking up, and sending a swirl of soapy water round his boots.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hullo, Ivy. Why weren’t you in when I came last night?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Because I’d gone into Senlac wud Polly Sinden, as your father ud have told you, if you’d done wot you should ought and gone to him fust.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’d no call to go into Senlac—not on the first night of my leave.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Your leave doan’t matter to me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ivy....”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He caught her wrist as she was dipping the scrubbing-brush in the bucket, and she was forced to meet his eyes at last. She had tried to avoid this, staring at her soapsuds, for Jerry’s eyes were “queer.” “Leave hold of me, Jerry.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not till you stand up and look at me. I can’t speak to you on all fours like this.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ivy stood up, rather wondering at Jerry’s power to make her do so. He was a small fellow, but not of the stubby built of Tom or Harry Beatup. On the contrary, he was lightly made as a dancing-master, his hands and feet were small but very strong, his face was small and brown, lit by two large sloe-black eyes, with lashes long and curly as a child’s. His hair was curly too, in spite of its military cropping. He was a most slovenly-looking soldier, with tunic stained and buttons dim, and puttees looping grotesquely round his slim, graceful legs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If the M.P.’s git hold of you ...” began Ivy jeeringly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [86]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There ain’t any M.P.’s hereabouts. I’m on my leave, and you’re starting to spoil it already.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Wot have I got to do wud your leave? You’re maaking some sort gurt big mistaake, Jerry Sumption.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Maybe you’ve forgotten that day at Senlac Fair?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And if I have, wot matter? It meant naun. You aun’t the fust lad that’s kissed me, nor the last, nuther.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It hurt her to have to speak so plainly, but Jerry Sumption must be put right at once on one or two important matters he seemed to have misunderstood. She saw his face go pale under its sunburn and she felt sorry for him. None the less, she stuck to her harshness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I likked you well enough, and I lik you still; but if you think as I meant more’n I did or said, you’re unaccountable mistaaken.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ivy—come out of doors with me. I can’t speak to you in here. When my heart’s full I want the wind blowing round me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She shook her head. “No, Jerry; we’ll stay where we are, surelye. You’re hedge-born, but I’m house-born, and I lik four walls around me when I’m vrothered. Now, lad, doan’t that show you as we two cud never mate?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So, I’m vrothering you, am I?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Unaccountable.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Reckon I didn’t vrother you when I clipped you in the lane by the stack of Slivericks.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Doan’t ’ee....”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His strange power over her was coming back. Looking into his eyes she seemed to see strange secrets of woods, memories of roads and stars, and a light that was like the light of a burning wood, such as she had once seen, licking up from the west, burning the little farm and the barns. She was frightened of Jerry, just as she was frightened of Dallington churchyard at night, or that field-corner by Padgham, where strange lights are sometimes seen. Yet it was a fear which instead of [87] making her run, made her stumble and droop towards him, seeking refuge from terror in its source....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He pushed her away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Reckon you’ll be kissing another lad to-night.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She felt flustered and miserable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re a lamentable trial to me, Jerry.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why? ’Cos I’ve kissed you? It’s nothing. I’ll be kissing another girl to-night.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re a valiant feller.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ain’t I? You think the world of me, Ivy Beatup.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Do I? That’s news. Now doan’t start it all over again. I hear mother coming.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Beatup’s step creaked outside, and Jerry scowled at the door. The next moment he was astride the window-sill, a queer furtive look in his eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You aun’t going out lik that, surelye! I’m ashamed of you. Stay and spik to mother like a Christian.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But he had swung his leg over, and slid into the yard. She heard him run off, with padding footsteps like a beast.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1952/55909.html","bookId":752,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:43:07 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:43:07 AM"}
