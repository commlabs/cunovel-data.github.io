At his side were the ten ice sculptures of different postures. The Hebilu that O’Brien froze maintained the most basic level of vitality, but their life force already suffered severe damage. Only if they were immediately defrosted and given treatment would they have a chance of survival.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe forest was currently still negative twenty degrees, so the ice wouldn’t melt at all.

The research manager’s face immediately changed. He hurried to O’Brien’s side and said, “Your distinguished self, top secret intelligence from the family.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eO’Brien received the optical screen. Then, with his own genes as the passcode, he unlocked the layers of seals placed on this intelligence. As he read it, his face gradually fell. The research manager that stood next to him didn’t show any changes in his expression, but his palms were covered in sweat, and he was inwardly grumbling. In the Arthur family, his level of authority was quite high, second only to some great figures with directly related bloodlines. In this type of situation where it was of the utmost secrecy, he could also use his authority to infer some key parts and help make a decision. However, this time, the first keywords that popped up were the Town of Trials!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe research manager immediately closed the report and gave it to O’Brien. However, he couldn’t remove the mark left behind after he saw the key words. As O’Brien silently read the contents, every change in expression this gray-haired young man made would scare this nearly fifty year old research manager witless! This was the first time in his life that he felt his own level of authority might be a bit too high.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter reading the report, O’Brien’s face instead returned to normal. It was already time to set off. O’Brien silently walked towards the center of the forest.

The fireball’s surface was covered in a purplish black color, and the core of the sphere was actually a blazing white! Even with several meters separating them, the Poseidon’s Trident soldiers could still feel the burning heat that assaulted their senses. Meanwhile, the crazy power stored within even more so made the many Magic Domain ability users present turn pale! Even the soldiers that had always followed O’Brien thought that he was only good at the cold domain, never expecting that he could condense a fireball of such power!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf this ball of flame flew out, even a main battle tank would have half its body melted!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe one that had been grabbed was a Hebilu girl, her body that was only two-thirds the size of a mature fighter indicated that she was still quite a ways off from reaching adulthood. With only a meter between herself and this fireball that could burn her into ashes, the girl’s bluish gray hair was already starting to burn, and her large eyes were even more so burned until they almost couldn’t open. However, she still struggled with everything she had and cried out angrily, not fearing O’Brien’s violent methods.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eO’Brien released a cold laugh.

In the blink of an eye, it already penetrated through layers of treetops, disappearing into the lush and exuberant leaves. A strand of fiery light suddenly rose from an ancient tree’s trunk, and then it swept outwards in a slanted manner. The further up it burned, the more ferocious it raged. It was like a long path of flames, drawing out the fireball’s flight trajectory!

It went without saying that making this forest his enemy was extremely dangerous. Perhaps continuing further would result in his entire troop being forever buried here. However, O’Brien still chose to continue as they originally planned. He had also thought about returning to Dragon City and then leading Poseidon’s Trident into a life and death fight against Mitchels, but this plan was immediately tossed aside. The current Poseidon’s Trident wouldn’t unconditionally obey his orders. In addition, with O’Brien’s pride, he would much rather personally remove that person’s head!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHis ice cold reasoning told O’Brien that if he wanted to accomplish this objective, the fastest method was the carry out the pre-established plan, this enormous, precise, complex, and perfect plan he created himself.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Madeline, wait for me.

In the deep night, the continuously flickering cigarette end was like a lighthouse in a dark night, unspeakably eye-grabbing and dazzling. Within a kilometer of distance, snipers with good enough sight could even see just how slender and white the two fingers that held the cigarette were.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn this darkness where one’s sight became limited, there should be over a thousand enemies within just a few dozen kilometers of distance.

Human’s innate tendency to wage war was the first to be unearthed, and when taken to the furthest extent, one would touch upon various talents related to night combat. If one’s luck was sufficiently bad, this bit of cigarette embers would make over a thousand Scorpions of Disaster soldiers simultaneously lock their sights onto Su.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBy now, the number of Scorpions of Disaster soldiers that died under Su’s hands already exceeded three hundred. Even though his current mood was plain like water without any taste, the excessive slaughter also made him feel a bit strange. His body seemed to constantly be releasing an infantile like aura. That was an aura of life, a flourishing, surging aura that was thick to the point of making Su want to vomit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu seemed to be slaughtering towards the center of the battlefield in a strange line, but he still never encountered a powerful opponent like Martham.

The low hanging clouds full of radiation covered the world in a faint green color. Su breathed in the cold, acrid air full of radiation and smoke, unexpectedly feeling a moment of great calmness.

Then, he leaned over his body, bending at the waist. While standing up, he picked up the assault rifle at his side and brushed away the dust that had landed on his body along the way. More than ten rounds of bullets of varying calibers flew over, all of them seemingly passing right next to Su’s body, blasting this incomparably tattered little house until dust flew everywhere and debris rushed into the air! It was to the extent where a sniper bullet accurately struck the cigarette butt Su flung away! As a result, the embers that flew outwards illuminated this dark and gloomy night ever so slightly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eImmediately after, there were no signs of anyone in this building anymore.

An enormous sniper rifle rested on his back, while what rested in his right hand was still the Scorpions of Disaster’s standard assault rifle.
