His hand tightened on her waist, holding her back, and she murmured, “Come on, Marco,” into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled away, leaving her panting. “Hungry little thing, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am. And if I want more?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed a thumb over her still-wet lips before releasing her and taking the knives from her clenched hands. As he stepped away, she nearly collapsed, her legs boneless and her hands suddenly empty and aching from making fists around the steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you’ll have to beg for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was off balance for a moment, but she quickly regained her footing, sensing that she needed to keep him interested, that he was the sort of man who got bored easily and would toy with her only as long as he enjoyed the chase. “Do I have to get on my knees?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat got his attention. He turned back from the crate, where he was slipping his knives one by one into a long leather roll. Their eyes caught, and with her chin held high, she gracefully dropped to her knees and sat back on her haunches as she’d been taught when interviewing geishas in the East. Hands folded just so, she lowered her eyelids to gaze up through her lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed hard and looked away, turning his head and listening to the sounds beyond the backdrop. She could hear it, too—the caravan was closing for the night. The noise of the crowd had grown faint, wagon doors were slamming closed, and Criminy’s voice shouted unnaturally loudly, thanking everyone and welcoming them back tomorrow if they weren’t eaten by bludbunnies on the way home. She had almost forgotten they weren’t the only people in the dark, that hundreds of people had been lingering and laughing just around the corner. But now they were alone. Almost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fearless and shameless. What a combination,” he finally said, and she laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a writer. I’ve lived through hell and imagined worse. You don’t scare me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even though they call me a murderer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood in one smooth motion. “Thing is, I don’t think you did it. I’d like to prove everyone wrong. I’m one of the only journalists out there hell-bent on the truth.” She shrugged. “Such is my curse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the wrong thing to say to him, and she felt the same drop in her gut as if moving a chess piece to a square that would lose her the game. His face closed up, his eyes going dark and fathomless, looking straight through her. “I can’t give you what you want.” It came out ragged, his back to her as he finished with his knives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was drawn to him, desperate to mend what she’d torn asunder. Her hand found the small of his back, her fingertips spreading to enjoy the play of hard muscles. “Is the truth so impossible?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shuddered and shook her off, rolling up his knives and storming to the stairs of his trailer. He slipped inside and slammed the door in her face without a word, and she felt a flare of anger. It was bad enough to kiss her like that and leave her wanting, but to lock her out was a slap in the face. Even if the truth was his possession, his secret, she was unaccustomed to being treated so rudely. And damned if she wasn’t burdened with a temper. But she wasn’t about to knock or yell or beg. The time for that was past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgetting that he had deadly aim and a history of supposed bloodshed and driven only by her cheated body and her angry heart, she reached into her pocket for her lock picks and had his door open in moments. The lights inside were warm, the room glowing with wallpaper in silver and black stripes. Marco sat on a low sofa, his head in his hands and his shirt half unbuttoned. Furious surprise was written clearly on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you just break into my wagon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth quirked up slowly. “Of course not. The door was open.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed the door silently and leaned back against it, suddenly unsure. What was she doing? She’d never thrown herself at a man—at least, not since Liam. The rest had come running like bludrats scenting a bare foot. She’d simply chosen one from the pack and let things run their course. But this was no pack, just a lone wolf, and the only one that would do. She had come to the caravan for an entertaining story, but now she couldn’t think past her own stupid body and swiftly racing heart. She wanted his secrets even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should have been easy. Seduce him. Take what she needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this was more than she had expected, and she had to tread carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarco didn’t move, sprawled over his couch as he was with one leg up on a steamer trunk. He was surprised, sure, but still dripping with confidence, with a bone-deep certainty that he was the most dangerous thing in the very small, suddenly rather airless room. She realized that she’d left Brutus outside, slammed the door in the metal dog’s face. Even without the knives glinting up his shirt, she still suspected Marco was well-armed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose I should be glad you didn’t break in while I was out and rifle my drawers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s always tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’ll you settle for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath. “More time to screw it out of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted, his head rocking back against the couch to show a long, muscled neck already shaded with new beard. “What makes you think I’m interested?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised one eyebrow and cast a damning look at his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just chuckled. “That’s nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Prove it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, his footsteps creaking across the wood floors, closer and closer. Even though she had invited the situation—well, forced it—she still felt as if her back was always against a door with him, that there was nowhere left to run as soon as his eyes found her. She pressed her hands against the wood, willing the blood out of her cheeks, the slight hitch out of her breath. He was angry with her, but he was amused, too. She had to hope the amusement would win out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarco’s expression was sharp and dark and hungry, and she fought the urge to look away, to look down, to cower in any way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Woman, do you know what you’re getting into?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a big girl. I always know what I’m getting into.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne finger, curled under her chin, made her tilt her head back to look up at him. Her lips parted, waiting for him to crash into her, to run his hands down her body with the frenzy she felt inside every time they traded barbs. Instead, he spun her around to face the door and pressed close against her back, hotter than the sun and breathing warmly over her neck. One after the other, he took her hands, pinning them against the door over her head. Her heart sped up, pounding against the door loudly enough that she was sure he could hear it, and with animal grace, she arched her back, feeling the hardness of him even through her bustle and the layers of skirts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips brushed her ear, running down her hairline to the high collar of her dress. She’d never hated fashion so much, never resented the way people in Sangland were forced to cover so much skin just to stay alive. As his mouth skimmed down the curve of her neck, she could feel the heat of his breath through the fabric, and when his teeth found her shoulder, she let out a small moan. One hand still pinned both of hers to the wood, his other hand tight on her hip, moving around to the front, to the sensitive crease just under the hipbone. Through layers of skirts, his hand steadily followed the line of her corset to where it came to a point, right at the crux of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t move your hands,” he whispered in her ear. “Or I stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released them, and they stayed pinned to the wood, flat, one on top of the other. His right hand traveled with careful, cruel slowness, down her wrist, past the sensitive furrow of her elbow, down her shoulder, still wet with the marks of his teeth. All the while, his left hand rubbed through her skirts, back and forth, hard enough that she could feel it but softly enough that it provided no relief. Over the curve of her ribs, the valley of her corset, the swell of her hip, his right hand traveled with leisurely abandon, never pausing, even when she strained for his touch. When his left hand left off its work, she groaned. But she swallowed the sound when she felt him move back and downward, palms gripping her hips as he knelt behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost turned around, but he had burned it into her: don’t move. His hands caressed her ass reverently through the bustle and skirts before running down the outsides of her legs, past her knees, all the way down to the tops of her boots, just above her ankles. Damn. If she’d known he’d get this close, she would have worn the elegant boots with the sharp heels, the ones that laced up to her thighs. His fingers were feather-light as he moved them to the insides of her legs and trailed them upward, skimming over her fashionably ripped stockings. When he found the insides of her knees, they nearly buckled. And as he reached the softness of her thighs, he stood back up, dragging her skirts up with him and exposing her legs to the chill air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeeth clenched, she closed her eyes and set her forehead against the cool wood, just under her wrists. She felt with exquisite slowness and anticipation the moment when his hands changed courses under her layers of skirts and petticoats, the left one continuing up the tender inside of her thigh while the right one spread wide and caressed her ass briefly, gently, before curving around to her front, just under the edge of her corset. At the exact same moment, his fingers found the crux of her from either side, and she gasped and whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne finger slid up and curled inside her with expert precision, and she spread her legs wider to accommodate him, fighting her every instinct to use her hands, her mouth, anything to touch him. But: don’t move. Or he would stop. So her own fingers curled against the wood in imitation of his fingers inside her, her nails raw against the gloves. Marco’s body pressed hard against her as he worked her with both hands, and she wanted nothing more than for him to slide up and enter her with the same damnable slowness. As his finger rubbed up and down, barely dipping in and out, his teeth caught the lobe of her ear, gentle but unyielding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to let go. You want to drop your hands. You want to turn around and feel my tongue in your mouth, moving in time with my finger. You want to press against me, feel your nipples rubbing against the corset, against my chest. But you can’t. You can’t move.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-damsel-and-the-daggerman-blud-3/page-10.html","bookId":1603,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:55:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:55:12 PM"}
