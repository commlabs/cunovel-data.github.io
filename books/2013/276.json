Hood help us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrders were given, passed down the ragged row of supine soldiers. Dawn was just tingeing the air when Gesler, Bottle at his side and trailed by Corabb Bhilan Thenu’alas, led his now oversized squad onto the cart path. Scuffing the ground, dragging furrows here and there-not too obvious, just enough-as they made their way towards the modest farmhouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler and Cuttle watched them for a time, until they were well enough away from the place they’d decided was best for the trap. Shrubs running close to the cart path, narrowing lines of sight for that span. Beyond the bushes, two middle-aged trees on the left and one old ancient on the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour cussers for this. Two close together, then one, and then the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuttle, his face sheathed in sweat from the arrow-head lodged in his shoulder, was strangely lacking in commentary as Fiddler directed the sapper to pace the track from this side of the narrowing to twenty strides beyond it, and set sticks in the ground when Fiddler so commanded. Once this was done, Cuttle’s task was to dig holes in the packed earth where the sticks had been. Shallow holes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sapper who trusted to Oponn’s pull might have left it at that, praying to the fickle Twins that a horse hoof would descend on at least one of the planted cussers. But that was not how the drum worked. All that was needed was vibration. If the cussers were thinned on one side just right; if the sharp stone against that spot was sharp enough and angled just right so that the reverberation would drive its tip into the clay shell. The real challenge, Fiddler and Hedge had discovered, was down to shaving the cusser-right down to eggshell thin-without breaking it and so painting leaves in the highest trees with one’s own blood and guts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Cuttle finished the first scooped-out hole, Fiddler headed towards it with a cusser cradled in his hands. Setting it down carefully on the ground, he drew a knife and made some minute adjustments to the hole. Then he turned his attention to the cusser. This one, furthest down along the track, would be the one to go first. Which would trigger the others, in the midst of the troop, with two at the back end in case die column was especially long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set the cusser into the hole, then settled down onto his stomach and brought his knife close to one side of the mine. And began scraping clay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun had risen, and although the air was still cool sweat streamed down Fiddler’s face as he shaved away minute slivers of the fine-grained clay. He wished for direct sunlight on the cusser, the side he was working on, s.o he could work until he saw that faint glow reaching through to the bright yellow incendiary powder with its shards of iron. But no such luck. All remained in shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, one last scrape, then he carefully edged the blade away. Found the sharp stone and set it down beside the thinned shell. Point against the clay, he made a half-twist-breath held, eyes squeezed shut-then slowly withdrew his hand. Opened his eyes. Studied his handiwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few more deep breaths to settle his nerves, then he began filling the hole with small handfuls of earth. Then scattered detritus over the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler belly-crawled away, until he reached the edge of the track where he’d left the other cussers. Glancing up the path, he saw Cuttle waiting at the far end, arms wrapped about his torso, looking like he’d just pissed himself. Aye, he knows why we’re a dying breed-Taking the second cusser, Fiddler made his way-lightly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– to the second hole. Not as thin this time, but thin enough. Each one in turn slightly easier, which made shaving each of them increasingly dangerous-the risk of getting careless, sloppy, just in that wash of relief at having managed the first one… well, he knew all the dangers in all this, didn’t he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeeth gritted, he arrived at the second hole in the path, slowly sank to his knees. Set the cusser down, and reached for his knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuttle was as close to pissing himself as he had ever been. Not at the prospect of dying-he was fine enough with that and had been ever since finding himself in the Fourteenth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– but at what he was witnessing here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last great Malazan sapper. No-one else came close. Imagine, shaving cusser shells. With a knife. Eggshell thin. Cuttle had watched, unable to make out much from this distance, as Fiddler had set to work on the first one, the deadliest one of all. And he had prayed, to every god he could think of, to gods he didn’t even know the names of, to spirits and ghosts and every sapper living or dead, each name-a benediction to one man’s brilliance. Praying that the one man he truly worshipped wouldn’t… wouldn’t what? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-276.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
