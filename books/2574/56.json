He had maybe forty-five minutes before he had to crank up for dinner in earnest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name of this place was the Red Arrow Lodge, and it was buried in the western Maine mountains, thirty miles from the town of Rangely. It was a good gig, Hallorann thought. The trade wasn\u0027t too heavy, it tipped well, and so far there hadn\u0027t been a single meal sent back. Not bad at all, considering the season was nearly half over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threaded his way between the outdoor bar and the swimming pool (although why anyone would want to use the pool with the lake so handy he would never know), crossed a greensward where a party of four was playing croquet and laughing, and crested a mild ridge. Pines took over here, and the wind soughed pleasantly in them, carrying the aroma of fir and sweet resin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side, a number of cabins with views of the lake were placed discreetly among the trees. The last one was the nicest, and Hallorann had reserved it for a party of two back in April when he had gotten this gig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman was sitting on the porch in a rocking chair, a book in her hands. Hallorann was struck again by the change in her. Part of it was the stiff, almost formal way she sat, in spite of her informal surroundings-that was the back brace, of course. She\u0027d had a shattered vertebra as well as three broken ribs and some internal injuries. The back was the slowest healing, and she was still in the brace... hence the formal posture. But the change was more than that. She looked older, and some of the laughter had gone out of her face. Now, as she sat reading her book, Hallorann saw a grave sort of beauty there that had been missing on the day he had first met her, some nine months ago. Then she had still been mostly girl. Now she was a woman, a human being who had been dragged around to the dark side of the moon and had come back able to put the pieces back together. But those pieces, Hallorann thought, they never fit just the same way again. Never in this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard his step and looked up, closing her book. \"Dick! Hi!\" She started to rise, and a little grimace of pain crossed her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"hope, don\u0027t get up,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t stand on no ceremony unless it\u0027s white tie and tails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled as he came up the steps and sat down next to her on the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is it going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty fair,\" he admitted. \"You try the shrimp creole tonight. You gonna like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Danny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right down there.\" She pointed, and Hallorann saw a small figure sitting at the end of the dock. He was wearing jeans rolled up to the knee and a redstriped shirt. Further out on the calm water, a bobber floated. Every now and then Danny would reel it in, examine the sinker and hook below it, and then toss it out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gettin brown,\" Hallorann said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Very brown.\" She looked at him fondly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took out a cigarette, tamped it, lit it. The smoke raftered away lazily in the sunny afternoon. \"What about those dreams he\u0027s been havin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better,\" Wendy said. \"Only one this week. It used to be every night, sometimes two and three times. The explosions. The hedges. And most of all... you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. He\u0027s going to be okay, Wendy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him. \"Will he? I wonder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann nodded. \"You and him, you\u0027re coming back. Different, maybe, but okay. You ain\u0027t what you were, you two, but that isn\u0027t necessarily bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were silent for a while, Wendy moving the rocking chair back and forth a little, Hallorann with his feet up on the porch rail, smoking. A little breeze came up, pushing its secret way through the pines but barely ruffling Wendy\u0027s hair. She had cut it short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve decided to take Al-Mr. Shockley-up on his offer,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann nodded. \"It sounds like a good job. Something you could get interested in. When do you start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right after Labor Day. When Danny and I leave here, we\u0027ll be going right on to Maryland to look for a place. It was really the Chamber of Commerce brochure that convinced me, you know. It looks like a nice town to raise a kid in. And I\u0027d like to be working again before we dig too deeply into the insurance money Jack left. There\u0027s still over forty thousand dollars. Enough to send Danny to college with enough left over to get him a start, if it\u0027s invested right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann nodded. \"Your mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him and smiled wanly. \"I think Maryland is far enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t forget old friends, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny wouldn\u0027t let me. Go on down and see him, he\u0027s been waiting all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, so have L\" He stood up and hitched his cook\u0027s whites at the hips. \"The two of you are going to be okay,\" he repeated. \"Can\u0027t you feel it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him and this time her smile was warmer. \"Yes,\" she said. She took his hand and kissed it. \"Sometimes I think I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The shrimp creole,\" he said, moving to the steps. \"Don\u0027t forget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked down the sloping, graveled path that led to the dock and then out along the weather-beaten boards to the end, where Danny sat with his feet in the clear water. Beyond, the lake widened out, mirroring the pines along its verge. The terrain was mountainous around here, but the mountains were old, rounded and humbled by time. Hallorann liked them just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Catchin much?\" Hallorann said, sitting down next to him. He took off one shoe, then the other. With a sigh, he let his hot feet down into the cool water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I had a nibble a little while ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take a boat out tomorrow morning. Got to get out in the middle if you want to catch an eatin fish, my boy. Out yonder is where the big ones lay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How big?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann shrugged. \"Oh... sharks, marlin, whales, that sort of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There aren\u0027t any whales!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No blue whales, no. Of course not. These ones here run to no more than eighty feet. Pink whales.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could they get here from the ocean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann put a hand on the boy\u0027s reddish-gold hair and rumpled it. \"They swim upstream, my boy. That\u0027s how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were silent for a time, looking out over the stillness of the lake, Hallorann just thinking. When he looked back at Danny, he saw that his eyes had filled with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting an arm around him, he said, \"What\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Danny whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re missin your dad, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny nodded. \"You always know.\" One of the tears spilled from the corner of his right eye and trickled slowly down his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t have any secrets,\" Hallorann agreed. \"That\u0027s just how it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at his pole, Danny said: \"Sometimes I wish it had been me. It was my fault. All my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann said, \"You don\u0027t like to talk about it around your mom, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She wants to forget it ever happened. So do I, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you need to cry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy tried to answer, but the words were swallowed in a sob. He leaned his head against Hallorann\u0027s shoulder and wept, the tears now flooding down his face. Hallorann held him and said nothing. The boy would have to shed his tears again and again, he knew, and it was Danny\u0027s luck that he was still young enough to be able to do that. The tears that heal are also the tears that scald and scourge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had quieted a little, Hallorann said, \"You\u0027re gonna get over this. You don\u0027t think you are right now, but you will. You got the shi-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I didn\u0027t!\" Danny choked, his voice still thick with tears. \"I wish I didn\u0027t have it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you do,\" Hallorann said quietly. \"For better or worse. You didn\u0027t get no say, little boy. But the worst is over. You can use it to talk to me when things get rough. And if they get too rough, you just call me and I\u0027ll come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if I\u0027m down in Maryland?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were quiet, watching Danny\u0027s bobber drift around thirty feet out from the end of the dock. Then Danny said, almost too low to be heard, \"You\u0027ll be my friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as you want me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy held him tight and Hallorann hugged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny? You listen to me. I\u0027m going to talk to you about it this once and never again this same way. There\u0027s some things no six-year-old boy in the world should have to be told, but the way things should be and the way things are hardly ever get together. The world\u0027s a hard place, Danny. It don\u0027t care. It don\u0027t hate you and me, but it don\u0027t love us, either. Terrible things happen in the world, and they\u0027re things no one can explain. Good people die in bad, painful ways and leave the folks that love them all alone. Sometimes it seems like it\u0027s only the bad people who stay healthy and prosper. The world don\u0027t love you, but your momma does and so do I. You\u0027re a good boy. You grieve for your daddy, and when you feel you have to cry over what happened to him, you go into a closet or under your covers and cry until it\u0027s all out of you again. That\u0027s what a good son has to do. But see that you get on. That\u0027s your job in this hard world, to keep your love alive and see that you get on, no matter what. Pull your act together and just go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Danny whispered. \"I\u0027ll come see you again next summer if you want... if you don\u0027t mind. Next summer I\u0027m going to be seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll be sixty-two. And I\u0027m gonna hug your brains out your ears. But let\u0027s finish one summer before we get on to the next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" He looked at Hallorann. \"Dick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t die for a long time, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure not studyin on it. Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir. I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got a bite, sonny.\" He pointed. The red and white bobber had ducked under. It came up again glistening, and then went under again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Danny gulped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWendy had come down and now joined them, standing in back of Danny. \"What is it?\" she asked. \"Pickerel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am,\" Hallorann said, \"I believe that\u0027s a pink whale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tip of the fishing rod bent. Danny pulled it back and a long fish, rainbow-colored, flashed up in a sunny, winking parabola, and disappeared again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny reeled frantically, gulping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me, Dick! I got him! I got him! Help me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallorann laughed. \"You\u0027re doin fine all by yourself, little man. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a pink whale or a trout, but it\u0027ll do. It\u0027ll do just fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put an arm around Danny\u0027s shoulders and the boy reeled the fish in, little by little. Wendy sat down on Danny\u0027s other side and the three of them sat on the end of the dock in the afternoon sun. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shining-the-shining-1/page-56.html","bookId":2574,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:45 PM"}
