I had been warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot these eyes. My eyes. Mine. This was me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe language I had found myself using was odd, but it made sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoppy, boxy, blind, and linear. Impossibly crippled in comparision to many I\u0027d used, yet still it managed to find fluidity and expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes beauty. My language now. My native tounge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the truest instinct of my kind, I\u0027d bound myself securely into the body\u0027s center of thought, twined myself inescapably into its every breath and reflex until it was no longer a seperate entity. It was me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the body, mybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the sedation wearing off and lucidity taking its place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI braced myself for the onslaught of the first memory, which would really be the last memory �C the last moments this body had experienced, the memory of the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been warned thorougly of what would happen now. These human emotions would be stronger, more vital than the feelings of any other species I had been. I tried to prepare myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory came. And, as I\u0027d been warned, it was not something that could ever be prepared for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seared with sharp color and ringing sound. Cold on her skin, pain gripping her limbs, burning them. The taste was fiercely metallic in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was the new sense, the fifth sense I\u0027d never had, that took the particles from the air and transformed them into strange messages and pleasaures and warnings in her brain �C scents. They were distracting, confusing to me, but not to her memory. The memory had no time for the novelties of smell. The memory was only fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear locked her in a vise, goading the blunt, clumsy limbd forward but hampering them at the same time. To flee, to run �C it was all she could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory that was not mine was so frighteningly strong and clear that it sliced through my control �C overwhelmed the detachment, the knowledge that this was just a memory and not me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSucked into the hell that was the last minute of her life, I was she, and we were running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s so dark. I can\u0027t see. I can\u0027t see the floor. I can\u0027t see my hands streched out in front of me. I run blind and try to hear the pursuit I can feel behind me, but the pulse is so loud behind my ears it drowns everything else out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s cold. It shouldn\u0027t matter now, but it hurts. I\u0027m so cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air in her nose was uncomfortable. Bad. A bad smell. For one second, that discomfort pulled me free of the memory. But it was only a second, and then I was dragged in again, and my eyes filled with horrified tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m lost, we\u0027re lost. It\u0027s over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re right behind me now, loud and close. There are so many footsteps! I am alone. I\u0027ve failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seekers are calling. The sound of their voices twists my stomach. I\u0027m going to be sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine, it\u0027s fine,\" one lies, trying to calm me, to slow me. Her voice is disturbed by the effort of her breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful!\" another shouts in warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t hurt yourself,\" one of them pleads. A deep voice, full of concern. Concern!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat shot trough my veins, and a violent hatred nearly choked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had never felt such an emotion as this in all my lives. For another second, my revulision pulled me away from the memory. A high, shrill keening pierced my ears and pulsed in my head. The sound scraped through my airways. There was a weak pain in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreaming, my body explained. You\u0027re screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze in shock, and the sound broke off abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not a memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body �C she was thinking! Speakingto me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the memory was stronger, in that moment, than my astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" they cry. \"There is danger ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe danger is behind! I scream back in my mind. But I see what they mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA feeble stream of light, coming from who knows where, shines on the end of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not the flat wall or the locked door, the dead end I feared and expected. It is a black hole. An elevator shaft. Abandoned, empty, and condemned, like this building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce a hiding place, now a tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA surge of relief floods through me as I raced forward. There is a way. No way to survive, but perhaps a way to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no, no! This thought was all mine, and I fought to pull myself away from her, but we wer together. And we sprinted from the edge of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please!\" The shouts are more desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like laughing when I know that I am fast enough. I imagine their hands clutching for me just inches behind my back. But I am as fast as I need to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t even pause at the end of the floor. The hole rises up to meet me midstride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emptiness swallows me. My legs flail, useless. My hands grip the air, claw through it, searching for anything solid. Cold blows past me like tornado winds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the thud before I feel it... The air is gone...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then pain is everywhere... Pain is everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake it stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot high enough, I whisper to myself through the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen will the pain end? When...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blackness swallowed up the agony, and I was weak with gratitude that the memory had come to this most final of conclusions. The blackness took all, and I was free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a breath to steady myself, as was this body\u0027s habit. My body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then the color rushed back, the memory reared up and engulfed me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! I panicked, fearing the cold and the pain and the very fear itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this was not the same memory. This was a memory within a memory �C a final memory, like a last gasp of air �C yet, somehow, even stronger than the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blackness took all but this: a face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face was as alien to me as the faceless serpentine tentacles of my last host body would be to this new body. I\u0027d seen this kind of face in the images I had been given to prepare for this world. It was hard to tell them apart, to see the tiny variations in color and shape that was the only markers of the individual. So much the same, all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoses centered in the middle of the sphere, eyes above and mouths below, ears around the sides. A collection of senses, all but touch, concentrated in one place. Skin over bones, hair growing on the crown and in strange furry lines above the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome had more fur lower down on the jaw: those were always males. The colors ranged through the brown scale from pale cream to a deep almost-black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from that, how to know one from the other?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis face I would of known among millions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis face was a hard rectangle, the shape of the bones strong under the skin. In color it was light golden brown. The hair was just a few shades darker than the skin, except where flaxen streaks lightened it, and it covered only the head and the odd fur stripes above the eyes. The circular irises in the white eyeballs were darker than the hair but, like the hair, flecked with light. There were small lines around the eyes, and her memories told me the lines was from smiling and squinting into sunlight. I knew nothing of what passed for beauty among these strangers, and yet I knew that this face was beautiful. I wanted to keep looking at it. As soon as I realized this, it disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine, spoke the alien thought that should not have existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I was frozen, stunned. There should have been no one here but me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet this thought was so strong and so aware!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpossible. How was she still here? This was me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine, I rebuked her, the power and authority that belonged to me alone flowing through the word. Everything is mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why am I talking back to her? I wondered as the voices interuppted my thoughts. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-2.html","bookId":2029,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM"}
