It played there seven weeks and was the top grosser in the history of the theater. In England, it was the biggest grosser after Gone With the Wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reviews delighted me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg you, please don\u0027t miss The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the best comedies to hit this town in more than a year . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A blessed concoction of fun, whimsy and heart . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A first-rate comedy. You\u0027ll laugh out loud . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sidney Sheldon has created the most agreeable film fare . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cast was praised, the director was praised. The reviews were unanimous. The movie won the Box Office Blue Ribbon Award and I was nominated for an Oscar. I knew that nothing could stop me now. Careers in Hollywood were like elevators constantly going up and down. The trick was not to leave the elevator when it was down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator for me was definitely up. I was on top of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had written an original treatment about a troubled marriage, called Orchids for Virginia. Eddie Dmytryk, a director at RKO, liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to ask the studio to buy it for me. I want you to do the screenplay. I\u0027ll get you thirty-five thousand dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" I was more than pleased because I needed the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne week later, Dore Schary was made the executive producer in charge of production at RKO. He called me into his office and I knew he wanted to congratulate me on Orchids for Virginia. I was going to ask him how soon I could start the screenplay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eddie Dmytryk wants to direct your story,\" Dore said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"Yes. That\u0027s terrific.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to let the studio buy it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a moment for it to sink in. \"What? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to make a picture about a man who\u0027s unfaithful to his wife and plans to murder her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Dore - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it. We\u0027re giving the story back to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was devastated. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have to find another project to work on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea that Dore\u0027s rejection of my script was going to change my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy agent, Sammy Weisbord, called. \"I just made a deal for you at MGM with a two-week guarantee. They want you to write Pride and Prejudice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had not read the book in years. All I remembered about it was that it was a Jane Austen, pre-Victorian, English society classic about five daughters looking for husbands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of working at MGM was exciting. It was the Tiffany of all Hollywood studios. The roster of their movies included classics like Gone With the Wind, Meet Me in St. Louis, The Wizard of Oz, The Philadelphia Story, The Great Ziegfeld, and dozens of other great films.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was twenty-nine years old when I walked onto the MGM lot for the first time. I was awed. MGM was a city in itself. It had its own supply of electricity, food, and water. Every conceivable need was met on site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe studio, like the other six major studios, produced an average of one film a week. There were 150 writers under contract at MGM, and they included famous novelists and playwrights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my first day there, I had lunch at the huge commissary. I was invited to sit at the writers\u0027 table, where a dozen writers had gathered. They were a friendly group and there was a lot of advice offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry if some of your scripts aren\u0027t made. The rule of thumb here is if you get a script made every three years, you\u0027re okay . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try to get on a picture with Arthur Freed. He\u0027s the big producer here . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When your contract is about to run out, make sure you get on an assignment so they\u0027ll pick you up . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not explain that my contract consisted of a two-week guarantee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been given a small office and a secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to do Pride and Prejudice,\" I told her. \"Can you get a copy of the book for me? I\u0027d like to read it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dialed a studio number and said, \"Mr. Sheldon would like a copy of Pride and Prejudice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book was delivered in thirty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was my introduction to the studio system. Every studio had a library, a research department, a casting department, a set department, a cinematography department, and a business department. It was almost biblical. All you had to do was ask and it was given to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, Sammy Weisbord came into my office. \"How are you doing?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just getting started,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arthur Freed would like to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him tell you. He\u0027s waiting for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had heard stories about Arthur Freed. He had started as an insurance salesman and had become a successful songwriter, with songs such as \"The Broadway Melody,\" \"Good Morning,\" \"On a Sunday Afternoon,\" and \"Singin\u0027 in the Rain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had gotten friendly with Louis B. Mayer, who made him a producer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was said of Freed that he always had to be first to know things. One of the writers told me the following story:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA friend invited Freed to the opening of a play. \"I\u0027ve seen it,\" Freed said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother time someone asked him if he\u0027d like to go to the premiere of a movie. \"I\u0027ve seen it,\" Freed said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA friend asked him if he\u0027d like to go to a baseball game that night. \"I\u0027ve seen it,\" Freed said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSammy and I walked down the hall and took the elevator up to the third floor, where Arthur Freed\u0027s office was. Freed sat behind his desk in a huge office. He was a stocky man in his fifties, with thin gray hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Sheldon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a problem. I have a script here that I can\u0027t seem to cast. Everyone\u0027s turning it down. It\u0027s a musical and it\u0027s well written, but the plot is wrong. It\u0027s too heavy. It needs a light touch. Do you think you can help it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m working on Pride and Prejudice, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore,\" Freed said. \"You\u0027re working on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the name of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easter Parade. You\u0027ll be working with Irving Berlin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a magical moment. It was my third day at MGM and I was going to work with the legendary Irving Berlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to do it,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judy Garland and Gene Kelly are going to star in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to look nonchalant. \"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to get it into production as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look over the screenplay and see what you think you can do with it. You\u0027ll have a meeting here tomorrow with Irving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI floated out of Freed\u0027s office. Weisbord watched me and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come through with this,\" he said, \"and you\u0027re fixed for life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glowing. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator was definitely up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original screenplay of Easter Parade had been written by the husband and wife team of Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. They were brilliant writers who later wrote the smash Broadway play The Diary of Anne Frank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Freed was right. What the screenplay needed was humor and a light touch. The story the Hacketts had written was too serious for a musical. I sat down to create a new story line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, I was summoned to Arthur Freed\u0027s office. With him was a short man with a cherubic face and bright, inquisitive eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Irving Berlin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the flesh. The genius who had written \"Alexander\u0027s Ragtime Band,\" \"God Bless America,\" \"There\u0027s No Business Like Show Business,\" \"Puttin\u0027 on the Ritz,\" and \"Top Hat.\" Someone once asked Jerome Kern what he thought Irving Berlin\u0027s place would be in American music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKern said simply, \"Irving Berlin is American music.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Sidney Sheldon,\" I said, pretending not to be completely awestruck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Berlin held out his hand. \"I\u0027m happy to meet you. I understand we\u0027re going to work together.\" He spoke in a high-pitched voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" I did not mention my New York experience where I had almost replaced him as the top songwriter in America because we were going to work together, and I did not want to make him nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we started to work on Easter Parade, Irving Berlin was sixty years old, with the enthusiasm of a teenager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been born Israel Baline in Russia and had come to the United States when he was five. He started his career as a singing waiter at the Chinatown Cafe in New York. He had never learned to play the piano on a regular piano. He used only the black keys, and he had an instrument that changed keys at the push of a lever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrving Berlin had questions and comments as I talked about the possible directions the screenplay could go, but oddly enough, Arthur Freed seemed to take no interest in what we were doing. He was completely silent. It was not until later that I found out why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Mr. Berlin, I want to tell you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped me. \"Irving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. I want to tell you how excited I am to be working with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"We\u0027re going to have a good time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writing was going well. I remembered what Sam Weisbord had said. Come through with this, and you\u0027re fixed for life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral times a week, while I was writing the script, Irving Berlin would bounce into my office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what you think of this,\" he would say enthusiastically. And in that shrill voice of his, he would begin singing a song he had just written. The only problem was that he could not carry a tune, and I had no idea what the song sounded like. He could not play the piano, and he could not sing. All he had was his genius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had lunch every day at the writers\u0027 table in the commissary and one of the writers would usually invite me to visit his set after lunch. The pictures shooting on the lot were The Best Years of Our Lives, with Myrna Loy and Fredric March; Saratoga Trunk, with Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman; and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, with Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went on the soundstages and watched the stars going through their scenes just a few feet away from me. These were the stars I had watched from the back aisle of the RKO Jefferson Theatre, when I was an usher. Now, every week I saw the biggest stars in Hollywood making their movies, and it was a wondrous time for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was finishing the script of Easter Parade when Sammy Weisbord came into my office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have good news, Sidney. I got a call from MGM. They want to negotiate a long-term contract with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful,\" I exclaimed. That was the dream of every Hollywood writer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t worked out all the details yet. There are still a lot of things we\u0027re discussing.\" He smiled. \"But don\u0027t worry. It will happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was elated. I turned in my screenplay to Arthur Freed and waited to hear his reaction. Silence. He hates it, I decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother day went by. I reread the script. The New York critic is right about my lack of talent. The dialogue is so wooden it could splinter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder Arthur Freed doesn\u0027t want to talk to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne week after I had given the script to Arthur Freed, his secretary finally called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Freed would like you to be in his office tomorrow morning at ten o\u0027clock to meet Judy Garland and Gene Kelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a sudden sense of panic. I simply could not meet them. They would find out what a fraud I was, just as Arthur Freed had. They would all hate my screenplay. I knew I could not go to that meeting. It was deja vu. Max Rich saying, Meet me at my office, ten o\u0027clock tomorrow morning, and we\u0027ll go to work, and Irving Reis saying, \"Camera . . . Action,\" and my running away from the screen test with Cary Grant. I knew I had to run away again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got little sleep that night. I had vivid dreams of Arthur Freed screaming at me about the terrible script I had written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, I made a decision. I would go to the meeting, but I would not say anything. I would listen to their derogatory criticisms and when they were through, I would quit. I spent the hour prior to the meeting packing up my office, getting ready to leave the studio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt ten o\u0027clock, I walked into Arthur Freed\u0027s office. Freed was seated behind his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Interesting screenplay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever that meant. Was that a euphemism for \"You\u0027re fired\"? Why did he not come out and say what he really thought?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Judy Garland walked in and my spirits lifted. It was like seeing an old friend. She was Betsy Booth, the girlfriend of Mickey Rooney\u0027s character in the Andy Hardy series. She was Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. She was Esther Smith in Meet Me in St. Louis. When I was an usher, I had seen her movies over and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudy Garland, nee Frances Gumm, had been with MGM since she was in her teens. The Wizard of Oz had made her a star when she was just fifteen. She had become so popular that the studio put her in movie after movie, giving her no chance to rest. She made nineteen movies in nine years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo keep up her energy, she began taking barbiturates and became addicted, taking uppers in the daytime and sleeping pills at night. She had tried to commit suicide and, unbeknownst to me, had just come from the Menninger Clinic when I met her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer first words were, \"Hello, Sidney. I loved your screenplay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, I was stunned. Then I began to grin like an idiot. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was good, wasn\u0027t it?\" Arthur Freed said. It was the first comment I had heard him make about my screenplay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and Gene Kelly came in. By now I began to relax. Gene Kelly was another familiar face. I had seen him in Thousands Cheer, Cover Girl, and Anchors Aweigh. He felt like an old friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe greeted Judy and Arthur, and then turned to me. \"Author author,\" he said, \"you did a damn fine job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did, didn\u0027t he?\" Arthur Freed said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was filled with a sudden sense of euphoria. All that worrying for nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any suggestions you have - \" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just right for me,\" Judy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGene Kelly added, \"Me, too. It\u0027s perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur Freed smiled. \"It looks like it\u0027s going to be a short meeting. We\u0027re all set to go. We start shooting Monday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the meeting, I went back to my office and started unpacking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy secretary was watching, puzzled. \"May I ask what\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I changed my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Friday, Arthur Freed called me into his office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a problem,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped breathing. \"Something wrong with the script?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s Gene Kelly. He broke his ankle playing volleyball over the weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. \"So, we\u0027re going to postpone the picture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sent your script to Fred Astaire. He retired last year but if he likes your script, he\u0027ll do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Fred Astaire is forty-eight years old. Judy is twenty-five. The audience is going to be rooting for them not to get together. That will never work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, tolerantly, \"Let\u0027s see what Fred has to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred Astaire said yes. I met him in Arthur Freed\u0027s office the next day and he said, \"Thank you for a wonderful script. It\u0027s going to be exciting to make.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at him, my misgivings about the casting disappeared. He looked young and alert and energetic. He had the reputation of being a perfectionist. On a picture he did with Ginger Rogers, he kept rehearsing a new routine with her until her feet were bleeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on the soundstage on Monday, the first day of shooting Easter Parade. Fred Astaire was at the far end of the stage where they were setting up the first shot. I was at the other end of the stage, telling a story to Judy. In the middle of it, the assistant director hurried over. \"We\u0027re ready for you, Miss Garland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Judy said, \"finish the story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" I started talking faster because I knew how expensive it was to keep a shooting company waiting. I looked over at the other end of the stage where they were set up and waiting, and I said, \"Judy, I\u0027ll finish the story later. It\u0027s really not important - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she insisted. \"Finish it now.\" She seemed upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judy, don\u0027t you want to do this scene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated a moment, then blurted out, \"I have to kiss Mr. Astaire in this scene, and I\u0027ve never met him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone had just assumed that these two superstars knew each other. I felt then a deep sense of how vulnerable Judy Garland was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" I said. I took her hand and led her over to the other end of the stage where they were all impatient to get started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fred,\" I said, \"this is Judy Garland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"It certainly is. I\u0027m a big fan of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m a fan of yours.\" Judy smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChuck Walters, the director, said, \"Take your places.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEaster Parade began shooting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, I dropped in at the rehearsal hall, where Fred was working alone on a new dance number. Tapping and turning his way around the stage, he did not see me. I crept up on him and when he stopped for a moment, I tapped him on the shoulder. He turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said patiently, \"No, Fred. Like this.\" And I did a little bad soft shoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Very good. I used to dance that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot likely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly before shooting began, Arthur Freed had hired Jules Munshin, a New York actor, for comedy relief. I had written a small part for him as a maitre d\u0027. The day before Munshin was to shoot his scene, my disc slipped out again. I was at home, in bed, suffering in agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang. It was Jules Munshin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sidney, I have to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now. I\u0027ll be out of bed in three days and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I have to see you today. Right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain was so bad, I could hardly speak. \"Jules, this is not a good time. I really don\u0027t feel well. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your secretary gave me your address. I\u0027ll be there in fifteen minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another pain pill and gritted my teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later, Jules Munshin arrived at my bedside. \"You look great,\" he said, cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glaring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The studio brought me out from New York, and I have only one little scene that I could have phoned in. I need you to do something with that scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small problem. I was in such pain that I could barely remember his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shoot my scene tomorrow,\" he reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and thought about the scene I had written for him. In it, he was an arrogant maitre d\u0027 who prided himself on the way he mixed a salad, with the exaggerated gestures of a snobbish gourmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The scene is nothing,\" Munshin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly knew how to make it something. \"Jules, the answer is very simple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no salad. You\u0027re going to do it in pantomime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turned out to be one of the funniest scenes in the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEaster Parade won the Box Office Blue Ribbon Award and the WGA Screen Award for Best Written American Musical of 1948, an award I shared with Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEaster Parade also turned out to be one of the most successful musicals MGM ever made. It has played on television every Easter for the last fifty-seven years. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-other-side-of-me/page-17.html","bookId":2371,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM"}
