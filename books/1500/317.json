She gave Helen’s face a firm smooch, and then urged, “What about the other three?

She truly couldn’t understand why Persephone always acted like a little girl that just wouldn’t grow up. Damn it, only in front of her face would Persephone display a side completely different from her dragonrider general self.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen finally raised her head. She coldly interrupted Persephone’s daydream. “Multi-faceted attacks? You really know how to dream! That is a Combat Domain ability that only exists in theory. Even if there really is such a thing, it would only appear as an eleventh level ability. Forget about it being impossible for it to appear as a ninth level ability, even if it weakened to a tenth level ability, do you have the natural talent to develop a tenth level ability?!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHmm…\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;Alright, damn it, it seems like you really do have the potential for ten levels.

I’ll just fight a bit more and those evolutionary points will come. Push comes to shove, I’ll just form an expeditionary force and slaughter from the east coast all the way until I reach the western sea!” Persephone was smiling beautifully, but she couldn’t help but release a bit of cold killing intent.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I don’t have time to speak nonsense with you! There are three other abilities, all of them in the Mysterious Fields, respectively being incomplete foresight, mysterious summoning, and fortune. You should understand what each ability entails. There are four options, so you should make your decision!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOne of the optical screens divided into four sections, with each section containing one ability. It was now Persephone’s turn to be stupefied. She asked with a bit of disbelief, “How did all four of them end up being ninth level abilities?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Exactly, four ninth level abilities with three of them being rare abilities. It really is too much!” Helen was extremely speechless towards Persephone’s natural talents. In addition, from her understanding of Persephone, this woman whose face was so thick that it was practically an art would endlessly tute her own horn in self-satisfaction. What was the most annoying part of it all was that Persephone would only act like this in front of her. In front of others, she would always put on that perfect wise and virtuous look to deceive everyone from eight to eighty years old.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone gradually became serious. Choosing between four ninth level abilities was, in reality, quite the difficult task. Not only did she have to consider the power of the ability itself, she also had to consider its synergy with her current and future abilities to maximize her fighting strength. It wasn’t that she couldn’t produce any other ninth level abilities, but instead that after through Helen’s repeated analysis, she decided that these four abilities were most suitable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone really wanted to take all of them, but that was an impossible thing. Where was she supposed to get all those evolutionary points? Even if she truly had that many, instead of developing four ninth level abilities, it was more realistic to abandon some of these ninth level abilities and directly produce a tenth level ability.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What should I pick?” Persephone asked seriously.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I don’t know. You choose yourself, or you might as well do it like how you used to.” Helen already stood up from her position in front of the light screen. She stretched out her somewhat rigid body.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Heavens!

You have such powerful innate abilities in the Mysterious Fields, so how can your luck be bad?

She swept her eyes over the four choices, and then she pointed at one of them and said, “Then this one it is!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen walked over to take a look, and then she couldn’t help but stare blankly for a moment. “Fortune?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Exactly! Don’t you think I am rather fortunate? If I have this too, I will become unbeatable!” Persephone said while smiling.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen she saw Persephone’s naive and guiltless face, Helen sighed. While shaking her head, she said, “Even if you didn’t have this, you are still unbeatable.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThen, Helen began to break down the genetic mapping, as well as create the ability formulation. Meanwhile, the bored Persephone walked over to the test apparatus on the side and began to precisely measure her body’s evolutionary points. If she didn’t recall incorrectly, she should have over 270 evolutionary points. These evolutionary points should be enough to produce a ninth level ability. The abilities Helen produced were much more powerful than the standard prescriptions, so it would use up more evolutionary points as well, but it normally wouldn’t exceed 10% of a standard formulation. That was why in terms of quality to price ratio, Helen’s personally concocted ability formulation was completely top level.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone placed a drop of blood on the sensor. Several seconds later, her current number of evolutionary points appeared on the light screen: 261.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone cried out with shock. “Helen! Is there something wrong with your machine? How did I lose evolutionary points?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“My instruments are always at their optimum states.” When she was busy concocting compounds, Helen’s tone and temper wouldn’t be too great.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“How can that be?” Persephone carefully thought to herself. After the final battle in the northern front, she had carefully examined her own evolutionary points. Even though it wasn’t as precise as this instrument, with her abilities, the difference wouldn’t be over 3 evolutionary points. Why did she suddenly lose 10 evolutionary points?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone calmed herself down. She used her perception abilities to scan her own body, and sure enough what she felt now was different from that of when she was in the northern front, feeling that she had 262 evolutionary points. In these few days of time, how could there be such a huge difference between her self-inspection?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShe carefully thought for a long time, but she couldn’t find any reasoning to explain this. The only explanation possible was that she sensed incorrectly last time. Even though the chances of it happening is small, it couldn’t be considered completely impossible.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone sighed, feeling a bit disappointed inwardly. Her evolutionary points was originally supposed to be enough to produce a new ninth level ability, never expecting that her analysis back then was incorrect, causing her to be 10 points deficient.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e10 evolutionary points was a crucial number. The formulations Helen produced normally wouldn’t exceed 270, but it rarely fell below 265. This mean that she had to fight one or two more battles in the northern front before she could obtain a new ninth level ability.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, her face immediately became filled with radiance. Either way, a bit earlier or a bit later was the same. She didn’t lack potential but instead lacked evolutionary points.
