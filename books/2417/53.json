You were right all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big comfort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and threw the backpack in the shotgun window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" I said, \"it was twentyfive thousand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The amountâ€”I was going to give you twentyfive thousand dollars. I scammed seven hundred. You can blame me for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed my toe in the air. \"Reimbursed myself for these here boots. Paid my rent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey cost about the same amount.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison cracked a smile. \"I\u0027ve seen your apartment. The boots were a better deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she came up and put her arms around me. Her fingers traced my skin, remembering exactly where the sword tip scar was, circling around it. She kissed me long enough for Gary Hales to water the tree, the street, the front bumper on my VW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong enough for me to forget how to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she pushed lightly away, bumped my forehead with hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come down to Falfurrias sometime,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ll introduce me to your four brothers?\" I managed to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. She tweaked my ear with her fingers and it stung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Them you could handle, sweetie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the red Miata drove away I stood in the middle of Queen Anne Street until a family Land Rover drove up and tapped its horn. Excuse us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved to the front yard, looked at Gary Hales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That one\u0027s gone,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeuh,\" Gary agreed. Disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately I\u0027d paid my rent. That gave me thirty days to find either more money or more blondes. I figured the odds were about even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went inside to see about some cake. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-53.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
