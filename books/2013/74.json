For your copper-faces.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe war leader said nothing, and Redmask could see in the warrior’s expression that he would not risk losing the force of his words, when his commands were disobeyed-as they would be, a truth of which all who were present were now aware. Destiny awaited, then, in this solitary clash of wills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadralt licked his lips. ‘Redmask, when I have killed you, what then of these Kechra?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking no reply, Redmask dismounted, walking to halt six paces in front of Hadralt. He unlimbered the rygtha crescent axe and centred his grip on the hafted weapon. ‘Your father is gone. You must now let go of his hand and stand alone, Hadralt. The first and last time. You have failed as war leader. You led Awl warriors to battle, then led them in flight. You betrayed allies. And now, you hide here on the very edge of the wastelands, rather than meet the invading Letherii blade to blade, teeth to throat. You will now step aside, or die.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Step aside?’ Hadralt tilted his head, then managed a rictus smile. ‘That choice is not offered to an Awl warrior.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘True,’ Redmask said. ‘Only to elders who can no longer defend themselves, or to those too broken by wounds.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadralt bared his teeth. ‘I am neither.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nor are you an Awl warrior. Did your father step aside? No, I see that he did not. He looked into your soul, and knew you, Hadralt. And so, old as he was, he fought you. For his tribe. For his honour.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadralt unsheathed his hook-blades. He was trembling once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the copper-faces then spoke. ‘Capalah ate in the hut of his son. In a single night he sickened and died. In the morning, his face was the colour of blue lichen.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrenys’galah?’ Redmask’s eyes narrowed in the mask’s slits. ‘You poisoned your father, Hadralt? Rather than meet his blades? How is it you stand here at all?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Poison has no name,’ muttered the same copper-face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadralt said, ‘I am the reason the Awl still live! You will lead them to slaughter, Redmask! We are not yet ready to face the Letherii. I have been trading for weapons-yes, there are Letherii who believe our cause is just. We give up poor land, and receive fine iron weapons-and now you come, to undo all my plans!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see those weapons,’ Redmask said. ‘In the hands of many of your warriors. Have they been tested in battle? You are a fool, Hadralt, to believe you won that bargain. The traders you meet are in the employ of the Factor-he profits on both sides of this war-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A lie!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I was in Drene,’ Redmask said, ‘less than two weeks ago. I saw the wagons and their crates of cast-off weapons, the iron blades that will shatter at the first blow against a shield. Weapons break, are lost, yet this is what you accepted, this is what you surrendered land for-land home to the dust of our ancestors. Home to Awl spirits, land that has drunk Awl blood.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Letherii weapons-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Must be taken from the corpses of soldiers-those are the weapons worthy of the term, Hadralt. If you must use their way of fighting, then you must use weapons of a quality to match. Lest you invite your warriors to slaughter. And this,’ he added, ‘is clearly what you were not prepared to do. Thus, Hadralt, I am led to conclude that you knew the truth. If so, then the traders paid you in more than weapons. Did you share out the coin, War Leader? Do your kin even know of the hoard you hide in your hut?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask watched as the copper-faces slowly moved away from Hadralt. Recognizing the betrayal their leader had committed upon them, upon the Awl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You intended surrender,’ Redmask continued, ‘didn’t you? You were offered an estate in Drene, yes? And slaves and Indebted to do your bidding. You planned on selling off our people, our history-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We cannot win!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadralt’s last words. Three sword-blades erupted from his chest, thrust into his back by his own copper-faces. Eyes wide with shock, the firstborn son and slayer of Capalah, last worthy leader of the Ganetok, stared across at Redmask. Hook-blades fell from his hands, then he sagged forward, sliding from the swords with a ghastly sucking sound almost immediately replaced by the gush of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes blank now in death, the corpse of Hadralt then toppled face-first into the dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask returned the rygtha to its harness. ‘Seeds fall from the crown of the stalk. What is flawed there makes its every child weak. The curse of cowardice has ended this day. We are the Awl, and I am your war leader.’ He paused, looked round, then said, And so I shall lead you to war.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-74.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
