Are kids supposed to protect their dad? No! I\u0027m supposed to protect you! Wait until I\u0027m old and feeble, then you can protect me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Also, don’t just disappear next time. If you want to go do something, say something to me first!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes glittering, Bruiser nudged Bai Xiaochun with his head, then dropped down, rolled over onto his back, and stuck his tongue out. He looked very charming, causing the warm feelings inside of Bai Xiaochun to grow even stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching out, he sent some of his Heaven-Dao Gold Core aura into Bruiser, straightening out his qi passageways. Bruiser hummed contentedly, and even reached his head up and licked Bai Xiaochun’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter healing Bruiser’s internal injuries, Bai Xiaochun looked at the wounds on his body, then produced a large quantity of medicinal pills for him to consume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach and every one of those pills could be sold for quite a few spirit stones, but when it came to Bruiser, Bai Xiaochun wasn’t stingy at all. The main thing he was worried about was making sure that Bruiser’s injuries didn’t worsen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter consuming the medicinal pills, Bruiser bared his teeth in a fond smile. As of this moment, Bruiser and Bai Xiaochun looked very much like family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun went on to scold Bruiser a bit more, and Bruiser wagged his tail and continued to rub up against Bai Xiaochun. Eventually, Bai Xiaochun didn’t have the heart to reprimand him anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they went back into the immortal\u0027s cave, Bruiser’s wounds continued to fade away, and the breakthrough aura on him grew even stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun could tell that Bruiser was definitely on the verge of breaking through to Core Formation. Core Formation was of great significance to battle beasts. Although battle beasts’ Tribulations weren’t like cultivators’, they were still dangerous. Furthermore, Bruiser was a beast king, so his Tribulation would be different from that of ordinary battle beasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorried, Bai Xiaochun went to seek the counsel of Zheng Yuandong. After all, Bruiser was very important to the River-Defying Sect as a whole, and especially the Spirit Stream Division. Zheng Yuandong immediately issued a Dharmic decree, identifying the peak of Mount River Defiance as the location where Bruiser would attempt to step into Core Formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large number of spell formations were set up, and work went underway to gather the spiritual energy of heaven and earth in that location. In addition, a large number of Core Formation cultivators were called upon to stand as Dharma protectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Patriarch Li Zimo, at Bai Xiaochun’s request, ended his session of secluded meditation to also stand as Dharma protector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun paid visits to the other three divisions as well, and as a result, they all offered assistance. The Blood Stream Division provided several precious treasures designed for transcending tribulation, and the Pill Stream Division assigned over a thousand disciples to concoct pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the Profound Stream Division, they were the ones tasked with creating special spell formations on the mountain peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power of all four divisions had been called on for this special occasion of Core Formation. It was enough to make any ordinary disciple envious. Of course, some of that had to do with Bruiser being a beast king, but more of it was because of Bai Xiaochun’s status.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven days later, when Bruiser was completely healed, and the aura of an imminent breakthrough was at its peak, rumbling sounds echoed out from the summit of Mount River Defiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeaven and earth shook, and the clouds converged, along with intense, thunderous rumblings. Bruiser took his place on the altar at the mountain’s summit, throwing his head back and roaring into the heavens, a roar that seemed capable of piercing the clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cultivators of the River-Defying Sect were shaken, and quite a few people flew up to see what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bruiser’s reaching Core Formation!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beast king Core Formation is so impressive!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beast kings are rare enough, and Bruiser is like a beast king among beast kings! Of course this is going to be extraordinary!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the discussions raged, the battle beasts in the Spirit Stream Division began to howl in support of Bruiser. The Heavenhorn ink dragon appeared, looking up into the sky, and then over at Bruiser, nervousness and anticipation gleaming in its eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun stood next to Bruiser, eyes sparkling. Of course, he was standing as Bruiser\u0027s primary Dharma protector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the clouds converged together, and a black lightning bolt appeared, which immediately began to descend toward the altar on Mount River Defiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoaring, Bruiser launched into the air, refusing to draw help from the spell formations or the surrounding Core Formation Dharma protectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he closed in, he viciously head-butted the lightning bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeaven and earth trembled as the lightning bolt shattered into countless sparks which rained down in all directions. Bruiser howled in delight, turning to look proudly at Bai Xiaochun before looking back up into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to Bruiser’s smug behavior, Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat. After all, it almost seemed like something he would do. Inside, his anxiety was mounting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay focused!” he called out. “If things get out of hand, get back down here. Don’t worry, it won’t be a loss of face....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn almost the exact same instant that the words left his mouth, a second lightning bolt began to fall. Even as Bruiser bashed into it, destroying it, a third lightning bolt appeared, then a fourth and a fifth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach of the lightning bolts was larger than the one before it, and they descended toward Bruiser with incredible speed. Trembling, Bruiser roared and continued to face them head-on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sixth lightning bolt sent Bruiser tumbling back down to the ground, where he landed inside the spell formation. Just when Bai Xiaochun was about to hurry forward to help, Bruiser gobbled up some of the medicinal pills that had been placed nearby. Eyes blazing red, he threw his head back and let out an enraged roar, then shot back up into the air, rocketing up with incredible speed, a beam of light surrounded by shocking violet flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, astonishingly, he actually slammed into the Tribulation clouds up above!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun took a deep breath; Bruiser seemed even crazier than he himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Patriarch Li Zimo was surprised to see what was happening, and the Core Formation cultivators who flanked him in midair were also shocked by Bruiser’s valiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisciples from the other four divisions who were observing the event were crying out in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This... this is incredible!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heavens! Is Bruiser going to destroy the Tribulation clouds?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as their voices rose up, the clouds seethed as a seventh, eighth, and ninth lightning bolt began to build up power. Then, gasps rang out as Bruiser yet again slammed into the cloud layer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUUUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clouds collapsed, and the three bolts of Tribulation Lightning exploded, sending out a powerful shockwave that left all the onlookers astonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmidst the collapsing clouds, Bruiser rapidly grew in size until he was 600 meters long, a sea of violet flames surrounding his feet as he threw his head back and let loose a long cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his cry echoed out, he continued to grow larger, his body radiating intense energy of heaven and earth. It was as if he were experiencing a baptism of sorts, and as a result, an aura spread out from him the likes of which was the subject of ultimate respect. It was the aura of a beast king!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt grew stronger and more powerful until all hearts trembled in response. As for Bai Xiaochun, his excitement was continuing to mount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the beast king aura raged, and the energy of heaven and earth converged, a violet-colored Core could be seen forming above Bruiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt radiated scintillating light, sending out a medicinal aura that left everyone in the area feeling refreshed and energized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was getting even more nervous. Seven days earlier, he had consulted the ancient records, as well as Patriarch Li Zimo, and had come to find that battle beast Core Formation usually didn’t involve Tribulation Lightning. That only came with beast king Tribulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Tribulation Lightning was when heaven and earth formed the Core, which Bruiser would then consume. That was actually the most dangerous part of the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the beast king aura formed a natural core of heaven and earth, it could be used by other cultivators or beasts for numerous purposes. Whether it was for cultivators to concoct spirit medicines, or for other beasts for use as a second core, it was something intrinsically attractive to many. In fact, if another beast managed to wrest it away, they could refine their own blood and gain a chance to rise up to the level of a beast king!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as Bai Xiaochun looked on nervously, and the Violet Core was moments away from condensing completely, a cry echoed out that could shake heaven and earth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed capable of piercing metal, of stabbing directly into the heart and mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff in the distance, a flying snake could be seen, fully 3,000 meters long. It shot through the air toward Bruiser’s Violet Core, eyes radiating sinister light. Shockingly, this snake had an aura similar to Bruiser’s!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis flying snake was another beast king!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranslator:\u003c/strong\u003e Deathblade.\u003cstrong\u003e Chinese language consultant:\u003c/strong\u003e ASI a.k.a.
