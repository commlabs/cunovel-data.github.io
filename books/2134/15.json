{"id":94818,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u003cp\u003eI was sitting on my couch, freshly showered and in blissfully clean clothes, when there was banging on the front door, and I heard an aged voice hollering, \"Livvy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In here!\" I called out, too tired to even think of getting up to answer the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liv?\" Betty came into the living room and looked at me, her hand over her heart. \"I swear to god, if I survive this, I\u0027m going to kill you. I am too old for this, Livvy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made her way over to the couch and sat next to me, pulled me into a hug, then pinched my cheek, kinda hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what you get for scaring the hell out of me.\" She leaned back on the couch, hand over her heart. \"I need a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her eyes to me. \"Ginny Boyle told us that you were there when Peach got attacked, and then I called and called and called and all I got was voice mail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah, sorry,\" I said. \"I turned my phone into a bat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, I came here last night to check on you, and you weren\u0027t here.\" She picked up my cell phone, which was still charging on the coffee table where I\u0027d left it two nights ago. \"I left you a thousand messages. Where were you?\" Before I could answer, she said, \"Oh, god, Stacy!\" She flipped open her phone, hit a number for speed-dial and then said, \"Stacy, I\u0027ve got her. Yes, she\u0027s ... fine.\" She eyed me warily as she said it; I guessed I didn\u0027t look quite fine. \"Okay, come by in the morning, and you can yell at her then.\" She tucked her phone in her pocket and sat next to me, grabbing my hands in hers. \"Honey, you look awful. Do I smell bacon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Yeah. Um...\" I hesitated for a minute, wondering how to explain why Cain was in my kitchen cooking for me, but I was too tired to explain, so I just said, \"Cain\u0027s making eggs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty froze and her voice went low. \"Cain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"Davina tried to steal my magic last night. He saved my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty opened her mouth, then closed it, then looked at me, her face all confusion, but I had to give her credit - she didn\u0027t argue, and she didn\u0027t say I told you so. \"And now he\u0027s making you eggs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s in the wash,\" Tobias said, stepping into the living room. \"I set it to cold, like you said. Hey, Betty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down in the floral love seat across from the couch, and Betty raised a brow at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One man cooking for you, another doing your laundry.\" Betty smiled at me. \"How do I get your job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed a half-smile, and Tobias cleared his throat stiffly. Betty looked from me to him, then back to me. Her expression softened as she picked up on the not-too-subtle tension between me and Tobias; her response was to squeeze my hand gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now eat this slowly,\" Cain said, coming around the corner into the living room, a plate in his hand. \"Little bites. If you hurl, I\u0027m not cleaning it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCain paused for a moment when he saw Betty, then walked over to stand across the coffee table from me. Betty stiffened, making it clear she was not happy about Cain\u0027s presence in my house. Cain, either not noticing or not caring, handed me the plate and a fork and repeated himself, as though I was a third-grader. \"Little bites.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Betty ... this is Cain.\" I said, motioning toward Cain with my fork. \"He\u0027s a conjurer, a...\" I hesitated, choosing my words carefully, \"... friend of Holly\u0027s. Cain, this is Betty. She\u0027s my boss. Also, she makes magical pastries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCain gave a brief nod, and Betty shifted closer to me on the couch. I poked at the food on my plate and my stomach protested, so I turned to Betty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Peach doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They let her go from the hospital this morning,\" she said. \"She had a minor concussion, but other than a few bruises, she\u0027s okay. Nick\u0027s with her next door. Neither one of them can remember what happened.\" Betty looked at me pointedly. \"I\u0027m assuming you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and put the fork down. \"Millie. Walnuts. Only it wasn\u0027t just Millie. She was surfing Davina\u0027s power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll tell you about it later,\" Cain said, picking up the fork and putting it back in my hand. \"Right now, she needs to eat, and then she needs to rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty shot an annoyed look at Cain, and turned her attention back to me. \"So, I take it Tobias knows ... everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"He\u0027s Magical security. Holly sent him to watch over me, a year and a half ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty straightened in surprise and looked at Tobias. \"ASF or RIAS?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ASF,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allied Strategical Forces,\" Tobias said. \"Name of the firm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better than RIAS,\" Betty said. \"You can\u0027t trust those bastards. They get ahold of you, no one will ever hear from you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"RIAS?\" I asked. \"What\u0027s RIAS?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias looked at me. \"Regional Initiative Action Services.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I thought for a beat. \"So, Magicals are as fond of bullshit acronyms as everyone else, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty looked at me. \"We\u0027re Magical, but we\u0027re still human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Tobias is with the good group, the ... whatsit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ASF,\" Tobias said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty let out a huff of disgust. \"To say they\u0027re good is a bit of an overstatement. They\u0027re better than RIAS, but that\u0027s a pretty low bar.\" She looked at Tobias. \"No offense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, none taken.\" Tobias stood up and looked at Cain. \"I\u0027m gonna take watch out front.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCain nodded, and Tobias left without looking at me or Betty. I watched him go until the front door shut behind him, and it took a moment before I realized someone was saying my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Olivia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled myself out of my distraction and looked up at Cain, who motioned toward my plate. \"Eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" I took a few bites, chewing slowly and swallowing carefully, until the thought of taking another bite made my stomach turn in protest. I handed the plate back to Cain; it looked as though I\u0027d barely touched it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"I can\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay.\" He took the plate back, and Betty said, \"So, Cain, you were friends with Liv\u0027s sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was ice in her voice when she said his name, but I was too tired to defend him, not that he needed me to; I got the sense that if Cain was comfortable with anything, it was hostility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So...\" Betty put effort into covering her distrust with sympathy. \"Can you tell us what happened there? And what it all has to do with Liv?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment of assessment, Cain finally sat in the chair across from us and leaned forward, elbows resting on his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Davina\u0027s got one MO; come to town, pretend to be a friend, take what she wants, and step over the bodies on her way out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty reached out and took my hand, but kept her eyes on Cain. \"Well, you stopped her. She didn\u0027t kill Liv.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCain shook his head. \"Davina\u0027s no quitter. She\u0027s gonna keep coming at Liv until she gets what she wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So ... what are we gonna do?\" I asked, my voice sounding feeble even to my own ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCain looked at me and said, \"Right now? You\u0027re gonna sleep and heal up. I got a plan, but I need you strong to make it work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the plan?\" Betty asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCain picked up my picked-over plate of eggs, and stood up. \"We\u0027ll talk about it tomorrow.\" And then he walked back into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he was gone, Betty spoke, her voice low and panicked. \"Liv? What the hell is going on? Wasn\u0027t he trying to kill you twenty minutes ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"That was Davina. It was always Davina. Cain was trying to stop her, not hurt me. And then, after the attack with Peach, I just wanted the magic gone, so I called Davina and...\" I let out a bitter laugh. \"God, I was so stupid. I offered her my magic. It was exactly what she wanted. She set that whole Millie attack up just to get me desperate enough to turn to her, and I fell for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy entire body started shaking then, little racking spasms of fear I was too weakened to control. Betty rubbed my back and said, \"Everything is going to be okay. But Cain\u0027s right. You need to rest. Get a little sleep, and you\u0027ll be able to deal with everything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, although I wasn\u0027t sure I believed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty got up off the couch and looked down at me. \"I\u0027m going to go upstairs and prepare the guest rooms. I\u0027m staying, and I assume\" - she nodded in the direction of the kitchen - \"he\u0027s staying, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the man with the plan, and that\u0027s more than I\u0027ve got so ... yeah,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Tobias...?\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. But there are four guest rooms upstairs, and there\u0027s clean bedding in the closet at the end of the hall, next to the bathroom. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty nodded and headed upstairs. I had a few moments of silence, and then the front door opened, and Tobias walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All quiet on the western front?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, but didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like hell,\" I said, not really meaning to be so blunt about it, but unable to edit myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed at his face, and I could hear the scratch of the scruff under his hand. \"That sounds about right. I haven\u0027t slept in two days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up the stairs, second door on the right. Room\u0027s yours, if you want to stay here tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eyed me for a second, then said, \"The couch is fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, I\u0027m not making a pass,\" I said, feeling a stab of annoyance. \"You made yourself clear on that. I\u0027m just saying, this house is lousy with guest bedrooms, and I\u0027m offering you one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just that someone should be down here on the couch, keeping an eye out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m staying on the couch,\" a voice said from behind me. I turned and saw Cain standing in the entryway between the hall and the living room. He, however, wasn\u0027t looking at me; he was looking at Tobias.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She needs sleep,\" he said. \"You want to help her to her room, or should I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, please,\" I said, pushing myself up off the couch. \"I\u0027m not an invalid, I don\u0027t need - whoa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand to my head as the world got wobbly, and Tobias was there in a moment, one arm around my waist. I didn\u0027t have enough pride left to fuel an argument, so I let him lead me upstairs, and I almost wept with gratitude when we got to my room and I saw my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love this bed,\" I said as I plopped face-first into my bedding. I turned my head to the side, indulging in the soft girliness of the down under my face. \"I shouldn\u0027t have mocked that guy who married his pillow. I\u0027m having serious romantic feelings for this duvet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias chuckled as he pulled back the covers and maneuvered me into them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep well,\" he said, and he might have said more, but I was passed out before I could hear anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a little after dawn when my eyes fluttered open. The light in my room was dim, but I could see the shape of Tobias, slumped on the floor with his back against the door, his head hanging down as he slept. I could hear his breath, just the slightest hint of a snore, and I sat up to watch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were clasped lightly over his stomach, which rose and fell with his breath. His lips turned up slightly at the corners, and I realized that despite all the incredible tragedy he\u0027d experienced in his life, a smile was his default expression. I felt a sudden overwhelming swell of love for him, and then was distracted as my hands began to tingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot now, I thought, and shook them out, then closed my eyes and calmed my heart. When I opened them again, Tobias\u0027s head was up, and he was watching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said. \"You slept by my door all night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cleared his throat and shifted up so he wasn\u0027t quite so slumped, then said, \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"Did I mention I have four guest bedrooms in this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped one knuckle gently against the door. \"You underestimate how comfortable this door is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scooched to one side of the bed, making space for him. \"Come up here. If you\u0027re not going to leave my side, at least don\u0027t be an idiot. You can\u0027t protect me if you\u0027ve got a spasm in your back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI patted the empty space next to me. He hesitated for a moment, then pushed himself up and lay down on top of the covers, leaning back into the pillows and letting out a slow sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" he said, a small smile forming on his face. \"This is a great bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay down next to him, suddenly wide awake, and stared at the ceiling. I listened for his breathing to deepen and morph into the light snore I\u0027d heard before, but after a few minutes went by and that didn\u0027t happen, I turned my head to look at him, and found him watching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what Edward did in the Twilight books, watching a girl sleep is just creepy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"You weren\u0027t sleeping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to breeze by on a technicality, Shoop. You go all Cullen on me, I\u0027m staking you through the heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was quiet for a while, and then I said, \"I\u0027m sorry about all this. I know it sucks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not.\" I turned in bed to face him, pushing up on one elbow. \"I hate this. I hate having to deal with the magic at all, but to have some crazy woman want to kill me? That\u0027s too much. And now you\u0027re pulled into it, and Cain - I don\u0027t care if he\u0027s good, he still creeps me out.\" I let out a heavy sigh. \"And then there\u0027s Millie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Millie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Davina did something to her,\" I said. \"She created this monster where Millie used to be. Millie was sweet and quiet and thoughtful and smart, and now she\u0027s just ... evil. It\u0027s like Davina ate her soul or something. Can she do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias opened his mouth to say something, then seemed to think better of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t have that. \"Go ahead. Say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe met my eye. \"Davina gave her a makeover, and she loaned her some power. Everything else that Millie\u0027s doing ... I don\u0027t know. I think it\u0027s just ... Millie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What the hell are you talking about? Have you met Millie? She would never hurt anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except, she did,\" he said. \"She seduced Nick. She attacked Peach, physically. Twice. Magic walnuts or a baseball bat, the choice to attack is what matters. Millie\u0027s been repressed and angry for a long time. She was a stick of dynamite just waiting to be lit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"You barely even know her. I know her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yawned and rubbed his eyes. \"Yeah, but that\u0027s the thing. You never really know anyone. You see what they want to show you, and if you\u0027re lucky, they show you most of the truth. My point is, there\u0027s only so much of this that you can blame on Davina. Millie made a lot of her own choices here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not making me feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not trying to make you feel better,\" he said. \"I\u0027m trying to tell you the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flopped back into my pillow. \"Yeah, your truth. And it\u0027s a stupid truth. It stinks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes. \"Fair enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Little flies are zooming around it, it stinks so bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened one eye and looked at me. \"You done yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somewhere out there, there\u0027s a dead fish thinking, \u0027Well, at least I don\u0027t stink as bad as Tobias\u0027s truth.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eye again. \"I\u0027ll take that as a no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack Nicholson called.
