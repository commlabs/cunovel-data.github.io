From it Ben learned that Mr. Baldwin had been dead for three weeks, and that all his property was left to a young man who claimed to be a distant relative. The name of the heir was John Tremlett. The letter concluded: \"I can find nothing in the papers of the deceased confirming your statement that your aunt was allowed to occupy her house rent free.
