And I honestly needed to get out of here. “All right, I need to go home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I waved him off, starting down the steps. “I really need to go home. Blake called and I need to call him back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boris can wait,” Daemon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blake,” I said, stopping on the sidewalk. Dee had wisely gone inside, but Daemon had moved to the edge of the porch. My thoughts, my emotions, felt overly exposed when I met his eyes. “They asked me a lot of questions—especially the lady.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nancy Husher,” he said, frowning. A second later, he was standing before me. “She’s apparently a big deal within the DOD. They wanted to know what went down Halloween weekend. I gave them the Daemon-edited-version.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did they believe you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “Hook, line, and sinker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shivered. “But it wasn’t you, Daemon. It was me. Or it was all of us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but they don’t know that.” His voice lowered as he cupped my cheek. “They won’t ever know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes closed. The warmth of his hand eased some of the fear. “It’s not me I’m worried about. If they think you blew a satellite out of orbit, they could see you as a threat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or they could just think I’m that awesome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not funny,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” Daemon moved closer, and before I knew it, I was in his embrace again. “Don’t worry about me or Dee. We can handle the DOD. Trust me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him hold me for a couple of moments, soaking up his warmth, but then I slipped free. “I didn’t tell that lady anything. And the damn phone rang as I was getting out of the car. She knew we were lying about why we were there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re not going to care about us lying over the phone. They probably think we were out there getting it on or something. You don’t need to worry, Kat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnxiety didn’t fade. It snaked through me. There had been something about Nancy. Calculating. As if a pop quiz had been sprung on us and we’d failed. I lifted my eyes, meeting his. “I’m glad you’re okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have stood there staring at his sparkling eyes all night, but something urged me to run as far away from him as quickly as I could. Something bad was going to come from all of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs expected, I spent the better part of Thanksgiving poking around the house alone. Mom really got shafted, pulling a double shift that took her out of the house from around noon Thursday until noon on Friday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could’ve gone next door. Both Dee and Daemon had invited me, but it didn’t feel right busting up their alien Thanksgiving. And from the amount of creepy peeping I was doing from my window every time I heard a car door close outside, I knew everyone showing up was secretly an ET. Even Ash arrived with her brothers, looking like she was going to a funeral rather than a dinner party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me didn’t like that she was there. Yeah, I was jealous. Stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’d made the right call by not going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was an anxious wreck. Today alone, I’d tipped over the coffee table, shattered three glasses, and blew a lightbulb. Being with people probably wasn’t a good idea, but it would’ve been nice to lose myself in the holiday festivities for a little while. The only good thing was the fact my head didn’t feel like it was being ripped apart after the shenanigans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround six in the evening, I felt that now-oh-so-familiar tingle on the back of my neck right before Daemon knocked. A ball of confusing feelings unfurled inside me as I hurried to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing I noticed was the large box beside him, and then the scent of roasted turkey and yams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” he said, holding a stack of covered plates. “Happy Thanksgiving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked slowly. “Happy Thanksgiving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You going to invite me in?” He held up the plates, wiggling them. “I come bearing gifts in the form of food.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill grinning, he came in and waved his free hand. The box lifted off the porch and trailed behind him like a dog. It landed just inside the foyer. As I shut the door, I caught sight of Ash and Andrew climbing into their car. Neither of them looked over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lump formed in my throat as I turned to Daemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I brought a little of everything.” He headed toward the kitchen. “There’s turkey, yams, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, green-bean casserole, some kind of apple crisp thing and pumpkin—Kitten? Are you coming?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeeling myself away from the front door, I went into the kitchen. He was setting up the table, uncovering the dishes. I…I didn’t know what to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon raised his hands and two depression glass candleholders Mom never used floated to the table. Candles came next, and with a wave of his hand, their wicks sparked tiny flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lump grew, nearly choking me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinnerware and glasses came from several opened drawers. Mom’s wine flew out of the fridge, pouring into two crystal flutes while Daemon stood in the middle of everything. It was like a scene straight out of Beauty and the Beast. I kept waiting for a teapot to start singing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And after dinner, I have another surprise for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do?” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “But you’ve got to join me for dinner first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuffled to the table and sat, watching him with eyes that were blurry. He made me a plate and then sat beside me. I cleared my throat. “Daemon, I…I don’t know what to say, but thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks aren’t necessary,” he said. “You didn’t want to come over, which I understand, but you shouldn’t be alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowering my gaze before he could see the tears gathering in my eyes, I grabbed the flute and downed the bitter-tasting white wine. When I looked up, his brows were raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lush,” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned. “Maybe—for today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nudged me with his knee under the table. “Dig in before it gets cold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe food was divine. Any doubts I had about Dee’s cooking abilities vanished. Throughout our little makeshift dinner, I drank another glass of wine. I also ate everything that Daemon put on my plate, including second helpings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd by the time I stabbed the pumpkin pie with my fork, I was either a little tipsy or I was starting to believe that there was more than just the connection propelling him. That maybe he did care for me, because I was able to fight it—sort of—and I know damn well that Daemon could if he wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he just didn’t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCleaning up dinner was a strangely intimate experience. Our elbows brushed several times. Amiable silence descended as we washed the dishes, side by side. My cheeks felt flushed. My thoughts were way too giddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo much wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed Daemon into the foyer afterward. He moved the large box to the living room without touching it. It sort of jingled. Sitting on the edge of the couch, I folded my hands and waited, having no clue what he was up to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon opened the box, reached inside, and pulled out a green-needled branch and poked me with it. “I think we have a Christmas tree to put up. I know it’s not during the parade, but I think Charlie Brown’s Thanksgiving special is on, and, well, that’s not too bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was it. The lump in my throat was back, but there was no stopping it this time. Jumping from the couch, I raced out of the room. Tears formed, then slid down my cheeks. Emotion clogged my throat as I wiped under my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon appeared in front of me, blocking the staircase. His eyes were wide, pupils luminous. I tried to turn away, but he quickly enveloped me in his strong arms. “I didn’t do this to make you cry, Kat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” I sniffled. “It’s just …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just what?” He cupped my cheeks, his thumbs brushing away the tears. My skin tingled from the contact. “Kitten?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think you know how much…something like this means to me.” I took a deep breath, but the stupid tears kept falling. “I haven’t done this since—since Dad was alive. And I’m sorry to cry, because I’m not sad. I just didn’t expect this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay.” Daemon tugged me forward, and I went. He wrapped his arms around me, holding me close as I buried my face into the front of his shirt. “I get it. Good tears and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something warm and right about being in his arms. And I wanted to deny it, but for the first time, I stopped—I just stopped. Even if Daemon saw me as one giant Rubik’s Cube he had to crack or if it was the healing mojo, it didn’t matter. Not right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed a handful of his shirt and held on. He may have thought he knew how much this meant to me, but he really didn’t. Daemon would never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my head and reached up, clasping his smooth cheeks. With his help, I brought his lips to mine and kissed him. It was a quick and innocent kiss, but I felt the zing all the way to my toes. I pulled back, breathless. “Thank you. I really mean it. Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brushed the backs of his fingers over my cheek, smoothing the last of my tears away. “Don’t let anyone know about my sweet side. I have a reputation to keep up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “All right, let’s do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrimming a Christmas tree with an alien was a different experience. He moved the recliner out from in front of the window with a jerk of his chin. Bulbs hung in the air along with twinkling lights that weren’t plugged in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe laughed. A lot. Every so often I’d get choked up when I thought of Mom’s face tomorrow afternoon. She’d be happy, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon dropped silvery tinsel on my head while I plucked a bulb out of the air. “Thanks,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It kind of fits you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent of artificial pine filled the living room. The holiday spirit woke inside me like a slumbering giant. I grinned at Daemon and held up a bulb that was so green it almost matched his eyes. I decided it was going to be his bulb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed it right under the twinkling star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost midnight by the time we finished. Sitting on the couch, thigh against thigh, we stared at our masterpiece. The tree was a little tinsel-heavy on one side, but it was perfect. A rainbow of colored lights shimmered. Glass bulbs glimmered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love it,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it’s pretty good.” He leaned in to me, yawning. “Dee put up the tree this morning. She has to have everything the same color, but I think our tree looks better. It’s like a disco ball.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur tree. I smiled, liking the sound of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bumped me with his shoulder. “You know, I had fun doing this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s lashes lowered. Man, I’d kill for a set of those babies. “It’s late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” I hesitated. “You want to stay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single brow arched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat hadn’t come out right. “I don’t mean that.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-23.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
