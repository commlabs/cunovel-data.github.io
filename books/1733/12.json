We had really expected to get the license.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m a respectable citizen; pillar of the community; all that kind of stuff. I was a little old, maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie-my wife-may have been past her best childbearing years. So what? We know other people worse off than us, older, trashy in character, who-Well, never mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had one son, Charlie, and we really wanted another child. Boy or girl, it didn\u0027t matter. Of course, if there was something wrong with Charlie, if he developed some illness, maybe then we could license a second child. Or maybe not. And if we did get the license, they would probably take care of Charlie as a defective. You know what I mean; I don\u0027t have to say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trouble was we were late getting started, and that was Josie\u0027s fault. She had irregular periods and you never knew when to get her, if you know what I mean. And we couldn\u0027t get any medical help, either. How could we? The clinics said if we couldn\u0027t have children without help, that was great for the world. It\u0027s patriotic, or something, to be childless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we fooled them and had a child after all. Charlie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Charlie was eight months old, we started applying for a second child. We wanted them pretty close in age. Was that so much to ask? Even if we were getting a little old for it? What kind of a world do we live in, anyway. No matter how much the population drops, they say it has to drop further, and if life gets easier and people live longer, it has to drop still further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey won\u0027t be satisfied till they wipe out humanity alto-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, look! I\u0027ll tell this just the way I want to. If you want the story, officer, you\u0027ll have to take it my way. What can you do to me? I really don\u0027t much care if I live or die. Would you in my position?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Look, it\u0027s no use arguing. I\u0027ll tell it my way, or I\u0027ll shut up and you can do your worst. You understand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Well then, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turned out, we didn\u0027t have to worry about Charlie being sickly, or anything like that. He grew like a bear, or one of those other animals that used to hang around in the woods and places like that in the old days. He came of good stock. You could see that. So why couldn\u0027t we have had another child?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what I want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntelligent? You bet. Strong. Knew what he wanted. Ideal boy. When I think of it, I could-I could-Oh, well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should have seen him with the other kids as he was growing up. A natural leader. Always had his way. Always had the other children in the neighborhood doing what he wanted. He knew what he wanted and what he wanted was always right. That was the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie didn\u0027t like it, though. She said he was spoiled. In fact, she said I spoiled him. I don\u0027t know what she was talking about. I was the making of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was two years ahead of his age in strength and in brains. I could see that. And if the other children got out of line, sometimes he would have to show them who was boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie thought he was getting to be a bully. She said he had no friends; all the children were afraid of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what! A leader doesn\u0027t want friends. He wants people to respect him, and if they get out of line, they better fear him. Charlie was coming along all right. Sure, the other children stayed away mostly. That was their parents\u0027 fault; and they\u0027re just a bunch of milksops. Once they get one child, and know they won\u0027t have any more, they start hovering over him or her like they were the family jewels, and rare jewels, too. You smother them if you do that. They become useless-worthless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was this guy Stevenson down the block. He had two girls, both pitiful things, giggling and empty-headed. How did he come to get two, I ask you? He knew somebody, maybe. A little money passed from hand to hand. Why not, he\u0027s got more money than he admits, too. Naturally. That accounts for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027d think with two, he could afford to risk one, but no-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That\u0027s all right. I\u0027ll get to the point, when I get to the point. If you push, you\u0027ll get nothing and we\u0027ll let it go straight to the court. See if I care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese other parents, they didn\u0027t want their babies hurt. Don\u0027t play with the Janowitz boy, they would say. I never heard them say so but I\u0027m sure that\u0027s what they said. Well, who needed them? I was planning for Charlie to go to college eventually, so he could take courses in microelectronics or in spatial dynamics, or that kind of stuff. And economics and business, too, so he would know how to get money and power out of his know-how. That\u0027s the way I saw it. I wanted him on top of the heap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Josie kept talking about Charlie not having friends and Charlie growing up alone, and like that. All the time. It was like living in an echo chamber. And then, one day, she came to me and said, \"Why don\u0027t we get Charlie a kid brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure,\" I said. \"You\u0027re past menopause so what do we do? Call in the stork? Look under cabbage leaves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have divorced her, you know. Married a young chick. After all, I wasn\u0027t past menopause. But I was-loyal. Fat lot of good that did me. Besides, if I had divorced her, she would mostly have kept\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie, so what good would that have done me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I just made that comment about the stork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I\u0027m not talking about a biological child. I\u0027m saying we can get a robot to be Charlie\u0027s brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never expected to hear anything like that, you can bet. I\u0027m not a robot-type guy. My parents never had one. I never had one. As far as I\u0027m concerned, every robot means one less human, and we\u0027re just watching the world being turned over to them. Just one more way of wiping out humanity, if you ask me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I said to Josie, \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really,\" said Josie, all very earnest. \"It\u0027s a new model. It\u0027s just designed to be friendly and pals for children. Nothing fancy, so they aren\u0027t expensive, and they do fill a need. With more and more people having only one child, there is a real value in supplying that one child with siblings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That may be true of other children. Not Charlie,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Charlie, especially. He\u0027s never going to find out how to deal with people this way. He\u0027s growing up alone, really alone. He won\u0027t come to understand the give and take of life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not going to give. He\u0027s a taker. He\u0027ll take power and he\u0027ll take position, and he\u0027ll tell people what to do. And he\u0027ll have children of his own and maybe even three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may be too young to feel this yet, officer, but if you have only one child, you\u0027ll eventually discover you\u0027ll still have a chance at another one when your child has a child. I had high hopes for Charlie. Before I died, I was sure I would see another child, maybe even two or three. They might be Charlie\u0027s but as far as our lives would overlap, I was going to make them mine, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all Josie could think about was a robot. Life became another kind of echo chamber. She priced them out. She figured out the down payment. She looked into the possibility of renting one for a year on a kind of approval. She was willing to use her own nest egg that her folks had left her to pay for it, and things like that. And you know how it is, in the end you have to keep peace in the family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave in. I said, \"Okay, but you go pick one out and you better make it a rental. And you pay for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured, who knows. The robot would probably be a pain in the neck and wouldn\u0027t work out, and we\u0027d return him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked him into the house, didn\u0027t even crate him. I should say \"it\" but Josie insisted on saying \"he\" and \"him\" so he would seem more like a kid brother to Charlie, and I got into the habit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a \"sibling-robot\"; that\u0027s what they called him. He had a registration number, but I never memorized it. What for? We just called him \"Kid. \" That was good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yes, I know that this sort of robot is getting popular. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening to human beings that they stand for such things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we stood for it, too. Or at least, I did. Josie was fascinated. The one we got was a pretty good one, I have to admit. He looked almost human, he smiled a lot, and he had a nice voice. He looked maybe fifteen, a small-sized fifteen, which wasn\u0027t too bad because Charlie was a large-sized ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKid was a little taller than Charlie and, of course, heavier. You know, there were titanium bones or whatever inside him and a nuclear unit, guaranteed for ten years before replacement, and that\u0027s pretty heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a good vocabulary, too, and he was very polite. Josie was just delighted. She said, \"I can use him in the house. He can help out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"No, you don\u0027t. You got him for Charlie, and that means he\u0027s Charlie\u0027s. Don\u0027t you go taking him away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking if Josie got him, and made him into a slavey, she\u0027d never let go of him. Charlie, on the other hand, might not like him or might get tired after a little while, and then we could get rid of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie fooled me, though. He liked Kid fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you know, it made sense after a while. Kid was designed to be a kid brother, so he was just right for Charlie. He let Charlie take the lead, like an older brother should. He had those three Laws. I can\u0027t quote them, but you know what they are. There was no way he could hurt Charlie, and he had to do whatever Charlie said, so after a while I began to think it was a good deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, when they played games Charlie always won. He was supposed to. And the Kid never got mad. He couldn\u0027t. He was made to lose. And sometimes Charlie kicked the Kid around, the way children do, you know. A child gets mad about something, he takes it out on some other child. Children always do that. Naturally, that gets the parents of the other child mad and I had to tell Charlie now and then not to do that and that sort of cramps him. It squeezes him in. He can\u0027t express himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, he could with the Kid. And why not? You can\u0027t hurt the Kid. He\u0027s made out of plastic and metal and who knows what else. For all he looked nearly like a human being, he wasn\u0027t alive; he couldn\u0027t feel pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, I felt the best thing the Kid did was to be something on which Charlie could bleed off his excess energy so that it wouldn\u0027t accumulate in him and fester. And the Kid never minded. They\u0027d play judo and the Kid would be thrown, and even stamped on, but he would just get up and say, \"That was good, Charlie. Let\u0027s try it again. \" Listen, you could throw him off the top of a building and he wouldn\u0027t be hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was always polite to us. He called me Dad. He called Josie Mom. He asked after our health. He would help Josie out of her chair when she wanted to stand up. That sort of stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was designed that way. He had to act affectionate. It was all automatic. He was programmed for it. It didn\u0027t mean a thing, but Josie liked it. Listen, I\u0027ve always been busy, hard-working. I have this plant I had to help run, interlocking machinery to oversee. One thing goes wrong and the whole shebang ties itself up. I have no time to bring flowers and go mucking around pulling out her chairs or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d been married nearly twenty years and how long does that sort of thing keep up anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Charlie-Well, he stood up to his mother the way any decent boy should. And I figured the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKid helped there. When Charlie made himself boss over the Kid one minute, he wasn\u0027t going to run around saying, \"Mommie, Mommie,\" the next minute. He was not a mamma\u0027s boy, and he didn\u0027t let Josie run him, and I was proud of him for that. He was going to be a man. Of course, he listened to what I said to him. A boy\u0027s got to listen to his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo maybe it was good that the Kid was designed to be a sort of mamma\u0027s boy. It gave Josie the feeling that there was one of those nerds about the house and it bothered her less that Charlie always thought for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course you could count on Josie to do her best to spoil it. She was forever worrying about her pet nerd being hurt. She was always coming out with, \"Now, Charlie, why don\u0027t you be nicer to your kid brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was ridiculous. I could never get it through her head that the Kid wasn\u0027t hurt; that he was designed to be a loser; that it was all good for Charlie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Charlie never listened to her. He played with the Kid the way he wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Do you mind if I rest a little. I don\u0027t really like talking about all this. Just let me rest a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Okay, I\u0027m better now. I can go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the year was up, I felt that it was enough. We could return the Kid to U.S. Robots. After all, he had served his purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Josie was against that. Dead set against that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"But we\u0027d have to buy him outright now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she said, she would pay the down payment, so I went along with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things she said was that we couldn\u0027t take away Charlie\u0027s brother. Charlie would be lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I did think, well, maybe she\u0027s right. I tell you it\u0027s deadly when you start thinking your wife might be right. It leads you into nothing but trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie did ease up on the Kid a little as he grew older. He got to be just as tall as the Kid, for one thing, so maybe he didn\u0027t think he had to knock him around as much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, he became interested in things besides rough and tumble. Basketball, for instance; he played one-on-one with the Kid and Charlie was good. He always outmaneuvered the Kid and hardly ever missed a basket. Well, maybe the Kid let himself be outmaneuvered and maybe he didn\u0027t ever block a basket-shot efficiently, but how do you account for getting the ball into the basket? The Kid couldn\u0027t fake that, could he ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the second year, the Kid sort of became a member of the family. He didn\u0027t eat with us or anything like that, because he didn\u0027t eat. And he didn\u0027t sleep either, so he just stood in the corner of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s bedroom at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he watched the holoviews with us, and Josie would always explain things to him so that he got to know more and to seem more human. She took him shopping with her and wherever else she went, if Charlie didn\u0027t need him. The Kid was always helpful, I suppose, and I guess he carried things for her and was always polite and attentive and that sort of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027ll tell you, Josie was more easygoing, with the Kid around. More good-humored, more good-natured, less whining. It made for a more pleasant homelife, and I figured, well, the Kid is teaching Charlie to be more and more dominant, and he\u0027s teaching Josie to smile more, so maybe it was a good thing it was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Listen, can you let me have something wet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yeah, with alcohol. Just a little, just a little. Come on, what are you worrying about the rules for? I\u0027ve got to get through this somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it happened. One out of a million-or out of a billion. Microfusion units aren\u0027t supposed to give trouble. You can read about it anywhere. They\u0027re all fail-safe, no matter what. Except mine wasn\u0027t. I don\u0027t know why. Nobody knows why. At the start, no one even knew it was the microfusion. They\u0027ve told me since that it was, and that I qualify for full restoration of the house and furniture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFat lot of good that would do me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Look, you\u0027re treating me as though I were a homicidal maniac, but why me? Why aren\u0027t you getting after the microfusion people for murder? Find out who made that unit, or who goofed up installing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t you people know what real crimes are? There\u0027s this thing, this microfusion-it doesn\u0027t explode, it doesn\u0027t make a noise, it just gets hotter and hotter and after a while the house is on fire. How come people can get away manufacturing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yes, I\u0027ll get on with it. I\u0027ll get on with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was away that day. That one day in a whole year I was away. I run everything from my home, or from wherever I am with my family. I don\u0027t have to go anywhere, the computers do it all. It\u0027s not like your job, officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the big boss wanted to see me in person. There\u0027s no sense to it; everything could have been done closed-circuit. He has some sort of idea, though, that he wants to check all his section heads every once in a while in person. He seems to think that you can\u0027t really judge a person unless you see him in three dimensions and smell him and feel him. It\u0027s just superstition left over from the Dark Age-which I wish would come back, before computers and robots, and when you could have all the children you wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the day when the microfusion went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got the word right away. You always get the word. Wherever you are, even on the Moon or in a space settlement, bad news gets to you in seconds. Good news you might miss out on, but bad news never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was rushing back while the house was still burning. When I got there, the house was a total wreck, but Josie was out on the lawn, looking a complete mess, but alive. She had been out on the lawn when it happened, they told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she saw the house become all in flame, and Charlie was inside, she rushed in at once, and I could see she must have brought him out because there he was lying to one side with people bending over him. It looked bad. I couldn\u0027t see him. I didn\u0027t dare go over there to see him. I had to find out from Josie first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hardly speak. \"How bad is he?\" I asked Josie, and I didn\u0027t recognize my own voice. I think my mind was beginning to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was saying, \"I couldn\u0027t save them both. I couldn\u0027t save them both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy should she want to save them both? I thought. I said, \"Stop worrying about the Kid. He\u0027s just a device. There\u0027s insurance and compassion money and we can buy another Kid. \"I think I tried to say all that, but I don\u0027t know if I managed. Maybe I just made hoarse, choking sounds.
