She was pretty much encouraging everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am asking, did you volunteer. Did you do it on your own. Or did she, for example, take your hand and place it on her-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I did it on my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your earlier reservations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was worked up.

She was ripping the buttons off my shirt. I had to go home, and I didn\u0027t want my wife to see my shirt, so I pushed her away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ever do anything that was not self-defense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hit her at any time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. What happened then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She threw a wineglass at me. But by then I was pretty much dressed. I went and got my phone from her windowsill, and then I went-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. You got your phone? What phone is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a cellular phone.\" He took it out of his pocket and showed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all carry them in the company, because we make them. And I had been using the phone to make a call from her office, when she started kissing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you in the middle of a call when she started kissing you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" \"Whom were you talking to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An answering machine.\" \"I see.\" She was clearly disappointed. \"Go on, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I went and got my phone and got the hell out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was screaming that I couldn\u0027t do this to her, that she would kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you responded how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.

You know, for the maintenance firm that cleans up our offices.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I went home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you tell your wife what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you tell anybody what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I was in shock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused and looked back over her notes. \"All right. You say you were sexually harassed. And you have described a very direct overture by this woman. Since she was your boss, I would have thought you\u0027d feel yourself at some risk in turning her down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. I was concerned. Sure. But I mean, don\u0027t I have the right to turn her down? Isn\u0027t that what this is about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly you have that right. I\u0027m asking about your state of mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was very upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet you did not want to tell anybody what had happened? You did not want to share this upsetting experience with a colleague? A friend? A family member, perhaps a brother? Anybody at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It didn\u0027t even occur to me. I didn\u0027t know how to deal with what- I guess I was in shock. I just wanted it to go away. I wanted to think it had never happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you make any notes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Now, you mentioned that you didn\u0027t tell your wife. Would you say you concealed it from your wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you often conceal things from her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But in this instance, you know, involving an old girlfriend, I didn\u0027t think she would be sympathetic. I didn\u0027t want to deal with her about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you had other affairs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This wasn\u0027t an affair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m asking a general question. In terms of your relationship to your wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I haven\u0027t had affairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I advise you to tell your wife at once. Make a full and complete disclosure. Because I promise you that she will find out, if she hasn\u0027t done so already. However difficult it may be to tell her, your best chance to preserve your relationship is to be completely honest with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, going back to last night. What happened next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meredith Johnson called the house and spoke to my wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFernandez\u0027s eyebrows went up. \"I see. Did you expect that to happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, no. It scared the hell out of me. But apparently she was friendly, and just called to say that the morning meeting was rescheduled for eight-thirty. Today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1 see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But when I got to work today, I found that the meeting had actually been scheduled for eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you arrived late, and were embarrassed, and so on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you believe that it was a setup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFernandez glanced at her watch. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m running out of time. Bring me up to date about what happened today quickly, if you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout mentioning Conley-White, he described the morning meeting briefly and his subsequent humiliation. His argument with Meredith. His conversation with Phil Blackburn. The offer of a lateral transfer. The fact that the transfer would deny him the benefits of a possible spin-off. His decision to seek advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFernandez asked few questions and wrote steadily. Finally, she pushed the yellow pad aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I think I have enough to get the picture. You\u0027re feeling slighted and ignored. And your question is, do you have a harassment case?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said, nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well. Arguably you do. It\u0027s a jury case, and we don\u0027t know what would happen if we went to trial. But based on what you have told me here, I have to advise you that your case is not strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSanders felt stunned. `Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t make the law. I\u0027m just telling you frankly, so you can arrive at an informed decision. Your situation is not good, Mr. Sanders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFernandez pushed back from her desk and began to stuff papers into her briefcase. \"I have five minutes, but let me review for you what sexual harassment actually is, under the law, because many clients aren\u0027t clear about it. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made sex discrimination in the workplace illegal, but as a practical matter what we call sexual harassment was not defined for many years. Since the middle nineteen-eighties, the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission has, under Title VII, produced guidelines to define sexual harassment. In the last few years, these EEOC guidelines have been further clarified by case law. So the definitions are quite explicit. According to the law, for a complaint to qualify as sexual harassment, the behavior must contain three elements. First, it must be sexual. That means, for example, that making a profane or scatological joke is not sexual harassment, even though a listener may find it offensive. The conduct must be sexual in nature. In your case, there\u0027s no doubt about the explicitly sexual element, from what you have told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Second, the behavior must be unwelcome. The courts distinguish between behavior that is voluntary and behavior that is welcome. For example, a person may be having a sexual relationship with a superior and it\u0027s obviously voluntary-no one\u0027s holding a gun to the person\u0027s head. But the courts understand that the employee may feel that they have no choice but to comply, and therefore the sexual relationship was not freely entered into-it\u0027s not welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To determine if behavior is really unwelcome, the courts look at the surrounding behavior in broad terms. Did the employee make sexual jokes in the workplace, and thus indicate that such jokes from others were welcome? Did the employee routinely engage in sexual banter, or sexual teasing with other employees? If the employee engaged in an actual affair, did they allow the supervisor into their apartment, did they visit the supervisor in the hospital, or see them at times when they didn\u0027t strictly have to, or engage in other actions that would suggest that they were actively and willingly participating in the relationship. In addition, the courts look to see if the employee ever told the supervisor the behavior was unwelcome, if the employee complained to anyone else about the relationship or tried to take any action to evade the unwelcome situation. That consideration becomes more significant when the employee is highly placed, and presumably more free to act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I didn\u0027t tell anybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. And you didn\u0027t tell her, either. At least, not explicitly, so far as I can determine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t feel I could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you didn\u0027t. But it\u0027s a problem for your case. Now, the third element in sexual harassment is discrimination on the basis of gender. The most common is quid pro quo-the exchange of sexual favors in return for keeping your job or getting a promotion. The threat of that may be explicit or implied. I believe you said it was your understanding that Ms. Johnson had the ability to fire you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. \"How did you gain that understanding?\" \"Phil Blackburn told me.\" \"Explicitly?\" \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about Ms. Johnson? Did she make any offer contingent on sex? Did she make any reference to her ability to fire you, in the course of the evening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly, but it was there. It was always in the air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said things like `As long as we\u0027re working together, we might as well have a little fun.\u0027 And she talked about wanting to have an affair during company trips we would make together to Malaysia, and so on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You interpreted this as an implied threat to your job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I interpreted it to mean that if I wanted to get along with her, I had better go along with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you didn\u0027t want to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you say so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I was married, and that things had changed between us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, under most circumstances, that exchange alone would probably serve to establish your case. If there were witnesses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there weren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Now, there is a final consideration, which we call hostile working environment. This is ordinarily invoked in situations where an individual is harassed in a pattern of incidents that may not in themselves be sexual but that cumulatively amount to harassment based on gender. I don\u0027t believe you can claim hostile work environment on this single incident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately, the incident you describe is simply not as clear-cut as it might be. We would then turn to ancillary evidence of harassment. For example, if you were fired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think in effect I have been fired,\" Sanders said. \"Because I\u0027m being pulled out of the division, and I won\u0027t get to participate in the spin-off\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand. But the company\u0027s offer to transfer you laterally makes things complicated. Because the company can argue-very successfullv, I thinkthat it does not owe you anything more than a lateral transfer. That it has never promised you the golden egg of a spin-off. That such a spin-off is in any case speculative, intended to occur at some future time, and it might never happen. That the company is not required to compensate you for your hopesfor some vague expectation of a future that might never occur. And therefore the company will claim that a lateral transfer is fully acceptable, and that you are being unreasonable if you turn it down. That you are in effect quitting, not being fired. It will place the burden back on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, it\u0027s not. Suppose, for example, you found out that you had terminal cancer and were going to die in six months. Would the company be required to pay the proceeds of the spin-off to your survivors? Clearly, no. If you\u0027re working in the company when it spins off, you participate. If you\u0027re not, you don\u0027t. The company has no broader obligation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying I might as well have cancer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m saying that you\u0027re angry and you feel the company owes you something that the court will not agree it does. In my experience, sexual harassment claims often have this quality. People come in feeling angry and wronged, and they think they have rights that they simply don\u0027t have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"Would it be different if I were a woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Basically, no. Even in the most clear-cut situations-the most extreme and outrageous situations-sexual harassment is notoriously difficult to prove. Most cases occur as yours has: behind closed doors, with no witnesses. It\u0027s one person\u0027s word against another\u0027s. In that circumstance, where there is no clear-cut corroborating evidence, there is often a prejudice against the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even so, one-fourth of all sexual harassment cases are brought by men. Most of those are brought against male bosses, but one-fifth are brought against women. And the number is increasing all the time, as we have more women bosses in the workplace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t much discussed,\" she said, peering over her glasses. \"But it\u0027s happening. And from my point of view, it\u0027s to be expected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harassment is about power-the undue exercise of power by a superior over a subordinate. I know there\u0027s a fashionable point of view that says women are fundamentally different from men, and that women would never harass an employee. But from where I sit, I\u0027ve seen it all. I\u0027ve seen and heard everything that you can imagine and a lot that you wouldn\u0027t believe if I told you. That gives me another perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I don\u0027t deal much in theory. I have to deal with the facts. And on the basis of facts, I don\u0027t see much difference in the behavior of men and women. At least, nothing that you can rely on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you believe my story?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whether I believe you is not at issue. What\u0027s at issue is whether you realistically have a case, and therefore what you should do in your circumstances. I can tell you that I\u0027ve heard it all before. You\u0027re not the first man I\u0027ve been asked to represent, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you advise me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t advise you,\" Fernandez said briskly. \"The decision you face is much too difficult. I can only lay out the situation.\" She pushed her intercom button. \"Bob, tell Richard and Eileen to bring the car around. I\u0027ll meet them in front of the building.\" She turned back to Sanders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me review your problems,\" she said. She ticked them off on her fingers. \"One: you claim that you got into an intimate situation with a younger, very attractive woman but you turned her down. In the absence of witnesses or corroborating evidence, that isn\u0027t going to be an easy story to sell to a jury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two: if you bring a lawsuit, the company will fire you. You\u0027re looking at three years before you come to trial. You have to think about how you\u0027ll support yourself during that time, about how you\u0027ll make your house payments, and your other expenses. I might take you on a contingency basis, but you\u0027ll still have to pay all direct costs throughout the trial. That will be a minimum of one hundred thousand dollars. I don\u0027t know whether you\u0027ll want to mortgage your house to pay for it. But it has to be dealt with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three: a lawsuit will bring all this out into the open. It\u0027ll be in the papers and on the evening news for years before the trial begins. I can\u0027t adequately describe how destructive an experience that is-for you, and for your wife and family. Many families don\u0027t survive the pre-trial period intact. There are divorces, suicides, illnesses. It\u0027s very difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four: because of the offer of lateral transfer, it\u0027s not clear what we can claim as damages. The company will claim that you have no case, and we\u0027ll have to fight it. But even with a stunning victory, you may end up with only a couple of hundred thousand dollars after expenses and fees and three years of your life. And of course the company can appeal, delaying payment further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five: if you bring a lawsuit, you\u0027ll never work in this industry again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it\u0027s not supposed to work that way, but as a practical matter,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u002711 never be hired for another That\u0027s how it goes. It would you be one thing if you were fifty-five. But you\u0027re only forty-one. I don\u0027t know if you want to make that choice, at this point in your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\" He slumped back in the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, but these are the facts of litigation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s so unjust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put on her raincoat. \"Unfortunately, the law has nothing to do with justice, Mr. Sanders,\" she said. \"It\u0027s merely a method for dispute resolution.\" She snapped her briefcase shut and extended her hand. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mr. Sanders. I wish it were different. Please feel free to call me again if you have any further questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried out of the office, leaving him sitting there. After a moment the assistant came in. \"Can I do anything for you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/disclosure/page-11.html","bookId":2410,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:47 AM"}
