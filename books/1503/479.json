(3)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strong sense of danger rose in Zhou Weiqing’s heart, but it was unfortunately too late for him to leave. The three were moving just too quickly, and only Shangguan Fei’er could possibly escape with her Consolidated Wings. However, since the three were already reaching, Zhou Weiqing also wanted to find out how they knew about him. Keeping his guard up, Zhou Weiqing gave Shangguan Fei’er a signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the encroaching trio were ordinary eight-Jeweled powerhouses, they might not need be too afraid. After all, both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er were powerful beyond their level, both having Legendary Sets. With Lin TianAo’s powerful defense to support them, they might not lose in a three versus three fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three figures finally landed about a dozen yards from Zhou Weiqing’s trio. Just as Zhou Weiqing was seizing them up with a critical eye, he heard a surprised cry from Shangguan Fei’er. “Lion Prince!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing had not expected that Shangguan Fei’er would actually know their opponents, and he started slightly before focusing on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the three figures, the one in the middle was clearly the leader. He was tall and well built, even taller than Zhou Weiqing by half a head. His hair was a brilliant golden red, the long hair swirling in the wind behind his back, and his features were handsome and resolute; especially his eyes, which were staring fiercely at Zhou Weiqing, giving him a sense of a powerful pressure. He was dressed in light gold robes, giving him an impressive and dignified overall look…… Lion Prince?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, this was the Lion Prince Gu YingBing. Gu YingBing was flanked on each side by an old man, both looking to be about sixty years of age or so, equally large and muscular built, red haired and with the same pale golden robes. However, the greatest difference between them and Gu YingBing was that their hair did not have the same lustrous golden hue, and this was also the reason why any onlooker could clearly see why the Lion Prince was the leader with just a single look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er’s expression was extremely ugly. Naturally, she knew the Lion Prince Gu YingBing very well. Three years ago, both she and Shangguan Xue’er had accompanied their Uncle and Father to join the Five Great Saint Lands Fight on the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and she had met him then. If Shangguan Xue’er was the top fighter in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace younger generation, then this Gu YingBing was the strongest fighter in the entire of the Five Great Saint Lands younger generation. Three years ago, he had already reached the top level of the seven-Jeweled stage, and by now, she could easily guess that he had long broken through to the eight-Jeweled cultivation level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only was the Lion Prince the main disciple of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, he was also the future heir of the WanShou Empire Royal Family, the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion Tribe. Whether or not he would actually inherit the throne in the future, or become the next Leader of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, it was without a doubt that he was of utmost rank in the entire WanShou Empire. For one such a the Lion Prince to appear here so suddenly, and furthermore it was he who had shouted out Zhou Weiqing’s name, could it be he was here to take revenge for the two Regiments? Yet, how could he have known and responded so quickly? More so, the Heavenly Snow Mountain was also restricted by the Five Great Saint Lands agreement, and they would not easily intervene in the ordinary wars of lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince she did not know the reason why Gu YingBing had appeared here, Shangguan Fei’er said coldly: “The grand main disciple of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, future heir of the WanShou Empire, actually deigns to enter deep into our ZhongTian Empire territory, are you breaking the promise of the Five Great Saint Lands to intervene in the war between the Empires?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er was extremely intelligent in her own right, and her words mere directed both at Zhou Weiqing and the Lion Prince, to inform Zhou Weiqing of the other’s identity and status, while using the words to also spite the Lion Prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu YingBing’s gaze had been fixed upon Zhou Weiqing the moment he arrived. In fact, the whole reason why the WanShou Empire had increased the amount of armies here against the Northwest Armies was because of him. He was here specially to look for Zhou Weiqing, ever since he had seen the image of him that day. However, the Northwest Armies numbered more than a hundred thousand strong, and it would not be easy to look for him. As such, the Lion Prince brought two attendants to the border to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, he had suddenly received news from the front lines that two of their vanguard Regiments had met with formidable enemies. Instantly, he had thought about Zhou Weiqing bringing his men to snipe the Swift Wolf Regiment previously. With that thought in mind, he immediately rushed over as quickly as he could. The three of them had been quite a distance away, but he had sensed the presence of a Heavenly Skill Image. In terms of his senses, as a member of the Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion, he had one of the strongest Heavenly Beast bloodlines along with the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers. Their senses and perception were much stronger than most others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensory feeling of the Heavenly Image Image confirmed Gu YingBing’s guess to himself, and that was the reason for the shout earlier. The name ‘Zhou Weiqing’ he had learned from Tian’er. After he had brought the Wolf Prince to the Heavenly Snow Mountain to receive healing, Tian’er and Gu YingBing had another series of interactions, but in the end he had still came to the border to look for Zhou Weiqing and settle everything. However, even he had not expected that this meeting between he and this human who had stolen his fiancee’s heart and body would come so soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he looked at Zhou Weiqing, the Lion Prince’s eyes were filled with fire as he fixed his gaze. Since he had already seen him in Butler’s memories, he definitely would not be mistaken about his identity. Only now when he heard Shangguan Fei’er’s voice did he pay her attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, that Shangguan…” The Lion Prince’s thick voice was filled with suppressed rage and mania.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am Shangguan Fei’er.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lion Prince said coldly: “You ask me why I am here, what about you? If I did not guess wrongly, you are the one who should have intervened in the fight between our Empires. However, I do not have time to waste on you. Today, I am here for him, and it is a personal matter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s brow furrowed slightly. “Personal matter? I do not think I know you right?” He was rather curious inwardly. After all, with Shangguan Fei’er’s introductory words, how could he not understand the sheer power of this Lion Prince. All of a sudden, inspiration struck him, and his face changed. He suddenly thought of a possible reason why the Lion Prince would look for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do not recognize me, but you should recognize Tian’er right? I am Tian’er’s fiance.” Gu YingBing’s words were forced out through gritted teeth. He truly did love Tian’er. In terms of age, he was more than ten years older than Tian’er, and could be said to have watched her grow up. He had always been waiting for her, and their marriage was not just only totally a political one. Otherwise, once he had known about how she had lost her ‘virtue’, he could have refused the marriage and gotten other benefits from his teacher instead. However, he did not do that, instead persisting in wanting to marry Tian’er. It was not to ingratiate himself with Xue AoTian, but because he truly loved Tian’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, as he saw this man who had stolen Tian’er’s heart and body, how could he not be filled with hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, Zhou Weiqing totally understood his guess was right. He might not know why the Lion Prince knew about him or how he managed to find him, but he knew that there was totally no longer any room for manoeuvre in this matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Tian’er alright?” Facing his love rival with eyes spitting with fire, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but be filled with worry about Tian’er, and he subconsciously asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu YingBing said coldly: “What right do you have to ask anything about Tian’er? What do you think you are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s gaze turned cold. Both men stood there, staring at each other, like two raging bulls ready to fight for a mate. The scent of gunpowder between them grew stronger and stronger, as if a fight would erupt at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin TianAo subconsciously took a step closer to Zhou Weiqing. As he grew closer, he could naturally sense the sheer power and danger from Gu YingBing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I challenge you. If you are a man, stand out and fight.” As he said that, a powerful violent aura of Heavenly Energy burst forth from Gu YingBing, along with a brilliant golden-red light that enveloped his entire body, spreading outwards. Eight Icy Jade Physical Jewels denoting the Strength Attribute appearing flagrantly around his right wrist, as his hand pointed towards Zhou Weiqing, the ferocious light in his eyes as if wanting to tear him apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty, no!” Shangguan Fei’er said urgently. She could naturally hear that Zhou Weiqing and Gu YingBing were fighting because of a woman… in fact, she had met Tian’er before, but at this moment, she could no longer care about being jealous. She was very clear what power Gu YingBing held. After all, even her sister Shangguan Xue’er was not comparable to the Lion Prince Gu YingBing, let alone Zhou Weiqing. The Lion Prince Gu YingBing was no ordinary eight-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master indeed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing turned to look at Shangguan Fei’er, before saying in a serious tone. “This is not a challenge that I can back down from.” As he said that, he turned back to Gu YingBing and said solemnly: “Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis fight was because of Tian’er, a fight between men, and there was nothing else to be said about it. Only strength and power could solve the dispute between them, the enmity between them. Both sides held equally strong killing intent towards the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he knew that his power was no match for his opponent, Zhou Weiqing would not back down. Otherwise, he would no longer have any qualification to love Tian’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing was indeed afraid of dying, but in some scenarios, he would never back down. Hidden deep within the marrow of his bones, there was that hot blood and burning ardour of youth indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu YingBing waved back, and the two old men who were flanking him slowly stepped back, forming an empty space about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er was about to speak out more, but was stopped by Lin TianAo, who stepped back first. Although Shangguan Fei’er was totally unwilling, what could she do at this point? She could only scold Zhou Weiqing in her heart for being such a playboy, while trying to hide her worry inside. At the same time, she was fully prepared to intervene if the Lion Prince really tried to give Zhou Weiqing a killing blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the other four stepped away, only Zhou Weiqing and Gu YingBing were left facing each other. Neither of them backed away, their gazes locked in a ferocious, forceful glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a fight between love rivals, and there was no turning away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one who struck out first was Zhou Weiqing. His cultivation level was no match for his opponent, and he would not allow the Lion Prince to continue building up his aura to the maximum. If that happened, it would be easy for him to be taken down in a single blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a low howl, Zhou Weiqing charged forward like a speedy arrow. In mid air, he had already completed a series of actions, entering the Demonic Change State instantly. He knew that without the Demonic Change State, he would not even stand a tiny chance. At the same time, the Heavenly Skill Image of the Demonic Dragon Lady appeared above his head. The Dragon Silencing Seal was another critical key to his small chance of victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Zhou Weiqing moved, Gu YingBing had also reacted. With a loud shout, his hair of golden red hair billowed in the wind, a thick gold light gushing out of his body as he charged forward. He did not have any flourishes, just punching directly towards Zhou Weiqing’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-19-chapter-159-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-19-chapter-160-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-19-chapter-159-03","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
