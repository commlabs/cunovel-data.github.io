I\u0027ve been in New York three times and am\n\u003cbr\u003e not quite a baby. I can\u0027t believe that I am really going to see you--\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve been just THINKING you so long that it hardly seems as though\n\u003cbr\u003e you are a tangible flesh-and-blood person.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You are awfully good, Daddy, to bother yourself with me, when you\u0027re\n\u003cbr\u003e not strong. Take care and don\u0027t catch cold. These fall rains\n\u003cbr\u003e are very damp.\n\u003cbr\u003e Affectionately,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. I\u0027ve just had an awful thought. Have you a butler? I\u0027m afraid\n\u003cbr\u003e of butlers, and if one opens the door I shall faint upon the step. \n\u003cbr\u003e What can I say to him? You didn\u0027t tell me your name. Shall I ask\n\u003cbr\u003e for Mr. Smith?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thursday Morning\n\u003cbr\u003e My Very Dearest Master-Jervie-Daddy-Long-Legs Pendleton-Smith,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Did you sleep last night? I didn\u0027t. Not a single wink. I was\n\u003cbr\u003e too amazed and excited and bewildered and happy. I don\u0027t believe\n\u003cbr\u003e I ever shall sleep again--or eat either. But I hope you slept;\n\u003cbr\u003e you must, you know, because then you will get well faster and can\n\u003cbr\u003e come to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dear Man, I can\u0027t bear to think how ill you\u0027ve been--and all the\n\u003cbr\u003e time I never knew it. When the doctor came down yesterday to put\n\u003cbr\u003e me in the cab, he told me that for three days they gave you up. \n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, dearest, if that had happened, the light would have gone out\n\u003cbr\u003e of the world for me. I suppose that some day in the far future--\n\u003cbr\u003e one of us must leave the other; but at least we shall have had\n\u003cbr\u003e our happiness and there will be memories to live with.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I meant to cheer you up--and instead I have to cheer myself. \n\u003cbr\u003e For in spite of being happier than I ever dreamed I could be,\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m also soberer. The fear that something may happen rests like\n\u003cbr\u003e a shadow on my heart. Always before I could be frivolous and\n\u003cbr\u003e care-free and unconcerned, because I had nothing precious to lose. \n\u003cbr\u003e But now--I shall have a Great Big Worry all the rest of my life. \n\u003cbr\u003e Whenever you are away from me I shall be thinking of all the automobiles\n\u003cbr\u003e that can run over you, or the sign-boards that can fall on your head,\n\u003cbr\u003e or the dreadful, squirmy germs that you may be swallowing. My peace\n\u003cbr\u003e of mind is gone for ever--but anyway, I never cared much for just\n\u003cbr\u003e plain peace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Please get well--fast--fast--fast. I want to have you close\n\u003cbr\u003e by where I can touch you and make sure you are tangible. Such a\n\u003cbr\u003e little half hour we had together! I\u0027m afraid maybe I dreamed it. \n\u003cbr\u003e If I were only a member of your family (a very distant fourth cousin)\n\u003cbr\u003e then I could come and visit you every day, and read aloud and plump up\n\u003cbr\u003e your pillow and smooth out those two little wrinkles in your forehead\n\u003cbr\u003e and make the corners of your mouth turn up in a nice cheerful smile. \n\u003cbr\u003e But you are cheerful again, aren\u0027t you? You were yesterday before\n\u003cbr\u003e I left. The doctor said I must be a good nurse, that you looked\n\u003cbr\u003e ten years younger. I hope that being in love doesn\u0027t make every\n\u003cbr\u003e one ten years younger. Will you still care for me, darling, if I\n\u003cbr\u003e turn out to be only eleven?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yesterday was the most wonderful day that could ever happen. \n\u003cbr\u003e If I live to be ninety-nine I shall never forget the tiniest detail. \n\u003cbr\u003e The girl that left Lock Willow at dawn was a very different person from\n\u003cbr\u003e the one who came back at night. Mrs. Semple called me at half-past four. \n\u003cbr\u003e I started wide awake in the darkness and the first thought that\n\u003cbr\u003e popped into my head was, `I am going to see Daddy-Long-Legs!\u0027 I ate\n\u003cbr\u003e breakfast in the kitchen by candle-light, and then drove the five\n\u003cbr\u003e miles to the station through the most glorious October colouring. \n\u003cbr\u003e The sun came up on the way, and the swamp maples and dogwood glowed\n\u003cbr\u003e crimson and orange and the stone walls and cornfields sparkled\n\u003cbr\u003e with hoar frost; the air was keen and clear and full of promise. \n\u003cbr\u003e I knew something was going to happen. All the way in the train\n\u003cbr\u003e the rails kept singing, `You\u0027re going to see Daddy-Long-Legs.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e It made me feel secure. I had such faith in Daddy\u0027s ability to set\n\u003cbr\u003e things right. And I knew that somewhere another man--dearer than Daddy--\n\u003cbr\u003e was wanting to see me, and somehow I had a feeling that before the\n\u003cbr\u003e journey ended I should meet him, too. And you see!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When I came to the house on Madison Avenue it looked so big and brown\n\u003cbr\u003e and forbidding that I didn\u0027t dare go in, so I walked around the\n\u003cbr\u003e block to get up my courage. But I needn\u0027t have been a bit afraid;\n\u003cbr\u003e your butler is such a nice, fatherly old man that he made me\n\u003cbr\u003e feel at home at once. `Is this Miss Abbott?\u0027 he said to me,\n\u003cbr\u003e and I said, `Yes,\u0027 so I didn\u0027t have to ask for Mr. Smith after all. \n\u003cbr\u003e He told me to wait in the drawing-room. It was a very sombre,\n\u003cbr\u003e magnificent, man\u0027s sort of room. I sat down on the edge of a big\n\u003cbr\u003e upholstered chair and kept saying to myself:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `I\u0027m going to see Daddy-Long-Legs! I\u0027m going to see Daddy-Long-Legs!\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then presently the man came back and asked me please to step up\n\u003cbr\u003e to the library. I was so excited that really and truly my feet\n\u003cbr\u003e would hardly take me up. Outside the door he turned and whispered,\n\u003cbr\u003e `He\u0027s been very ill, Miss. This is the first day he\u0027s been\n\u003cbr\u003e allowed to sit up. You\u0027ll not stay long enough to excite him?\u0027 \n\u003cbr\u003e I knew from the way he said it that he loved you--an I think he\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e an old dear!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he knocked and said, `Miss Abbott,\u0027 and I went in and the door\n\u003cbr\u003e closed behind me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was so dim coming in from the brightly lighted hall that for a\n\u003cbr\u003e moment I could scarcely make out anything; then I saw a big easy\n\u003cbr\u003e chair before the fire and a shining tea table with a smaller chair\n\u003cbr\u003e beside it. And I realized that a man was sitting in the big chair\n\u003cbr\u003e propped up by pillows with a rug over his knees. Before I could\n\u003cbr\u003e stop him he rose--rather shakily--and steadied himself by the back\n\u003cbr\u003e of the chair and just looked at me without a word. And then--\n\u003cbr\u003e and then--I saw it was you! But even with that I didn\u0027t understand. \n\u003cbr\u003e I thought Daddy had had you come there to meet me or a surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then you laughed and held out your hand and said, `Dear little Judy,\n\u003cbr\u003e couldn\u0027t you guess that I was Daddy-Long-Legs?\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In an instant it flashed over me. Oh, but I have been stupid! \n\u003cbr\u003e A hundred little things might have told me, if I had had any wits. \n\u003cbr\u003e I wouldn\u0027t make a very good detective, would I, Daddy? Jervie? \n\u003cbr\u003e What must I call you? Just plain Jervie sounds disrespectful, and I\n\u003cbr\u003e can\u0027t be disrespectful to you!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a very sweet half hour before your doctor came and sent me away. \n\u003cbr\u003e I was so dazed when I got to the station that I almost took a train\n\u003cbr\u003e for St Louis. And you were pretty dazed, too. You forgot to give\n\u003cbr\u003e me any tea. But we\u0027re both very, very happy, aren\u0027t we? I drove\n\u003cbr\u003e back to Lock Willow in the dark but oh, how the stars were shining! \n\u003cbr\u003e And this morning I\u0027ve been out with Colin visiting all the places\n\u003cbr\u003e that you and I went to together, and remembering what you said and\n\u003cbr\u003e how you looked. The woods today are burnished bronze and the air\n\u003cbr\u003e is full of frost. It\u0027s CLIMBING weather. I wish you were here to\n\u003cbr\u003e climb the hills with me. I am missing you dreadfully, Jervie dear,\n\u003cbr\u003e but it\u0027s a happy kind of missing; we\u0027ll be together soon. We belong\n\u003cbr\u003e to each other now really and truly, no make-believe. Doesn\u0027t it\n\u003cbr\u003e seem queer for me to belong to someone at last? It seems very,\n\u003cbr\u003e very sweet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And I shall never let you be sorry for a single instant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yours, for ever and ever,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS.
