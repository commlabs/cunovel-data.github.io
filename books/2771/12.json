No senseless chatter for Mrs. Reynolds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the accident, trying to stand hasn\u0027t been easy. Being covered in a muumuu makes it that much harder. Especially when I have to extend my leg in front of me to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Reynolds waves her hands around as if her limbs can talk. \"Usually people bend their legs when they do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t bend my leg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who says?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and look straight at Mrs. Reynolds. Is she kidding? Obviously I\u0027m crippled. Okay, so not crippled. But I got hit by a car. I\u0027ll never be the same again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bend your leg when you walk. Don\u0027t know why you can\u0027t bend it when you stand, that\u0027s all,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally stand, then take a deep breath. I\u0027m itching to say something, but can\u0027t. Mrs. Reynolds is the first person in over a year that treats me as though nothing is wrong with me. It\u0027s refreshing and frustrating at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEVENTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom knocks on my door on Saturday night before she leaves for the annual Fall Festival. \"Are you sure you don\u0027t want to go, Caleb? It\u0027ll be fun.\" Yeah, right. \"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leah\u0027s coming, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow the hell did Mom manage that? Leah lives in her room as if she\u0027s a bear in perpetual hibernation. I think I\u0027ve seen her more in the halls at school than I have at home. \"I\u0027m gonna stay home and hang out,\" I say. There\u0027s no way I want to go to the fair and be one of the main attractions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom opens the door and peeks her head inside. \"Your father and I would like you to make an appearance. Dr. and Mrs. Tremont are going to be there. Your dad relies on his referrals. Put on one of the new outfits I bought and show off the clean-cut person you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t feel like dressing up in clothes that make me choke, and putting on another fake \"happy\" show. \"Is that what you really want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods. \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, I\u0027ll meet you there later,\" I say curtly. This bullshit is wearing me down fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Caleb. I appreciate it,\" she says, as if she\u0027s talking to a colleague.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho is this lady who I used to call Mom? I need to make her realize I\u0027m the same person as before. She can love the old Caleb Becker without trying to create a new and improved one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my parents and Leah leave, I head outside and make myself some chicken on the grill. I\u0027m gonna eat here in my comfortable, ripped jeans and t-shirt before I dress up like a banker and head to the fairgrounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sitting at the patio table when I hear a familiar voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I might find you out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to my ex-girlfriend. Kendra looks great, dressed in a tight, pink shirt and short, white skirt. No trace of conservativeness in her attire, that\u0027s for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to the fair?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe comes up real close to me and bends down. \"I went, but you weren\u0027t there,\" she says in a sexy whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you want me to be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, because I want you all to myself. You\u0027re a legend in Paradise. Everybody\u0027s clamoring for a glimpse of the mysterious and dangerous Caleb Becker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what they think, that I\u0027m dangerous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just reporting the rumor. You were in jail, you know. I heard a lot of things happened to you when you were there to make you change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do you think?\" I ask, confused by her motives for coming here. \"Do you think I\u0027m dangerous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\" She\u0027s looking straight at me, but I sense she\u0027s thinking about something else. \"Was it really as tough as they say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twirls her blond curls around her finger. \"Did you think about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just about every day,\" I admit. \"What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles. \"I missed you. But I couldn\u0027t handle what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t sweat it, Kend. That night was totally fucked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re telling me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her sideways. I\u0027ve been dying to know the answer to this question. \"Do you remember what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinks twice before answering. \"Not much. I was almost as plastered as you were and ran when the cops came. My dad is the mayor, you know. His daughter couldn\u0027t be caught in the middle of that whole messy scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t expect you\u0027d go to jail, Caleb. I just ... it freaked me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Freaked me out, too. But I\u0027m back now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy ego needs me to ask this next question. It\u0027s strange, but this discussion is our way of figuring out where each of us stand in this relationship. \"Have you been with anyone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anyone that matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell does that mean? I\u0027m not jealous. Okay, I am. But she\u0027s here with you now, a voice inside my head tells me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I missed her so much. Too much. I\u0027ve dreamt about kissing her again, those full lips on mine, rubbing against her until I think I\u0027ll die from the sheer pleasure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here,\" I say, moving my chair out so she can sit on my lap. My libido kicks into gear, ready for this immediately. \"It\u0027s been a long time, Kend, but I\u0027m game if you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe settles herself on my thighs and wraps her arms around my neck. I watch her lips with interest as she smiles at me. Wet, shiny lips from whatever she put on them before she came over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever made that glossy lip shit up is a genius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the curled ends of her golden hair between my fingers and twist them between my thumb and forefinger. Her hair feels different than I remember. It used to be softer. I always loved playing with it. \"You changed the color,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s lighter. Do you like it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat can I say, that it feels more like straw than silk? \"I need time to get used to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I should have kissed her by now, but I\u0027m hesitating. I\u0027ve kissed Kendra a thousand times before. She\u0027s an awesome kisser, and those lips are begging to be messed with. So what\u0027s my problem?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe feels the top of my buzz cut with her palm. \"I hope you\u0027ll grow out your hair. I can\u0027t grab onto it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So noncommittal, aren\u0027t you.\" She laughs, then says, \"I missed you, CB.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she missed me so much, why do I have this strange feeling she\u0027s holding something back? Shit, I\u0027ve got to stop playing mind games with myself and overanalyzing stuff. I know what\u0027ll make me stop thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand on the back of Kendra\u0027s head and guide her mouth toward mine. As my lips touch hers, the scent of cherries from the glossy stuff is overpowering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a bad way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips and tongue slide against hers, but all I can think about is that I hate cherries. I hate cherry pie, I hate cherries in my fruit cocktail or on top of a hot fudge sundae. I even hate Cherry Coke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendra moans while our mouths are still meshed. Her tongue is working overtime and she twists her body so she\u0027s straddling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my eyes while we\u0027re kissing. My gaze focuses on Maggie Armstrong\u0027s room. Now not only do I have cherry lips attached to mine, I\u0027m hoping Maggie Armstrong doesn\u0027t see me lip-locked and tongue-tied with Kendra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t even ask me why I care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull back and say, \"Let\u0027s go inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendra slides off my lap, and we hold hands as I lead her to my bedroom. I wipe off my lips with the back of my hand, hoping the cherry flavor will disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendra lies on my bed when we reach my room, not even hesitating or questioning why we\u0027re moving so fast after not being together for a year. \"It\u0027s just like old times,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept somehow it doesn\u0027t feel as exciting or daring as it used to. Maybe it\u0027s because we\u0027re older now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take my shirt off, then slip into bed next to her. She starts kissing my chest. \"Jeez, Caleb. Your pecs are huge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my forefinger I lightly wiggle her new, shiny bellybutton ring. \"I guess we both changed, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me investigate how much.\" She kisses her way down, past my chest and stops at the waistband of my jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she starts unbuttoning them, I put my hand over hers to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up at me, confused. I don\u0027t blame her. I\u0027m all screwed up in the head and need to take everything slower than before. I swear, a year ago I\u0027d be jumping her bones before we even reached my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, rub my hand over my hair, and take a deep breath. Fuck. I\u0027m screwing everything up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rests her head on my shoulder and places her arm across my stomach. It feels real good and I\u0027m glad she doesn\u0027t make me talk about it. Maybe she gets it, maybe she understands I can\u0027t verbalize my fucked-up thoughts. But then she starts getting restless after a few minutes and sits up. \"I should probably go back to the festival before my parents find out where I\u0027ve gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end she doesn\u0027t understand. Just like everyone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a flip of her hair over her shoulders, she slips her shoes back on and stands up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI convince myself things will get back to normal soon enough. I\u0027m back home, I have my girl again. Okay, I\u0027ll admit things are strange between us. Her hair is fake, her lips taste different, and her kisses are frantic instead of sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you talking to Samantha Hunter in the hall yesterday,\" she says, turning back and looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit up and lean against my headboard, still shirtless. \"Yeah, she wanted to know if I\u0027ll wrestle this year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendra blows out an annoyed breath. \"You don\u0027t think she\u0027s cute, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"She\u0027s all right, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because girls like that are totally manipulative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not lookin at other girls, Kend, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re worried about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good.\" The corners of her mouth turn up, but then she bites down on her lower lip. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re back, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we keep this thing between us a secret, Caleb? The kids at school are expecting a big show between you and me, and I don\u0027t want it to get weird. Besides, my dad is up for election in November and he\u0027s already forbidden me to have any contact with you. It\u0027ll be best if nobody knows about this right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer comments shouldn\u0027t surprise me, but they do. I just say, \"That\u0027s cool,\" because, well, what else can I say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing Kendra out to her car, I wonder what our lives would have been like if I hadn\u0027t been locked up. I wouldn\u0027t have to keep our relationship a damn secret, that\u0027s for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we\u0027re in the front yard, Kendra climbs into her car. Then she opens her purse and pulls out a tube of lip gloss. Twisting the rearview mirror, she carefully glides on more cherry gloss, essentially erasing away our power make-out session. When her lips are as glossy as when she came here, she drives off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking my head, I head back inside. I spot the picture of Kendra when I get to my room. Removing it from my headboard, I stare at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s hard keeping everything the same when the same things look and feel so different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEIGHTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m wearing a long print dress that touches the ground and a powder blue sweater over it. Mom bought me the dress because she knows how I feel about exposing any part of my left leg. Deep down I know she also hopes boys will see me as Maggie Armstrong and not as the girl who got hit by Caleb Becker. Guess what, it\u0027s not going to happen. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-12.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
