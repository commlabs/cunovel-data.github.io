I hope you\u0027re on a\n\u003cbr\u003e mountain peak (but not in Switzerland; somewhere nearer) looking at\n\u003cbr\u003e the snow and thinking about me. Please be thinking about me. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m quite lonely and I want to be thought about. Oh, Daddy, I wish\n\u003cbr\u003e I knew you! Then when we were unhappy we could cheer each other up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t think I can stand much more of Lock Willow. I\u0027m thinking\n\u003cbr\u003e of moving. Sallie is going to do settlement work in Boston\n\u003cbr\u003e next winter. Don\u0027t you think it would be nice for me to go with her,\n\u003cbr\u003e then we could have a studio together? I would write while she\n\u003cbr\u003e SETTLED and we could be together in the evenings. Evenings are\n\u003cbr\u003e very long when there\u0027s no one but the Semples and Carrie and Amasai\n\u003cbr\u003e to talk to. I know in advance that you won\u0027t like my studio idea. \n\u003cbr\u003e I can read your secretary\u0027s letter now:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Miss Jerusha Abbott.\n\u003cbr\u003e `DEAR MADAM,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Mr. Smith prefers that you remain at Lock Willow.\n\u003cbr\u003e `Yours truly,\n\u003cbr\u003e `ELMER H. GRIGGS.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I hate your secretary. I am certain that a man named Elmer H.\n\u003cbr\u003e Griggs must be horrid. But truly, Daddy, I think I shall have to go\n\u003cbr\u003e to Boston. I can\u0027t stay here. If something doesn\u0027t happen soon,\n\u003cbr\u003e I shall throw myself into the silo pit out of sheer desperation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mercy! but it\u0027s hot. All the grass is burnt up and the brooks are\n\u003cbr\u003e dry and the roads are dusty. It hasn\u0027t rained for weeks and weeks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This letter sounds as though I had hydrophobia, but I haven\u0027t. I\n\u003cbr\u003e just want some family.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Goodbye, my dearest Daddy.\n\u003cbr\u003e I wish I knew you.\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59790.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
