Billy\u0027s wheelchair couldn\u0027t maneuver the uneven ground separating it from the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob started pulling the first bike��the red one, which was destined for me��to pieces immediately. He opened up the passenger door of the Rabbit so I could sit on the seat instead of the ground. While he worked, Jacob chattered happily, needing only the lightest of nudges from me to keep the conversation rolling. He updated me on the progress of his sophomore year of school, running on about his classes and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis two best friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quil and Embry?\" I interrupted. \"Those are unusual names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob chuckled. \"Quil\u0027s is a hand-me-down, and I think Embry got named after a soap opera star. I can\u0027t say anything, though. They fight dirty if you start on their names��they\u0027ll tag team you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good friends.\" I raised one eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they are. Just don\u0027t mess with their names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then a call echoed in the distance. \"Jacob?\" someone shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that Billy?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Jacob ducked his head, and it looked like he was blushing under his brown skin. \"Speak of the devil,\" he mumbled, \"and the devil shall appear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake? Are you out here?\" The shouting voice was closer now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah!\" Jacob shouted back, and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe waited through the short silence until two tall, dark-skinned boys strolled around the corner into the shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne was slender, and almost as tall as Jacob. His black hair was chin-length and parted down the middle, one side tucked behind his left ear while the right side swung free. The shorter boy was more burly. His white T-shirt strained over his well-developed chest, and he seemed gleefully conscious of that fact. His hair was so short it was almost a buzz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth boys stopped short when they saw me. The thin boy glanced swiftly back and forth between Jacob and me, while the brawny boy kept his eyes on me, a slow smile spreading across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, guys,\" Jacob greeted them halfheartedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Jake,\" the short one said without looking away from me. I had to smile in response, his grin was so impish. When I did, he winked at me. \"Hi, there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quil, Embry��this is my friend, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuil and Embry, I still didn\u0027t know which was which, exchanged a loaded look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie\u0027s kid, right?\" the brawny boy asked me, holding out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" I confirmed, shaking hands with him. His grasp was firm; it looked like he was flexing his bicep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Quil Ateara,\" he announced grandly before releasing my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to meet you, Quil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Bella. I\u0027m Embry, Embry Call��you probably already figured that out, though.\" Embry smiled a shy smile and waved with one hand, which he then shoved in the pocket of his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Nice to meet you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what are you guys doing?\" Quil asked, still looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella and I are going to fix up these bikes,\" Jacob explained inaccurately. But bikes seemed to be the magic word. Both boys went to examine Jacob\u0027s project, drilling him with educated questions. Many of the words they used were unfamiliar to me, and I figured I\u0027d have to have a Y chromosome to really understand the excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were still immersed in talk of parts and pieces when I decided that I needed to head back home before Charlie showed up here. With a sigh, I slid out of the Rabbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob looked up, apologetic. \"We\u0027re boring you, aren\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw.\" And it wasn\u0027t a lie. I was enjoying myself��how strange. \"I just have to go cook dinner for Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh�� well, I\u0027ll finish taking these apart tonight and figure out what more we\u0027ll need to get started rebuilding them. When do you want to work on them again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could I come back tomorrow?\" Sundays were the bane of my existence. There was never enough homework to keep me busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuil nudged Embry\u0027s arm and they exchanged grins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob smiled in delight. \"That would be great!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you make a list, we can go shop for parts,\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s face fell a little. \"I\u0027m still not sure I should let you pay for everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"No way. I\u0027m bankrolling this party. You just have to supply the labor and expertise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbry rolled his eyes at Quil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t seem right,\" Jacob shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake, if I took these to a mechanic, how much would he charge me?\" I pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Okay, you\u0027re getting a deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to mention the riding lessons,\" I added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuil grinned widely at Embry and whispered something I didn\u0027t catch. Jacob\u0027s hand flashed out to smack the back of Quil\u0027s head. \"That\u0027s it, get out,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really, I have to go,\" I protested, heading for the door. \"I\u0027ll see you tomorrow, Jacob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I was out of sight, I heard Quil and Embry chorus, \"Wooooo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of a brief scuffle followed, interspersed with an \"ouch\" and a \"hey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If either of you set so much as one toe on my land tomorrow��\" I heard Jacob threaten. His voice was lost as I walked through the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggled quietly. The sound made my eyes widen in wonder. I was laughing, actually laughing, and there wasn\u0027t even anyone watching. I felt so weightless that I laughed again, just make the feeling last longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI beat Charlie home. When he walked in I was just taking the fried chicken out of the pan and laying it on a pile of paper towels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Dad.\" I flashed him a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock flitted across his face before he pulled his expression together. \"Hey, honey,\" he said, his voice uncertain. \"Did you have fun with Jacob?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started moving the food to the table. \"Yeah, I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s good.\" He was still cautious. \"What did you two do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was my turn to be cautious. \"I hung out in his garage and watched him work. Did you know he\u0027s rebuilding a Volkswagen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I think Billy mentioned that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interrogation had to stop when Charlie began chewing, but he continued to study my face as he ate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dinner, I dithered around, cleaning the kitchen twice, and then did my homework slowly in the front room while Charlie watched a hockey game. I waited as long as I could, but finally Charlie mentioned the late hour. When I didn\u0027t respond, he got up, stretched, and then left, turning out the light behind him. Reluctantly, I followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I climbed the stairs, I felt the last of the afternoon\u0027s abnormal sense of well-being drain from my system, replaced by a dull fear at the thought of what I was going to have to live through now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t numb anymore. Tonight would, no doubt, be as horrific as last night. I lay down on my bed and curled into a ball in preparation for the onslaught. I squeezed my eyes shut and�� the next thing I next I knew, it was morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the pale silver light coming through my window, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in more than four months, I\u0027d slept without dreaming. Dreaming or screaming. I couldn\u0027t tell which emotion was stronger��the relief or the shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay still in my bed for a few minutes, waiting for it to come back. Because something must be coming. If not the pain, then the numbness. I waited, but nothing happened. I felt more rested than I had in a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t trust this to last. It was a slippery, precarious edge that I balanced on, and it wouldn\u0027t take much to knock me back down. Just glancing around my room with these suddenly clear eyes��noticing how strange it looked, too tidy, like I didn\u0027t live here at all��was dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed that thought from my mind, and concentrated, as I got dressed, on the fact that I was going to see Jacob again today. The thought made me feel almost�� hopeful. Maybe it would be the same as yesterday. Maybe I wouldn\u0027t have to remind myself to look interested and to nod or smile at appropriate intervals, the way I had to with everyone else. Maybe�� but I wouldn\u0027t trust this to last, either. Wouldn\u0027t trust it to be the same��so easy��as yesterday. I wasn\u0027t going to set myself up for disappointment like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt breakfast, Charlie was being careful, too. He tried to hide his scrutiny, keeping his eyes on his eggs until he thought I wasn\u0027t looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you up to today?\" he asked, eyeing a loose thread on the edge of his cuff like he wasn\u0027t paying much attention to my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to hang out with Jacob again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded without looking up. \"Oh,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mind?\" I pretended to worry. \"I could stay��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up quickly, a hint of panic in his eyes. \"No, no! You go ahead. Harry was going to come up to watch the game with me anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Harry could give Billy a ride up,\" I suggested. The fewer witnesses the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a great idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure if the game was just an excuse for kicking me out, but he looked excited enough now. He headed to the phone while I donned my rain jacket. I felt self-conscious with the checkbook shoved in my jacket pocket. It was something I never used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the rain came down like water slopped from a bucket. I had to drive more slowly than I wanted to; I could hardly see a car length in front of the truck. But I finally made it through the muddy lanes to Jacob\u0027s house. Before I\u0027d killed the engine, the front door opened and Jacob came running out with a huge black umbrella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held it over my door while I opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie called��said you were on your way,\" Jacob explained with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEffortlessly, without a conscious command to the muscles around my lips, my answering smile spread across my face. A strange feeling of warmth bubbled up in my throat, despite the icy rain splattering on my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Jacob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good call on inviting Billy up.\" He held up his hand for a high five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to reach so high to slap his hand that he laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry showed up to get Billy just a few minutes later. Jacob took me on a brief tour of his tiny room while we waited to be unsupervised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where to, Mr. Goodwrench?\" I asked as soon as the door closed behind Billy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob pulled a folded paper out of his pocket and smoothed it out. \"We\u0027ll start at the dump first, see if we can get lucky. This could get a little expensive,\" he warned me. \"Those bikes are going to need a lot of help before they\u0027ll run again.\" My face didn\u0027t look worried enough, so he continued. \"I\u0027m talking about maybe more than a hundred dollars here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my checkbook out, fanned myself with it, and rolled my eyes at his worries. \"We\u0027re covered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a very strange kind of day. I enjoyed myself. Even at the dump, in the slopping rain and ankle-deep mud. I wondered at first if it was just the aftershock of losing the numbness, but I didn\u0027t think that was enough of an explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was beginning to think it was mostly Jacob. It wasn\u0027t just that he was always so happy to see me, or that he didn\u0027t watch me out of the corner of his eye, waiting for me to do something that would mark me as crazy or depressed. It was nothing that related to me at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Jacob himself. Jacob was simply a perpetually happy person, and he carried that happiness with him like an aura, sharing it with whoever was near him. Like an earthbound sun, whenever someone was within his gravitational pull, Jacob warmed them. It was natural, a part of who he was. No wonder I was so eager to see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven when he commented on the gaping hole in my dashboard, it didn\u0027t send me into a panic like it should have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did the stereo break?\" he wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poked around in the cavity. \"Who took it out? There\u0027s a lot of damage��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Maybe you shouldn\u0027t touch the motorcycles too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Jacob, we did get lucky at the dump. He was very excited about several grease-blackened pieces of twisted metal that he found; I was just impressed that he could tell what they were supposed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom there we went to the Checker Auto Parts down in Hoquiam. In my truck, it was more than a two hour drive south on the winding freeway, but the time passed easily with Jacob. He chattered about his friends and his school, and I found myself asking questions, not even pretending, truly curious to hear what he had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m doing all the talking,\" he complained after a long story about Quil and the trouble he\u0027d stirred up by asking out a senior\u0027s steady girlfriend. \"Why don\u0027t you take a turn? What\u0027s going on in Forks? It has to be more exciting than La Push.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong,\" I sighed. \"There\u0027s really nothing. Your friends are a lot more interesting than mine. I like your friends. Quil\u0027s funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"I think Quil likes you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"He\u0027s a little young for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s frown deepened. \"He\u0027s not that much younger than you. It\u0027s just a year and a few months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a feeling we weren\u0027t talking about Quil anymore. I kept my voice light, teasing. \"Sure, but, considering the difference in maturity between guys and girls, don\u0027t you have to count that in dog years? What does that make me, about twelve years older?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, rolling his eyes. \"Okay, but if you\u0027re going to get picky like that, you have to average in size, too. You\u0027re so small, I\u0027ll have to knock ten years off your total.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five foot four is perfectly average.\" I sniffed. \"It\u0027s not my fault you\u0027re a freak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe bantered like that till Hoquiam, still arguing over the correct formula to determine age��I lost two more years because I didn\u0027t know how to change a tire, but gained one back for being in charge of the bookkeeping at my house��until we were in Checker, and Jacob had to concentrate again. We found everything left on his list, and Jacob felt confident that he could make a lot of progress with our haul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we got back to La Push, I was twenty-three and he was thirty��he was definitely weighting skills in his favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t forgotten the reason for what I was doing. And, even though I was enjoying myself more than I\u0027d thought possible, there was no lessening of my original desire. I still wanted to cheat. It was senseless, and I really didn\u0027t care. I was going to be as reckless as I could possibly manage in Forks. I would not be the only keeper of an empty contract. Getting to spend time with Jacob was just a much bigger perk than I\u0027d expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly wasn\u0027t back yet, so we didn\u0027t have to be sneaky about unloading our day\u0027s spoils. As soon as we had everything laid out on the plastic floor next to Jacob\u0027s toolbox, he went right to work, still talking and laughing while his fingers combed expertly through the metal pieces in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s skill with his hands was fascinating. They looked too big for the delicate tasks they performed with ease and precision. While he worked, he seemed almost graceful. Unlike when he was on his feet; there, his height and big feet made him nearly as dangerous as I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuil and Embry did not show up, so maybe his threat yesterday had been taken seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day passed too quickly. It got dark outside the mouth of the garage before I was expecting it, and then we heard Billy calling for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped up to help Jacob put things away, hesitating because I wasn\u0027t sure what I should touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just leave it,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll work on it later tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t forget your schoolwork or anything,\" I said, feeling a little guilty. I didn\u0027t want him to get in trouble. That plan was just for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth our heads snapped up as Charlie\u0027s familiar voice wafted through the trees, sounding closer than the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot,\" I muttered. \"Coming!\" I yelled toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go.\" Jacob smiled, enjoying the cloak-and-dagger. He snapped the light off, and for a moment I was blind. Jacob grabbed my hand and towed me out of the garage and through the trees, his feet finding the familiar path easily. His hand was rough, and very warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the path, we were both tripping over our feet in the darkness. So we were also both laughing when the house came into view. The laughter did not go deep; it was light and superficial, but still nice. I was sure he wouldn\u0027t notice the faint hint of hysteria. I wasn\u0027t used to laughing, and it felt right and also very wrong at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie was standing under the little back porch, and Billy was sitting in the doorway behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Dad,\" we both said at the same time, and that started us laughing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie stared at me with wide eyes that flashed down to note Jacob\u0027s hand around mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy invited us for dinner,\" Charlie said to us in an absentminded tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My super secret recipe for spaghetti. Handed down for generations,\" Billy said gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob snorted. \"I don\u0027t think Ragu\u0027s actually been around that long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was crowded. Harry Clearwater was there, too, with his family��his wife, Sue, whom I knew vaguely from my childhood summers in Forks, and his two children. Leah was a senior like me, but a year older. She was beautiful in an exotic way��perfect copper skin, glistening black hair, eyelashes like feather dusters��and preoccupied. She was on Billy\u0027s phone when we got in, and she never let it go. Seth was fourteen; he hung on Jacob\u0027s every word with idolizing eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were too many of us for the kitchen table, so Charlie and Harry brought chairs out to the yard, and we ate spaghetti off plates on our laps in the dim light from Billy\u0027s open door. The men talked about the game, and Harry and Charlie made fishing plans. Sue teased her husband about his cholesterol and tried, unsuccessfully, to shame him into eating something green and leafy. Jacob talked mostly to me and Seth, who interrupted eagerly whenever Jacob seemed in danger of forgetting him. Charlie watched me, trying to be inconspicuous about it, with pleased but cautious eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was loud and sometimes confusing as everyone talked over everyone else, and the laughter from one joke interrupted the telling of another. I didn\u0027t have to speak often, but I smiled a lot, and only because I felt like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was Washington, though, and the inevitable rain eventually broke up the party; Billy\u0027s living room was much too small to provide an option for continuing the get-together. Harry had driven Charlie down, so we rode together in my truck on the way back home. He asked about my day, and I told mostly the truth��that I\u0027d gone with Jacob to look at parts and then watched him work in his garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you\u0027ll visit again anytime soon?\" he wondered, trying to be casual about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow after school,\" I admitted. \"I\u0027ll take homework, don\u0027t worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You be sure to do that,\" he ordered, trying to disguise his satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was nervous when we got to the house. I didn\u0027t want to go upstairs. The warmth of Jacob\u0027s presence was fading and, in its absence, the anxiety grew stronger. I was sure I wouldn\u0027t get away with two peaceful nights of sleep in a row.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo put bedtime off, I checked my e-mail; there was a new message from Renee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrote about her day, a new book club that rilled the time slot of the meditation classes she\u0027d just quit, her week subbing in the second grade, missing her kindergarteners. She wrote that Phil was enjoying his new coaching job, and that they were planning a second honeymoon trip to Disney World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I noticed that the whole thing read like a journal entry, rather than a letter to someone else. Remorse flooded through me, leaving an uncomfortable sting behind. Some daughter I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote back to her quickly, commenting on each part of her letter, volunteering information of my own��describing the spaghetti party at Billy\u0027s and how I felt watching Jacob build useful things out of small pieces of metal��awed and slightly envious. I made no reference to the change this letter would be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom the ones she\u0027d received in the last several months. I could barely remember what I\u0027d written to her even as recently as last week, but I was sure it wasn\u0027t very responsive. The more I thought about it, the guiltier I felt; I really must have worried her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed up extra late after that, finishing more homework than strictly necessary. But neither sleep deprivation nor the time spent with Jacob��being almost happy in a shallow kind of way��could keep the dream away for two nights in a row.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke shuddering, my scream muffled by the pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the dim morning light filtered through the fog outside my window, I lay still in bed and tried to shake off the dream. There had been a small difference last night, and I concentrated on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night I had not been alone in the woods. Sam Uley��the man who had pulled me from the forest floor that night I couldn\u0027t bear to think of consciously��was there. It was an odd, unexpected alteration. The man\u0027s dark eyes had been surprisingly unfriendly, filled with some secret he didn\u0027t seem inclined to share. I\u0027d stared at him as often as my frantic searching had allowed; it made me uncomfortable, under all the usual panic, to have him there. Maybe that was because, when I didn\u0027t look directly at him, his shape seemed to shiver and change in my peripheral vision. Yet he did nothing but stand and watch. Unlike the time when we had met in reality, he did not offer me his help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie stared at me during breakfast, and I tried to ignore him. I supposed I deserved it. I couldn\u0027t expect him not to worry. It would probably be weeks before he stopped watching for the return of the zombie, and I would just have to try to not let it bother me. After all, I would be watching for the return of the zombie, too. Two days was hardly long enough to call me cured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchool was the opposite. Now that I was paying attention, it was clear that no one was watching here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered the first day I\u0027d come to Forks High School��how desperately I\u0027d wished that I could turn gray, fade into the wet concrete of the sidewalk like an oversized chameleon. It seemed I was getting that wish answered, a year late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like I wasn\u0027t there. Even my teachers\u0027 eyes slid past my seat as if it were empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened all through the morning, hearing once again the voices of the people around me. I tried to catch up on what was going on, but the conversations were so disjointed that I gave up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica didn\u0027t look up when I sat down next to her in Calculus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Jess,\" I said with put-on nonchalance. \"How was the rest of your weekend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me with suspicious eyes. Could she still be angry? Or was she just too impatient to deal with a crazy person?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Super,\" she said, turning back to her book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure of speech cold shoulder seemed to have some literal truth to it. I could feel the warm air blowing from the floor vents, but I was still too cold. I took the jacket off the back of my chair and put it on again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fourth hour class got out late, and the lunch table I always sat at was full by the time I arrived. Mike was there, Jessica and Angela, Conner, Tyler, Eric and Lauren. Katie Marshall, the redheaded junior\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho lived around the corner from me, was sitting with Eric, and Austin Marks��older brother to the boy with the motorcycles��was next to her. I wondered how long they\u0027d been sitting here, unable to remember if this was the first day or something that was a regular habit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was beginning to get annoyed with myself. I might as well have been packed in Styrofoam peanuts through the last semester.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one looked up when I sat down next to Mike, even though the chair squealed stridently against the linoleum as I dragged it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to catch up with the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike and Conner were talking sports, so I gave up on that one at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Ben today?\" Lauren was asking Angela. I perked up, interested. I wondered if that meant Angela and Ben were still together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI barely recognized Lauren. She\u0027d cut off all her blond, corn-silk hair��now she had a pixie cut so short that the back was shaved like a boy. What an odd thing for her to do. I wished I knew the reason behind it. Did she get gum stuck in it? Did she sell it? Had all the people she was habitually nasty to caught her behind the gym and scalped her? I decided it wasn\u0027t fair for me to judge her now by my former opinion. For all I knew, she\u0027d turned into a nice person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben\u0027s got the stomach flu,\" Angela said in her quiet, calm voice. \"Hopefully it\u0027s just some twenty-four hour thing. He was really sick last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela had changed her hair, too. She\u0027d grown out her layers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you two do this weekend?\" Jessica asked, not sounding as if she cared about the answer. I\u0027d bet that this was just an opener so she could tell her own stories. I wondered if she would talk about Port Angeles with me sitting two seats away? Was I that invisible, that no one would feel uncomfortable discussing me while I was here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were going to have a picnic Saturday, actually, but�� we changed our minds,\" Angela said. There was an edge to her voice that caught my interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess, not so much. \"That\u0027s too bad,\" she said, about to launch into her story. But I wasn\u0027t the only one who was paying attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Lauren asked curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Angela said, seeming more hesitant than usual, though she was always reserved, \"we drove up north, almost to the hot springs��there\u0027s a good spot just about a mile up the trail. But, when we were halfway there�� we saw something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saw something? What?\" Lauren\u0027s pale eyebrows pulled together. Even Jess seemed to be listening now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Angela said. \"We think it was a bear. It was black, anyway, but it seemed�� too big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren snorted. \"Oh, not you, too!\" Her eyes turned mocking, and I decided I didn\u0027t need to give her the benefit of the doubt. Obviously her personality had not changed as much as her hair. \"Tyler tried to sell me that one last week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to see any bears that close to the resort,\" Jessica said, siding with Lauren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really,\" Angela protested in a low voice, looking down at the table. \"We did see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren snickered. Mike was still talking to Conner, not paying attention to the girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she\u0027s right,\" I threw in impatiently. \"We had a hiker in just Saturday who saw the bear, too, Angela. He said it was huge and black and just outside of town, didn\u0027t he, Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment of silence. Every pair of eyes at the table turned to stare at me in shock. The new girl, Katie, had her mouth hanging open like she\u0027d just witnessed an explosion. Nobody moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike?\" I muttered, mortified. \"Remember the guy with the bear story?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"S-sure,\" Mike stuttered after a second. I didn\u0027t know why he was looking at me so strangely. I talked to him at work, didn\u0027t I? Did I? I thought so��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike recovered. \"Yeah, there was a guy who said he saw a huge black bear right at the trailhead��bigger than a grizzly,\" he confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmph.\" Lauren turned to Jessica, her shoulders stiff, and changed the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear back from USC?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone else looked away, too, except for Mike and Angela. Angela smiled at me tentatively, and I hurried to return the smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what did you do this weekend, Bella?\" Mike asked, curious, but oddly wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone but Lauren looked back, waiting for my response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friday night, Jessica and I went to a movie in Port Angeles. And then I spent Saturday afternoon and most of Sunday down at La Push.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes flickered to Jessica and back to me. Jess looked irritated. I wondered if she didn\u0027t want anyone to know she\u0027d gone out with me, or whether she just wanted to be the one to tell the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What movie did you see?\" Mike asked, starting to smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead End��the one with the zombies.\" I grinned in encouragement. Maybe some of the damage I\u0027d done in these past zombie months was reparable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard that was scary. Did you think so?\" Mike was eager to continue the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella had to leave at the end, she was so freaked,\" Jessica inserted with a sly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, trying to look embarrassed. \"It was pretty scary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike didn\u0027t stop asking me questions till lunch was over. Gradually, the others were able to start up their own conversations again, though they still looked at me a lot. Angela talked mostly to Mike and me, and, when I got up to dump my tray, she followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" she said in a low voice when we were away from the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking up, sticking up for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me with concern, but not the offensive, maybe-she\u0027s-lost-it kind. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why I\u0027d picked Jessica over Angela��though I\u0027d always liked Angela more��for the girls\u0027 night movie. Angela was too perceptive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not completely,\" I admitted. \"But I\u0027m a little bit better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve missed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren and Jessica strolled by us then, and I heard Lauren whisper loudly, \"Oh, joy Bella\u0027s back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela rolled her eyes at them, and smiled at me in encouragement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed It was like I was starting all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s today\u0027s date?\" I wondered suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s January nineteenth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Angela asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a year ago yesterday that I had my first day here,\" I mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s changed much,\" Angela muttered, looking after Lauren and Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I agreed I was just thinking the same thing.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-2-new-moon-twilight-2/page-7.html","bookId":2024,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM"}
