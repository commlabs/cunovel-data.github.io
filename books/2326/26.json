It\u0027s enough to get a warrant issued and pull the son of a bitch off the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before he kills somebody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. What time was it when you got in the alley with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I met her at midnight, so-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Candy, you mean. The transsexual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. So it was probably half an hour after that by the time the assault took place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say twelve-thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roughly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then you went to a hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think it was necessary. He caused a lot of pain but I knew I didn\u0027t have any broken bones and I wasn\u0027t bleeding. I figured I\u0027d be better off going straight home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So there\u0027s no hospital record.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t go to a hospital, so how the hell could there be a hospital record?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess there couldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My cabdriver wanted to take me to a hospital,\" I said. \"I must have looked as though I belonged there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a shame you didn\u0027t listen to him. You see what I\u0027m getting at, don\u0027t you, Matt? If there was an emergency-room record, it would tend to confirm your story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to say to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about the cabdriver?\" he went on. \"I don\u0027t suppose you got his hack license number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or his name? Or the number of his cab?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It never occurred to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he could place you in the neighborhood and give evidence of your appearance and physical condition. As it is, all we\u0027ve got is your statement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt anger rising, and I made an effort to keep a lid on it. Evenly I said, \"Well, isn\u0027t that worth something? Here\u0027s a guy who went away for aggravated assault on a police officer. After sentencing he threatened that officer in open court. He served twelve years, during which time he committed other acts of violence. Now, a few months after his release, you\u0027ve got a sworn statement charging him with assault on that same police officer, and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a police officer now, Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t been a police officer for quite some time now.\" He lit a cigarette, shook the match out, went on shaking it after the flame had died. Without looking at me he said, \"What you are, you want to get technical about it, you\u0027re an ex-cop with no visible means of support.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what else are you? You\u0027re a sort of half-assed private detective, but you don\u0027t carry a license and you get paid off the books, so what do you think that looks like when you write it up?\" He sighed, shook his head. \"Late last night,\" he said. \"Was that the first time you saw Motley yesterday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the first time I saw him since his sentencing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t go over to his hotel earlier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What hotel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes or no, Matt. Did you or didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. I don\u0027t even know where he\u0027s staying. I\u0027ve been turning the city upside down looking for him. What\u0027s all this about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rooted through papers on his desk, found what he was looking for. \"This came through this morning,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Late yesterday afternoon a lawyer named Seymour Goodrich turned up at the Sixth Precinct on West Tenth. He was representing one James Leo Motley, and he had with him a recently obtained order of protection on behalf of his client against you, and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Against me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"- and he wanted a complaint on the record about your actions earlier that day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What actions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to Motley, you turned up at his lodgings at the Hotel Harding. You menaced him, threatened him, and laid hands on his physical person in a threatening and intimidating manner, et cetera et cetera et cetera.\" He let go of the paper and it floated down onto the cluttered desktop. \"You\u0027re saying it never happened. You never went to the Harding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I went there. It\u0027s a flop at the corner of Barrow and West, I knew it well years ago when I was attached to the Sixth. We used to call it the Hard-on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you did go there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, but not yesterday. I went there when I was knocking on doors down there. Saturday night, it must have been. I showed his picture to the desk clerk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And nothing. \u0027No, he don\u0027t look familiar, I never seen him before.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you never went back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward, crushed out his cigarette. He pushed his chair back and leaned all the way back and fixed his gaze on the ceiling. \"You can see how it looks,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose you tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guy comes in, swears out a complaint, he\u0027s got an order of protection, a lawyer, the whole bit. Says you shoved him around and got rough with him. Next day you came in looking like you fell down a flight of stairs and you\u0027re the one with a complaint this time, only it happened in the middle of the night somewhere in the asshole of Manhattan, Attorney Street for God\u0027s fucking sake, and there\u0027s no witnesses, no cabdriver, no hospital report, nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could check trip sheets. You might find the cabbie that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I could check trip sheets. I could put twenty men on it, a high-priority thing like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Going back twelve years, why\u0027d he sound off in the courtroom? \u0027I\u0027ll get you for this,\u0027 all that crap. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a psychopath. What does he need with a reason?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right, but what was the reason he thought he had?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was putting him in jail. That\u0027s as much of a reason as he needed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Putting him away for something he didn\u0027t do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sure,\" I said. \"They\u0027re all innocent, you know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, nobody guilty ever goes away. He said you framed him, right? He never fired a gun, he never owned a gun. A frame-up all the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to him, he was innocent of all charges. It\u0027s a funny stance to take when you\u0027re pleading guilty, but that\u0027s the way he told it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. Was it a frame?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wondered,\" Durkin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a damn good case. The guy fired three shots at a police officer who was trying to collar him. He should have drawn a lot more than one-to-ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" he said. \"I\u0027m just thinking about what it looks like now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe avoided my eyes. \"This Mardell,\" he said. \"She was a snitch, is that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was a source, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make a lot of cases with the stuff she gave you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was a good source.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. Cooperman a source, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hardly knew Connie, I only met her a few times. She was a friend of Elaine\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And any friend of Elaine\u0027s was a friend of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Matt. I\u0027m not enjoying this, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, probably not. Did you take money from them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to hear you say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cooperman and Mardell. Did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Joe. I wore a floppy purple hat, drove a pink Eldorado with leopard upholstery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to sit down. I thought you were a friend of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought so, too. I still think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were a good cop,\" he said. \"I know that. You made detective early on and you had some damn good collars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do, pull my file?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all in the computer, you just punch a few keys and it comes right up. I know about the letters of commendation you got. But you had a drinking problem, and maybe you got in over your head a little, and what good cop ever did everything by the book anyway, right?\" He sighed. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"So far all you can show me is a domestic homicide in another state and a woman who takes a dive out a window five blocks from here. You say he did \u0027em both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but nobody else heard him say it. Only you. Matt, maybe everything you\u0027re telling me is gospel, maybe he did those Venezuelans the other day, too. And maybe that was a hundred percent kosher bust twelve years ago; maybe you didn\u0027t sweeten it to make sure he got himself some jail time.\" He turned, and his eyes met mine. \"But don\u0027t swear out a complaint against him and ask me to try and get a warrant. And for Christ\u0027s sake don\u0027t go looking for him, because the next thing you know somebody\u0027ll be arresting you for violating an order of protection. You know how that works. You\u0027re not allowed to go near him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a great system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the law. You want to get into a pissing contest with him, now\u0027s the wrong time to do it. Because you\u0027d lose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started for the door, not trusting myself to speak. As I reached for it he said, \"You think I\u0027m not your friend. Well, you\u0027re wrong. I\u0027m your friend. Otherwise I wouldn\u0027t be saying all this shit to you. I\u0027d let you find it out on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not at the Harding,\" I told Elaine. \"He checked in the night before last and checked out the next day, right after I allegedly went over there and threatened him. I don\u0027t know that he ever actually occupied a room there. He registered under his own name, probably so he would have an address to use when his attorney applied for the order of protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You went there looking for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After I left Durkin. I don\u0027t know that you can really say I was looking for Motley at the Harding, because I knew I wouldn\u0027t find him there.\" I thought for a moment. \"I don\u0027t even know that I wanted to find him. I found him last night and I didn\u0027t come out of it too well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor baby,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were in her apartment, in the bedroom. I was stripped to my shorts and lying facedown on the bed. She had been giving me a massage, not working too deep, her hands gentle but insistent, working the muscles, taking some of the knots out, soothing some of the aches. She gave a lot of attention to my neck and shoulders, where much of the tension seemed to be centered. Her hands seemed to know just what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re really good,\" I said. \"What did you do, take a course?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean how did a nice girl like me get into this? No, I never studied. I\u0027ve been getting massages once or twice a week for years. I just paid attention to what people did to me. I\u0027d be better at it if I had more strength in my hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of Motley, and the strength in his hands. \"You\u0027re strong enough,\" I said. \"And you\u0027ve got a knack. You could do this professionally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to laugh. I asked her what was so funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"For God\u0027s sake don\u0027t tell anybody. If word gets out all my clients\u0027ll want this, and I\u0027ll never get laid anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater we were in the living room. I stood at the window with a cup of coffee, watching traffic on the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge. A couple of tugs sported on the river, maneuvering a barge around. She was on the couch, her feet tucked under her, eating a quartered orange. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-26.html","bookId":2326,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:56 AM"}
