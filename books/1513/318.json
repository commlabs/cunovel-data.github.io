The magic crystal on the table flew into her hands, leaving behind a flickering black afterimage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin merely looked at her with a vacant stare, as if what he had said was the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright then!” The female Magus elegantly raised her finger, on which her fingernail had been painted with the red sap of a daffodil, and kept the magic crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Celine! You can contact me in the future for more information regarding the Icy Jade Scorpion. This is my secret imprint!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe then passed her secret imprint, which looked like a purple daffodil, to Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin nodded and left the area, and right after that, a plump Magus walked up to Celine and began to chat with her earnestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leylin, my friend! Where are you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, Siegfried strolled up to where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You came at the right time. Do you know who that purple haired female Magus is?” Leylin pointed at the female Magus who occasionally covered her mouth and giggled while conversing animatedly with the plump Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh! That’s Celine, the inheritor of a small guild. Although the guild’s strength isn\u0027t much, she is a famous beauty of the eastern capital! However, she’s extremely crafty, and many Magi who have harboured designs on her have suffered. She’s not someone you’d want to provoke…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiegfried looked at Leylin before grinning. “Why? Are you interested in her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! We just had some dealings previously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter listening to Siegfried’s explanation, he was even more sure that Celine was not a simple woman. The grip he had on the box unconsciously tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath was paramount to his path as a Warlock, so he absolutely could not miss this chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems like I’ll have to play with this vixen for a while!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin smiled as he glanced at Celine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the eastern capital, within the villa that Leylin bought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Baelin’s silent farewell, only Leylin was left as the sole occupant of the grand villa. As Leylin had not bought any slaves, it felt rather empty in here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, Leylin had separately constructed a concealed tunnel in the underground cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the tunnel was a spacious underground lab, at the centre of which was a silver metal experimental desk with test-tubes lying on top of it. All of these things were items that Leylin had brought along with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What a strange item!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, Leylin used silver tweezers and held the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath as blue light shined in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the aid of the microscopic analysing abilities of the A.I. Chip, the surface on the icy shard continuously enlarged, finally revealing a strange rune with six sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChilliness churned and emanated from this strange rune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Beep! The analysis of the components of the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath is complete! Creating matrixes and images! Beginning simulation of the experiments on bloodline!]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, the A.I. Chip’s voice intoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s begin!” Leylin inhaled deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Authorisation received. Beginning the simulation of experiment on bloodline!] The A.I. Chip worked on the data. Leylin’s eyes blurred as he seemed to enter a different dimension. He could vaguely make out a translucent human figure with purple blood running through their veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Injecting the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath!] With the A.I. Chip’s voice, two thin metal needles pierced the humanoid figure at the shoulders, and images then showed a strange white liquid flowing into the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Huala!* Once the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath had entered the body, it frothed as if hot oil had met with icy water, creating a very strong reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe experimented-on body began to shake violently, and the numbers which represented the data of the figure changed wildly, almost turning into a blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Blood flow and pressure are increased, and burden on the body is multiplied by five!]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom time to time, the A.I. Chip would update and interpret the new figures for Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Begin the radiation of energy particles! Stabilise the vitality within!” Leylin ordered once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, black Dark elemental energy particles began to emanate from the experimental body, and under such radiation, the body slowly began to stabilise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the experimental body returned to its original state, and the purple blood in the body continued to flow, just like wine inside a glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main difference was that the blood had dulled a little and become darker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Warlock’s bloodline emotional stability experiment was successful! Estimated time for suppressing the core emotional waves: 345 days, 13 hours.] The A.I Chip gave an accurate analysis of the experiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If the dosage is increased, could it prevent any troubles in the future?” Leylin asked the A.I. Chip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Data is insufficient. Analysing the data’s probabilities...] The A.I. Chip once again went into a computing mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly after five hours had passed did the A.I. Chip come up with a reply. [Success rate is 67%. Requires more high-level Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As expected! This kind of Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath can really cure problems with Warlocks’ emotions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s eyes shone brightly with happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the ancient bloodline Warlocks had powerful physiques and magic capabilities, it was very difficult for them to advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this was not the main reason why the Warlock inheritance declined!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of their access to powerful ancient bloodlines, a Warlock would also inherit the intact genes—which were deeply imbued with tyrannical and terrifying emotions—of ancient predators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this, a Warlock’s personality was often irascible, and they were quick-tempered, which was a fatal flaw in the Magus world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how powerful one was, what was the point in having such power if one could not control their own spirit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, the calm and rational Magi could pass on their legacies. However, there were no traces of Warlocks on the south coast and Twilight Zone; perhaps only the central continent had some of the legacies left behind by Warlocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Icy Jade Scorpion!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin quickly sorted out all the information he had related to this organism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter being told the name of this crystal, Leylin began an intensive study on the characteristics, habitats, capabilities, etc. of this organism, and gathered all of the relevant data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Icy Jade Scorpion, a high energy organism that reaches the might of a rank 1 Magus in its adult stages. In search of fertile lands, they often reside in icy caves! Legend has it that they came from another world back in ancient times, and after entering the Twilight Zone, they underwent some evolutionary changes. Only the special radiation reflected from certain types of topaz are able to sustain their lives and reproduction capabilities. Their crystallised breath is known to have stimulating effects on certain high-grade meditation techniques.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a brief summary of all the information Leylin had gathered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe icy cave’s resources had already been monopolised by several guilds, and was in the process of being excavated. It would be extremely difficult for Leylin to enter on his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No matter what, I have to obtain the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath!” Flames of desire glinted in Leylin’s eyes, “Even if the heavens fall and the earth crumbles, I will not stop under any circumstances!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppressing a bloodline Warlock’s emotional instability proved to be extremely difficult, as even though there were so many ancient Magi, they could only discover ways to suppress it. If not for Leylin having the A.I. Chip and bloodline acting as a reminder, he definitely would not have been able to discover the use of the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath this easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin did not feel that he would chance upon such a lucky encounter again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, using the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath as a suppressant may not work for all Warlocks, and may not even work for others with the Giant Kemoyin Serpent’s bloodline. However, the A.I. Chip managed to find a resource that is able to work specifically for me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s face was extremely solemn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no remedies to treat the emotional instability of Warlocks. Also, due to the difference in bloodlines, each Warlock had a unique bodily attribute. Hence, Leylin himself was not sure whether the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath would be effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was very likely that the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath would aid Leylin, but not another Warlock with the Giant Kemoyin Serpent’s bloodline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, the unique characteristics of this resource made it especially effective for Leylin!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the rise and fall of other Warlocks was of no concern to Leylin! He only cared that the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath was useful to him, and that he needed more of it. It would be best if he could find another Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath of higher quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll have to plan for this! I need a calm and collected mind!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked at the icy shard between the tweezers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Through the experimentation on the A.I. Chip, I now know that although the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath can suppress my mental fluctuations and allow me to be sane for close to a year, there will also be some side effects. I have to concoct some potions to get rid of these side effects!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would not stump Leylin at all. After residing in Four Seasons Garden for such a long time, Leylin was no longer a Potion Master who had just advanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Four Seasons Garden was a large-scaled power that was formed of potion masters. They had various information on all sorts of potions, as well as ideas on concocting ancient potions, and these experiments were not too difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, Leylin had absorbed all of the information stored within the Four Seasons Garden like a sponge, all while practising his potioneering skills at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough various trades and experiments, Leylin estimated that his skills had far surpassed that of his mentor, Professor Kroft, after leaving the Four Seasons Garden, and had even reached the realm of a Potion Grandmaster!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Potions Grandmaster! Their success rate for brewing high-grade potions was around 30%, and they could even research and try brewing new types of potions on their own!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-317\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-319\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-318","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
