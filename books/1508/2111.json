This religion in actuality worships the glory of the ancient races from 10 billion years past. The gods of the Ancient God Religion include the Asura Road Master and the other powerhouses of the primal god race. After my efforts came to fruition, I launched the Ancient God Uprising.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I created a Holy Land and Divine Kingdom. The array formations here were all arranged by me, and these array formations originated from the inheritances that I obtained. I set up a system of punishments and rewards, using the numerous treasures and cultivation methods I obtained from the land of inheritance as the rewards. I tried my best to inspire my subordinates to try their best to obtain merits, and at the same time I used all methods at my disposal to prevent abyssal spies from infiltrating our ranks. The scale of the Ancient God Uprising has grown larger and larger, and the Demon Association can no longer turn a blind eye to us. Rather, they have even started to mobilize Elders to encircle us. I suspect that the Demon Association has used clues to slowly grasp information about me, and now with the Demon Association sending a surge of troops to Black Sand City, I suspect that soon there will even be a True Divinity level Elder that appears…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs Mo Eversnow finished speaking, Lin Ming was also worried.

To use glory and belief to stir up the hearts of the ancient race martial artists and then give them a boost with rewards.
