Once our breathing returned to normal and our heart rates slowed, I sat up and pushed her hair behind her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re amazing.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe softly stroked my face with her finger. “That was the best sex I’ve ever had in my life. I didn’t know I could feel certain things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I aim to please.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are fantastic in bed, Mr. Black. I have no words for what I felt. You sent me to places I’ve never been.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned in and kissed her one last time before we had to get dressed and head back to the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next month, Amelia and I spent as much time together as we could. Actually, we saw each other every single day. I spent the night most nights, but it was difficult with her bed being so small. She wouldn’t spend the night at the penthouse because of my parents. The whole respect issue kept coming up. I really needed to get my own place. It was family dinner night, so I picked up Amelia and we went to the penthouse. As we were having dinner, her phone rang. She excused herself and picked it up from the counter. She answered it and suddenly became excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” I asked as she hung up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My parents’ house in the Hamptons sold. The buyer paid cash and I’m meeting the realtor tomorrow to collect the money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up from my chair and hugged her. “That’s great news, baby. I’m so happy for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. It couldn’t have come at a better time. Now I can pay off my student loans and still have enough money to live on until I start getting paid for being a nurse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone congratulated her and we sat down to finish our dinner. As the women were cleaning up, I walked over to the bar and poured myself a scotch. My dad and Jake walked in shortly after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like me to pour you one?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No thanks, Collin,” Jake replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Do you have a second to talk?” my dad asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s up, Dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you’ve been itching to get a place of your own and, if you think it’s cool, I would like to buy you the apartment that’s for sale on the same floor as Julia and Jake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear my heart stopped. “Dad, are you serious?” I asked as I handed him his scotch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mom and I talked and we think it would be good for you to have a place of your own. You’ve exceeded my expectations at Black Enterprises and you’re doing extremely well. I’m really proud of you, son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad, I don’t know what to say. Thank you,” I said as I hugged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re welcome and now, with you gone, that means your mom and I can fuck all over this place as many times as we want without the worry of anyone coming home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried and covered my ears. “DAD!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled as he raised his eyebrow and gave me a smile. My mom, Julia, and Amelia walked in the room and my mom looked at me and smiled. I walked over and pulled her into a warm embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Mom. I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too, my sweet boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” Amelia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to her and placed my hands on her hips. “I’m getting a place of my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s wonderful! Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One floor down. By Julia and Jake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled as she pressed her lips against mine. “That’s so cool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I better get you home. It’s getting late.” I winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right. It is getting late.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Getting late? It’s only eight thirty,” my dad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a look and he then knew exactly what I meant. “Oh, you’re right; it is getting late. You better get going. I’ll contact the realtor tomorrow and we’ll go look at the apartment downstairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks again, Dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia and I said goodbye to everyone and I told my mom that I’d be back home tonight. She was happy about that because she wanted to make me breakfast in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe climbed into my Range Rover and I drove Amelia back to her apartment. As soon as we reached her door, she unlocked it, turned around, grabbed me by my shirt, and pulled me inside, smashing her lips against mine with force. My hands instantly gravitated to the bottom of her shirt as she broke our kiss and lifted up her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, I need to fuck you up against the wall,” I said as I looked around. “Shit, baby, there’s no open wall space.” I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promise you amazing wall sex the minute you move into your new place.” She smiled as she nipped my bottom lip and unbuttoned my pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m holding you to that promise.” I unhooked her bra and threw it on the floor. She pulled down my pants and took hold of my hard cock in her hand, stroking it up and down, sending me into oblivion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not just wall sex either,” she said between kisses. “Kitchen sex, counter sex, bathroom sex, floor sex. Just fucking sex all over the place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was it. I needed to be inside her immediately after all that sex talk. I ripped her panties from her and pushed her back on the bed. As I plunged two fingers inside her to make sure she was ready, she moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to take me from behind,” she said as she pushed my fingers out of her and rolled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, baby. I’m dying here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then get moving, Mr. Black. I want you now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed inside her and we both gasped. I moved in and out at a rapid pace, bringing both of us to orgasm at the same time. I pushed and pumped every last drop inside her and then collapsed on top of her, softly kissing her neck with the smallest kisses and holding her breasts in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re amazing, baby. Just fucking amazing. I love you,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too, Collin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled off of her and onto the other side of her small bed. As much as I loved being with her at her place, it was way too small for two people. We both lay there and I wrapped my arm around her. She placed her hand on me and began to stroke my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is so nice of your dad to buy you your own place. I’m so happy for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He has his motives.” I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As much as my mom and dad love having me at home, it’s cramping their sex life because I’m always catching them starting to do things in places other than their bedroom and I yell at them. Plus, my dad thinks I’m old enough and responsible to be on my own. Not to mention the fact that I’m always complaining about how small your place is.” I smiled. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-40.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
