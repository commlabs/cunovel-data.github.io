Apparently, they expected this kind of behavior from \"Lord\" Matrim Cauthon. Faile had a squad of fifty of the Band’s best, including Captain Mandevwin, Lieutenant Sandip and several Redarms who came highly recommended by Talmanes. None of them knew their true purpose in guarding the Horn of Valere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have brought ten times this number if she could. As it was, fifty was suspicious enough. Those fifty were the Band’s very best, some pulled from command positions. They would have to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re not going far, Faile thought, checking the next page of the ledgers. She had to look as if she were concerned about the supplies. Why am I so worried?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed only to carry the Horn to the Field of Merrilor, now that Cauthon had finally appeared. She’d already run three caravans from other locations using the same guards, so her current job wouldn’t be suspicious in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d chosen the Band very deliberately. In the eyes of most, they were just mercenaries, so the least important—and least trustworthy—troops in the army. However, for all of her complaints about Mat—she might not know him well, but the way Perrin spoke of him was enough—he did inspire loyalty in his men. The men who found their way to Cauthon were like him. They tried to hide from duty and preferred gambling and drinking to doing anything useful, but in a pinch they’d each fight like ten men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Merrilor, Cauthon would have good reason to check in on Mandevwin and his men. At that point, Faile could give him the Horn. Of course, she also had some members of Cha Faile with her as guards. She wanted some people she knew for certain she could trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, Laras—the stout mistress of the kitchens at Tar Valon—came out of the warehouse, wagging a finger at several of the serving girls. The woman walked to Faile, trailed by a lanky youth with a limp who was carrying a beat-up chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something for you, my Lady\". Laras gestured to the trunk. \"The Amyrlin herself added it to your shipment as an afterthought. Something about a friend of hers, from back home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s Matrim Cauthon’s tabac\", Faile said with a grimace. \"When he found that the Amyrlin had a store of Two Rivers leaf left, he insisted upon purchasing it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tabac, at a time like this\". Laras shook her head, wiping her fingers on her apron. \"I remember that boy. I’ve known a youth or two in my day like him, always skulking around the kitchens like a stray wanting scraps. Someone ought to find something useful for him to do\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We’re working on it\", Faile said as Laras’ servant placed the trunk in Faile’s own wagon. She winced as he let it thump down, then dusted off his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaras nodded, walking back into her warehouse. Faile rested her fingers on the chest. Philosophers claimed the Pattern did not have a sense of humor. The Pattern, and the Wheel, simply were, they did not care, they did not take sides. However, Faile could not help thinking that somewhere, the Creator was grinning at her. She had left home with her head full of arrogant dreams, a child thinking herself on a grand quest to find the Horn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife had knocked those out from under her, leaving her to haul herself back up. She had grown up, had started paying mind to what was really important. And now . . . now the Pattern, with almost casual indifference, dropped the Horn of Valere into her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe removed her hand and pointedly refusing to open the chest. She had the key, delivered to her separately, and she would check to see that the Horn was really in the chest. Not now. Not until she was alone and reasonably certain she was safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe climbed into the wagon and rested her feet on the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still don’t like it\", Mandevwin was saying beside the warehouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don’t like anything..\" Vanin said. \"Look, the work we’re doing is important. Soldiers have to eat\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose that is true\", Mandevwin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is!\" a new voice added. Harnan, another Redarm, joined them. Not one of the three, Faile noticed, jumped to help the servants load the caravan. \"Eating is wonderful\", Harnan said. \"And if there is an expert on the subject, Vanin, it is certainly you\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarnan was a sturdily built man with a wide face and a hawk tattooed on his cheek. Talmanes swore by the man, calling him a veteran survivor of both \"the Six-Story Slaughter\" and Hinderstap, whatever those were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, that wounds me, Harnan\", Vanin said from behind. \"That wounds me badly\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it\", Harnan said with a laugh. \"To wound you badly, an attack would first have to penetrate through fat to reach the muscle. I’m not sure Trolloc swords are long enough for that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandevwin laughed, and the three of them moved off. Faile went over the last few pages of the ledger, then began to climb down, to call for Setalle Anan. The woman had been acting as her assistant for these caravan runs. As she was climbing down, however, Faile noticed that not all three members of the Band had moved off. Only two of them had. Portly Vanin still stood back there. She saw him, and paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVanin immediately lumbered off toward some of the other soldiers. Had he been watching her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faile! Faile! Aravine says she has finished checking over the manifests for you. We can go, Faile\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver scrambled eagerly into the wagon seat. He had insisted on joining the caravan, and the members of the Band had persuaded her to allow it. Even Setalle had suggested it would be wise to bring him. Apparently, they worried that Olver would find his way to the fighting somehow if he wasn’t constantly under their watch. Faile had reluctantly set him to running errands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then\", Faile said, climbing back into the wagon. \"I suppose we can be off\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wagons lumbered into motion. She spent the entire trip out of the city trying not to look at the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to distract herself from thinking about it, but that only brought her mind to another pressing concern. Perrin. She had seen him only briefly during a supply run to Andor. He’d warned her he might have another duty, but had been reluctant to tell her about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he’d vanished. He’d made Tam steward in his place, had taken a gateway to Shayol Ghul and had vanished. She’d asked those who’d been there, but nobody had seen him since his conversation with Rand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll would be well with him, wouldn’t it? She was a soldier’s daughter and a soldier’s wife; she knew not to worry overly much. But a person could not help but worry a little. Perrin had been the one to suggest her a \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-193.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
