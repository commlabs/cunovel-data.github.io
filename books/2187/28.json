Standing with his hands clasped behind his back, the gnome presented an image of uncertainty and trepidation. Bruenor and Hralien, who had been sitting discussing their next moves when Nanfoodle and Regis had entered the dwarf\u0027s private quarters, looked at each other with confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well if ye can\u0027t get it translated, then so be it,\" Bruenor said, guessing at the source of the gnome\u0027s consternation. \"But ye\u0027re to keep working on it, don\u0027t ye doubt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle looked up, glanced at Regis, then bolstered by Regis\u0027s nod, turned back to the dwarf king and squared his shoulders. \"It is an ancient language, based on the Dwarvish tongue,\" he explained. \"It has roots in Hulgorkyn, perhaps, and Dethek runes for certain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought I\u0027d recognized a couple o\u0027 the scribbles,\" Bruenor replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Though it is more akin to the proper Orcish,\" Nanfoodle explained, and Bruenor gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dworcish?\" Regis remarked with a grin, but he was the only one who found any humor in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027re telling me that the durned orcs took part of me Delzoun ancestors\u0027 words?\" Bruenor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle shook his head. \"How this language came about is a mystery whose answer is beyond the parchments you brought to me. From what I can tell of the proportion of linguistic influence, you\u0027ve juxtaposed the source and add.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in the Nine Hells are ye babblin\u0027 about?\" Bruenor asked, his voice beginning to take on an impatient undercurrent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems more like old Dwarvish with added pieces from old Orcish,\" Regis explained, drawing Bruenor\u0027s scowl his way and taking it off of Nanfoodle, who seemed to be withering before the unhappy dwarf king with still the most important news forthcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they needed to talk to the dogs to tell them what\u0027s what,\" said Bruenor, but both Regis and Nanfoodle shook their heads with every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was deeper than that,\" Regis said, stepping up beside the gnome. \"The dwarves didn\u0027t borrow orc phrases, they integrated the language into their own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something that would have taken years, even decades, to come into being,\" said Nanfoodle. \"Such language blending is common throughout the history of all the races, but it occurs, every time, because of familiarity and cultural bonds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence came back at the pair, and Bruenor and Hralien looked to each other repeatedly. Finally, Bruenor found the courage to ask directly, \"What are ye saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwarves and orcs lived together, side-by-side, in the city you found,\" said Nanfoodle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor\u0027s eyes popped open wide, his strong hands slapped against the arms of his chair, and he came forward as if he meant to leap out and throttle both the gnome and the halfling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For years,\" Regis added as soon as Bruenor settled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf looked at Hralien, seeming near panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a town called Palishchuk in the wastes of Vaasa on the other side of Anauroch,\" the elf said with a shrug, as if the news was not as unexpected and impossible as it seemed. \"Half-orcs, one and all, and strong allies with the goodly races of the region.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half-orcs?\" Bruenor roared back at him. \"Half-orcs\u0027re half-humans, and that lot\u0027d take on a porcupine if the durned spines didn\u0027t hurt so much! But we\u0027re talkin\u0027 me kin here. Me ancestors!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHralien shrugged again, as if it wasn\u0027t so shocking, and Bruenor stopped sputtering long enough to catch the fact that the elf might be having a bit of fun with the revelation, at the dwarf\u0027s expense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know that these were your ancestors,\" Regis remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gauntlgrym\u0027s the home o\u0027 Delzoun!\" Bruenor snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This wasn\u0027t Gauntlgrym,\" said Nanfoodle, after clearing his throat. \"It wasn\u0027t,\" he reiterated when Bruenor\u0027s scowl fell over him fully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was it, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A town called Baffenburg,\" said Nanfoodle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never heared of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor had I,\" the gnome replied. \"It probably dates from around the time of Gauntlgrym, but it was surely not the city described in your histories. Not nearly that size, or with that kind of influence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That which we saw of it was probably the extent of the main town,\" Regis added. \"It wasn\u0027t Gauntlgrym.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor fell back in his seat, shaking his head and muttering under his breath. He wanted to argue, but had no facts with which to do so. As he considered things, he recognized that he\u0027d never had any evidence that the hole in the ground led to Gauntlgrym, that he had no maps that indicated the ancient Delzoun homeland to be anywhere near that region. All that had led him to believe that it was indeed Gauntlgrym was his own fervent desire, his faith that he had been returned to Mithral Hall by the graces of Moradin for that very purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle started to talk, but Bruenor silenced him and waved both him and Regis away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This does not mean that there is nothing of value...\" Regis started to say, but again, Bruenor waved his hand, dismissing them both - then dismissing Hralien with a gesture, as well, for at that terrible moment of revelation, with orcs attacking and Alustriel balking at decisive action, the crestfallen dwarf king wanted only to be alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still here, elf?\" Bruenor asked when he saw Hralien inside Mithral Hall the next morning. \"Seeing the beauty o\u0027 dwarf ways, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHralien shared the dwarf king\u0027s resigned chuckle. \"I am interested in watching the texts unmasked. And I would be re - \" He stopped and studied Bruenor for a moment then added, \"It is good to see you in such fine spirits this day. I had worried that the gnome\u0027s discovery from yesterday would cloak you in a dour humor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor waved a hand dismissively. \"He\u0027s just scratched the scribblings. Might be that some dwarves were stupid enough to trust the damned orcs. Might be that they paid for it with their city and their lives - and that might be a lesson for yer own folk and for Lady Alustriel and the rest of them that\u0027s hesitating in driving Obould back to his hole. Come with me, if ye\u0027re wantin\u0027, for I\u0027m on me way to the gnome now. He and Rumblebelly have worked the night through, on me orders. I\u0027m to take their news to Alustriel and her friends out working on the wall. Speak for the Moonwood in that discussion, elf, and let\u0027s be setting our plans together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHralien nodded and followed Bruenor through the winding tunnels and to the lower floors, and a small candlelit room where Regis and Nanfoodle were hard at work. Parchment had been spread over several tables, held in place by paperweights. The aroma of lavender permeated the room, a side-effect from Nanfoodle\u0027s preservation potions that had been carefully applied to each of the ancient writings, and to the tapestry, which had been hung on one wall. Most of its image remained obscured, but parts of it had been revealed. That vision made Bruenor cringe, for the orcs and dwarves visible in the drawing were not meeting in battle or even in parlay. They were together, intermingled, going about their daily business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis, who sat off to the side transcribing some text, greeted the pair as they entered, but Nanfoodle didn\u0027t even turn around, hunched as he was over a parchment, his face pressed close to the cracked and faded page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027re not looking so tired, Rumblebelly,\" Bruenor greeted accusingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m watching a lost world open before my eyes,\" he replied. \"I\u0027m sure that I will fall down soon enough, but not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor nodded. \"Then ye\u0027re saying that the night showed ye more o\u0027 the old town,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that we have broken the code of the language, the pace improves greatly,\" said Nanfoodle, never turning from the parchment he was studying. \"You retrieved some interesting texts on your journey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor stared at him for a few heartbeats, expecting him to elaborate, but soon realized that the gnome was fully engulfed by his work once more. The dwarf turned to Regis instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The town was mostly dwarves at first,\" Regis explained. He hopped up from his chair and moved to one of the many side tables, glanced at the parchment spread there, and moved along to the next in line. \"This one,\" he explained, \"talks about how the orcs were growing more numerous. They were coming in from all around, but most of the dwarven ties remained to places like Gauntlgrym, which was of course belowground and more appealing to a dwarf\u0027s sensibilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it was an unusual community?\" Hralien asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis shrugged, for he couldn\u0027t be certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor looked to Hralien and nodded smugly in apparent vindication, and certainly the elf and the halfling understood that Bruenor did not want his history intertwined with that of the foul orcs!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it was a lasting arrangement,\" Nanfoodle intervened, finally looking up from the parchment. \"Two centuries at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until the orcs betrayed me ancestors,\" Bruenor insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until something obliterated the town, melting the permafrost and dropping the whole of it underground in a sudden and singular catastrophe,\" Nanfoodle corrected. \"And not one of orc making. Look at the tapestry on the wall - it remained in place after the fall of Baffenburg, and certainly it would have been removed if that downfall had been precipitated by one side or the other. I don\u0027t believe that there were \u0027sides,\u0027 my king.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how\u0027re ye knowing that?\" Bruenor demanded. \"That scroll tellin\u0027 ye that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no indication of treachery on the part of the orcs - at least not near the end of the arrangement,\" the gnome explained, hopping down from his bench and moving to yet another parchment across from the table where Regis stood. \"And the tapestry...Early on, there were problems. A single orc chieftain held the orcs in place beside the dwarves. He was murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the dwarves?\" Hralien asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By his own,\" said Nanfoodle, moving to another parchment. \"And a time of unrest ensued.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seemin\u0027 to me that the whole time was a time of unrest,\" Bruenor said with a snort. \"Ye can\u0027t be living with damned orcs!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Off and on unrest, from what I can discern,\" Nanfoodle agreed. \"And it seemed to get better through the years, not worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until the orcs brought an end to it,\" Bruenor grumbled. \"Suddenly, and with orc treachery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not believe...\" Nanfoodle started to reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But ye\u0027re guessin\u0027, and not a thing more,\" said Bruenor. \"Ye just admitted that ye don\u0027t know what brought the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every indication - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah! But ye\u0027re guessing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle conceded the point with a bow. \"I would very much like to go to this city and build a workshop there, in the library. You have uncovered something fascinating, King Bru - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the time\u0027s for it,\" Bruenor interrupted. \"Right now I\u0027m seeing the call of them words. Get rid of Obould and the orcs\u0027ll fall apart, as we were expecting from the start. This is our battle call, gnome. This is why Moradin sent me back here and told me to go to that hole, Gauntlgrym or not!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s not...\" Nanfoodle started to argue, but his voice trailed away, for it was obvious that Bruenor paid him no heed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head bobbing with excitement and vigor, Bruenor had already turned to Hralien. He swatted the elf on the shoulder and swept Hralien up in his wake as he quick-stepped from the room, pausing only to berate Nanfoodle, \"And I\u0027m still thinking it\u0027s Gauntlgrym!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle looked helplessly at Regis. \"The possibilities....\" the gnome remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve all our own way of looking at the world, it would seem,\" Regis answered with a shrug that seemed almost embarrassed for Bruenor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this find not an example?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of what?\" asked Regis. \"We do not even know how it ended, or why it ended.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drizzt has whispered of the inevitability of Obould\u0027s kingdom,\" Nanfoodle reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Bruenor is determined that it will not be. The last time I looked, Bruenor, and not Drizzt, commanded the army of Mithral Hall and the respect of the surrounding kingdoms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A terrible war is about to befall us,\" said the gnome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One begun by King Obould Many-Arrows,\" the halfling replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanfoodle sighed and looked at the many parchment sheets spread around the room. It took all his willpower to resist the urge to rush from table to table and crumble them to dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name was Bowug Kr\u0027kri,\" Regis explained to Bruenor, presenting more of the deciphered text to the dwarf king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An orc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An orc philosopher and wizard,\" the halfling replied. \"We think the statues we saw in the library were of him, and maybe his disciples.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he\u0027s the one who brought the orcs into the dwarf city?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The two of ye do a lot o\u0027 thinking for so little answering,\" Bruenor growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have only a few old texts,\" Regis replied. \"It\u0027s all a riddle, still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guesses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speculation,\" said Regis. \"But we know that the orcs lived there with the dwarves, and that Bowug Kr\u0027kri was one of the leaders of the community.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any better guesses on how long that town lived? Ye said centuries, but I\u0027m not for believin\u0027 ye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis shrugged and shook his head. \"It had to be over generations. You saw the structures, and the language.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how many o\u0027 them structures were built by the dwarfs afore the orcs came in?\" Bruenor asked with a sly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis had no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might\u0027ve been a dwarf kingdom taken down by trusting the damned orcs,\" Bruenor said. \"Fool dwarfs who took much o\u0027 the orc tongue to try to be better neighbors to the treacherous dogs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t think - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye think too much,\" Bruenor interrupted. \"Yerself and the gnome\u0027re all excited about finding something so different than that which we\u0027re knowin\u0027 to be true. If ye\u0027re just finding more o\u0027 the same, then it\u0027s just more o\u0027 the same. But if ye\u0027re findin\u0027 something to make yer eyes go wide enough to fall out o\u0027 their holes, then that\u0027s something to dance about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t invent that library, or the statues inside it,\" Regis argued, but he was talking into as smug and sure an expression as he had ever seen. And he wasn\u0027t sure, of course, that Bruenor\u0027s reasoning was wrong, for indeed, he and Nanfoodle were doing a lot of guessing. The final puzzle picture was far from complete. They hadn\u0027t even yet assembled the borders of the maze, let alone filled in the interior details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHralien walked into the room then, answering a summons Bruenor had sent out for him earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s coming clear, elf,\" Bruenor greeted him. \"That town\u0027s a warning. If we\u0027re following Alustriel\u0027s plans, we\u0027re to wind up a dead and dust-covered artifact for a future dwarf king to discover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My own people are as guilty as is Alustriel in wanting to find a stable division, King Bruenor,\" Hralien admitted. \"The idea of crossing the Surbrin to do battle with Obould\u0027s thousands is daunting - it will not be attempted without great sorrow and great loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s to be found by sitting back?\" Bruenor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHralien, who had just lost a dozen friends in an orc assault on the Moonwood, and had just witnessed first-hand the attack on the dwarven wall, didn\u0027t need to use his imagination to guess the answer to that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t be fightin\u0027 them straight up,\" Bruenor reasoned. \"That\u0027s the way o\u0027 doom. Too many o\u0027 the stinking things.\" He paused and grinned, nodding his hairy head. \"Unless they\u0027re attacking us, and in bits and pieces. Like the group that went into the Moonwood and the one that come over me wall. If we were ready for them, then there\u0027d be a lot o\u0027 dead orcs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHralien gave a slight bow in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Drizzt was right,\" said Bruenor. \"It\u0027s all about the one on top. He tried to get rid of Obould, and almost did. That\u0027d\u0027ve been the answer, and still is.

He wasn\u0027t afraid of adventuring beside Bruenor and Drizzt, even if it would be behind orc lines. But he did fear that Bruenor was reading it all wrong, and that their mission would turn out badly, for them perhaps, and for the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gathering fell quiet when Banak Brawnanvil looked Bruenor in the eye and declared, \"Ye\u0027re bats!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor, however, didn\u0027t blink. \"Obould\u0027s the one,\" he said evenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not doubtin\u0027 that,\" replied the irrepressible Banak, who seemed to tower over Bruenor at that moment despite the fact that he was confined to a sitting position because of his injury in the orc war. \"So send Pwent and yer boys to go and get him, like ye\u0027re wantin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me own job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only because ye\u0027re a thick-headed Battlehammer!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few gasps filtered about the room at that proclamation, but they were diffused by a couple of chortles, most notably from the priest Cordio. Bruenor turned on Cordio with a scowl, but it fast melted against the reality of Banak\u0027s words. Truer words regarding the density of Bruenor\u0027s skull, Cordio - and Bruenor - knew, had never been spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was meself that went to Gauntlgrym,\" Bruenor said. He snapped his head to Regis\u0027s direction, as if expecting the halfling to argue that it wasn\u0027t Gauntlgrym. Regis, though, wisely stayed silent. \"Was meself that anchored the retreat from Keeper\u0027s Dale. Was meself that battled Obould\u0027s first attack in the north.\" He was gaining speed and momentum, not to bang drums for meself, as the dwarven saying went, but to justify his decision that he would personally lead the mission. \"Was meself that went to Calimport to bring back Rumblebelly. Was meself that cut the damned Baenre in half!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I drunk enough toasts to ye to appreciate the effort,\" said Banak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now I\u0027m seeing one more task afore me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The King o\u0027 Mithral Hall\u0027s plannin\u0027 to march off behind an orc army and kill the orc king,\" Banak remarked. \"And if ye\u0027re caught on the way?

Ye\u0027re not for changing yer ways with orcs for meself any more than ye would for any of our boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanak started to respond, but really had no answer for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, besides,\" Bruenor added, \"once I\u0027m walking out that gate, I\u0027m not the king o\u0027 Mithral Hall, which is the whole point in us being here, now ain\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be yer steward, but no king is Banak,\" the crippled Brawnanvil argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027ll be me steward, but if I\u0027m not returning then yerself is the Ninth King o\u0027 Mithral Hall and don\u0027t ye be doubting it.

Nothing seemed to excite that group quite so much as the prospect of one of their own walking off on an apparent suicide mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Begging yer pardon, King Bruenor,\" Torgar Hammerstriker said from the other side of the room. \"But me thinking is that the Mirabar boys should be represented on yer team, and me thinking\u0027s that meself and Shingles here\" - he reached to the side and pulled forward the scarred old warrior, Shingles McRuff - \"be just the two to do Mirabar proud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he finished, the other five Mirabarran dwarves in the room exploded into cheers for their mighty leader and the legendary Shingles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make it seven, then,\" Cordio Muffinhead added. \"For ye can\u0027t be goin\u0027 on a march for Moradin without a priest o\u0027 Moradin, and I\u0027m that priest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight, then,\" Bruenor corrected, \"for I\u0027m thinking that Hralien o\u0027 the Moonwood won\u0027t be leaving us after we find Drizzt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight for the road and eight for Obould!\" came the cheer, and it grew louder as it was repeated a second then a third time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it ended abruptly, as a scowling Catti-brie came in through the door, staring hard at Bruenor with a look that had even the doubting Banak Brawnanvil looking at the dwarf king with sympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go and do what needs doin\u0027,\" Bruenor instructed them all, his voice suddenly shaky, and as the others scattered through every door in the room, Catti-brie limped toward her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re going for Obould\u0027s head, and you\u0027re to lead it?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor nodded. \"It\u0027s me destiny, girl.
