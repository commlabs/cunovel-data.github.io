Duncan wasn\u0027t going to make her lose her temper now, no matter how much he grinned over her aches and pains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared into his eyes, determined not to flinch this time. He was looking at her intently, as if he thought he might find an answer to some unsolved puzzle that was bothering him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze slowly lowered, until he was staring at her mouth, and she wondered over that until she realized she was staring at his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed, yet didn\u0027t know why. \"Gilard is wrong. I\u0027m not simpleminded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin, damn his black soul, widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may let go of me now.\" She gave him what she hoped was a haughty look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll fall on your face if I do,\" Duncan announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And would that give you pleasure?\" she asked, trying her best to keep her voice as whisper-soft as his had been when he made the disgraceful comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan shrugged and suddenly let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, he was a horrible man all right. He knew exactly what was going to happen. Madelyne would have fallen on her backside if she hadn\u0027t grabbed hold of his arm. Her legs could not seem to remember what their duty was. \"I\u0027m not accustomed to riding for such long hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t think she was accustomed to riding at all. Lord, she confused him. Without a doubt Lady Madelyne was the most perplexing woman he\u0027d ever encountered. She was graceful when she walked, but could be incredibly clumsy too. She\u0027d bumped her head against his chin so many times, he thought the top of her head must surely be bruised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne didn\u0027t have any idea what he was thinking. But he was smiling at her and that was a worry. She was finally able to let go of him. She turned her back on him then and slowly made her way into the forest to find privacy. She knew she was moving like an old woman and prayed Duncan wasn\u0027t watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she returned from the dense, wooded area, she circled the men, determined to work the aches and cramps out of her legs before she was forced back on Silenus again. She stopped when she reached the far corner of the triangular area, and stared down at the valley they\u0027d just climbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan didn\u0027t seem to be in any particular hurry to set out again. That didn\u0027t make sense to Madelyne, for she remembered how irritated he\u0027d been when Gilard demanded they stop. Now he acted as though they had all the time in the world. Madelyne shook her head. Duncan of Wexton was the most confusing man she\u0027d ever met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to be thankful for this respite. She needed a few more minutes alone to clear her mind of her worries; a few precious minutes of peaceful solitude to get her emotions under control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day was nearly gone, for the sun was setting now. Glorious streaks of bright orange and faded red lined the sky, arching downward, giving her the impression that they touched the ground in some distant spot. There was such beauty in the starkness of coming winter; each season held its own special treasures. Madelyne tried to ignore the noise behind her and concentrate on the beauty below, when her attention was caught by a spark of light that suddenly appeared through the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blink of light disappeared a second later. Curious, she moved to the right, until she captured the light again. Odd, but the spark seemed to come from another direction farther down the valley now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights suddenly multiplied, until it appeared as if a hundred candles had all been lit at the same instant. They flickered and blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distance was great but the sun acted like a mirror, bringing the sparks closer and closer. Like fire, she thoughtâ€¦ or metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe understood then. Only men wearing armor could account for such reflections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there were hundreds of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eare us bold as a lion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eold testament, proverbs, 28:1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God, they were going to be attacked. Madelyne was too stunned to move. She started to tremble with fear. That infuriated her, losing her control so quickly. Madelyne threw back her shoulders, determined to think logically. She took a deep, calming breath. There, she told herself, now I can decide what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, how she wished she had courage. Her hands had begun to cramp and she realized she was gripping the folds of her cloak with such force, her fingers ached from the pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne shook her head, praying for divine help in making up her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt certainly wasn\u0027t her duty as a captive to alert Duncan to the approaching threat. She could keep silent, and as soon as the battle began, make her own escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat possibility was soon discarded when she realized there\u0027d be more killing. If she told Duncan, perhaps they could hurry to leave this place. Aye, they could gain distance if they left immediately, and the battle would be denied. Wasn\u0027t saving lives more important than her own escape plans?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne made up her mind to intercede. She picked up the hem of her gown and ran in search of her captor. She thought it was ironic that she would be the one to give the warning of the coming attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan was standing in a circle of soldiers, Gilard right beside him. Madelyne edged around the men and stopped when she was behind Duncan\u0027s back. \"Baron, I would have a word with you,\" Madelyne interrupted. Her voice cracked with tension and held little volume. Surely that was the reason he ignored her petition. He just hadn\u0027t heard her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must speak to you.\" Madelyne repeated her request in a much louder voice. She then dared to nudge his shoulder once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan continued to ignore her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne nudged him again, harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan increased his voice as he continued to speak to his men on some subject Madelyne knew had to be paltry in comparison to what she was trying to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord, he was stubborn. Madelyne wrung her hands together, growing more alarmed by the second, sick with worry that the soldiers climbing the hills would be upon them any moment now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frustration of waiting for him to acknowledge her suddenly became too much to bear. Anger took control. Utilizing every ounce of strength she possessed, she kicked him quite thoroughly. Her aim was the back of his right knee, her mark most accurate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne realized the foolishness of her rash action when excruciating pain shot up her leg. Her toes were surely broken from the impact, and the only consolation for her self-inflicted pain was the fact that she did get his attention. Rather swiftly too. Duncan turned to her with the speed of a wolf ready to pounce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked more astonished than furious. His hands were on his hips, fisted, she couldn\u0027t help but notice. Madelyne, grimacing from the pain in her toes, now found it just as painful to look directly up at his face. She turned to stare at Gilard instead, and that did ease her discomfort, for the younger brother had the most ridiculous expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like a word with you in private,\" Madelyne stated when she was finally able to look at Duncan again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan was curious over the worry he\u0027d heard in her voice. He nodded, took hold of her arm, and dragged her over to the other side of the camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne tripped twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed once, long and drawn out it was, and she knew it was all for her benefit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne didn\u0027t care if he tried to make her feel as unimportant as a splinter under his skin. He certainly wouldn\u0027t think her interruption was a nuisance when she explained. Why, he might even be appreciative, though in her heart she doubted he was capable of that reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore important, killing would be averted. That thought gave her courage to look him right in the eye. \"There are men coming from the valley,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe expected an immediate reaction to her statement. Yet Duncan just stared at her. He didn\u0027t show her any reaction at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was forced to repeat her words. \"Soldiers are coming up the hills. I could see the sun reflected from their shields. Think you should do something about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it going to be an eternity before action was taken? Madelyne considered that possibility while she waited for Duncan to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring at her in the most disturbing way, his hard, angular face clearly showing his puzzlement. She thought she saw cynicism there as well, in those chilling gray eyes. Madelyne decided then that he was trying to decide if she was telling him the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have never spoken a falsehood in my life, Baron. If you\u0027ll follow me, I\u0027ll show you that I speak the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan watched the lovely woman standing so proudly before him. Wide blue eyes looked up at him with such trust. Tendrils of auburn-colored hair floated across her cheeks. There was a smudge of dirt on the side of her nose, drawing his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you give me this warning?\" Duncan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? So that we could get away from here,\" Madelyne answered. She frowned over his bizarre question. \"I don\u0027t want any more killings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan nodded, content with her answer. He motioned to Gilard. His younger brother had been standing off to the side, trying to hear what was being said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady Madelyne has only just realized we\u0027re being followed,\" Duncan remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard showed his surprise. He hadn\u0027t realized they were being followed. He turned to look at Madelyne. \"We\u0027re being followed? How long have you known, Duncan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since midday,\" Duncan answered with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They be outcasts?\" Gilard inquired. His voice was mild now in an attempt to imitate his brother\u0027s nonchalant attitude. Inside, Gilard was irritated over Duncan\u0027s silence throughout the afternoon. Yet he was puzzled, too, wondering why Madelyne had given them warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They aren\u0027t outcasts, Gilard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long, silent moment stretched between the two brothers before a look of comprehension came over Gilard\u0027s face. \"Does the rat chase after the wolf?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God willing, he\u0027ll be leading his men this time,\" Duncan answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard smiled. Duncan nodded. \"I\u0027d thought to meet them nearer to home, at Creek Crossing, but the hills below us give much the same advantage. Tell the men to prepare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard turned and hurried across the clearing, shouting the order to mount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne was too appalled to speak. Her plan to give warning so that a battle could be averted evaporated when Gilard\u0027s laughter reached her. She hadn\u0027t understood what the brothers\u0027 exchanges meant though. They spoke in riddles, talking about rats and wolves, making no sense at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I was correct,\" Madelyne blurted out. \"You\u0027re really no different than Louddon, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan ignored her angry outburst. \"Mount my horse, Madelyne. We\u0027ll meet your brother together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne was too infuriated to argue. She told herself she should have realized Duncan wouldn\u0027t turn his back on a fight. Hadn\u0027t she learned that lesson when she\u0027d tried to persuade him into leaving Louddon\u0027s land?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she realized what she\u0027d done, she found herself settled on Silenus\u0027s back. Her anger had made her forget all about her fear. She couldn\u0027t even remember from which side she\u0027d mounted the horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan walked over, grabbed hold of the reins, and began to lead the animal across the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne held on to the saddle for dear life, her shoulders bent to the task. The stirrups were too long for her feet to catch, and her backside was being slapped with each step the animal took. She knew she looked pitifully untrained and was thankful Duncan wasn\u0027t watching her. \"By what name do you call this horse?\" Madelyne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Horse,\" Duncan called over his shoulder. \"The animal is a horse and that is what I call him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just as I suspected. You\u0027re so cold and heartless, you couldn\u0027t even take the time to name your loyal steed. I have given him a name. Silenus. What think you of that?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan refused to answer. He should have been irritated that Madelyne had the gall to name his stallion, but his thoughts had already turned to the battle ahead of them. He wouldn\u0027t allow himself to be bothered by such insignificant talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne smiled to herself, feeling pleased with the way she\u0027d just goaded him. Then Ansel appeared at her side with another horse, a flecked gray mount that looked much more docile than Silenus. Duncan turned, threw the reins to Madelyne, and mounted the back of the gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile froze on Madelyne\u0027s face. She caught the reins, overwhelmed when it dawned on her that he expected her to direct the animal. The stallion must have caught her worry, for he immediately began to dance to the side. His heavy hooves stomped the ground with enough force to unseat Madelyne. She was sorry now she had done such a good job of pretending to be skilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard appeared on Madelyne\u0027s other side, riding a brown steed. He forced his mount close to the stallion, effectively blocking the animal\u0027s skittish sidestep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They still be some distance away,\" Gilard remarked to his brother over the top of Madelyne\u0027s head. \"Do we wait for them, brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Duncan answered. \"We\u0027ll meet them halfway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers were lining up behind the threesome, making a terrible commotion. Madelyne thought Duncan waited until the sound diminished before giving the signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stay here until you return,\" Madelyne told Duncan. Her voice sounded desperate. Duncan glanced over at her, shook his head, and then turned back to look down into the valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to stay here,\" Madelyne announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are not.\" He didn\u0027t even bother to look at her when he made the harsh denial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could tie me to a tree,\" Madelyne suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Lady Madelyne, you wouldn\u0027t want to deny Louddon the sight of your lovely face, now, would you?\" Gilard asked the question with a smile on his face. \"I promise it will be the last he sees before he dies,\" the brother added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll both enjoy this battle, won\u0027t you?\" Madelyne asked. She was so appalled, her voice shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Tis a fact I will enjoy it,\" Gilard answered with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you are as crazed as your brother, Gilard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know we\u0027ve good reason to want your brother dead,\" Gilard announced. The smile slowly left his face. \"Just as you must surely want us dead.\" He mocked her with his statement, a deliberate sneer in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne turned to Duncan to see how he was reacting to his brother\u0027s remark, but the baron didn\u0027t seem to be paying any attention to their conversation. She turned back to Gilard then. \"I understand why you want to kill Louddon. I don\u0027t want you or your brother to die in this confrontation, Gilard,\" she added. \"Why would you think that I would?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilard frowned in confusion. \"What kind of fool do you take me for, Lady Madelyne? Do you try to tell me you won\u0027t take Louddon\u0027s side. Louddon is your brother.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-9.html","bookId":1841,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
