Not because I hate my reflection or that I suffer from Eisoptrophobia. Mirrors see straight through my fa√ßade. They know who I used to be; a loud spoken, reckless girl, who showed what she felt to the world. There were no secrets with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now secrets define me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a reflection revealed what was on the outside, I\u0027d be okay. My long auburn hair goes well with my pale complexion. My legs are extensively long and with heels, I\u0027m taller than most of the guys I know. But I\u0027m comfortable with it. It\u0027s what\u0027s buried deep inside that frightens me because it\u0027s broken, like a shattered mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tape one of my old sketches over the mirror on the dorm wall. It\u0027s almost completely concealed by drawings and obscures all of my reflection except for my green eyes, which are frosted with infinite pain and secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my hair into a messy bun and place my charcoaled pencils into a box on my bed, packing them with my other art supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila skips into the room with a cheery smile on her face and a drink in her hand. \"Oh my God! Oh my God! I\u0027m so glad it\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up a roll of packing tape off the dresser. \"Oh my God! Oh my god!\" I joke. \"What are you drinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tips the cup at me and winks. \"Juice, silly. I\u0027m just really excited to be getting a break. Even if it does mean I have to go home.\" She tucks strands of her hair behind her ear and tosses a makeup bag into her purse. \"Have you seen my perfume?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point at the boxes on her bed. \"I think you packed them in one of those. Not sure which one, though, since you didn\u0027t label them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulls a face at me. \"Not all of us can be neat freaks. Honestly, Ella, sometimes I think you have OCD.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI write \"Art Supplies\" neatly on the box and click the cap back on the sharpie. \"I think you might be on to me,\" I joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dang it.\" She smells herself. \"I really need it. All this heat is making me sweat.\" She rips some photos off her dresser mirror and throws them into an open box. \"I swear it\u0027s like a hundred and ten outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s actually hotter than that.\" I set my school work in the trash, all marked with A\u0027s. Back in High School, I used to be a C student. I hadn\u0027t really planned on going to college, but life changes - people change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila narrows her blue eyes at my mirror. \"You do know that we\u0027re not going to have the same dorm when we come back in the fall, so unless you take all your artwork off, it\u0027s just going to be thrown out by the next person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re just a bunch of doodles; sketches of haunting eyes, black roses entwined by a bed of thorns, my name woven in an intricate pattern. None of them matter except one: a sketch of an old friend, playing his guitar. I peel that one off, careful not to tear the corners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave them for the next person,\" I say and add a smile. \"They\u0027ll have a predecorated room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure the next person will actually want to look in the mirror.\" She folds up a pink shirt. \"Although, I don\u0027t know why you want to cover up the mirror. You\u0027re not ugly, El.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not about that.\" I stare at the drawing that captures the intensity in Micha\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila snatches the drawing from my hands, crinkling the edges a little. \"One day you\u0027re going to have to tell me who this gorgeous guy is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just some guy I used to know.\" I steal the drawing back. \"But we don\u0027t talk anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his name?\" She stacks a box next to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI place the drawing into the box and seal it with a strip of tape. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. \"Just wondering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name is Micha.\" It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve said his name aloud, since I left home. It hurts, like a rock lodged in my throat. \"Micha Scott.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glances over my shoulder as she piles the rest of her clothes into a box. \"There\u0027s a lot of passion in that drawing. I just don\u0027t see him as being some guy. Is he like an old boyfriend or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop my duffel bag, packed with my clothes, next to the door. \"No, we never dated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyes me over with doubt. \"But you came close to dating? Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I told you we were just friends.\" But only because I wouldn\u0027t let us be anything more. Micha saw too much of me and it scared me too much to let him in all the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twists her strawberry blonde hair into a ponytail and fans her face. \"Micha is an interesting name. I think a name really says a lot about a person.\" She taps her manicured finger on her chin, thoughtfully. \"I bet he\u0027s hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make that bet on every guy,\" I tease, piling my makeup into a bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins, but there\u0027s sadness in her eyes. \"Yeah, you\u0027re probably right.\" She sighs. \"Will I at least get to see this mysterious Micha - who you\u0027ve refused to speak about our whole eight months of sharing a dorm together - when I drop you off at your house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope not,\" I mutter and her face sinks. \"I\u0027m sorry, but Micha and I... we didn\u0027t leave on a good note and I haven\u0027t talked to him since I left for school in August.\" Micha doesn\u0027t even know where I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heaves an overly stuffed pink duffle bag over her shoulder. \"That sounds like a perfect story for our twelve hour road trip back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back home... \" My eyes widen at the empty room that\u0027s been my home for the last eight months. I\u0027m not ready to go back home and face everyone I bailed on. Especially Micha. He can see through me better than a mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" Lila asks with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips bend upward into a stiff smile as I stuff my panicked feeling in a box hidden deep inside my heart. \"I\u0027m great. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe head out the door, with the last of our boxes in our hands. I pat my empty pockets, realizing I forgot my phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on. I think I forgot my phone.\" Setting my box on the ground, I run back to the room and glance around at the garbage bag, a few empty plastic cups on the bed, and the mirror. \"Where is it?\" I check under the bed and in the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soft tune of Pink\u0027s \"Funhouse\" sings underneath the trash bag - my unknown ID ringtone. I pick up the bag and there is my phone with the screen lit up. I scoop it up and my heart stops. It\u0027s not an unknown number, just one that was never programmed into my phone when I switched carriers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Micha.\" My hands tremble, unable to answer, yet powerless to silence it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to answer that?\" Lila enters the room, her face twisted in confusion. \"What\u0027s up? You look like you just saw a ghost or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone stops ringing and I tuck it into the back pocket of my shorts. \"We should get going. We have a long trip ahead of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila salutes me. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe links arms with me and we head out to the parking lot. When we reach the car, my phone beeps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoicemail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicha\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is Ella Daniels such a common name,\" Ethan grunts from the computer chair. His legs are kicked up on the desk as he lazily scrolls the internet. \"The list is freaking endless, man. I can\u0027t even see straight anymore.\" He rubs his eyes. \"Can I take a break?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking my head, I pace my room with the phone to my ear, kicking the clothes and other shit on my floor out of the way. I\u0027m on hold with the main office at Indiana University, waiting for answers that probably aren\u0027t there. But I have to try - I\u0027ve been trying ever since the day Ella vanished from my life. The day I promised myself that I\u0027d find her no matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure her dad doesn\u0027t know where she is?\" Ethan flops his head back against the headrest of the office chair. \"I swear that old man knows more than he\u0027s letting on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he does, he\u0027s not telling me,\" I say. \"Or his trashed mind has misplaced the information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan swivels the chair around. \"Have you ever considered that maybe she doesn\u0027t want to be found?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every single day,\" I mutter. \"Which makes me even more determined to find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan refocuses his attention to the computer and continues his search through the endless amount of Ella Daniels in the country. But I\u0027m not even sure if she\u0027s still in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secretary returns to the phone and gives me the answer I was expecting. This isn\u0027t the Ella Daniels I\u0027m looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hang up and throw my phone onto the bed. \"God Dammit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan glances over his shoulder. \"No luck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sink down on my bed and let my head fall into my hands. \"It was another dead end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I know you miss her and everything,\" he says, typing on the keyboard. \"But you need to get your crap together. All this whining is giving me a headache.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s right. I shake my pity party off, slip on a black hoodie, and a pair of black boots. \"I\u0027ve got to go down to the shop to pick up a part. You staying or going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drops his feet to the floor and gratefully shoves away from the desk. \"Yeah, but can we stop by my house. I need to pick up my drums for tonight\u0027s practice. Are you going to that or are you still on strike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling my hood over my head, I head for the door. \"Nah, I got some stuff to do tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s bull.\" He reaches to shut off the computer screen. \"Everyone knows the only reason you don\u0027t play anymore is because of Ella. But you need to quit being a pussy and get over her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m going to... \" I smack his hand away from the off button and squint at a picture of a girl on the screen. She has the same dark green eyes and long auburn hair as Ella. But she has on a dress and there isn\u0027t any heavy black liner around her eyes. She also looks fake, like she\u0027s pretending to be happy. The Ella I knew never pretended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it has to be her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dude, what are you doing?\" Ethan complains as I snatch my phone off my bed. \"I thought we were giving up for the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tap the screen and call information. \"Yeah, can I get a number for Ella Daniels in Las Vegas, Nevada.\" I wait, worried she\u0027s not going to be listed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been down in Vegas.\" Ethan peers at the photo on the screen of Ella standing next to a girl with blonde hair and blue eyes in front of the UNLV campus. \"She looks weird, but kinda hot. So is the girl she\u0027s with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but she\u0027s not your type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone\u0027s my type. Besides, she could be a stripper and that\u0027s definitely my type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operator comes back on and she gives me a few numbers listed, one of the numbers belongs to a girl living on the campus. I dial that number and walk out into the hall to get some privacy. It rings and rings and rings and then Ella\u0027s voice comes on the voicemail. She still sounds the same, only a little unemotional, like she\u0027s pretending to be happy, but can\u0027t quite get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it beeps, I take a deep breath and pour my heart out to the voicemail. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-1/page-2.html","bookId":1861,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:09 PM"}
