He was glad to find that it afforded him a prospect of the Mississippi, a mile distant. He could not help speculating on the singular position in which he found himself placed. He had come to this place expecting to receive abuse and defiance from his uncle. On the other hand he had been politely welcomed, and was now a guest. He didn\u0027t understand it, but he was glad of it. He was prepared to contend, but he would much prefer to compromise in a friendly manner.
