Hurry!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed the chair back and slid beneath the wooden frame, and I scooted in from the other side and pulled the hangings down to conceal us, just as the door opened and heavy footsteps crossed wood, aiming toward us. No servant walked thus, with such assurance. I lifted the draperies just enough to spot the expensive leather of the shoes, and the gleam of gold buckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Ordelaffi looked down on his son for a long moment, and then dragged a chair close—the same one Romeo had pushed away—to sit. Dust sifted into my face as Mercutio moved in the bed, and I closed my eyes against it; it crawled into my nose, and I had the horrible fear I might sneeze, or Romeo might, but we both stayed dead silent, somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Lord Ordelaffi finally said, “You live to see the dawn, then. It is a sign from God that even He does not want you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercutio’s voice came thready and weak, muffled by the swelling of his nose and mouth. “And no credit to the love of my father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You brought this horror on yourself, with your filthy ways. But I pray you to take the instruction it offers: Give up your sinful perversions, and embrace a life of piety and duty to your family. You will not be offered this pardon again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pardon? Why, sir, I beg your pardon, for if that was pardon, then fists are love and nooses are kisses. You speak of duty? Duty is the rope that strangles me. Piety is a bed of broken glass. And family is the company of hateful demons.” His voice was half-mad. The bed shifted, as if Mercutio had rolled on his side, away from his father. “I want none of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You beg another beating!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do not beg. Even if you hate me, I am your son and only heir. Kill me, kill your own name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What matters a legacy when it will breed none of its own?” Lord Ordelaffi shoved the chair back and paced with sharp agitation. I watched the shadow move beneath the draping curtains. “You will marry the girl when you are presentable enough, and you will get her with child. Past that, I care not of you, or for you. You are no son of mine, save in necessity. We will never speak again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left then, and slammed the door behind him. I heard the metal scrape of the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomeo and I slithered out from under the bed, and I wiped pale dust from my face and coughed. Mercutio had taken off the compresses. His face was not as swollen, but the bruises had flowered dark, and he scarce looked human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did look . . . different. No longer the fast-witted, silver-tongued jester I had known all my life. There was something older in the hard-to-see glint of his eyes, and the tension in his puffy chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You stayed,” he said. He sounded less distant today, but no less flat. “I love you well for it, but if you’re found in my company here, you’ll be named as sodomites for certain. I am a pestilent friend; I poison all I touch. I beg you, go, and don’t return. Once I am safely married and lashed to the family plow, I can see you again. Not until then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mercutio—” Romeo looked at him with real worry on his earnest, handsome face. “You spoke of daggers as friends last night. Say you do not mean it, for the love we bear you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A dagger is the only friend I cannot corrupt. Even my blood cannot defile good steel.” But Mercutio carefully shook his head, which must have hurt. “Fear not; I will not give him satisfaction in seeing me safely buried. No, I will gadfly him a while longer, the wretched man who frowns on perversion while he capers at murder. I will bring down the guilty; see if I do not. All the guilty, even should I pull down the temple on my head, like Samson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to be glad for him, to wish him success in that, but I was all too aware that the temple that he would be pulling down would be the palace of the Montagues. My sister and my grandmother had set this tragedy in motion, and the coming waves were sure to wash us to far distant shores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might be up to me to be sure those waves did not drown us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFROM THE DIARY OF MERCUTIO, HIDDEN BY HIS HAND\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn only a week’s time, how quickly Tomasso has disappeared from the world. His body has not yet completed a feast for the worms, and yet no one remembers him. I am presentable enough to dine in the hall now. My father ignores me; he will keep his silence toward me to his dying day; I know that. No one remarks on my face, or my newly crooked nose. No one asks whether I am well. I am a ghost at the table, as dead to them as the boy they helped murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them knows his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them cares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn all of them to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been almost a month. The bruises are gone from my face, and the mirror shows me a new man—a stranger, with shadows in my eyes and a cruel tilt to my mouth. My father took the heart from me, and what remains is a cavern of roaring blood, and no pity left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy servant Elias has brought me whispers and pieces of rumor, and I turn them over greedily, as once I turned over the treasure the Prince of Shadows brought to me. I have wealth secreted away, clean coin from the sale of my friend’s ill-gotten loot. I had meant it to take us away, into a new and likely impossible life together, but with Tomasso gone the gold means nothing, save a tool to loosen tongues and buy my vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday Elias has told me a Capulet betrayed us. I’ faith, I almost hate the Montagues as much; I know in my head that Romeo and Benvolio could do nothing for me, or Tomasso, yet knowing they saw his death, saw my humiliation, goes hard. Hearing of Capulet guilt makes me think had I not been such fast friends with Montague it would not have happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fault, again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pray every night for forgiveness. I pray that Tomasso will intercede for me, but I do not pray for salvation; that is beyond me now, and I know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that is left is vengeance, and I will have that, at least, if nothing else. I will contrive a revenge yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst is upon me. I am wed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sickens me, though I should have pity on her; she is as trapped in this web as I, but she is a symbol of all I have lost of myself. And I loathe her. It is a bitter bed we make, and after, she weeps herself to sleep. I tell her that once she bears a living heir she can be shut of me, and I know she is well content with that. We both cling to the promise of loneliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen say that love is cruel, but it is the lack of it in the act that is cruelest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw my Prince of Shadows in the market today, but I avoided him. I think he would have followed me, but I fell in with some drunken fellows instead; he prefers his sobriety, my serious young friend. I wonder if he is still stealing, and if so, where he hides his loot. (Even here, I will not inscribe his name. I owe him that much.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday Elias brought me a priest. He was to hear my confession, but I confessed him, instead; I heard from his own lips how Rosaline Capulet, that convent-bound bitch, had pointed the finger at us and roused my father’s ire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is proof enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wife’s maidservant came to me with reports that my wife sneaks away to visit a witch, one who doses her with potions to make her more fertile. She desires a babe as badly as I, and for the same reasons—it is our salvation from this fleshy purgatory we inhabit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced the wench to tell me where the witch lives, and tomorrow I will pay her a visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witch must have been in terror that I would betray her; the penalty for such unholy acts as she commits is death, but I will not betray anyone with a secret. I threw gold on the table, a mountain of it, and told her to continue to dose my wife with whatever herbs might induce her to conceive, but to make for me a curse, a great and terrible curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine my surprise to discover that this young slip of a witch once had a cousin, a cousin I so tenderly cherished. She had come to Verona to discover the reason for Tomasso’s death. Once she learned who I was, she was cheerful in her help to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had long considered carefully how to achieve my vengeance. One blade alone might cut a few throats, but not enough, and not the right ones. No, I needed to destroy the Capulets, root and branch, before turning the vengeance upon my own father and his varlets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA curse for love, cast in my own hand and faith and flesh. A curse of love, on the house of the guilty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet them feast on love, as crows feast on the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps I am, after all, mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have made me a poem of my madness, and it concerns Queen Mab. In part, it reads:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf healths five-fathom deep; and then anon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd being thus frighted swears a prayer or two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat plats the manes of horses in the night,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat presses them and learns them first to bear,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking them women of good carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Mab has made me mad. I no longer care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e• • •\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have consorted with the witch to make this curse, and there are three parts to my vengeance: flesh, mind, and spirit. Let me then speak my mind, here:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCURSED BE THE CAPULETS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCURSED BE THE HOUSE WHO BETRAYED US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet Queen Mab visit her madness upon us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQUARTO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne would believe that Tomasso had never existed, save for the new twist in Mercutio’s once-straight nose; the bruises had faded, and if our friend’s humor had taken a turn for the bizarre and bitter, I could scarce blame him. He had been wed, with all the necessary pomp, to a blushing young girl; Romeo and I had helped put Mercutio to bed with her according to custom, a strange and horrible business knowing what we did, but we’d been spared the awkward business of listening to any consummation behind the curtains, though some servant would have done so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I had been forced to listen, still, to Romeo’s half-drunken rambling paeans to the beauty of a woman he would not name, but who must have been Rosaline Capulet. She was not, of course, in attendance at the wedding; the Capulets would not set foot where Montagues entertained. Yet her shadow loomed large over all. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prince-of-shadows/page-24.html","bookId":2662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:26 AM"}
