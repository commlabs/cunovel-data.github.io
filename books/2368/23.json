{"id":69147,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\u003cp\u003eDr. Gilbert Keller was in charge of Ashley\u0027s therapy. His specialty was treating multiple personality disorder, and while he had had failures, his success rate was high. In cases like this, there were no easy answers. His first job was to get the patient to trust him, to feel comfortable with him, and then to bring out the alters, one by one, so that in the end they could communicate with one another and understand why they existed, and finally, why there was no more need for them. That was the moment of blending, when the personality states came together as a single entity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re a long way from that. Dr. Keller thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, Dr. Keller had Ashley brought to his office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Ashley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning. Dr. Keller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to call me Gilbert. We\u0027re going to be friends. How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him and said, \"They tell me I\u0027ve killed five people. How should I feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember killing any of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read the transcript of your trial, Ashley. You didn\u0027t kill them. One of your alters did. We\u0027re going to get acquainted with your alters, and in time, with your help we\u0027ll make them disappear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I hope you can - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can. I\u0027m here to help you, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do. The alters were created in your mind to save you from an unbearable pain. We have to find out what caused that pain. I need to find out when those alters were born and why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How - how do you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll talk. Things will come to you. From time to time, we\u0027ll use hypnotism or Sodium Amytal. You\u0027ve been hypnotized before, haven\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one\u0027s going to pressure you. We\u0027re going to take our time.\" He added reassuringly, \"And when we\u0027re through, you\u0027re going to be well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked for almost an hour. At the end of that time, Ashley felt much more relaxed. Back in her room, she thought, I really think he can do it. And she said a little prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Keller had a meeting with Otto Lewison. \"We talked this morning,\" Dr. Keller said. \"The good news is that Ashley admits she has a problem, and she\u0027s willing to be helped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a beginning. Keep me informed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, Otto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Keller was looking forward to the challenge ahead of him. There was something very special about Ashley Patterson. He was determined to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked every day, and a week after Ashley arrived, Dr. Keller said, \"I want you to be comfortable and relaxed. I\u0027m going to hypnotize you.\" He moved toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Wait!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, surprised. \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen terrible thoughts flashed through Ashley\u0027s head. He was going to bring out her alters. She was terrified of the idea. \"Please,\" she said. \"I - I don\u0027t want to meet them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t,\" Dr. Keller assured her. \"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Here we go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took fifteen minutes to hypnotize her. When she was under, Gilbert Keller glanced at a piece of paper on his desk. Toni Prescott and Alette Peters. It was time for switching, the process of changing from one dominating personality state to another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Ashley, asleep in her chair, then leaned forward. \"Good morning, Tonni. Can you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched Ashley\u0027s face transform, taken over by an entirely different personality. There was a sudden vivacity in her face. She began to sing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half a pound of tupenny rice,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf a pound of treacle,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMix it up and make it nice,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePop! goes the weasel...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was very nice, Toni. I\u0027m Gilbert Keller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know who you are,\" Toni said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad to meet you. Did anyone ever tell you that you have a beautiful singing voice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sod off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it. Did you ever take singing lessons? I\u0027ll bet you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t. As a matter of fact, I wanted to, but my\" - For God\u0027s sakes, will you stop that terrible noise! Whoever told you you could sing? - \"never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toni, I want to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t, Dockie baby. You want to lay me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think that, Toni?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all you bloody men ever want to do. Ta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toni...? Toni...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilbert Keller looked at Ashley\u0027s face again. It was serene. Dr. Keller leaned forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alette?\" There was no change in Ashley\u0027s expression. \"Alette...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to speak to you, Alette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley began to stir uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come out, Alette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley took a deep breath, and then there was a sudden explosion of words spoken in Italian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027i qualcuno che parla Italuaw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alette - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Non so dove mi trovo\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alette, listen to me.

I\u0027m tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been through a terrible time, but all that is behind you. Your future is going to be very peaceful. Do you know where you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Si. It\u0027s some kind of place for people who are pazzo.\" That\u0027s why you\u0027re here, Doctor. You\u0027re the crazy one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a place where you\u0027re going to be cored. Alette, when you close your eyes and visualize this place, what comes to your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hogarth. He painted insane asylums and scenes that are terrifying.\" You\u0027re too ignorant ever to have heard of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to think of this place as terrifying.

It looks like an ugly blob to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeave me alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alette?\" Gilbert Keller watched Ashley\u0027s face change again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlette was gone. Dr. Keller awakened Ashley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes and blinked. \"Have you started?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toni and Alette talked to me.

As a matter of fact, I think about you often. I feel as though we\u0027ve gone through the wars together. It was a tough fight, but we won. And I have good news. I\u0027ve been assured that the murder charges against you in Bedford and Quebec will be dropped. If there is anything I can do for you, let me know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarmest wishes,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, Dr. Keller was talking to Toni while Ashley was under hypnosis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it now, Dockie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to have a little chat with you.

Dr. Keller leaned forward and said soothingly, \"It\u0027s all right. You\u0027re going to awaken now. Ashley....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I talked to Toni and Alette. They\u0027re friends. I want you all to be friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Ashley was at lunch, a male nurse walked into her room and saw a painting of a landscape on the floor. He studied it a moment, then took it to Dr. Keller\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a meeting in Dr. Lewison\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s it going, Gilbert?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Keller said thoughtfully, \"I\u0027ve talked to the two alters. The dominant one is Toni. She has an English background and won\u0027t talk about it. The other one, Alette, was born in Rome, and she doesn\u0027t want to talk about it, either. So that\u0027s where I\u0027m going to concentrate. That\u0027s where the traumas occurred. Toni is the more aggressive one. Alette is sensitive and withdrawn. She\u0027s interested in painting, but she\u0027s afraid to pursue it. I have to find out why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you think Toni dominates Ashley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Toni takes over. Ashley wasn\u0027t aware that she exists, or for that matter, that Alette existed. But Toni and Alette know each other. It\u0027s interesting. Toni has a lovely singing voice, and Alette is a talented painter.\" He held up the painting that the male nurse had brought him. \"I think their talents may be the key to getting through to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley received a letter from her father once a week.

Every little bit helps....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley was becoming used to her surroundings. The patients seemed to walk about, although there were attendants at every door and in the corridors. The gates to the grounds were always locked. There was a recreation room where they could gather and watch television, a gymnasium where inmates could work out and a common dining room. There were many kinds of people there: Japanese, Chinese, French, Americans.... Every effort had been made to make the hospital as ordinary- looking as possible, but when Ashley went to her room, the doors were always locked behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a hospital,\" Toni complained to Alette. \"It\u0027s a bloody prison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Dr. Keller thinks he can cure Ashley.

In other words, to cure her, we have to die.
