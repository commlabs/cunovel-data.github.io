We can talk while performing that necessary task. These gentlemen,\" added he, pointing to the bodies, \"cannot hear us.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But we could throw them into the ditch,\" said Porthos, \"after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Athos, \"that\u0027s Grimaud\u0027s business.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" cried D\u0027Artagnan, \"pray let Grimaud search them and throw them over the walls.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Heaven forfend!\" said Athos; \"they may serve us.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"These bodies serve us?\" said Porthos. \"You are mad, dear friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Judge not rashly, say the gospel and the cardinal,\" replied Athos. \"How many guns, gentlemen?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Twelve,\" replied Aramis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How many shots?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"A hundred.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s quite as many as we shall want.

Only, to alleviate the tediousness of the duty, Athos allowed him to take a loaf, two cutlets, and a bottle of wine.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And now to table,\" said Athos.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like Turks, or even tailors.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And now,\" said D\u0027Artagnan, \"as there is no longer any fear of being overheard, I hope you are going to let me into your secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory, gentlemen,\" said Athos. \"I have induced you to take a charming promenade; here is a delicious breakfast; and yonder are five hundred persons, as you may see through the loopholes, taking us for heroes or madmen--two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But the secret!\" said D\u0027Artagnan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The secret is,\" said Athos, \"that I saw Milady last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eD\u0027Artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips; but at the name of Milady, his hand trembled so, that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw your wi--\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush!\" interrupted Athos. \"You forget, my dear, you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself. I have seen Milady.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" demanded D\u0027Artagnan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Within two leagues of this place, at the inn of the Red Dovecot.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case I am lost,\" said D\u0027Artagnan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so bad yet,\" replied Athos; \"for by this time she must have quit the shores of France.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eD\u0027Artagnan breathed again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But after all,\" asked Porthos, \"who is Milady?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"A charming woman!\" said Athos, sipping a glass of sparkling wine. \"Villainous host!\" cried he, \"he has given us Anjou wine instead of champagne, and fancies we know no better! Yes,\" continued he, \"a charming woman, who entertained kind views toward our friend D\u0027Artagnan, who, on his part, has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots, a week ago by trying to poison him, and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What! by demanding my head of the cardinal?\" cried D\u0027Artagnan, pale with terror.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that is true as the Gospel,\" said Porthos; \"I heard her with my own ears.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I also,\" said Aramis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Then,\" said D\u0027Artagnan, letting his arm fall with discouragement, \"it is useless to struggle longer. I may as well blow my brains out, and all will be over.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the last folly to be committed,\" said Athos, \"seeing it is the only one for which there is no remedy.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can never escape,\" said D\u0027Artagnan, \"with such enemies. First, my stranger of Meung; then De Wardes, to whom I have given three sword wounds; next Milady, whose secret I have discovered; finally, the cardinal, whose vengeance I have balked.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Athos, \"that only makes four; and we are four-- one for one. Pardieu! if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making, we are about to have to do with a very different number of people. What is it, Grimaud? Considering the gravity of the occasion, I permit you to speak, my friend; but be laconic, I beg. What do you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"A troop.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Of how many persons?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty men.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What sort of men?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sixteen pioneers, four soldiers.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How far distant?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Five hundred paces.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Good!

As to Grimaud, he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardieu!\" said Athos, \"it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes, mattocks, and shovels. Grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away, and I am convinced they would have left us in peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that,\" replied D\u0027Artagnan, \"for they are advancing very resolutely. Besides, in addition to the pioneers, there are four soldiers and a brigadier, armed with muskets.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because they don\u0027t see us,\" said Athos.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"My faith,\" said Aramis, \"I must confess I feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"He is a bad priest,\" said Porthos, \"who has pity for heretics.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"In truth,\" said Athos, \"Aramis is right. I will warn them.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What the devil are you going to do?\" cried D\u0027Artagnan, \"you will be shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Athos heeded not his advice. Mounting on the breach, with his musket in one hand and his hat in the other, he said, bowing courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers, who, astonished at this apparition, stopped fifty paces from the bastion: \"Gentlemen, a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion. Now, you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast. We request you, then, if you really have business here, to wait till we have finished or repast, or to come again a short time hence, unless; unless, which would be far better, you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels, and come and drink with us to the health of the King of France.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care, Athos!\" cried D\u0027Artagnan; \"don\u0027t you see they are aiming?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes,\" said Athos; \"but they are only civilians--very bad marksmen, who will be sure not to hit me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, at the same instant four shots were fired, and the balls were flattened against the wall around Athos, but not one touched him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFour shots replied to them almost instantaneously, but much better aimed than those of the aggressors; three soldiers fell dead, and one of the pioneers was wounded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Grimaud,\" said Athos, still on the breach, \"another musket!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGrimaud immediately obeyed. On their part, the three friends had reloaded their arms; a second discharge followed the first. The brigadier and two pioneers fell dead; the rest of the troop took to flight.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, gentlemen, a sortie!\" cried Athos.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd the four friends rushed out of the fort, gained the field of battle, picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half-pike of the brigadier, and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city, turned again toward the bastion, bearing with them the trophies of their victory.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Reload the muskets, Grimaud,\" said Athos, \"and we, gentlemen, will go on with our breakfast, and resume our conversation. Where were we?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I recollect you were saying,\" said D\u0027Artagnan, \"that after having demanded my head of the cardinal, Milady had quit the shores of France. Whither goes she?\" added he, strongly interested in the route Milady followed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"She goes into England,\" said Athos.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"With what view?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"With the view of assassinating, or causing to be assassinated, the Duke of Buckingham.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eD\u0027Artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But this is infamous!\" cried he.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"As to that,\" said Athos, \"I beg you to believe that I care very little about it. Now you have done, Grimaud, take our brigadier\u0027s half-pike, tie a napkin to it, and plant it on top of our bastion, that these rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGrimaud obeyed without replying. An instant afterward, the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends. A thunder of applause saluted its appearance; half the camp was at the barrier.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" replied D\u0027Artagnan, \"you care little if she kills Buckingham or causes him to be killed? But the duke is our friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The duke is English; the duke fights against us. Let her do what she likes with the duke; I care no more about him than an empty bottle.\" And Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"A moment,\" said D\u0027Artagnan. \"I will not abandon Buckingham thus. He gave us some very fine horses.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And moreover, very handsome saddles,\" said Porthos, who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" said Aramis, \"God desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Amen!\" said Athos, \"and we will return to that subject later, if such be your pleasure; but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly, and I am sure you will understand me, D\u0027Artagnan, was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal, and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But this creature must be a demon!\" said Porthos, holding out his plate to Aramis, who was cutting up a fowl.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And this carte blanche,\" said D\u0027Artagnan, \"this carte blanche, does it remain in her hands?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it passed into mine; I will not say without trouble, for if I did I should tell a lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear Athos, I shall no longer count the number of times I am indebted to you for my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it was to go to her that you left us?\" said Aramis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And you have that letter of the cardinal?\" said D\u0027Artagnan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Here it is,\" said Athos; and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform. D\u0027Artagnan unfolded it with one hand, whose trembling he did not even attempt to conceal, to read:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDec. 3, 1627\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is by more order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Richelieu\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact,\" said Aramis, \"it is an absolution according to rule.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That paper must be torn to pieces,\" said D\u0027Artagnan, who fancied he read in it his sentence of death.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"On the contrary,\" said Athos, \"it must be preserved carefully. I would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And what will she do now?\" asked the young man.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why,\" replied Athos, carelessly, \"she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned Musketeer, named Athos, has taken her safe-conduct from her by force; she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends, Aramis and Porthos, at the same time. The cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path; and then some fine morning he will arrest D\u0027Artagnan, and for fear he should feel lonely, he will send us to keep him company in the Bastille.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to! It appears to me you make dull jokes, my dear,\" said Porthos.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not jest,\" said Athos.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know,\" said Porthos, \"that to twist that damned Milady\u0027s neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of Huguenots, who have committed no other crime than singing in French the psalms we sing in Latin?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What says the abbe?\" asked Athos, quietly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I say I am entirely of Porthos\u0027s opinion,\" replied Aramis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And I, too,\" said D\u0027Artagnan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Fortunately, she is far off,\" said Porthos, \"for I confess she would worry me if she were here.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"She worries me in England as well as in France,\" said Athos.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"She worries me everywhere,\" said D\u0027Artagnan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her, strangle her, hang her?\" said Porthos. \"It is only the dead who do not return.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You think so, Porthos?\" replied the Musketeer, with a sad smile which D\u0027Artagnan alone understood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I have an idea,\" said D\u0027Artagnan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" said the Musketeers.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"To arms!\" cried Grimaud.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe young men sprang up, and seized their muskets.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis time a small troop advanced, consisting of from twenty to twenty-five men; but they were not pioneers, they were soldiers of the garrison.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we return to the camp?\" said Porthos. \"I don\u0027t think the sides are equal.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible, for three reasons,\" replied Athos. \"The first, that we have not finished breakfast; the second, that we still have some very important things to say; and the third, that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" said Aramis, \"we must form a plan of battle.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s very simple,\" replied Athos. \"As soon as the enemy are within musket shot, we must fire upon them. If they continue to advance, we must fire again. We must fire as long as we have loaded guns. If those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault, we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch, and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Bravo!\" cried Porthos. \"Decidedly, Athos, you were born to be a general, and the cardinal, who fancies himself a great soldier, is nothing beside you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Gentlemen,\" said Athos, \"no divided attention, I beg; let each one pick out his man.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I cover mine,\" said D\u0027Artagnan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And I mine,\" said Porthos.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And I mine,\" said Aramis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Fire, then,\" said Athos.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe four muskets made but one report, but four men fell.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe drum immediately beat, and the little troop advanced at charging pace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen the shots were repeated without regularity, but always aimed with the same accuracy. Nevertheless, as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends, the Rochellais continued to advance in quick time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith every three shots at least two men fell; but the march of those who remained was not slackened.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArrived at the foot of the bastion, there were still more than a dozen of the enemy. A last discharge welcomed them, but did not stop them; they jumped into the ditch, and prepared to scale the breach.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, my friends,\" said Athos, \"finish them at a blow. To the wall; to the wall!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd the four friends, seconded by Grimaud, pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall, which bent as if pushed by the wind, and detaching itself from its base, fell with a horrible crash into the ditch. Then a fearful crash was heard; a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky--and all was over!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we have destroyed them all, from the first to the last?\" said Athos.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"My faith, it appears so!\" said D\u0027Artagnan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" cried Porthos; \"there go three or four, limping away.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, three or four of these unfortunate men, covered with dirt and blood, fled along the hollow way, and at length regained the city. These were all who were left of the little troop.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAthos looked at his watch.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"we have been here an hour, and our wager is won; but we will be fair players.

Have I not been there once?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes; but at that period we were not at war. At that period Buckingham was an ally, and not an enemy.

The balls passed and whistled all around him; not one struck him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAthos waved his flag, turning his back on the guards of the city, and saluting those of the camp.

More than two thousand persons had assisted, as at a spectacle, in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friends--and undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive. Nothing was heard but cried of \"Live the Musketeers! Live the Guards!\" M. de Busigny was the first to come and shake Athos by the hand, and acknowledge that the wager was lost. The dragoon and the Swiss followed him, and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the Swiss. There was nothing but felicitations, pressures of the hand, and embraces; there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the Rochellais. The tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot, and sent La Houdiniere, his captain of the Guards, to inquire what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" asked the cardinal, on seeing La Houdiniere return.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, monseigneur,\" replied the latter, \"three Musketeers and a Guardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais; and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy, and have killed I don\u0027t know how many Rochellais.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you inquire the names of those three Musketeers?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, monseigneur.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What are their names?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Messieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Still my three brave fellows!\" murmured the cardinal. \"And the Guardsman?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"D\u0027Artagnan.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Still my young scapegrace.

M. de Treville, who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it, related it in all its details to his Eminence, not forgetting the episode of the napkin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s well, Monsieur de Treville,\" said the cardinal; \"pray let that napkin be sent to me.
