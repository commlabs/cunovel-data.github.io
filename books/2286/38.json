The aunts stood as well, ready to walk their guests to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“David, darling, you must come here again, too-anytime. You’re family, and we do love you so!” Esther told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. But I want to take you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid it will have to be somewhere quiet these days,” Esther said. “We’ll talk!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both stood on tiptoe to kiss David then Sean goodbye. When they came to hug Katie, she asked, “Would you two trust me to take your ledger for a few days? I would absolutely love to read it. I’ll be very careful with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, of course!” Ester said. “We’ll be delighted for you to read it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we know you’ll take care with it,” Alice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thanked them. Sean looked at her and rolled his eyes, shaking his head. “I’m going to be careful!” she whispered to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a bit frightening, borrowing a family treasure,” Sean said, aware that the others were looking at the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katie, I know you’ll take it home and take good care of it,” Alice said. “We’re not worried in the least.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll defend it with my life,” Katie promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good Lord, don’t do that, child,” Alice said, smiling. “Your life is worth far more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later, they were in the car, heading back. One of the streets was blocked for construction; Katie hadn’t intended on coming down Duval with its throngs of tourists, but she did so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good God, what is that?” Sean demanded from the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” she asked. Her eyes were on the road. Tourists didn’t have the sense to look before they stepped off the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red light allowed her the chance to look. One of the shops had a Robert the Doll mannequin out in front, except it was oversize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A balloon?” Sean asked, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was looking out the window, as well. “No, I think it might be canvas, but it’s got some kind of an inner structure, wood or metal. Damn, that’s ugly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie kept driving. She could see that there was a line to get into the museum where Stella Martin had been killed and laid out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStella was still at the morgue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd people would be thronging in to see where she had lain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Capitalism at its best,” Sean murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We do need to survive as a city,” Katie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drove on, turning down her street and bringing the car into the drive. “Sean, should I back out and park in the street so that you can reach your car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I’m going to bed. I could sleep for a week. If I go to sleep now, I may feel human again by tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe parked the car and they all got out. Sean headed toward the house and then looked back. He strode over to them with purpose. “All right, someone has been killed, and Fantasy Fest may be starting off with a bang, but there is a killer on the loose. Katie, if you two don’t come here for the night, you make sure that I know you’re staying out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” David told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, all right, it’s a little bit weird, but I actually prefer it if you stay here at night,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of them moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean waved a hand in the air and walked on into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to take a run down to the police station. Will you go in for a while and promise me that you’ll stay there?” David asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted the journal. “Sure. But you know, I work tomorrow night again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, I’m getting to just love karaoke,” he assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed his cheek and headed into the house. “Lock it!” he called to her, and then started walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie went on in and set the ledger on the dining-room table. She wished that she had the books from the library as well, but they were at David’s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t read more than one at a time anyway, she told herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been hot outside. She ran upstairs, jumped into the shower and afterward slid into the coolest cotton dress she could find. The shower refreshed her, and she went back downstairs. She set the kettle on the range top to boil. Now that she was cooled down, she was in the mood for a cup of hot tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away from the stove and went dead still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart thudded against her chest, and seemed to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny Zigler was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked to the door, and saw that it remained locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had seen him last night; it might have been a dream, or something like a dream, but she had already seen Danny, and she had thought that he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow she had ever imagined that he might be flesh and blood, that he might have broken into the house, she didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to fade even as she stared at him. He had his old baseball cap in his hands, and his hair seemed unkempt. His clothes looked mussed and dirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Danny,” she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe faded away completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he reappeared. He pointed to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned, looking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pointing at the journal she had taken from the Beckett house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Danny, what is it? What am I looking for?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe faded away again, his arm, hand and then fingers disappearing last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, there was no one there at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCraig Beckett wrote a wonderful log. It was personal, but she assumed that he had gotten accustomed to keeping such a diary because he’d been a ship’s captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had lived a long life, dying at the age of ninety-six in eighteen ninety-five. He painted a vivid picture of when Key West had been little more than a trading post with a hardy group of settlers working to turn it into a place that would boast, in the Victorian era, the highest per capita income in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the early pages she turned to first. He wrote about being a young sea captain in the navy and his decision to leave the navy and work for David Porter as a civilian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe described the events she had learned about from Bartholomew in detail. Of course, he hadn’t seen the attack that had taken Victoria’s life-the attack that Eli Smith had blamed on Bartholomew-but described it from imagination and experience. The canons firing and fire streaking through the sails of the ship, men and women screaming as smoke, fire or the tempestuous sea threatened their lives. Pirates killing everyone in their path with their broadswords. It was an unprovoked attack, and one that shocked the town, because David Porter had all but eliminated piracy a few years before it had taken place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCraig Beckett wrote about his friendship with Bartholomew. “A man of my heart; a man who loved the sea, and his country. He might have remained a brigand, but he knew that I spoke to him truly, that I understood how he had taken enemy ships and no others. In the city, he was a model citizen, but also a man, who came to love too deeply if not with sense. I sincerely doubt that the rascal Smith could have ever started such a rumor, one so vile as to take a life, if Bartholomew had not so deeply loved Victoria. It was with the heaviest of hearts that I learned of the crowd that formed, a lynch mob, one with no more sense than that of a school of fish, darting here and there at the whim of one, that burst in upon that good fellow and dragged him to the hanging tree. They say that he died with dignity, claiming his innocence and showing no fear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie was surprised to feel her eyes stinging, and then she realized that tears were dampening her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wished that she could hug Bartholomew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that she knew where he was!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, well, she would do her best when she did see him next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had seemed so taken with the woman in white-the one he now knew to be Lucinda, whose brother had died in a storm-he had told her with a certain wistfulness that Victoria had moved on. She was not among those walking the streets of Key West in any spectral way. She must have been a very strong woman-killed so ruthlessly, and yet able to move on to the higher plain of heaven, or wherever it was that the souls of the dead finally found peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie turned a page in the book, careful to dry her hands so as not to smear the ink or hurt the delicate pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBartholomew’s story was a sad one. She could certainly understand it if he was to walk around near the hanging tree, still crying out his innocence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started reading again. The days of the bold wreckers came into play. Sponge divers, builders, settlers…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, she felt a presence near her. She looked up, thinking that Sean might have awakened, even if he had said that he could sleep for a week. But it wasn’t her brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBartholomew was back. He was perched on the edge of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was reading about you,” she told him. “I’m so sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved a hand in the air. “Yes, it was quite unjust, but a very long time ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where have you been this time?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Police headquarters. Apparently, Lieutenant Dryer has been combing the streets, and he’s quite irritated by all the shenanigans for Fantasy Fest. Seems he can’t get in the questioning he wants at various bars because there are so many people in the streets. Anyway, that’s left most of everything at the station in the hands of Mr. Liam Beckett, who is dealing with all competently, even if his frustration level is quite high.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you learn anything new?” she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not at the station,” Bartholomew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I can tell you this-Danny Zigler is dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve seen him, too?” Bartholomew asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was here-for a split second. He pointed at the book,” Katie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the book is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain Craig Beckett started it, and other Becketts over the years have kept it up. It’s not exactly a family bible, but it’s history as the Becketts saw it over the years,” Katie explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There we are-back to the past,” Bartholomew said, deep in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did you see him?” Katie asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-shadow-bone-island-trilogy-1/page-38.html","bookId":2286,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:51:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:51:16 PM"}
