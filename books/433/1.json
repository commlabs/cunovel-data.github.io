With me you have sorrowed over the untimely death of “Little Charlie.” “Bertha,” with her precious gifts,—whereof so many stand in need,—has grown to you and me not a child of fancy, but a living presence. “Little Floy,” and the “Child of the Street,” will recall, to your mind as to mine, the touching lines of Mrs. Browning:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ere the sorrow comes with years?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They are leaning their young heads against their mothers;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And that cannot stop their tears.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The young lambs are bleating in the meadows;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The young birds are chirping in the nest;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The young fawns are playing with the shadows;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The young flowers are blowing toward the West:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the young, young children, O my brothers!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They are weeping bitterly,—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They are weeping in the play-time of the others,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the country of the free.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They look up with their pale and sunken faces,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And their looks are sad to see;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the man’s grief abhorrent draws and presses\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Down the cheeks of infancy.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To you, then, I dedicate this book,—which is partly yours, in spirit, if not in deed,—confident, that, whatever may be its shortcomings in the eyes of others, it will find a kindly welcome at your hands.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2956/81289.html","bookId":433,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 8:15:49 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 8:15:49 PM"}
