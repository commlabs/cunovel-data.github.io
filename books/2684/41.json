{"id":69570,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" I ask, trying to sound neutral. \"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re both suddenly distracted by a drunken man in a bathing suit who\u0027s gesturing at something invisible in the air at the end of the pier, sunburned, bearded. Trent takes off his sunglasses again and for some reason he doesn\u0027t know where to look and he\u0027s more agitated than he was before and the land has disappeared behind us and there\u0027s no sound coming from the distant shore, which is now completely hidden by haze, and we\u0027re out over the water now and two Asian girls pulling tufts of cotton candy off a stick are the only other people wandering by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s much more complicated than you know.\" Trent says this in a strained voice as he keeps looking around, and I just want him to stop but I also don\u0027t want him to look at me. \"It\u0027s just ... bigger than you think. All you need to do is, is, is remove yourself,\" he stammers before regaining his composure. \"You don\u0027t need to know anything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remove myself from what, exactly?\" I ask. \"Remove myself from her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent pauses a moment, and then decides to tell me something. \"Kelly Montrose was a close friend of mine.\" He lets the statement hang there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hangs there long enough for me to ask, \"What does Kelly have to do with why I\u0027m here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rain was with him,\" Trent says. \"I mean, when he disappeared. They were together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he was paying for it, I guess ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought she had stopped doing that,\" I say. \"I thought she met Rip and that she had stopped doing that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knows things,\" Trent says. \"And so does Julian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what happened to Kelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at Trent stone-faced but the fear begins swirling around us softly and it causes me to notice a young blond guy in cargo shorts and a windbreaker leaning against a railing on the pier, purposefully not looking at us, and I realize he could not be more obvious if he were holding a hundred balloons. Invisible gulls keep squalling in the hazy sky above him, and the blond guy suddenly seems familiar but I can\u0027t place him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not saying she\u0027s innocent,\" Trent\u0027s saying. \"She\u0027s not. But she doesn\u0027t need someone like you to make things worse for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn back to Trent. \"But Rip Millar is okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason this question forces Trent to shut up and figure out another tactic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe start walking again. We pass a Mexican restaurant that overlooks the sea. We\u0027re near the end of the pier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you get out of taking Rain on as a client?\" I ask. \"I\u0027m curious. Why did you take on a girl you knew was never going to make it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent keeps matching my steps, and his expression momentarily relaxes. \"Well, it made my wife happy to help Julian out before she realized ... \" Trent pauses, thinks things through, and continues. \"I mean, I knew about Julian. Blair and I didn\u0027t talk about it but it wasn\u0027t a secret between us.\" Trent squints and then puts his sunglasses back on. \"If I have any problems they\u0027re not with Rain Turner. And they\u0027re not with Blair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have a problem with Julian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I knew that Blair had loaned him a lot of money - well, seventy grand, but for him that\u0027s a lot of money.\" Trent moves alongside me toward the end of the pier, seemingly unaware of the guy who\u0027s following us and I keep looking back at. I notice he\u0027s holding a camera. \"And I knew she really liked him.\" Trent pauses. \"But I also knew that in the end nothing was going to happen with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See, there you go again, Clay,\" Trent says. \"It\u0027s not about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trent - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It comes down to this,\" he continues, cutting me off. \"Blair loaned Julian a large sum of money. Julian decided to go to Rip to borrow some cash to pay Blair back. Why? I don\u0027t know.\" Trent pauses. \"And that\u0027s how Rip met Miss Turner. And, um, the rest is, well, what it is.\" He pauses again. \"Do I need to say anything more? Do you get it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at the blond guy again. He\u0027s supposed to be in costume, he\u0027s supposed to be camouflaged but he\u0027s not: it\u0027s almost as if he wants us to notice him. He keeps moving down the pier, twenty, maybe thirty yards behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rip told me he was going to divorce his wife,\" I say. \"What would they have done then? I mean, if Kelly hadn\u0027t shown up? How much longer could they have played this game with Rip if he actually went through with the divorce?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-41.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
