{"id":108210,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u003cp\u003ePaula is having contractions in my car when I decide we are not going to the local hospital where her doctor is waiting. I turn left and head for the freeway. Paula is in pain, and in shock when I floor it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" she cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like your hospital,\" I say. \"It\u0027s ill equipped. I\u0027m taking you to a much nicer one. Don\u0027t worry, I have money, I\u0027ll pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they\u0027re expecting me! I called before I left!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. This hospital is only thirty minutes away.\" It is actually over forty minutes away. \"You\u0027ll like it, we can get you a room with a view of the mountains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m not going on vacation! I\u0027m going to have a baby! I don\u0027t need a room with a view!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s always nice to have a view,\" I reply, patting her leg. \"Don\u0027t worry, Paula, I know what I\u0027m doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis baby--I don\u0027t know what\u0027s special about it I don\u0027t know why Ray and Kalika are obsessed with it. But I do know they are the last people on earth who are going to see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hospital I take her to, the famous Cedar Sinai, is surprised to see us. But the staff jumps to attention when I wave cash and gold credit cards in their faces. What a terrible thing it is that the quality of emergen?cy care is often determined by money. Holding Paula\u0027s hand, I help her fill out the paperwork and then we are both ushered into a delivery room. The baby appears to be coming fast. A nurse asks me to put on a gown and a mask. She is nice, and lets me stay with Paula without asking questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaula is now drenched in sweat and in the throes of real pain, which I have often been intimate with. An anesthesiologist appears and wants to give her Demerol to take the edge off the contractions, maybe an epidermal to partially numb her tower body. But Paula shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need anything,\" she says. \"I have my friend with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anesthesiologist doesn\u0027t approve, but I am touched by the remark. I have become so human. Even sentimental nonsense has meaning to me. Paula\u0027s hand is sweaty in mine but I have seldom felt a softer touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am with you,\" I say. \"I will stay with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby fakes us all out It is eight hours later, at night, when the child finally makes an appearance--a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehandsome male of seven pounds five ounces, with more hair than most babies, and large blue eyes that I assume will fade to brown over the next few months. I am the first to hold the baby--other than the deliver?ing physician--and I whisper in his ear the ancient mystical symbol that is supposed to remind the child of its true essence or soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vak,\" I say over and over again. It is practically the first sound the infant hears because he did not come out screaming, and the doctor and the others fell strangely silent at the moment of his birth. Indeed, it was almost as if time stood still for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVak is a name for Saraswati, the Goddess of speech, the Mother above the head who brings the white light to saints and prophets. The baby smiles at me as I say Vak. Already, I think, I am in love with him. Wiping him gently off and handing him to Paula, I wonder who his father is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he all right?\" she asks, exhausted from the effort but nevertheless blissful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he\u0027s perfect,\" I say, and laugh softly, feeling something peculiar in my words, an intuition, per?haps, of things to come and a life to be lived. \"What are you going to call him?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaula cuddles her child near her face and the baby reaches out and touches her eyes. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she says. \"I have to think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you think about a name before?\" a nurse asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaula appears puzzled. \"No. Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath is a part of life. Calling home to see how Kalika has faired with the two police, I know the grave and the nursery sit on opposite sides of the same wall. That they are connected by a dark closet, where skeletons are hidden, and where the past is sometimes able to haunt the present. All who are born die, Krishna said. All who die will be reborn. Neither is supposed to be a cause for grief. Yet even I, with all my vast experience extending over fifty centuries, am not prepared for what is to happen next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika answers the phone. It is ten at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Mother,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew it was me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you? Did you just get home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I have been home awhile. Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitate. \"Ray must have told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You\u0027re at the hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. How did you get on with the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have trouble asking the next question. \"Are they all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to worry about them, Mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI momentarily close my eyes. \"Did you kill them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika is cool. \"It is not your concern. The baby has been born. I want to see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow does she know the baby has been born? \"No,\" I say. \"Paula\u0027s still in labor. You can\u0027t see the baby now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika is a long time in responding. \"What hospital are you at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The local one. Let me speak to Ray a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ray is not here. What is the name of this hospital?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he seldom goes out. Are you sure he\u0027s not there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not here. I\u0027m telling you the truth, Mother. You will tell me the truth. What is the name of the hospital where you\u0027re at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as a human, I do not like to be pushed around. \"All right, I will tell you. If you tell me why it is so important to you to see this baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave birth to you. I am older than you know. I understand more than you think. Try me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not your concern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Then it is also not my concern to tell you where the child is. Let me speak to Ray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika speaks softly but there is tension in her words. \"He\u0027s not here, I told you. I don\u0027t lie, Mother.\" She pauses. \"But Eric is here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear my heart pound. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s sitting on the couch beside me. He\u0027s still tied up but he\u0027s not gagged. Would you like to speak to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel as if I stand on melting ice in a freezing river that flows into a black sea. A mist rises before me and the next moments are played out in shadow. There is no way I can second-guess Kalika because all of her actions--when judged by humans or vampires alike--are inexplicable. Perhaps it was a mistake to snap at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put him on,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a moment of rumbling. It sounds as if my daughter has momentarily covered the phone with her hand. Then the line is clear. Eric does not sound well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric, it\u0027s me. Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is breathing heavily, scared. \"I don\u0027t know. She ... This person says you have to tell her something or something bad will happen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put her back on the line. Do it now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother confused moment passes. But Eric remains on the line. \"She doesn\u0027t want to talk to you. She says you have to tell me which hospital you\u0027re in. She says if you lie she will know it, and then something really bad will happen to me.\" Eric chokes with fear. \"Could you tell her the name of the hospital? Please? This girl-- She\u0027s so strong. She picked me up with one hand and carried me out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric,\" I say, \"try to convince her that I need to talk to her directly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear Eric speaking to Kalika. But Eric is forced to stay on the line. I imagine his arms and legs still bound, Kalika holding the phone up to his ear. The tears in his eyes--I can see them in my mind, and I hear the many vows I swore to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can promise you you\u0027re not going to die. I swear this to you, Eric, and I keep my word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to help me!\" he cries. \"She has long nails, and she says she\u0027s going to open the veins in my neck unless you tell her what hospital it is. Ouch! She\u0027s touching me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her the hospital is called St. Judes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s St. Judes!\" He screams. Another\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;soul-shattering pause. \"She says you\u0027re lying! Oh God! Her nails!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat pours off my head. My heart is a jackhammer vibrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kalika!\" I yell into the phone. \"Talk to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She keeps shaking her head!\" Eric weeps. \"She\u0027s scratching my neck! Jesus help me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fight to stay calm, and lose the fight. \"Eric, shove the phone in her face!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh God, I\u0027m bleeding! She\u0027s cut my neck! The blood is gushing out! Help me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric, tell her I\u0027ll tell her the name of the hospital! Tell her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe begins to choke. \"This can\u0027t be happening to me! I can\u0027t die! I don\u0027t want to die!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose are the last intelligible words he speaks. The rest--it goes on another two minutes--is slobbering sounds and pitiful weeping. It trails off into strangled gasps, then I must assume his heart has stopped beating. I sag against the wall of the hospital next to the place where the phone is attached. People stare at me from down the hall but I ignore them. Kalika lets me enjoy the silence. Another minute goes by before she returns to the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he should never have been born,\" she says calmly. \"Is that what you wanted to tell him, Mother? Your famous quote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am in shock. \"You,\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to see the baby, Mother,\" she repeats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is the name of the hospital? Where is it located?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would never tell you!\" I cry. \"You\u0027re a monster!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is as if she smiles. I hear her unspoken mirth, somehow. Yet her voice remains flat. \"And what are you? What did Krishna say to you about vampires in Kali Yuga?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can only assume Ray explained my dialogue with Krishna to Kalika. It doesn\u0027t matter--I am not in the mood for philosophical discussions. There is an ach?ing void inside me that I had always believed a daughter would fill. Well, the irony is bitter, for the real Kali has always been described as the abyss, and now the void inside me feels as if it stretches forever. Eric\u0027s death screams continue to reverberate inside my skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am human now,\" I whisper. \"I don\u0027t kill unless I have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same with me. This baby--you don\u0027t under?stand how I feel about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How you feel about it? You have no feelings, Daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not argue. I will not repeat my questions. Answer now or you will regret it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will never answer to you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika doesn\u0027t hesitate. \"There is someone else here I want you to speak with. He also sits on the couch beside me. But I have gagged him. Just a moment and I will remove his gag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no, I cringe. My demon child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour comes on the line. He strains to sound upbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sita. What\u0027s happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice is filled with agony. \"What are you doing there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your daughter called me six hours ago. She said she needed to speak to me. I think Ray gave her my number. You remember Ray and I used to be friends when we were both normal high school kids? I caught the first plane down. Your daughter met me at the airport.\" He hesitates and probably glances at Eric\u0027s body. \"She seemed really friendly at first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you not to come. I told you it was dan?gerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but I was worried about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand. Is Ray there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen him.\" Seymour coughs and I hear his fear. There is talking in the background. \"Your daughter says you\u0027re to tell me the name of the hospital where you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or something bad will happen to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t say that exactly, but I think it would be safe to bet that will be the case.\" He pauses. \"She seems to know when you\u0027re lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knows an awful lot.\" Yet Kalika is unable to \"tune into\" where I am. I find that curious, what with her incredible psychic abilities. \"Tell her I want to talk to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI catch snatches of more mumbled conversation. Seymour remains on the line. \"She says you are to tell me the name and location of the hospital.\" Seymour stops, and a note of desperation enters his voice. \"What she did to Eric--you\u0027d have to have been here. She made the old you look like a Girl Scout.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can imagine.\" I think frantically. \"Tell her I\u0027ll make her a counter proposal. I\u0027ll bring the child to her in exactly twenty-four hours. At the end of the Santa Monica Pier at ten tomorrow night. Tell her if she so much as scratches you, she\u0027ll never see this baby, if she searches the entire globe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour relays my offer. Kalika appears to listen patiently. Then the phone is covered and I imagine my daughter is talking to Seymour. A minute goes by. Finally Seymour returns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wants to know why you need twenty-four hours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the baby has to remain in an incubator for a day. Tell her that\u0027s normal hospital procedure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour repeats what I say. He doesn\u0027t cover the phone this time but I still can\u0027t hear Kalika speak-- her voice is too soft. I tire of this game. But there is a reason why my daughter doesn\u0027t let me talk to her directly at critical times. It heightens my helplessness, and her strategy says a lot about how her mind works. She is a master manipulator. I have as much hope for the two missing police officers as I do for Eric. Seymour finally relays her latest message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She says you are lying about the incubator but she doesn\u0027t care,\" he says. \"As long as you bring the baby, she will wait to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has to bring you as well,\" I say. \"Alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour acts cheerful. \"I made that a condition of the bargain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she know where the Santa Monica Pier is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both know where it is, in Santa Monica.\" I try to sound optimistic. \"Hang lose, Seymour. I\u0027ll get you out of this mess somehow.\" He pauses. \"Do what you have to, Sita.\" Kalika must have taken the phone from him. It goes dead. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/phantom-the-last-vampire-4/page-15.html","bookId":2513,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:17:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:17:35 PM"}
