But she couldn\u0027t stop squeezing Brodick\u0027s hand, though God knows she tried. Just when she was certain she couldn\u0027t take another second of the torture, it began to ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The worst is over, lass,\" Annie whispered in a voice that sounded as though she, too, wanted to have a good cry. \"Now I\u0027m going to put some soothing salve on your skin and wrap it up tight in a nice bandage. Is the pain easing yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian tried, but she found it impossible to speak just yet, and so she stiffly nodded. She stared beyond Brodick\u0027s shoulder, focusing on a splinter of wood in the far wall, and prayed she wouldn\u0027t pass out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie worked quickly, and within minutes Gillian\u0027s arm was covered in a thick white ointment and then wrapped from elbow to wrist. It was awkward work, for Gillian still refused to let go of Brodick\u0027s hand. Now that the pain was bearable, she realized he was rubbing her palm with his thumb. His countenance hadn\u0027t changed, but the little caress had a powerful effect. She felt as though he had taken her into his arms and was holding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Annie tied the ends of the bandage at her wrist, Gillian took one last calming breath and finally pulled her hand away from Brodick\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There, it\u0027s done,\" Annie whispered. \"You\u0027ll be as fit as ever tomorrow. Please try not to get the injury wet for a couple of days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian nodded again. Her voice was hoarse when she thanked the woman for her help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027ll excuse me for a moment,\" she began as she slowly stood up. Dylan took hold of her elbow and helped her. She sagged against him, slowly righted herself, and then inclined her head to Annie before she left the cottage. The soldiers bowed as she passed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian was certain they watched her from the doorway, and so she didn\u0027t give in to the urge to run to the cover of the trees. Alec was skipping barefoot in the stream while Robert stood guard. Fortunately, the child didn\u0027t notice her when she hurried in the opposite direction or hear her when the first sob escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam frowned with concern as he watched her leave, then turned back to Annie. \"Is there any of that mother\u0027s fire left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, a few drops,\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam went to the table, pulled out his dirk, and made a small cut above his wrist. All of his friends knew what he was going to do, and none of them was the least bit surprised, for Liam was known as the doubting Thomas of the group and also the most curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanting to know exactly what the liquid felt like against a raw cut, he put his arm out over the cloth Annie had left on the table and ordered, \"Pour some of the liquid on this nick. I would know how it feels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Annie thought the request was insane, she was smart enough not to remark on it. She felt as though she were in a cave with a family of bears. The men were the most ferocious warriors in the Highlands. Easily insulted and quick to react, they made frightening enemies. Yet at the same time, they were the best of allies. Annie counted herself fortunate to be related to the Buchanans, because that meant she and her husband would never by preyed upon by other more civilized clans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped forward to do as he ordered. \"Your cut is paltry compared to milady\u0027s,\" she remarked. \"So the sting won\u0027t be near as bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter making the comment, she tipped the pan and let the liquid pour into the cut. Liam didn\u0027t react. His curiosity assuaged, he nodded to Annie and then turned and strode outside. Brodick and the others followed. Surrounding him, they patiently waited for him to give his report. Aaron smiled when Liam finally spoke because his voice sounded very like the croak of a drowning frog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It hurt like a son of a bitch,\" he whispered. \"I don\u0027t know how the lass stood it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert joined them, carrying Alec like a sack of wheat over his shoulder. The child squealed with delight until he noticed that Gillian wasn\u0027t there. A look of stark terror crossed his face as he scrambled to the ground and screamed Gillian\u0027s name at the top of his lungs. Robert clapped his hand over the boy\u0027s mouth to quiet him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s just beyond the trees, Alec. She\u0027ll be right back. Calm yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears poured down the child\u0027s face as he ran to his uncle. Brodick picked him up and roughly patted his back. \"I forgot how very young you are, lad,\" he said gruffly. \"Gillian didn\u0027t leave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshamed that he had panicked, Alec hid his face in the crook of Brodick\u0027s neck. \"I thought maybe she did,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since you\u0027ve known her, has she ever left you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No… but sometimes… I get scared,\" he whispered. \"I didn\u0027t used to, but now I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" Brodick said, and with a sigh he added, \"You\u0027re safe now. I\u0027m not going to let anything happen to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what Gillian said,\" he remembered. \"She\u0027s not gonna let anyone hurt me, not ever.\" He lifted his head and stared into Brodick\u0027s eyes. \"You got to take care of her too \u0027cause she\u0027s just a puny lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick laughed. \"I haven\u0027t noticed anything puny about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she is. She cries sometimes when she thinks I\u0027m sleeping. I told her she needed you. I don\u0027t want nobody to hurt her any more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to let anyone hurt her,\" he assured the child. \"Now stop worrying and go with Robert to fetch his horse. We\u0027ll leave as soon as Gillian returns from her walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian didn\u0027t return to the clearing for another ten minutes, and it was evident from her red eyes that she\u0027d been crying. Brodick waited by his stallion while she said her thank-you to Annie, and when she hurried over to him, he lifted her up into the saddle, then swung up behind, her. She was so exhausted from her ordeal, she collapsed against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick was suddenly overwhelmed with the need to protect and comfort her. He tried to be gentle as he settled her on his lap, then wrapped his arm around her and held her close. Within minutes she was sound asleep. He nudged his mount forward and gently settled Gillian in the crook of his arm, her long curls brushing his thigh. She had the most angelic face, and with the back of his hand he brushed her cheek tenderly. He finally gave in to the desire that had been plaguing him since the moment he\u0027d laid eyes on her. He leaned down and kissed her soft lips, smiling when she wrinkled her nose and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind kept telling him to be reasonable. She was English, and God only knew, he couldn\u0027t abide anyone or anything English. He had learned his lesson well on his one foray into that hateful country when he was young and foolish. He\u0027d wanted to find a bride as fitting as Iain Maitland\u0027s wife, Judith, but the quest had been futile, for Iain had found the only treasure England had to offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr so Brodick had believed until he met Gillian. Now he wasn\u0027t so certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a courageous lass,\" he whispered. And with a nod, he added, \"I\u0027ll give you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec\u0027s needs came first. As impatient as Brodick was to get some answers, he decided to wait until after the boy had been fed to question Gillian. It was late, well past sunset, and the moon shone brightly. The woman and the child were tired. They made camp at the base of Carnith Ridge in a narrow, secluded tract of land buffered on three sides by towering pines. The clearing eased down to the grassy bank of Beech Lake, a clear, stone-bottomed basin filled with speckled trout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAaron placed a plaid on the ground near the small campfire Liam had built after noticing Gillian was shivering. She thanked him with a smile that caused the soldier to blush like a little boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian sat with her legs tucked under her on the edge of the woolen cloth while Alec sprawled like a lazy Roman statesman beside her. Brodick thought his angel looked as though she had just been to battle. Her complexion was gray; her lips were pinched, and her eyes were bright with fever, yet she didn\u0027t utter a word of complaint. She didn\u0027t want any of the food Robert offered, but she made certain that Alec filled his seemingly hollow stomach. He wanted to gulp his food down and would have done just that if she hadn\u0027t given him only small portions at a time. In a whisper, she kept reminding him to eat slowly so he wouldn\u0027t get sick again and she showed amazing endurance by listening to his nonstop chatter without losing her patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little boy was in good cheer until she suggested he bathe. He scrambled to his feet and ran to his uncle shouting, \"I don\u0027t need a bath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian was the only one who wasn\u0027t surprised by the child\u0027s outburst. \"You\u0027ll feel better after,\" she promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec vehemently shook his head. \"No, I won\u0027t,\" he shouted. \"You can\u0027t make me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec, you will not speak to the lady in such a tone,\" Brodick ordered. \"And stop hiding behind me. A Maitland doesn\u0027t cower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the boy\u0027s puzzled expression Brodick surmised he didn\u0027t know what the word \"cower\" meant, but he must have guessed it wasn\u0027t good because he immediately stepped out to stand next to his uncle. His shoulder pressed against Brodick\u0027s thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to have a bath,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to Gillian. \"She\u0027ll make me use her soap, and then I\u0027ll…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll what?\" Brodick prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll smell like a girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that, Alec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to considerable trouble borrowing this soap,\" she called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stole it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Alec, I borrowed it,\" she corrected before glancing at Brodick. \"The soap has rose petals in it, and Alec seems to think that because I use it…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child finished her explanation for her. \"It makes me smell like a girl,\" he insisted as he took a step back and warily watched her out of the corner of his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert came up behind Alec, hooked his arm around him, and carried him to the lake. Liam asked her for the soap and then followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian heard Robert promise Alec that although they would surely smell like roses after they had bathed, the sweet scent would in no way turn them into females.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec was laughing a minute later, and the crisis, it seemed, was over. She decided to stand up and stretch her legs and had made it to her knees when Aaron and Stephen rushed forward to offer their assistance. Without asking, they each grabbed an elbow and pulled her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, gentlemen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may call me Stephen,\" the dark skinned soldier said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt you have all our names straight in your mind,\" Aaron remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know most of you. Robert took Alec to the lake, Liam went with him, and I know you\u0027re Aaron, but I don\u0027t know the other names yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name\u0027s Fingal,\" a redheaded soldier announced as he pressed forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Ossian,\" another called out as he, too, moved close. He was tall and so thick through the shoulders his neck disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian suddenly felt as though she were enclosed by a six-foot male wall. The men were all staring down at her as if they considered her an oddity that had dropped from the sky to land at their feet. Had they never encountered a woman from England before? And why were they acting so peculiar now? She\u0027d been in their company a full day, and that was surely time enough for them to get past their curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped to the left so she could see between two soldiers and spotted Brodick leaning against a tree with his arms folded across his chest. He, too, was watching her, but unlike his soldiers, he wasn\u0027t smiling. She tilted her head ever so slightly toward the men pressing into her, fully expecting Brodick to catch her subtle hint and order his soldiers to give her breathing room. He didn\u0027t seem inclined to come to her assistance, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t eat much supper, milady,\" Ossian said. \"Are you feeling poorly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m feeling quite well, thank you,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to be brave in front of us,\" Stephen commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you see, sir…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please call me Stephen.\" Before she could agree, he added, \"I meant what I said. You don\u0027t have to be brave in front of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet another soldier joined the wall. He was going to be the easiest to remember, because he had a scar that crossed the left side of his face and the most handsome brown eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name\u0027s Keith,\" he reminded her. \"And you may always speak freely in front of us. We\u0027re your laird\u0027s guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he isn\u0027t my laird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan joined the conversation in time to hear her comment. He noticed none of the men contradicted her, but they were all grinning like idiots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milady, Annie Drummond gave Liam a pouch of medicine powder. You\u0027re to take half tonight, mixed with water, and the rest tomorrow night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam had returned from the lake and thrust a cup of liquid into her hand. \"I tasted it, milady,\" he said. \"It\u0027s bitter, so you might want to gulp it down quick. It smells vile too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied his blue eyes for several seconds and then asked suspiciously, \"Are you thinking to drug me to sleep, Liam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Nay, milady, we learned our lesson with Kevin Drummond. The potion will help rid you of your fever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to believe him and drank the liquid as quickly as she could. The urge to gag was overpowering, but taking deep, gasping breaths helped. Blanching, she said, \"The cure is worse than the illness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does your arm hurt?\" Stephen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she answered. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, gentlemen, I would like to sit on that boulder next to your laird so that I may speak to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingal and Ossian moved out of her way so she could get past them, while Keith grabbed the plaid from the ground and hurried ahead to put the woolen cloth on the flat surface of the rock for her to sit on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thanked him for his consideration as she took her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything else we may do for you, milady?\" Fingal asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you,\" she replied. \"You have all been very kind and gracious to me,\" she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need not thank us for doing our duty, milady,\" Ossian told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please call me Gillian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe appeared scandalized by her suggestion. \"I cannot, milady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he cannot,\" Brodick announced as he walked over to stand in front of her. \"Leave us now,\" he ordered quietly. ,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne by one the soldiers bowed to Gillian before heading to the lake. She watched them until they disappeared from view, all the while gathering her thoughts because she knew the time had come for her to give a detailed explanation of what had transpired. Lord, reliving the past was exhausting to even think about. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-18.html","bookId":1843,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM"}
