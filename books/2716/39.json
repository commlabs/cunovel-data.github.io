I used them all to make a kind of nest for my unconscious, bound sister and helped Gerard carry her down the stairs. I tuck her in as carefully as I could as he lashed her to one of the supporting beams. I left the flashlight there, pointed up, to give her some light. Then we trudged back up the steps and shut the door, putting the beam across it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this really necessary?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is what necessary?” Gerard asked. He had picked the gun back up and was examining it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Locking her in the basement. Can’t we just keep her up here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eet is better to keep her there. She is dangerous now. In the morning we will release her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made sense. Kind of. As much sense as anything could make. I looked down at poor Henri, his crumpled body on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do we do now?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerard looked up at me and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. So we made out on the couch for an hour. I don’t think it’s fair for anyone to be judging me. Yes, I know. Dead guy. Sister tied up in basement. I know, I know. But there was nothing else to do except watch Mission: Impossible in French. They say that stressful situations bring people together. It’s true. No, it’s really true. I’m sure there’s something in the DSM-IV about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yes. Couch, dark living room, rain outside, French countryside…the rest of the picture sounds right, doesn’t it? We had just paused because our lips had gone a little numb when we heard Marylou screaming in the basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is awake,” Gerard said calmly, stroking my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI buried my head into his chest and put my hands over my ears, but nothing drowned it out. She was screaming my name over and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t we let her out?” I asked. “We have the gun. We can tie her up in the kitchen where it’s warm. She’s going to need water and food….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She will be fine,” he said. There was a firmness to his voice I didn’t like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She can’t hurt us,” I said, sitting up. “There are two of us. I’m not saying that we let her run around, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no idea what she can do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dark all I could see was the outline of his hair, his bright eyes. His hand was on my leg. I felt his fingers tighten and tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The infection,” he said, “you do not understand. You do not know what eet does. You have no idea. I have seen what eet does. That is not your sister right now, Charlie. She was gone by the time you got to the part about the guillotine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The part about what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The part about the guillotine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back through my mind, back to the moment where I was standing there with Henri and he was talking and talking and I asked to use his bathroom…. He had never said anything about a guillotine. I’d cut him off. I never got the whole story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich meant that possibly…possibly I had never been infected. I had never passed it on to Marylou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Gerard seemed to know a lot about this Law of Suspects thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was sounding calmer and calmer, the tone stripped from his voice, just like it had been from Henri’s. But Gerard would never let himself listen to the story….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerard had been tied up in a chair, alone with Henri. Helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers flexed again. He was staring at me in the dark, his expression unmoving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” I said, trying to sound cool. “That part. That was the freakiest part.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t take Gerard, not physically. All I had was the gun, and I was not going to shoot him. We hadn’t known each other long, but I liked him. He was a good person. He had almost gotten himself killed trying to protect me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was thinking,” I said. “The car. We should really check the car. I’ll bet there’s enough gas. Henri was probably lying about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is there to go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To town!” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d feel better if we just looked,” I said. “I’ll just go and check. It’ll take two seconds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt his hands moving to grab my arm, but I got up first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’ll get us something to eat!” I said as cheerfully as I could. “Something besides onions!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried to the kitchen and fumbled around for the switch. We had turned the lights off because the sight was so horrible. I couldn’t find the switch, so I made my way to the table in the dark and grabbed the gun. I had to move it. Hide it. Somehow get it out of the picture. But I got exactly nowhere, because Gerard was behind me in a moment. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacations-from-hell/page-39.html","bookId":2716,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM"}
