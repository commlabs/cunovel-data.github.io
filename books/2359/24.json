It was in one of the most beautiful areas in London, with the old Georgian houses facing tree-filled private parks. Nannies in stiffly starched uniforms wheeled their small charges in status-named prams along the graveled paths, and children played their games. I miss Amy, Tracy thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy walked along the storied old streets and shopped at the greengrocers and the chemist on Elizabeth Street; she marveled at the variety of brilliantly colored flowers sold outside the little shops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunther Hartog saw to it that Tracy contributed to the right charities and met the right people. She dated wealthy dukes and impoverished earls and had numerous proposals of marriage. She was young and beautiful and rich, and she seemed so vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone thinks you\u0027re a perfect target,\" Gunther laughed. \"You\u0027ve really done splendidly for yourself, Tracy. You\u0027re set now. You have everything you\u0027ll ever need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true. She had money in safe-deposit boxes all over Europe, the house in London, and a chalet in St. Moritz. Everything she would ever need. Except for someone to share it with. Tracy thought of the life she had almost had, with a husband and a baby. Would that ever be possible for her again? She could never reveal to any man who she really was, nor could she live a lie by concealing her past. She had played so many parts, she was no longer sure who she really was, but she did know that she could never return to the life she had once had. It\u0027s all right, Tracy thought defiantly. A lot of people are lonely. Gunther is right. I have everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was giving a cocktail party the following evening, the first since her return from Venice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking forward to it,\" Gunther told her. \"Your parties are the hottest ticket in London.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy said fondly, \"Look who my sponsor is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s going to be there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody,\" Tracy told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody turned out to be one more guest than Tracy had anticipated. She had invited the Baroness Howarth, an attractive young heiress, and when Tracy saw the baroness arrive, she walked over to greet her. The greeting died on Tracy\u0027s lips. With the baroness was Jeff Stevens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tracy, darling, I don\u0027t believe you know Mr. Stevens. Jeff, this is Mrs. Tracy Whitney, your hostess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy said stiffly, \"How do you do, Mr. Stevens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff took Tracy\u0027s hand, holding it a fraction longer than necessary. \"Mrs. Tracy Whitney?\" he said. \"Of course! I was a friend of your husband\u0027s. We were together in India.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that exciting!\" Baroness Howarth exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strange, he never mentioned you,\" Tracy said coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t he, really? I\u0027m surprised. Interesting old fella. Pity he had to go the way he did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, what happened?\" Baroness Howarth asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy glared at Jeff. \"It was nothing, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing!\" Jeff said reproachfully. \"If I remember correctly, he was hanged in India.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pakistan,\" Tracy said tightly. \"And I believe I do remember my husband mentioning you. How is your wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaroness Howarth looked at Jeff. \"You never mentioned that you were married, Jeff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cecily and I are divorced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy smiled sweetly. \"I meant Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaroness Howarth was astonished. \"You\u0027ve been married twice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once,\" he said easily. \"Rose and I got an annulment. We were very young.\" He started to move away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy asked, \"But weren\u0027t there twins?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaroness Howarth exclaimed, \"Twins?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They live with their mother,\" Jeff told her. He looked at Tracy: \"I can\u0027t tell you how pleasant it\u0027s been talking to you, Mrs. Whitney, but we mustn\u0027t monopolize you.\" And he took the baroness\u0027s hand and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning Tracy ran into Jeff in an elevator at Harrods. The store was crowded with shoppers. Tracy got off at the second floor. As she left the elevator, she turned to Jeff and said in a loud, clear voice, \"By the way, how did you ever come out on that morals charge?\" The door closed, and Jeff was trapped in an elevator filled with indignant strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy lay in bed that night thinking about Jeff, and she had to laugh. He really was a charmer. A scoundrel, but an engaging one. She wondered what his relationship with Baroness Howarth was: She knew very well what his relationship with Baroness Howarth was. Jeff and I are two of a kind, Tracy thought. Neither of them would ever settle down. The life they led was too exciting and stimulating and rewarding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her thoughts toward her next job. It was going to take place in the South of France, and it would be a challenge. Gunther had told her that the police were looking for a gang. She fell asleep with a smile on her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his hotel room in Paris, Daniel Cooper was reading the reports Inspector Trignant had given him. It was 4:00 A.M., and Cooper had been poring over the papers for hours, analyzing the imaginative mix of robberies and swindles. Some of the scams Cooper was familiar with, but others were new to him. As Inspector Trignant had mentioned, all the victims had unsavory reputations. This gang apparently thinks they\u0027re Robin Hoods, Cooper reflected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had nearly finished. There were only three reports left. The one on top was headed BRUSSELS. Cooper opened the cover and glanced at the report. Two million dollars\u0027 worth of jewelry had been stolen from the wall safe of a Mr. Van Ruysen, a Belgian stockbroker, who had been involved in some questionable financial dealings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe owners were away on vacation, and the house was empty, and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Cooper caught something on the page that made his heart quicken. He went back to the first sentence and began rereading the report, focusing on every word. This one varied from the others in one significant respect: The burglar had set off an alarm, and when the police arrived, they were greeted at the door by a woman wearing a filmy negligee. Her hair was tucked into a curler cap, and her face was thickly covered with cold cream. She claimed to be a houseguest of the Van Ruysens\u0027. The police accepted her story, and by the time they were able to check it out with the absent owners, the woman and the jewelry had vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCooper laid down the report. Logic, logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspector Trignant was losing his patience. \"You\u0027re wrong. I tell you it is impossible for one woman to be responsible for all these crimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a way to check it out,\" Daniel Cooper said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to see a computer run on the dates and locations of the last few burglaries and swindles that fit into this category.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s simple enough, but\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next, I would like to get an immigration report on every female American tourist who was in those same cities at the times the crimes were committed. It\u0027s possible that she uses false passports some of the time, but the probabilities are that she also uses her real identity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspector Trignant was thoughtful. \"I see your line of reasoning, monsieur.\" He studied the little man before him and found himself half hoping that Cooper was mistaken. He was much too sure of himself. \"Very well. I will set the wheels in motion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first burglary in the series had been committed in Stockholm. The report from Interpol Sektionen Rikspolis Styrelsen, the Interpol branch in Sweden, listed the American tourists in Stockholm that week, and the names of the women were fed into a computer. The next city checked was Milan. When the names of American women tourists in Milan at the time of the burglary was cross-checked with the names of women who had been in Stockholm during that burglary, there were fifty-five names on the list. That list was checked against the names of female Americans who had been in Ireland during a swindle, and the list was reduced to fifteen. Inspector Trignant handed the printout to Daniel Cooper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll start checking these names against the Berlin swindle,\" Inspector Trignant said, \"and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel Cooper looked up. \"Don\u0027t bother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name at the top of the list was Tracy Whitney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith something concrete finally to go on, Interpol went into action. Red circulations, which meant top priority, were sent to each member nation, advising them to be on the lookout for Tracy Whitney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re also Teletyping green notices,\" Inspector Trignant told Cooper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Green notices?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We use a color-code \u0027system. A red circulation is top priority, blue is an inquiry for information about a suspect, a green notice puts police departments on warning that an individual is under suspicion and should be watched, black is an inquiry into unidentified bodies. X-D signals that a message is very urgent, while D is urgent. No matter what country Miss Whitney goes to, from the moment she checks through customs, she will be under observation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day Telephoto pictures of Tracy Whitney from the Southern Louisiana Penitentiary for Women were in the hands of Interpol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel Cooper put in a call to J. J. Reynolds\u0027s home. The phone rang a dozen times before it was answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need some information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that you, Cooper? For Christ\u0027s sake, it\u0027s four o\u0027clock in the morning here. I was sound\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to send me everything you can find on Tracy Whitney. Press clippings, videotapes\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening over\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCooper had hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day I\u0027ll kill the son of a bitch, Reynolds swore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore, Daniel Cooper had been only casually interested in Tracy Whitney. Now she was his assignment. He taped her photographs on the walls of his small Paris hotel room and read all the newspaper accounts about her. He rented a video cassette player and ran and reran the television news shots of Tracy after her sentencing, and after her release from prison. Cooper sat in his darkened room hour after hour, looking at the film, and the first glimmering of suspicion became a certainty. \"You\u0027re the gang of women, Miss Whitney,\" Danie Cooper said aloud. Then he flicked the rewind button of the cassette player once more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-tomorrow-comes/page-24.html","bookId":2359,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:06 AM"}
