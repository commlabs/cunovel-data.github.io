This was the third time this week he\u0027d left it somewhere for me to find. This time it had a note attached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about the baby. You need this for emergencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a low blow. Smiling I picked the phone up and put it in my pocket. He wasn\u0027t going to give up until I accepted it. Today was my second doctor\u0027s appointment. I\u0027d told Rush about it on our third date Monday night. He\u0027d been very determined to take me on dates all week. Last night I\u0027d begged him to just stay in and watch a movie. He had made his point. Everyone in town had seen us together. I was sure they were all sick of seeing us together by now. The thought made me smile even bigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped the phone back out of my pocket. I had forgotten to remind Rush about today\u0027s appointment last night. Now I had a phone so I could call him. His name was the first one on my contacts list under favorites. I wasn\u0027t surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt rang three times before he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I need to call you back,\" Rush\u0027s voice said in an annoyed tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay but...\" I started to say when he muffled the phone to talk to someone else. What was going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027m fine but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I gotta call you back,\" he interrupted me before I could finish then he ended the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there and stared at the phone. What had just happened? Maybe I should have asked if he was okay. When he didn\u0027t call back in the next ten minutes I decided I\u0027d better get dressed for my appointment. Surely he would call back before it was time to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later and he still hadn\u0027t called back. I debated on calling him or not. Maybe he had forgotten that I\u0027d called. I could always borrow Bethy\u0027s car and go to my appointment. On Monday when I\u0027d told him about it he\u0027d seemed excited about going. I couldn\u0027t just leave him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed his number again. It rang four times this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Nan\u0027s voice startled me. Was he at Nan\u0027s?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, um...\" I wasn\u0027t sure what to say to her. I couldn\u0027t tell her about my appointment. \"Is Rush there?\" I asked nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNan let out a hard laugh. \"Unbelievable. He told you he\u0027d call you back. Why don\u0027t you give him some breathing room? Rush doesn\u0027t do needy. He\u0027s visiting with his family. My mom and dad are here and we\u0027re getting ready to go have a family lunch. When he is ready to talk to you he will.\" Then she hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank down onto the bed. He was having a family lunch with his sister, mother and my father. That was why he hung up on me? He didn\u0027t want me to know he was with them. His family lunch came before me and the baby. This was what I\u0027d expected but then he\u0027d been so sweet and protective. Was I being needy? I wasn\u0027t a needy person but I had turned into one. Hadn\u0027t I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding up, I laid the phone down on the bed. I didn\u0027t want it anymore. Nan\u0027s hateful voice as she told me they were eating with her father taunted me. I grabbed my purse. I had time to walk down to the offices and borrow Bethy\u0027s car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sweating by the time I made it to the course offices. So much for looking nice for my appointment. That didn\u0027t matter really. It was the least of my problems. I walked up the steps and Darla met me as she was coming out of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t work today,\" she stated when she saw me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I need to borrow Bethy\u0027s car. I have a doctor\u0027s appointment in Destin that I... uh ... forgot about.\" I hated lying but telling her the truth was just more than I could handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarla studied me a moment then reached into the pocket of her slacks and pulled out her keys. \"Take my car. I\u0027ll be here all day. I don\u0027t need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to hug her but I didn\u0027t. I wasn\u0027t sure she\u0027d be comfortable with that kind of reaction to a simple doctor\u0027s appointment. \"Thank you so much. I\u0027ll put gas in it,\" I assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and waved me on. I hurried down the steps and climbed into her Cadillac to head toward Destin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drive over wasn\u0027t bad and I only had to wait fifteen minutes before they called me back to the exam room. The nurse was all smiles as she pulled out a machine with a small screen on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re only ten weeks along so to hear the baby\u0027s heartbeat we\u0027re gonna need to do an ultrasound. We should hear the heartbeat and see a little bitty baby in there too,\" she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to see my baby and hear it\u0027s heartbeat. This was real. The few times I\u0027d imagined this day I hadn\u0027t imaged being alone. I had thought someone would be with me. What if they can\u0027t find a heartbeat? What if something is wrong? I didn\u0027t want to be alone for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor walked in with a comforting smile. \"You look terrified. This is a happy moment. All your vitals are good. No need to be so nervous,\" he assured me. \"Now lay back.\" I did as he instructed and the nurse put my legs up in the stirrups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t far enough along to do this externally and be able to see or hear the baby. We need to do a transvaginal ultrasound which means we need to go in vaginally. It doesn\u0027t hurt. You\u0027ll feel some pressure from the wand, that\u0027s all,\" the nurse explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t watch them. The idea of him sticking a wand up me only made this worse. I focused on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, here we go. Easy, be still,\" the doctor instructed. I watched the black and white screen, waiting patiently for something that resembled a baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small thumping sound filled the room and it felt like my own heart had stopped beating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that...?\" I asked, suddenly unable to say anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it alright. Thumping just right too. Nice and strong,\" the doctor replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the screen and the nurse pointed to what looked like a little pea. \"There he or she is. Perfect size for ten weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t swallow past the lump in my throat. Tears rolled down my face but I didn\u0027t care. I just sat transfixed looking at the tiny miracle on the screen while his heartbeat filled the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and the baby are both doing excellently,\" the doctor said as he slowly pulled the instrument from inside me and the nurse pulled down my gown and gave me her hand to pull me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little blood tinged discharge is perfectly normal after this procedure so don\u0027t be alarmed,\" the doctor said, standing up and going over to the sink to wash his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep taking those prenatal vitamins and come back to see me in four weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. I was still in awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here you go,\" the nurse said, handing me a small pictures from my ultrasound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are mine?\" I asked, looking down at the pictures of my baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course they are,\" she replied with an amused tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I said as I looked at each one and found the small pea I knew was alive inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome.\" She patted my knee. \"You can get dressed now. Everything looks great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and wiped away another tear that had broken free and was rolling down my face. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-33.html","bookId":1994,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:58 AM"}
