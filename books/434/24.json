PROFESSOR PUFFER FROM HIS OWN POINT OF VIEW.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Shall you see him, Mr. Cunningham?” asked Bernard. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; I have engaged you, to be sure, but after what you have told me of the professor, I am curious to interview him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shouldn’t like to have him see me. He might try to get me into his power.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Wouldn’t you like to be present and hear what he has to say?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, if I could do so unobserved.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You can. There is an alcove curtained off from the main room. Go in there, and you can hear every word that passes between us.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, I shall like it very much.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You may tell the gentleman to come in,” said Walter Cunningham, addressing his servant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The latter reappeared, followed by Professor Puffer, who bowed low to the young man from whom he sought a position.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Professor Puffer?” said Cunningham inquiringly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have that honor,” said Puffer. “I called about your advertisement for a traveling companion.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you know of any one whom you can recommend?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I would be glad to accept the position myself. What salary do you propose to give?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That will be a matter of negotiation after I have made my selection.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I only wanted to make sure that it would be worth my while to accept. As you may infer from my card I am a man of reputation,” and Professor Puffer swelled out his chest and assumed a look of dignity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am glad to hear it. I consider it a compliment that a man of your standing should be willing to be my companion.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To tell the truth, Mr. Cunningham,” went on Puffer, “I was not sure till I saw you whether I should be willing, but now that I have seen you I have a strong desire to accompany you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Appearances are deceitful, you know, professor.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am willing to take the risk. How soon do you propose to start?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My dear sir, it seems to me you are going too fast. I have not yet selected you. I should like to ask you a few questions.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall have pleasure in answering, sir. Professor Puffer is always open and aboveboard.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is well. May I ask where you have held the position of professor?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “At the American University of Harvard. Doubtless you have heard of it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Certainly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have also lectured at Cornell University.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “On what subject?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ahem! On antiquities.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then that is your specialty?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Doubtless I should find your companionship very instructive.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are kind to say so.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t say so. I only say that from your account of yourself I should presume so. Of course I know of you only from your own statements. So you were a professor at Harvard University?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “During what years?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I left there a year since, after serving for a term of five years.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That was a long period. Why did you leave, may I ask?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “On account of my health. I labored so assiduously that it became seriously affected. My physician prescribed traveling for a year or more. My means are not large, partly because I have spent so much money on books and scientific research, and our salaries as professors were not munificent.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You have a large library?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “About four hundred volumes,” answered Puffer promptly. “I think those books—many of them rare—must have cost over ten thousand dollars.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where are they now?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have stored them. I could not make up my mind to sell them.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What an old humbug!” thought Bernard, as he heard the professor’s statements in the security of the alcove.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “May I ask your age, Professor Puffer?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Puffer hesitated, and finally answered, “I am forty-five.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Walter Cunningham would have been surprised if he had put any confidence in the professor’s statements, as he looked at least ten years older.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I asked because I am a young man, and though you are doubtless a man from whom I should gain instruction, I am in doubt as to whether your age would not be too great to make you a congenial companion.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My dear Mr. Cunningham,” said the professor with a genial smile, “I am not surprised to hear you say so. Forty-five no doubt seems very old to you, but I assure you I have a young heart and my company is prized by a great many young people. Why, only recently I was engaged as companion for a boy of sixteen.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Indeed! What was his name?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Bernard Brooks.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Did he seem happy in your company?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, indeed! We were like brothers. He loved me dearly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Walter Cunningham had hard work to suppress a smile, and Bernard felt like choking with laughter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Old Puffer is a worse humbug than I supposed,” he said to himself. “How I should like to burst upon him after that big falsehood! Wouldn’t he look disconcerted!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where is the boy now? I should like to see him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He has left England with some friends of the family.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Was he sorry to part with you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t like to boast, but, big boy as he is, he shed tears at leaving me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How was it that you gained such an ascendency over him?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I really can’t say. I am naturally fond of young people, and they take to me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You think, then, that I should find you an agreeable companion?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My dear Mr. Cunningham, may I say Walter, give me a week and we should be like Damon and Pythias.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose this boy Bernard was an attractive boy?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very much so. Of course he had his faults—most boys have—but as long as he gave me his affection I was willing to overlook them.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That was very kind in you. I am afraid I have faults, too.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very few, I am sure, Walter—excuse me, Mr. Cunningham.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Can you give me an idea of what you would regard as a satisfactory salary in case I engaged you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The professor brightened up. This looked encouraging.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “At Harvard I was paid three thousand dollars a year,” he said, “but then my duties were arduous. I instructed a large junior class, and gave lectures weekly to the seniors.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope you wouldn’t feel inclined to lecture me, professor.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ha, ha! very good!” said Puffer, laughing heartily. “You will have your joke. However, I only mentioned this to explain why my salary was so large. Of course I shouldn’t expect nearly as much with you. If you paid my traveling expenses and a hundred dollars a month it would satisfy me. I am not expecting to save much in this my year of recreation.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will consider your proposal. By the way, can you show me a catalogue of Harvard University with your name enrolled as professor?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am really sorry, but I don’t happen to have a catalogue with me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “One of Cornell, where I understand you gave a course of lectures, will do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I regret to say that I haven’t that either.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course I don’t doubt you, but it would be pleasant to have some confirmation of your statements.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My dear Mr. Cunningham, I hope you don’t doubt my word.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You know I have never met you before this morning. Perhaps you have some of the books you have published which you can show me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I haven’t at present, but I may be able to pick one up in the London book stores.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do so, and send it to me by messenger. I shall be too busy to see you for a week to come.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do I understand,” asked the professor insinuatingly, “that you engage me as a traveling companion?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don’t understand anything of the kind just now. Give me your address, and I will communicate with you.”.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am staying at the Brown Hotel, in Norfolk Street.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, I will note it down.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall be glad to hear from you as soon as possible, as I have another position in view.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, Professor Puffer. I won’t keep you waiting unduly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Professor Puffer bowed gracefully and retired. Then Bernard was called from his nook by Mr. Cunningham. He came out all smiles.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It was as good as a play, Mr. Cunningham,” he said. “I am very glad the professor speaks so well of me. It is quite unexpected.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It seems you shed tears at leaving him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I did they were tears of joy.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t know but I had better reconsider my decision and engage Professor Puffer instead of you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you really think you would like him better, Mr. Cunningham, you had better do so.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are not very much afraid of it. Well, Bernard, I will tell you what I did not care to tell him. I mean to start away inside of a week, and I think you had better join me at this hotel, so that we may make preparations together.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should like nothing better.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “As to the salary—you have not inquired how much I am to pay you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am content to leave that to you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well. The professor settled that matter. I will pay your traveling expenses and give you a hundred dollars a month.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But that is much more than I can earn,” said Bernard, in astonishment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very probably. I give you a large salary out of friendship.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Miss Smith, the schoolmistress, was delighted to hear of Bernard’s success. The next day he removed to Morley’s Hotel.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2955/81274.html","bookId":434,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:42:08 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:42:08 AM"}
