In fact, the story probably reads better now than it did in 1958, back when the choice came down to white or whole wheat. Leiber slyly imagines a near-future when giant machines not only harvest the wheat field, but grind flour and bake bread on the spot -- the ultimate in big farming. In this toasted tomorrow, the highly-mechanized Puffy Products is bent on producing the supremely lightest loaf. The story is what happens if bread isn\u0027t just airy, but pumped full of lighter-than-air helium. Leiber (\"Ships to the Stars\") didn\u0027t often bake up such a souffle of spoof, but he\u0027s a master in the kitchen. And \"Bread Overhead\" has just enough to say about human nature to be filling, besides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/bread-overhead.jpg","author":"Fritz Leiber","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/bread-overhead.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:30 PM"}
