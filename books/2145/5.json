So I thought I\u0027d find comfort in the only other man I could count on: my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly and my dad were playing Risk in the family room and fighting for global domination while my mom was laboring at the family computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were going to meet Alexander,\" my mom said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did, too,\" I said. I peered over my mother\u0027s shoulder. She was designing flyers forDullville\u0027s Annual Art Auction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plopped down on the La-Z-Boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was school?\" my dad wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pits,\" I said. \"I have a partnered English assignment and it\u0027s with Trevor. Matt picked Becky, and Trevor deliberately picked me. His sole mission in this world is to ruin my life. I\u0027m not going to get into any college. I\u0027ll be forced to live here for the rest of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents looked at each other in horror. The thought of a thirty-year-old gothic slacker running to raves and getting tattoos instead of jobs wasn\u0027t what they had planned. It didn\u0027t fit with their golf- outings -and-mixed-doubles- filled retirement plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t I be homeschooled like Alexander?\" I whined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I saw Alexander\u0027s parents,\" Billy said suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" I asked. \"You\u0027re not supposed to see them before I do!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry and I left Shirley\u0027s Bakery,\" he said, rolling dice, \"and were cutting through the square when we spotted a lady anda man, dressed from head to toe in black, enter the Main Street Gallery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped up from my chair and faced my brother. \"Did you see them up close?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was too far away,\" he said, focused on his army. He was preparing to overtakeSiberia . \"But I\u0027m sure it was them. No one in town is that ghost white. Their skin was so pale you could almost see through it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking forward to meeting them. I have to admit, I\u0027m quite curious about them, too,\" my father said, moving his troops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You?\"I asked. \"What about me? Alexander hasn\u0027t even invited me over. There must be something wrong with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duh,\" Billy mumbled under his breath. \"I\u0027ve been telling you that for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was gearing up to wipe out his Asian invasion when he covered his pieces with his scrawny body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think it\u0027s me?\" I asked my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not...They just arrived in town. They\u0027re probably still settling in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not so sure... Something seems odd. Alexander never breaks dates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to the confident girl Iraised ?\" she asked. \"You never cared what anyone thought of you. Not teachers, classmates, or even us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom was right. But these people weren\u0027t regular people. These were the love of my life\u0027s parents. And they were vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax,\" my dad said as I started for my room. \"Alexander\u0027s not keeping you a secret. Perhaps he\u0027s concerned about what you\u0027ll think of hisparents\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took my dad\u0027s words to heart. I had never thought of this situation from Alexander\u0027s perspective before. I remembered how embarrassed I was when Alexander first met my totally conservative mom and dad the night of the Snow Ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI surprised my dad and gave him a big hug. Though my dad was totally old school, at times like this he was the hippestguy on the planet. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-5.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
