I told him that I had come to find him in the afternoon with an old acquaintance of mine, who was going to the Austrian provinces, and that I had advised you to ask introductions from him to his friends there. He was a good deal interested, as I knew he would be, in what I told him about the objects of your journey. \u0027I\u0027m very sorry,\u0027 he said, \u0027that I did not see your friend, for I could have given him letters which I don\u0027t doubt would have been of great use to him. But wait a few minutes,\u0027 said he, \u0027and I\u0027ll write a few lines now.\u0027 Here they are,\" continued Vinal, giving to Morton four or five notes of introduction. \"You can put them in your pocket, and use them or not, as you may find convenient.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m very much obliged to you,\" said Morton. \"Tell Professor Speyer that I am greatly indebted to his kindness, and shall be happy to avail myself of it. You are looking very pale; are you ill?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, not at all,\" stammered Vinal, \"but, what is nearly as bad, I have been kept awake all night with a raging toothache.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had been awake all night, but not with toothache.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There is one consolation for that trouble; cold steel will cure it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, but the remedy is none of the pleasantest.

Happiness blinded him, and he was in no mood to doubt of human nature.

They all spoke of Morton as interested in a common object with the person addressed; but, with this exception, there was nothing in them which drew his attention, especially as they were in German, a language with which he was not very familiar. As for the circumstance of their having been given at all to a person whom the writer had never seen, Morton accounted for it on the score of the good natured professor\u0027s desire to oblige his valued friend Vinal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2850/78649.html","bookId":1216,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:18:34 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:18:34 AM"}
