From the depths below, a large shape rolled into view, belly up, but still squirming, teeth gnashing. It was a massive tiger shark, over six meters. The glowing waters frothed over its form, bubbling and turning the milky water into red wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan realized it wasn\u0027t water that was bubbling over the shark\u0027s belly, but its own flesh, boiling off in wide patches. The horrible sight sank away. But across the milky seas, other shapes rolled to the surface, thrashing or already dead: porpoises, sea turtles, fish by the hundreds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApplegate took a step away from the rail. \"It seems these bacteria have found more than just algae to feed on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGregg turned to stare at her. \"Susan . ..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could not look away from the deadly vista. Despite the horror, she could not deny a twinge of scientific curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally turned to him, slightly irritated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were diving,\" he explained, and pointed. \"In that water. All day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So? We were all in the water at least some time. Even Oscar did some dog-paddling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband would not meet her gaze. He remained focused on where she was scratching her forearm. The wet suit sometimes chafed her limbs. But the worry in his tight face drew her attention to her forearm. Her skin was pebbled in a severe rash, made worse by her scratching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she stared, bruising red welts bloomed on her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gaped in disbelief. \"Dear God . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she also knew the horrible truth. its... it\u0027s in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12 Dark Madonna\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 1, 10:34 a.m. Venice, Italy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was being hunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefano Gallo hurried across the open plaza square. The morning sun already baked the stones of the piazza, and the usual throng of tourists sought shady spots or crowded the gelato shop that lay within the shadow of St. Mark\u0027s Basilica. But this most lofty of all of Venice\u0027s landmarks, with its towering Byzantine facade, massive bronze horses, and domed cupolas, was not his goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even such a blessed sanctuary could offer him protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis steps became more rushed as he passed by the basilica. The piazza\u0027s pigeons scattered from his path as he stumbled through them, heedless of their flapping flight. He was beyond stealth. He had already been discovered. He had spotted the young Egyptian with the black eyes and trimmed beard as he\u0027d entered the far side of the square. Their gazes had locked. The man was now dressed in a dark suit that flowed like oil from his wide, sharp shoulders. The first time the man had approached Stefano he had claimed to be an archaeology student out of Budapest, representing an old friend and colleague from the University of Athens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Egyptian had come to the Museo Archeologico searching for a specific bit of antiquity. A minor treasure. An obelisk from his country. The Egyptian, financed by his government, wished it returned to his homeland. He had come with a sizable payment, bonded cashier notes. Stefano, one of the museum\u0027s curators, was not above accepting such a bribe; his wife\u0027s escalating medical bills threatened to evict them from their small apartment. To collect such secret payment was not untoward; for the past two decades the Egyptian government had been buying back national treasures out of private collections and pressuring museums to return what rightfully belonged in Egypt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Stefano had agreed, promising at first to deliver it up. What was one small nondescript stone obelisk? The object had remained crated for almost a full century according to the manifest. And its terse description probably explained why: Unmarked marble obelisk, excavated in Tanis, dated to the late dynastic period (26th Dynasty, 615 B.C). There was nothing unusual or particularly intriguing, unless one looked closer, followed its trail of provenance. It had come out of a collection that graced one of the Musei Vaticani in Rome: the Gregorian Egyptian Museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow it ended up in the vaults here in Venice was unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen yesterday morning, Stefano had received a newspaper clipping, sent by private courier in an envelope with a single symbol stamped into a wax seal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Greek letter sigma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still did not understand the significance of the seal, but he did understand the import of the enclosed clipping. A single article, dated three days prior, reported news of a man\u0027s body found on an Aegean beach, his throat slashed, his body bloated and nested with feasting eels. An especially fierce storm surge had returned the body from its watery grave. Dental records identified the body as that of his university colleague, the one who had reportedly sent the Egyptian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man had been dead for weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock had caused Stefano to act rashly. He clutched the heavy object to his bosom, wrapped in sackcloth and still prickling with packing hay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefano had stolen the obelisk from the vault, knowing the act would put him, his wife, his whole family, at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d had no choice. Along with the dire article, the sealed envelope had contained a single message, unsigned, but plainly scrawled in a hurry, in a woman\u0027s hand, a warning. What the note contended seemed impossible, incredible, but he had tested the claim himself. It had proved true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears threatened as he ran, a sob choked his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe obelisk must not fall into the hands of the Egyptian. Still, it was a burden he refused to shoulder any longer than necessary. His wife, his daughter . . . he pictured the blotted body of his colleague. Would the same befall his family?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Maria, what have I done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one who could take this burden from him. The one who had sent the envelope, a warning sealed with a Greek letter. At the end of her note, a place had been named, along with a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow the Egyptian had discovered his theft, must have sensed Stefano was going to betray him. So he had come for it at dawn. Stefano had barely escaped his offices. He had fled on foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not fast enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked over his shoulder. The Egyptian had vanished into the milling crowd of tourists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning back around, Stefano stumbled through the shadow of the square\u0027s bell tower, the Campanile di San Marco. Once the brick tower had served as the city\u0027s watchtower, overlooking the nearby docks and guarding the port. Would that it could protect him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis goal lay across a small piazzetta. Ahead rose the Palazzo Ducal, the fourteenth-century palace of Venice\u0027s former dukes. Its two levels of Gothic arches beckoned, offering salvation in Istrian stone and rosy Veronese marble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClutching his prize, he stumbled across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she still there? Would she take the burden?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rushed toward the sheltering shadows, escaping the blaze of the sun and the glare off the neighboring sea. He needed to be lost in the maze of the palace. Besides housing the duke\u0027s personal residence, the Palazzo Ducal also served as a governmental office building, a courthouse, a council chamber, even an old prison. A newer prison rose across the canal behind the palace, connected by an arched bridge, the infamous Bridge of Sighs, over which Casanova had once made his escape, the only prisoner ever to break out of the palace\u0027s cells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Stefano ducked under the overhanging stretch of loggia, he prayed to the ghost of Casanova to protect his own flight. He even allowed himself a small breath of relief as he sank into the shadows. He knew the palace well. It was easy to get lost in its maze of corridors, a ready place for a clandestine rendezvous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr so he placed his faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe entered the palace through the western archway, flowing in with a few tourists. Ahead opened the palace\u0027s courtyard with its two ancient wells and the magnificent marble staircase, the Scala dei Giganti, the Giant\u0027s Stairs. Stefano skirted the courtyard, avoiding the sun now that he had escaped it. He pushed through a small, private door and followed a series of administrative rooms. They ended at the old inquisitor\u0027s office, where many poor souls had suffered interrogations of the most pained and brutal sort. Not stopping, Stefano continued into the neighboring stone torture chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door slammed somewhere behind him, causing him to jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clutched his prize even tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instructions had been specific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a narrow back stairway, he wended down into the palace\u0027s deepest dungeons, the Pozzi, or Wells. It was here the most notorious prisoners had been held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was also where he was to make his rendezvous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefano pictured the Greek sigil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did it mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe entered the dank hall, broken by black stone cells, too low for a prisoner to stand erect. Here the imprisoned froze during winter or died of thirst during the long Venetian summers, many forgotten by all except the rats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefano clicked on a small penlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis lowest level of the Pozzi appeared deserted. As he continued deeper, Stefano\u0027s steps echoed off the stone walls, sounding like someone following him. His chest squeezed with the fear. He slowed. Was he too late? He found himself holding his breath, suddenly wishing for the sunlight he had fled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped, a tremble quaking through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if sensing his hesitation, a light flared, coming from the last cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" he asked. \"Chi e la?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scrape of heel on stone, followed by a soft voice, in Italian, accented subtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sent you the note, Signore Gallo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lithe figure stepped out into the corridor, a small flashlight in her hand. The glare made it hard to discern her features, even when she lowered her flashlight. She was dressed all in black leather, hugging tight to hips and breast. Her features were further obscured by a head scarf, wrapped in a bedouin style, obscuring her features fully, except her eyes that reflected a glint of her light. She moved with an unhurried grace that helped calm the thudding of his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe appeared out of the shadows like some dark Madonna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the artifact?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I do,\" he stammered, and took a step toward her. He held out the obelisk, letting the sackcloth fall away. \"I want nothing more to do with it. You said you could take it somewhere safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can.\" She motioned for him to set it down on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crouched and rested the Egyptian stone spire on the floor, glad to be rid of it. The obelisk, carved of black marble, rose from a square base, ten centimeters per side, and tapered to a pyramidal point forty centimeters tall. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-3.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
