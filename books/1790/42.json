Nathan\u0027s determined to start over,\" he added with a nod toward the papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, love in bloom,\" Sir Richards said. \"Sara will certainly be pleased with his thoughtfulness. God knows she\u0027s deserving of some happiness. It was hard on her today. Why, the look on her face when the prince made mention of her mother nearly broke my heart, Caine, and I\u0027m certainly not given to emotion as you well know. Lady Sara looked so frightened. I wanted to reach out to her, to pat her and tell her it would all wash out. I\u0027m not usually so demonstrative, but I tell you I had to restrain myself from going over to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine looked bewildered. \"I don\u0027t recall the prince mentioning Sara\u0027s mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe both you and Nathan were out of the room at the time,\" Richards said. \"Yes, that\u0027s right,\" he added with a nod. \"Sara sat all alone. Nathan had gone to fetch some water for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara isn\u0027t in the washroom,\" Nathan bellowed from the doorway. \"Damn it, Richards, where\u0027d you send her? Down the street, for God\u0027s sake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine stood up. \"Nathan, we might have a problem.\" His voice was harsh from worry. \"Sir Richards, tell us exactly what the prince said about Sara\u0027s mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director was already pushing his chair back so that he could stand up. He wasn\u0027t certain what the danger was, but the scent was there, permeating the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winston demanded to know who told us about Grant. The prince told him it was his wife who gave us the name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Nathan and Caine were already running out the door. \"Surely Winston wouldn\u0027t dare touch his wife or his daughter,\" Sir Richards muttered as he chased after the two men. \"You\u0027re thinking that\u0027s where Sara went, aren\u0027t you? Charles,\" he shouted over his shoulder, \"bring the carriage around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan reached the ground level with Caine right on his heels when Sir Richards turned the corner of the landing above. \"Nathan, you don\u0027t believe Winston is capable of hurting either his wife or his daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan threw the door open and ran out onto the sidewalk. \"No,\" he shouted over his shoulder. \"Winston won\u0027t touch them. He\u0027ll leave it to his brother to mete out the punishment. That\u0027s how the bastard operates. Damn it, Sara took your carriage, Caine. God, we\u0027ve got to get to her before Henry does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hack was racing down the street. Nathan seized his opportunity. He wasn\u0027t about to wait for the director\u0027s carriage. He ran into the street, braced himself for the struggle, and grabbed the reins of the two horses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw his shoulder into the side of the horse closer to him. Caine added his strength, and the vehicle came to a screeching stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver was thrown on top of the vehicle. He started shouting. The fare, a blond-headed young man with spectacles and a squint, stuck his head out the window to see what all the commotion was about just as Nathan pulled the door open. Before the man knew what had happened Nathan had tossed him to the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine shouted directions to the driver while Sir Richards helped the stranger to his feet. The director was being very solicitous until he realized he was about to be left behind. He rudely shoved the man back to the ground and jumped inside the hack before Caine could pull the door closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one said a word on the ride over to the Winchesters\u0027 townhouse. Nathan was shaking with terror. For the first time in his life he rebelled against the isolation he\u0027d always enforced upon himself. He needed her, and dear God, if something happened to her before he could prove to her that he could be worthy, could love her as much as she deserved to be loved, he didn\u0027t think he could go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the space of those long, unbearable minutes Nathan learned how to pray. He felt as unskilled as an atheist, couldn\u0027t remember a single prayer from childhood days, and so ended up simply begging God\u0027s mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow he needed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ride over to her mother\u0027s residence wasn\u0027t quite as traumatic for Sara. She wasn\u0027t in a panic because she knew she had enough time to get to her mother first. Her father would have to go to his brother\u0027s townhouse. That ride would take him at least twenty minutes. Then he\u0027d have to spend at least fifteen more minutes working his brother into a rage for the injustices dealt to him. Assuming that Henry would certainly be in the throes of his daily hangover, it would take him time to clear his head and get dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was also the oddly comforting fact that surely in that amount of time Nathan would put the pieces together and figure out she wasn\u0027t in the washroom. She knew he\u0027d come after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t give up on me. His whispered command once again intruded upon her thoughts. She immediately tried to get angry over the insulting demand. How dare he think she\u0027d given up on him. How dare he…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t work herself up into a proper fury, for in her heart she wasn\u0027t at all certain she had the right to be outraged. Had she given up on him? No, of course not, she told herself. The simple fact was that Nathan didn\u0027t love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had shown her consideration, though. She\u0027d give him that much. She remembered how he\u0027d rubbed her back when she\u0027d been in such embarrassing agony with her monthly cramps. His touch had been so gentle, so soothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a gentle lover, too. Not that he\u0027d ever given her loving words when he was caressing her. But he\u0027d shown her kindness, patience, and never once had she truly been afraid of him. Never once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d spent long hours teaching her so many little things he thought she needed to know to become self-sufficient. She thought it was because he didn\u0027t want to watch out for her. And while she did consider it her duty to protect those she loved, like her mother, she left the task of her own protection to her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike her mother…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God, Nora had been right. Without realizing it Sara had been following in her mother\u0027s path. She had been determined to become dependent on her husband. If Nathan had turned out to be a cruel, selfish man like her father, would Sara have learned how to cringe whenever he raised his voice to her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. No, she would never allow any man to terrorize her. Nathan had made her realize her own strength. She could survive alone, and she certainly could stand up for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t taught her how to defend herself because he didn\u0027t want to be bothered with the chore of watching out for her. He just didn\u0027t want anything to happen to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a kind man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara burst into tears. Why couldn\u0027t he love her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t give up on me. If he didn\u0027t love her, why did he care if she gave up on him or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara was so consumed with her thoughts, she didn\u0027t realize the carriage had stopped until Caine\u0027s driver shouted down to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked the driver to wait, then hurried up the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler, a new man hired by her father, told her that both her mother and her sister had gone out for the afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara didn\u0027t believe him. She pushed her way past the servant and hurried up the stairs to the bedroom level to see for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler sniffed at her lack of manners and retired to the back of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bedrooms were empty. Sara was at first relieved, then she realized she would have to find her mother before either of the Winchester men did. She went through the stack of invitations on top of her mother\u0027s writing table, but none gave her a clue as to the afternoon activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to go back downstairs and force the information out of the servants. Surely one of them knew where her mother had gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara had just reached the landing when the front door opened. She thought it was her mother returning home and started down the steps. She stopped midway when Uncle Henry strutted into the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw her at once. The sneer on his face made her stomach lurch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father went directly to you with his anger, didn\u0027t he?\" she called out, contempt evident in her voice. \"I knew he would,\" she added. \"It\u0027s the only thing he\u0027s predictable about. He thinks he\u0027s so cunning to let his drunken brother dole out the punishment whenever he\u0027s upset. Father\u0027s waiting at White\u0027s, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer uncle\u0027s eyes narrowed into slits. \"Your mother should have her tongue cut out for turning against her husband. This isn\u0027t your business, Sara. Get out of my way. I\u0027m going to have a word with your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara shook her head. \"I won\u0027t let you speak to her,\" she shouted. \"Not now, not tomorrow, not ever. If I have to force Mother, I will, but she\u0027s going to leave London. A nice visit with her sister will be just the thing. She might even realize she doesn\u0027t want to come back here again. God, I hope so. Mother deserves a little joy in her life. I\u0027m going to see that she gets it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry kicked the door shut behind him. He knew better than to strike Sara, for he remembered the threat her husband had made when he\u0027d walked into the tavern to get his bride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go back to the cur you\u0027re married to,\" he shouted. \"Victoria,\" he added in a screech. \"Get down here. I\u0027m wanting a word with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother isn\u0027t here. Now you get out. The sight of you makes me ill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry started toward the steps. He stopped when he spotted the brass umbrella stand in the corner. He was too furious to consider the consequences. The chit needed to learn a lesson, he thought to himself. Just one good hit to rid her of her insolence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for the ivory-tipped walking stick. Just one good hit…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Sixteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe damn near killed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTortured screams echoed into the street. The carriage hadn\u0027t come to a complete stop before Nathan jumped to the pavement and started up the steps. The god-awful screaming made him crazed with fear for his Sara—so crazed, in fact, that he didn\u0027t stop to notice it was a man\u0027s voice making all the noise. He didn\u0027t stop to open the door, either. He went through it. The frame bounded off his shoulder and landed with a thud on Henry Winchester\u0027s head. The heavy piece of wood muffled some of the louder cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan wasn\u0027t at all prepared for the sight he came upon. He was so stunned, he stopped dead in his tracks. Caine and Sir Richards crashed into his back. Caine let out a low grunt. He felt as though he\u0027d just run into a block of steel. Both he and Sir Richards recovered their balance and moved to the side to see what held Nathan transfixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was difficult for the men to take in. Henry Winchester was shriveled up in a fetal position on the floor in the center of the large foyer. His hands were clutching his groin. The man was literally writhing about in agony, and when he rolled over their way Sir Richards and Caine immediately noticed his bloody nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan was staring at Sara. She was standing at the bottom of the steps. She looked thoroughly composed, absolutely beautiful, and completely unharmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was all right. The bastard hadn\u0027t gotten to her. Yes, she was all right. Nathan kept repeating that fact inside his mind in an attempt to calm down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t work. His hands were shaking. He decided he needed to hear her tell him she was all right before he could start breathing normally again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara?\" Nathan whispered her name in such a hoarse whisper, he doubted she could hear him above the racket her Uncle Henry was making. He tried again. \"Sara? Are you all right? He didn\u0027t hurt you, did he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anguish in her husband\u0027s voice was almost her undoing. Tears filled her eyes, and she realized that Nathan was just as misty. The look on his face made her heart ache. He looked so… scared, so vulnerable… so loving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God, he did love her. It was so apparent to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou love me, she wanted to shout. She didn\u0027t, of course, because there were other people present. But he loved her. She couldn\u0027t speak, couldn\u0027t quit smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started toward her husband, then remembered her audience. She turned to Caine and Sir Richards and made a perfect curtsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine grinned. Sir Richards was in the middle of an acknowledging bow when he caught himself. \"What happened here?\" he demanded in a fluster of authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, Sara, answer me,\" Nathan strangled out at the same time. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her gaze to her husband. \"Yes, Nathan. I\u0027m quite all right. Thank you for inquiring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at her uncle. \"Uncle Henry had a little mishap,\" she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director bent on one knee and lifted a remnant of the door away from Henry\u0027s chest. \"I surmised as much, my dear,\" he said to Sara. He tossed the piece of wood aside, then frowned at Henry. \"For the love of God, man, quit that weeping. It isn\u0027t dignified. Did the door fell you when Nathan came charging through? Speak up, Winchester. I can\u0027t catch a word of your blubbering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine had already put the pieces together. Sara was rubbing the back of her right hand in what appeared to be an attempt to work out the sting. Henry was clutching his groin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle Henry had his mishap before the door fell on him,\" Sara explained. She sounded incredibly cheerful, and she was smiling at Nathan when she made that statement. Nathan still wasn\u0027t calm enough to reason it through. He couldn\u0027t understand why his wife looked so damned pleased with herself. Hadn\u0027t she realized the danger she\u0027d been in? Hell, his nerves still felt as raw as a fresh wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she was slowly walking toward him, and all he could think about was taking her into his arms. He was never going to let go of her, not even when he lectured her on her sinful habit of taking off on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine\u0027s smile proved catching. The director found himself smiling, too, though he still didn\u0027t know what was so amusing. He stood up and turned to Sara. \"Please satisfy my curiosity and tell me what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t about to explain. If she told him exactly what she\u0027d done, the director would certainly be appalled by her unladylike behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan wouldn\u0027t be appalled. He\u0027d be proud of her. Sara couldn\u0027t wait until they were alone and she could give him all the details, blow by satisfying blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle Henry tripped over a walking stick,\" she said, unable to stop smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan finally came out of his stupor and took a good look around him. Sara had just reached his side when he grabbed hold of her and stared intently at the red splotches on the back of her right hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat low growl she found adorable was working its way up Nathan\u0027s throat. She could also see the rage coming over him. She wasn\u0027t at all frightened, however, for she knew he would never turn his anger against her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want him to get all worked up on her behalf. Sara wrapped her arms around her husband\u0027s waist and hugged him tight. \"I\u0027m really all right, Nathan,\" she whispered. \"You mustn\u0027t worry so.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-42.html","bookId":1790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM"}
