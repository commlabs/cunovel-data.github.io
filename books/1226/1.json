{"id":18948,"no":1,"title":"Introductory Note","content":"\u0026nbsp;Line under heading \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The various prose sketches here reprinted were first published by Melville, some in Harper\u0027s and some in Putnam\u0027s magazines, during the years from 1850 to 1856. \"Hawthorne and His Mosses,\" the only piece of criticism in this collection, is particularly interesting viewed in the light of Melville\u0027s friendship with Hawthorne while they were neighbors at Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The other sketches cover a variety of homely subjects treated by Melville with a fresh humor, richly phrased and curiously personal. Longer and in some ways more ambitious prose pieces written about this same time have been collected under the title of \"Piazza Tales,\" but none of the sketches which follow have heretofore been gathered into a book. This has now been done not only to answer a growing demand for accessible reprints of Melville\u0027s work but also in response to the literary appeal of the sketches themselves. The author\u0027s phraseology and punctuation have, of course, been, followed exactly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n H.
