{"id":90976,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u003cp\u003eI here was a clatter above Jenny-the sound of a chain racketing along wood. She reacted instinctively, before rational thought could interfere. She seized the body in the china blue dress and pulled it off the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot fast enough. The huge disk came straight down-and then veered sideways, knocked out of line by something that leaped up by Jenny like black lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee hit the disk with both heels, one after the other, so fast that the blows looked simultaneous. The disk swerved, crashing down beside the table. Then the table crashed into Dee, who\u0027d just regained her feet. Dee sprawled on the floor beside Jenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bundle in Jenny\u0027s arms stirred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock had wiped all the dreadful thoughts out of her mind, all the pictures of decomposing faces that might have looked up at her from under Summer\u0027s fluff of curls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it seemed quite natural to see Summer\u0027s own small face looking up, with cheeks like rain-washed roses and blinking, sleep-encrusted blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer yawned and rubbed at her lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so tired-what was the crash?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee had picked herself up and was approaching gingerly. So were Audrey and Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it dead?\" Michael said huskily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny knew what he meant. Just because Summer could talk, that didn\u0027t mean she wasn\u0027t dead-not here in the Shadow World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Summer\u0027s weight was warm in Jenny\u0027s arms, and Summer\u0027s flesh looked like real flesh, not like plastic or that hideous goo that Slug\u0027s body had been wearing. Summer looked-alive. Summer looked-all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny felt very dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t say anything. None of them could. They all just stared at Summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer\u0027s eyes grew large and timid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" she said faintly. \"What\u0027s... how long was I asleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey leaned over slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summer ... ?\" she whispered, as if she found the word more foreign than any in all the languages she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" Summer wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long do you think you were asleep?\" Michael croaked. \"What\u0027s the last thing you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I was in that hallway ... and then you found me ... and then we went into my bedroom. Only it wasn\u0027t my bedroom. And then ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped, her mouth open like a baby bird\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiddo,\" Dee said and waved a hand helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something bad happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but you don\u0027t have to think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember it. Just that it was bad. Did I get hurt? Did I faint?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee looked at Jenny. Jenny looked at Audrey and Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s really her,\" Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s her,\" Dee said. She reached for Summer briskly-almost feverishly, examining Summer\u0027s arms and legs. \"Are you okay? Really okay? Does everything work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summer,\" Jenny said abruptly, with a hysterical laugh. She put two fingers to her lips and began crying just as hysterically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was catching. Audrey began laughing and crying at the same time. Michael sniffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny didn\u0027t know what was happening to her. Her heart was skipping-but then it had been skipping all night. She felt dizzy-but she\u0027d been feeling dizzy on and off ever since she\u0027d stepped into the Shadow World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was different. It was like pain, but it wasn\u0027t pain. It coursed through her, flooding up from her toes in an irresistible skyward rush. She actually felt lighter, as if she were lifting toward the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll she could think was oh, thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind still couldn\u0027t get around the concepnt that Summer was here, in her own body, talking and moving and apparently well and strong. Not even bruised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, thank you, thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had an urge to bundle Summer up and hustle her away somewhere, pack her in tissue paper, keep her safe. Get her to sanctuary before anything else could happen to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there wasn\u0027t any sanctuary, not here. Summer was alive, but still in danger. She\u0027d have to take her chances like the rest of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd anything might happen before they got home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis thought actually helped Jenny, stopped the giddiness and the trembling inside her. She\u0027d been trying to picture Summer\u0027s little brother Cam, with his tough face and his wistful blue eyes, and what he\u0027d look like when he saw his sister again. The picture wouldn\u0027t come; it was too good, scary good. But now that she realized it might very well never happen, she felt calmer. It seemed more possible now that it was only a possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try to get you out, though,\" she said, and only realized she\u0027d said it aloud when Summer looked up at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you will,\" Summer said, like a trusting child. \"I hate this paper house. Do we look for Zach now? Isn\u0027t he next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny felt another jolt of improbability as she realized how much they needed to explain to Summer. Wherever Summer had been since they\u0027d last seen her, she obviously didn\u0027t remember anything about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael said, shooting a pointed glance at Jenny. \"This place gives me the creeps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. They had to get out of this chamber of horrors before any other logs fell on them. The shift to ordinary concerns stopped the last of the trembling inside Jenny. It wasn\u0027t that she was less happy-she was more happy, now that she was getting over her disbelief. The first joy had been painful, but now a great quietness came over her. Whatever else happened, she could get Summer out of the fun house, to a place where they could rest and talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she stood, helping Dee help Summer up, she saw eyes in the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes like the ones she\u0027d seen in the mine shaft. They burned with a pale fire. They were watching from the corridor behind Jenny, and they were full of malice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny slung an arm around Summer\u0027s shoulders, turning Summer so she wouldn\u0027t see them. \"This way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey won\u0027t touch you. I promise. I won\u0027t let them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe meant it. Her happiness wrapped her in a cloak of protection. The Shadow Men could stare all they wanted, but they wouldn\u0027t get near Summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her relief, the torture chamber part of the fun house ended with Summer\u0027s scene. The narrow corridor wound back and forth a few turns and then opened into a small room with a revolving door and a neon sign that read: exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Made it,\" Dee breathed. Jenny wondered if she had seen the eyes, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer wriggled out from under Jenny\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, look at this.\" Her voice was just as it had always been, light and childish, eager. Jenny could hardly believe she was hearing it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer was standing in front of a candy machine like the ones Jenny had seen in the arcade. She thrust her small fingers into the one pocket of her shirtdress. \"Do any of you guys have a quarter? I\u0027m dying for some chocolate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh.\" Michael looked at Jenny. \"I don\u0027t know if we better...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should get out of here,\" Dee said positively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m starving. And it\u0027ll only take one second-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael looked at Jenny again, and Jenny said, \"Oh, give it to her so we can get out,\" and looked back into the black corridor for the eyes. The candy peanuts had been okay; she supposed this would be. She could hear the sound of Summer putting the quarter in and turning the handle, and then the patter of falling M\u0026amp;M\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope I didn\u0027t get a lot of green ones,\" Summer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee said, \"I\u0027ll open it. Never mind why, Summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just don\u0027t put your hand in,\" Audrey said, and Jenny turned around in time to see the look Dee gave Audrey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the candies were spilling into Dee\u0027s hand-and Dee gave a kind of yelp that made Jenny forget everything and run to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind had plenty of time to instantaneously flash over all the horrible things that might have come out of that machine. Dead buss, red-hot pennies, blobs of acid. Why hadn\u0027t she thought-? But she was still a step away when she saw the answer gleaming in the pile of candy on Dee\u0027s palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five brown ones, four yellows, two greens, one red, and a gold coin,\" Michael said coolly, assessing the pile. \"Not bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny just beat Dee gently on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put it somewhere safe,\" Dee said, and Jenny plucked it from the mound and held it tightly, feeling its coolness before it warmed in her hand. She rubbed her thumb against the engraving. When she opened her hand again, the coin was as rich and shiny as molten gold straight from the forge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she put it in her shirt pocket and buttoned the flap. \"Come on, let\u0027s go. We did it, we did everything we could here. Summer and a coin.\" She smiled at Summer, who was looking utterly mystified. \"We\u0027ll explain outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer accepted the pile of M\u0026amp;M\u0027s from Dee and looked somewhat comforted. They all began to go through the revolving door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would only take one at a time, and Jenny pushed Summer in front of her. Then she stepped into the next segment of the iron cage and pushed briskly on the thick metal arms, to get out of the fun house as soon as possible. Between the moving arms she could see only darkness-it was pitch black outside, and she couldn\u0027t even glimpse Summer\u0027s hair....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew something was wrong even before she stepped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t the outside. It was a room. And the others weren\u0027t with her, because she couldn\u0027t see any flashlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, where am I now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached behind her and wasn\u0027t at all surprised not to find the iron arms of the revolving door. She was somewhere with no light and no exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I suppose I see the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, a small shimmering light went on, and she saw a boy in a black duster jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julian?\" He looked so different. \"Julian!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny ran toward him, joining him in the shadows. He didn\u0027t move an inch to come toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time she\u0027d ever been glad to see him. But she was glad: happiness was blossoming like a flower inside her, petals opening frantically. She stopped in front of him, breathless and triumphant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was you, wasn\u0027t it? You gave us Summer back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave you Summer back.\" His voice was subdued, moody. He was more modestly dressed than Jenny had ever seen him. The black duster jacket wrapped him in shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. You don\u0027t know-\" She paused. Julian probably did know. He\u0027d watched Jenny for years; he knew what Summer meant to her. He probably even knew she\u0027d always felt that Summer\u0027s death was her fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she-okay? Like, really, underneath?\" Jenny asked, afraid to say the words, afraid of the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s okay. She\u0027s been asleep. Just like the princess who pricked her finger on a spindle. Good as new, now.\" But Julian spoke flatly and he still looked moody. Almost-distrustful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny ignored it and met the shadowed blue gaze directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said again, very quietly and looking at him so that he could see everything she was feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian\u0027s heavy lashes drooped, as if he couldn\u0027t hold her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julian.\" Jenny touched both arms of the duster jacket, just below the shoulders. \"You did a good thing. You shouldn\u0027t act as if you were ashamed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did it for my own reasons.\" He glanced at her, one quick flash of blue fire, then looked away again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you trying to ruin it? You did it, that\u0027s what matters.\" Why couldn\u0027t he ever stay the same person twice running? Jenny was thinking. The last time she\u0027d seen Julian he had been subdued and sad-vulnerable. She\u0027d almost felt sorry for him. Now he was cold and sullen-resentful. She wanted to shake him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was too scared. You didn\u0027t do that to Julian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" she said, moving in even closer, knowing she was taking a risk, \"there was a time when I thought you were completely evil. Completely. But now I don\u0027t believe that. I don\u0027t think you\u0027re as bad as you say you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up then, and the blue fire burned steadily. \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong. Don\u0027t count on it, Jenny. Don\u0027t count on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThreads of fear went through her at his voice. It was as musical and cold as she\u0027d ever heard it. The pitiless music of a clear mountain stream that could suddenly rise in a flood and kill everyone in its path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still don\u0027t believe it,\" Jenny breathed. She wouldn\u0027t look away from him and she was very close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, you\u0027re wrong. I am what I am, and nothing can change it.\" He simply stood there, immovable as rock, which wasn\u0027t like Julian at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s fingers clenched on the sleeves of his jacket. \"You didn\u0027t kill Summer before, in the paper house. You saved her.\" She rapped out the words as if she were angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He spoke just as coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you could have killed her, the rules said you could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Slug and P.C.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t play stupid, Julian!\" She could have shaken him now, she was angry enough, but instead she stood as rigid and unmoving as he was, their faces inches apart. \"Did you kill Slug and P.C.? Make them into what they are now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her a moment, blue eyes unfathomable. Then he said, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a damn liar!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just looked back at her. His eyes were absolutely bottomless, glacier pools that went down and down forever. Jenny wouldn\u0027t look away. She could feel warmth in her own eyes, tears of anger that wouldn\u0027t spill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you do it to Slug and P.C.?\" she said, like a TV lawyer prepared to repeat a question endlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHead slightly tilted back, he returned her gaze. Then, face still cold, eyes like blue ice, he said, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was hard and dangerous. Jenny heard her own voice, relentless and just as hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They opened the door to the closet and let me out. But when I came out\"-a slight and very unsettling smile touched Julian\u0027s lips-\"they ran. They ran out of the paper house and right into the arms of the other Shadow Men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny could feel something in her relax slightly, a mystery solved. She wasn\u0027t even sure why she\u0027d thought Julian hadn\u0027t killed P.C. and Slug. He\u0027d always said he had-there was no reason not to believe him. He was a Shadow Man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they did that?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was their right. Nobody comes here uninvited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my grandfather. They did that, too.\" It wasn\u0027t a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A long time ago. I didn\u0027t pay much attention; I wasn\u0027t interested in him. They would never let me touch him. I could keep Summer alive because she was mine, my prey that I\u0027d caught myself. And I kept her for a reason, Jenny. To use her against you.\" His voice was harder than ever, his face like an ice carving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t,\" Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But don\u0027t let yourself think that means anything. Next time I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you, Julian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027re making a bad mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was still no kindness in the midnight blue eyes, nothing to encourage Jenny. Some part of her had the sense to be frightened, but recklessness was flowing through her blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two sides to Julian, she thought, and she remembered a line from something she\u0027d read-Emily Bronte, maybe. Different as a moonbeam and lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to reach the moonbeam part, but she didn\u0027t know how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery softly she said again, \"I don\u0027t believe you. You\u0027re not like the other Shadow Men. You could change-if you wanted to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said bleakly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julian...\" It was the bleakness that got her. She could see herself reflected in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout thinking, she moved even closer. And closer. Her upper lip touched his lower lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can change,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kiss began before she knew it. Everything was very sweet. Warmth flowed between the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Julian pulled back. A lock of hair had fallen into his eyes, white as the dogwood blossoms Jenny had seen by the highway. The mask of icy control was broken, but there was something frightening in its place. A kind of shattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike what Jenny had felt herself the last time they kissed, in the cavern with the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was too excited to dwell on it. She wasn\u0027t thinking anymore, only feeling-and she felt hot and victorious. The conqueror. \"You\u0027re not evil. You can change, you can be whatever you want-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething ugly sparked in Julian\u0027s eyes, the danger and wildness flaming up to overwhelm the shattered light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am what I want to be,\" he said. \"You forgot that-and that was your mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julian-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was flushed, overwrought, his eyes blazing. \"You want to see what I really am? I\u0027ll show you, Jenny. I\u0027ll prove it to you. I\u0027ll enjoy that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun her around roughly. The revolving door had reappeared, and the neon Exit sign was over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julian, listen to me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom behind, he pushed her toward the door. \"Go on, try a little more of the park. See what I\u0027ve got waiting. Then we can talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julian-\" She was frightened, but she turned around as soon as he let go of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course he wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was empty. Jenny stood a moment, perfectly still, breathing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was-he was the most impossible-the most infuriating -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never met anyone as-as -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he scared her. She didn\u0027t want to try to imagine what he might do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething to prove he was evil, anyway. Something she wouldn\u0027t enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually Jenny\u0027s breathing slowed. Summer, she thought. What\u0027s important is that I find Summer and get her out of here. No matter what happens, no matter what, I have to get Summer out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForget about Julian. There\u0027s nothing you can do for him. Concentrate on playing his Game and getting out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about Tom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe quashed the guilt that tried to well up then. She was thinking about Tom; she wasn\u0027t neglecting him. He was in her thoughts all the time, running like an undercurrent beneath whatever else was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappening. He was the reason she was still on her feet, still fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t going to stop until he was safe. Which meant she\u0027d better get moving again right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened her shirt, smoothed her hair. Then she stepped into the revolving door\u0027s embrace. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-kill-the-forbidden-game-3/page-10.html","bookId":2101,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:46:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:46:09 PM"}
