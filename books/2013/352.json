I’m not sure, Karsa.’ And, a moment later, she added, ‘Yes, I see now how that might be important-worth knowing, I mean.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have my own ghosts,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know. And what are they feeling? Can you tell?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Eager.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. ‘Truly, Karsa Orlong? Truly?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. ‘Not for what you think. No, they delight in the end that is coming to them, to the sacrifice they will make.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What kind of sacrifice?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When the time comes, witch, you must draw your iron knife. Give it your blood. Free the spirits you have bound.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What time, damn you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You will know. Now, take off your clothes. I will see you naked.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. Gadalanak is dead. Never again will we hear his laughter-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, so it is for us to laugh, now, Samar Dev. We must remind ourselves what it is to live. For him. For Gadalanak.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, then hissed in anger. ‘You almost had me, Karsa Orlong. It’s when you get too convincing, you know, that you become the most dangerous.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps you’d rather I just took you, then. Tore your clothes away with my own hands. Flung you down on the bed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m leaving now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed had once dreamt of the time now imminent, when Icarium Lifestealer would step onto the sand of the arena, amidst the eager roar of unwitting onlookers-and those derisive cries would change very quickly, oh yes, to ones of astonishment, then terror. As the rage was awakened, unleashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the world began its gory end. An emperor, a palace, a city, the heart of an empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this Rhulad would not die. Not with finality. No, each time he would rise again, and two forces would lock together in battle that might never end. Unless… could Icarium be killed? Could he die? He was not immortal, after all-although it could be argued that his rage was, the rage of the victim, generation after generation, a rage against injustice and inequity, and such a thing was without end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, if Taralack Veed pushed his thoughts far enough, he ever came to the same place. Rhulad would kill Icarium. A hundred clashes, a thousand-at some point, on a continent of ashes, the burgeoning chaos would strike through, into the heart of Icarium’s rage. And Lifestealer would fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was logic to this. The victim might awaken to fury, but the victim was doomed to be just that: a victim. This was the true cycle, the one to which every culture, every civilization, was witness, century upon century. A natural force, the core of the struggle to exist is the desire to not just survive, but thrive. And to thrive is to feed on victims, ever more victims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is the language itself,’ Senior Assessor said, kneeling over a basin of still water to study his reflection as he applied gaudy paint. ‘Life pushes forward, when it succeeds. Life halts or falls to the wayside, when it fails. Progression, Taralack Veed, implies a journey, but not necessarily one through a fixed interval of time. That is, the growth and ageing of an individual person, although that too is quickly sewn into the cloth. No, the true journey is one of procreation, one’s seed moving from host to host in a succession of generations, each of which must be successful to some degree, lest the seed… halt, fall to the wayside. Of course, it is not in a single man’s mind to think in terms of generation upon generation, although the need to sow his seed is ever paramount. Other concerns, all of which support that which is paramount, generally occupy the mind on a moment to moment basis. The acquisition of food, the security of one’s shelter, the support of one’s family, relatives and allies, the striving to fashion a predictable world, peopled with predictable people-the quest, if you will, for comfort.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed looked away, back to the window, where stood Finadd Varat Taun, watching something in the compound below. ‘Monk,’ Taralack said in a growl, ‘among my tribe, each of the things you describe was but part of a war, 11 feud that could never end. Each was desperate and vicious. No love, no loyalty could be wholly trusted, because the ground churned beneath our feet. Nothing is certain. Nothing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘One thing is,’ Varat Taun said, facing them. ‘The warrior named Gadalanak is dead. And now so too is the one named Puddy, the quick one who loved to boast.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed nodded. ‘You come to believe as I now do, Finadd. Yes, you and I, we have seen Icarium in his anger. But this Emperor, this Rhulad…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monk made a strange grunting noise, then pivoted on the stool-away from them both-and hugged himself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-352.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
