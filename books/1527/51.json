While not getting the full story concerning what had happened at the North Charleston Fertility Clinic, Lisa understood enough to know whom to blame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCranston was a monster hiding behind a handsome face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one with great ambitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There should be a signal by now,” Kat said. “But I’m still not getting any reception.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter commandeering the vehicle, Kat had ordered Lisa to turn the SUV around and backtrack along their path. She wanted to reach a phone or get close enough to a cell tower to regain reception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some farmhouses off to the right,” Lisa offered. “We can turn in and ask for help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They might alert the local authorities. I don’t know who to trust out here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa remembered Painter expressing the same concern. The Gants owned much of South Carolina. Who knew how far that reach extended into local law enforcement?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look.” Lisa pointed ahead. “There’s a sign for a turnoff to Orangeburg. Surely that town must get cell signal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Head that way,” Kat agreed, but she kept searching around the vehicle, with a suspicious look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa made that turn and traveled a half-mile. Off in the distance, the steeple of a church poked above the tree line. That had to be the town of Orangeburg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo focused on the horizon, Lisa glided through an intersection with a flashing red light. A small drawbridge crossed a hidden river. A warning gate began to drop across its entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled to a stop in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she waited for the drawbridge to open, Lisa asked, “Anything now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the rearview mirror, Kat’s eyes fixed at the back of Cranston’s head. He’d been unusually quiet for the past five minutes, no further complaints about his wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low rumble announced the raising of the bridge—but then got louder and louder—becoming more like a thumping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa frowned, concerned about the worn mechanics of the old bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat’s reaction was rougher. She jerked upright and threw her cell phone out the window. She clutched Lisa’s shoulder at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get us out of here! Now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warning came too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sleek military-gray helicopter burst out of hiding from the riverbed to the left. It lofted high over the bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa yanked the car into reverse and jammed the gas. She raced backward to the intersection, fishtailed the car a full 180, and was ready to speed off—but the helicopter was faster. The chopper cut them off, plunging out of the sky to block the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa braked, avoiding a collision with the whirling blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRotor wash beat at the Ford’s windshield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bullhorn roared. “Throw your weapons clear of the vehicle! Exit with your hands up!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make sure the order was understood, a small gun mounted on the chopper’s underside chattered, and a spate of rounds blasted into the pavement in front of the SUV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa turned to Kat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “Do what they say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto that stunned silence, Cranston smiled. “Ladies, you’re not the only ones allowed surprises.” He awkwardly swiveled around. “Back there, I disabled my phone’s cellular receiver and activated an emergency satellite beacon built into the phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning it into a tracking device, Lisa realized. No wonder Kat jettisoned the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCranston frowned. “Though I have to say the emergency response was faster than I expected. Apparently, my employers truly don’t want you to escape. But why? Who the hell are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat raised the pistol to his ear. “You’ll never know.” His eyes got huge as the pistol exploded, shattering away half his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa cringed from the sudden brutality, her ears ringing as Kat tossed the weapon through the window. Still, Lisa heard the fierce whisper that followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was for Amy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8:15 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWashington, DC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter sat in Kat’s chair, rubbing his eyes. The faint smell of jasmine that hung in the air was no longer evident. Maybe it had faded away with everyone bustling in and out of the office, or maybe he’d just become desensitized to the scent. Either way, he felt a nagging sense of loss, a foreboding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re just exhausted, he tried to convince himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason and Linus continued their work, searching for any other sightings of the Ford. Painter had played that grainy footage over and over again, watching the shadowy shape shift frame by frame, knowing it was Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was relieved to find her still alive, but the longer that silence stretched, with no further word on Kat and Lisa’s true fate, the deeper that icy knife twisted in his gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced his eyes to stare once more at the map on the monitor. It displayed South Carolina, along with parts of North Carolina and Georgia. Large swaths of red stood out from the green background. The crimson areas were landholdings of the Gant family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter suspected Lisa and Kat were hidden somewhere in that crimson field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich presented a major challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gant family had arrived on the shores of the Carolinas a century before the founding of this country, settling in the city of Charles Town, which later became simply Charleston. Wealth and power grew rapidly, channeled through the financial support of the family’s Old World connections in both France and England. As that family grew, so did its reach and influence, branching into universities, governments, military institutions, and banking circles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd much of that wealth turned into land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was said, back at the turn of the century, that the Gants could ride horseback from one side of the state to the other—from the beaches of Charleston across the low-country counties and up to the Blue Ridge Mountains—all without ever stepping foot off their own property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, the Gants could drive a herd of cattle across the state and make that same claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter rubbed his temples, overwhelmed by the wealth and power that opposed his small group. How could they hope to succeed against a force so entrenched? And if the enemy ever did learn Sigma was still investigating them in secret, what would their next response be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could guess the answer. In 146 B.C., Rome destroyed Carthage by sacking the place, burning the city, enslaving the survivors, and salting the very earth to make sure nothing ever grew there again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter expected something worse than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason Carter appeared at his door, ever his shadow. “Director, you asked me to let you know when I finished that special project.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re done? Already?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On our computer. But I might have to demonstrate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter stood from the chair and relinquished it to Kat’s chief analyst. The kid hurried over and dropped into the seat. He tapped rapidly and brought up the genealogical map of the Gant clan. Painter had asked for his expert assistance at building a more detailed version, one set to his specific parameters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the very beginning, something had been troubling him about the Gant family tree, a nagging sense that he was missing a vital detail. He began to suspect the problem, but he didn’t know what it signified, or if it meant anything at all. The only way to make sure was to construct a genealogical representation where no detail was left out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted the complete picture—and asked Jason to prepare it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here’s the lineage you originally assembled,” Jason said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a click of the mouse, the three-dimensional schematic of the Gant family tree appeared. Progeny and familial connections formed a monumental tapestry, a weaving and warping of heredity and genealogy that spanned two centuries, back to the founding of the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to get reliable records much earlier than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut apparently not for Jason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, director, I know what you asked for, but I took the liberty of also searching back another century—just to be thorough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to clone this kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter leaned closer. “And you were still able to expand the search to the sides.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter had spent hours studying that chart, finally gleaning what nagged him. Certain tendrils of the chart showed familial lines that wove in and out of the main genealogical matrix, marking distant cousins marrying back into the family. For such a rich family, it wasn’t unusual, a typical inbreeding of power and blood among aristocrats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut those loose threads in the Gant family’s tapestry troubled him, because there seemed to be too many of them, even for such a rich dynasty, a suspicious fraying of the cloth. Painter couldn’t help but pick at those threads to see what they might reveal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked Jason to stretch the genealogical search to the sides of the main family tree, to follow all of those loose threads. He also instructed him to look for new ones, specifically lines of the family that strayed even farther from the fold, farther than merely distant cousins, before diving and returning to the Gant bosom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Show me,” Painter ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be prepared. The chart is vast. No individual names will show up, just data points.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason tapped a few keys, and that original matrix Painter constructed shrunk to a size of a fist. Names dwindled away to become nodes of a network, stars in a galaxy. Around that galactic core, a hazy corona of new data points and fine lines appeared, scintillating into existence on the screen, surrounding yet incorporated into the whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter brushed his fingertips across the new spiral arms of this galaxy. “And all of these extensions mark where a strand of the family tree shot away from the others—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only to eventually return again,” Jason confirmed. “The average deviation was two generations, but a few of those lines broke away for five or six generations. A couple of the prodigal relatives returning to the family were seventeenth or eighteenth cousins. But return they did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like moths around a lamp,” Painter said. “Fluttering out, then diving back in again. Over and over again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason shrugged. “I can probably confirm this is excessive, even for a prominent family like the Gants, but it’ll take time to work up a comparable dynasty. Still, I’m not sure what the significance is.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline-sigma-force-8/page-51.html","bookId":1527,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM"}
