Jon gave her cheek a reassuring caress and then joined Matt, where she could not see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Touch her here,” Jon’s voice said softly. She quivered harder as Matt laid his palms on the curves of her ass, his thumbs inserting between them and then spreading her open, causing her breath to catch and hold in the back of her throat while a hard spasm of sensation rocked through her, like an aftershock of climax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She likes it very much when you touch her, much more than when we do. Hold her open like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a simple, truthful statement from Jon, no slyness. Almost as if he were trying to reassure Matt. Did Matt need such reassurance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want her hurt.” Matt’s voice was rough, odd. “Is that lubricated enough?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is. She’ll feel nothing but pleasure, I swear it. Savannah, what you’re feeling now is my finger. I’m very gently placing some lubrication in your anal passage. I’m only going to be putting some pressure on your sphincter, not going all the way in, but I want you to be comfortable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a gentle, rubbing sensation around the rim that made her buttocks tremble under Matt’s grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinctively, she lifted toward Jon’s touch. God, it felt…good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, let that breath you’re holding out slowly, for a count of five. One, two…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed his direction, and felt something rounded, smooth and slick ease into the opening of her rectum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot deep, as he had said. It just stretched the opening, made her want to squirm with the stimulating sensation. He’d seated the short rubber hub in her passage, she realized. The “wheel” was placing the firm pressure against the rim of the opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“While many women enjoy getting fucked in the ass, the sensation is ninety percent psychological and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eten percent stimulating the opening,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe confirmed her reaction. “With a device like this, therefore, I’ve focused on the sensitive nerves there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus, we agreed your ass would be Ben’s specialty. Just like your breasts are Peter’s area of expertise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavannah froze at that remarkable statement. “Don’t worry.” Jon’s hand stroked her back. “You’ll love having him there, and this, as well as Peter, will help you prepare for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Matt, with your permission, I’d like to take it from here. Savannah, this next piece will stimulate your clit. “ Jon’s long fingers slid up her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her legs spread apart, she felt the trepidation again, but no one had hurt her yet, physically, and she decided to rely on the empirical data she had and tried to relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good girl,” Jon murmured. His fingers moved under her, past the pussy. The material of the oblong piece felt like good quality linen, now viscous with some type of adhesive. He completely hooded her clit, pressing firmly, making her breath rasp as the two sensations twined together and pulled pleasurable tension down even lower in her stomach. “The adhesive is a warming oil, so it won’t feel much different from your own fluids after a moment, and it’s fragrant, a vanilla smell to make it pleasant to your nose, though I personally prefer the smell of a woman’s aroused cunt to any other scent on earth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe withdrew and shifted, placing the flat of one palm against her lower back, just at the rise of her buttocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething touched the opening of her pussy, the shaft piece, she realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, the phallus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s up to you how deep I’ll go. I don’t want to break anything that’s not mine to break.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took her a moment to understand, then she gave a nervous half laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The gynecologist took care of that years ago.” She felt shy about saying it, but she did it, forcing herself to try and be as sophisticated as they were being about all these things she’d never done, things she’d never even realized could be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just…don’t go any deeper than you know…you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, then. You tell me if I cause you a moment of discomfort.” There was the glide of something within her opening, and then pressure. She tensed. Jon immediately stopped, his palm obviously on her back to register such a reaction. “I think an additional distraction might be good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is low setting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavannah sucked in a breath as current ran through the hood over her clit and through the pinwheel. The oblong clit piece hummed against her in a wave rhythm, like experiencing a tongue and a vibration at once. And the anal piece…there were tiny electrons of sensation leaping all over there. She couldn’t track them all, but it robbed her of the ability to retain any control over her voice. She was making soft moans of pleasure, unable to stop herself, and she wished for the gag, so the embarrassing noises would be muffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon eased the phallus in on one of the tiny undulations she could not help making, and seated it against a dense spot that reacted immediately, almost spasmodically, to the touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perfect. God, you’re perfect. That’s it, honey. The current goes through the spokes of the wheel and all around the rim, and there’s a different rhythm pulsing through the hub, the part that’s inside you. It’s key to the whole thing, because the flow and speed of the vibration alters constantly in all three pieces, so they keep stroking you, over and over, but in different ways. When you finally go, that lack of consistency will prolong the orgasm, much like when a man changes the angle of his cock during lovemaking between the clit and G-spot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew nothing of those things, only that his words were goading her further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jon,” she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hang with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing an engineer, and therefore very detail-oriented, he was making some more adjustments. His hands moved quickly over her now, and she felt the satin ribbons of the straps tighten over her thighs, between her legs, so the components were held firmly against her anus and in her pussy. The clit piece was left alone, and its greater freedom to vibrate against her made all three sensations even more excruciating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God…” She was so close. It was going to be hard and intense, more than she could handle, but she wanted it, craved it like the relief of an excruciating pain being taken away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon wasn’t in the mood to let her go so quickly. Abruptly, the vibration stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she blurted out. “No. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt stepped into her field of vision, his hand cupping her face, his expression dangerous with brutal male desire, telling her he was not there to soothe, but to see her agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith no outlet for her passion, she bit him anew, this time his palm, too wound up to exercise restraint. She tasted his blood again and reveled in it, the taste of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe growled in response and buried the fingers of his other hand in her hair, but not to yank her away. In the same instinctive way she knew how to breathe, she knew he wanted to grip her with such brutal force at this moment, make her feel his dominance over her. She snarled against his flesh. It eased the grip of her jaw and he drew the hand back, showing her that she had marked him. She wanted to mark him everywhere. That gorgeous chest, flat abdomen, hard thighs, his feet, his…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Start taking her up, Jon,” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five minutes at low setting,” Jon responded behind her, his voice thick with his own reaction. His hand slid over her buttock, squeezed hard and she whimpered at the bolt of electric reaction. Matt’s spanking had made her hypersensitive there, in a way that made pain irrelevant. Pain or no pain, it was all pleasurable. “That will build her reaction, make it even more intense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three pieces activated again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey weren’t just vibrating. The dildo began a slow, measured stroking, like a man’s cock must, only still not deep enough, making her want to struggle, pull it in, even as the terror of what that desire meant swept through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt stepped back, though his attention never left her face, and then he was outside the range of her vision. She could feel him to the left of her, and Jon was before her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his beautiful face, the long sensitive fingers, the curve of his mouth, Jon would never need a device such as this to get a girl to go to bed with him. But with it, women would elevate him to the stature of a god, bow down and worship him. At the moment, she’d cheerfully volunteer to be High Priestess of the cult of Jon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now,” he continued. “Before I raise the setting, I’m going to put the gag back in your mouth. I want something seated on your tongue to keep you from biting through it, though I’d love to hear you scream for us. I’m going to draw up your head a little higher, because we all want to see your face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat will enhance the sensation of your bondage, your slavery to us, to Matt.” At that amazing statement, one she would not have expected from Jon, he put his fingers along her cheek again, pushing the ball gently against her teeth. “A most cherished slave. One we couldn’t do without.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen up, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t have much choice with her head held rigid and his thumb cleverly inserting into the hinge of her jaw, making her obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put her on display in the center of the table so we all can enjoy watching her reach climax again and again,” Matt commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gears whirred at the far end of the table and the mechanism began to lift her even higher into the air and move her forward, toward the center. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/board-resolution-knights-of-the-board-room-1/page-13.html","bookId":1900,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:44 PM"}
