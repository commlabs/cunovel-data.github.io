There was only a slight breeze but it was bloody cold, what with the mist and the gloom and my despair over King Jeff. I pulled my woolen cape around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bloody Scotland,\" said I. \"Albany is possibly the darkest, dampest, coldest bloody crevice in all of Blighty. Sodding Scots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Witches?\" reminded Kent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the bloody ghost told me I\u0027d find my answers here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ghost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The girl ghost at the White Tower, keep up, Kent.

Nothing to fear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the day, when Lear was still Christian, we did not do well by witches. I\u0027ve had a cartload of curses cast on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not very effective, though, were they?

What\u0027s that light?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a fire ahead in the wood, and figures moving around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stealthy, now, good Kent. Let us creep up silently and see what is to be seen before revealing ourselves. Now, creep, Kent, you crashing great ox, creep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with but two steps my strategy revealed its flaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re jingling like a coin purse possessed of fits,\" said Kent. \"You couldn\u0027t creep up on the deaf nor dead.

Three bent-backed hags were walking a slow circle around a large cauldron, dropping in twisted bits of this and that as they chanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Double, double, toil and trouble:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire burn, and cauldron bubble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Witches,\" whispered Kent, paying tribute to the god of all things bloody fucking obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" said I, in lieu of clouting him.

It was all I could do not to cry out. I felt Kent\u0027s hand on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steady, lad, it\u0027s just a cat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother brush, and a meow. Two of them now, licking my bells, and purring. (It sounds more pleasant than it was.) \"It\u0027s the bloody pork fat,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA third feline joined the gang. I stood on one foot, trying to hold the other above their heads, but while I am an accomplished acrobat, the art of levitation still eludes me; thus my ground-bound foot became my Achilles\u0027 heel, as it were. One of the fiends sank its fangs into my ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuckstockings!\" said I, somewhat emphatically. I hopped, I whirled, I made disparaging remarks toward all creatures of the feline aspect. Hissing and yowling ensued. When at last the cats retreated, I was sitting splayed-legged by the fire, Kent stood next to me with his sword drawn and ready, and the three hags stood in ranks across the cauldron from us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Back, witches!\" said Kent. \"You may curse me into a toad, but they\u0027ll be the last words out of your mouths while your heads are attached.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Witches?\" said the first witch, who was greenest of the three. \"What witches? We are but humble washerwomen, making our way in the wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rendering laundry service, humble and good,\" said witch two, the tallest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All it be, is as it should,\" said witch three, who had a wicked wart over her right eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By Hecate\u0027s[27] night-tarred nipples, stop rhyming!\" said I. \"If you\u0027re not witches, what was that curse you were bubbling about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stew,\" said Warty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stew, stew most true,\" said Tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stew most blue,\" said Green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not blue,\" said Kent, looking in the cauldron. \"More of a brown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" said Green, \"but brown doesn\u0027t rhyme, does it, love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for witches,\" said I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" said Tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was sent by a ghost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hags looked at one another, then back at me. \"Ghost told you to bring your laundry here, did it?\" said Warty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not washerwomen! You\u0027re bloody witches!

The ghost? I didn\u0027t say it was a she - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did she look like, fool?\" snarled Warty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose I shall pass my days eating bugs and hiding under leaves until some crone drops me in a cauldron,\" mused Kent, leaning on his sword now, watching moths dart into the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was ghostly pale,\" said I, \"all in white - vaporous, with fair hair and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was fit,[28] though?\" asked Tall. \"Lovely, you might even say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bit more transparent than I care for in my wenches, but aye, she was fit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" said Warty, looking to the others, who huddled with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they came up, Green said, \"State your business, then, fool. Why did the ghost send you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said you could help me. I am fool to the court of King Lear of Britain. He has sent away his youngest daughter, Cordelia, of whom I am somewhat fond; he\u0027s given my apprentice fool, Drool, to that blackguard bastard Edmund of Gloucester, and my friend Taster has been poisoned and is quite dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And don\u0027t forget that they\u0027re going to hang you at dawn,\" added Kent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t concern yourselves with that, ladies,\" said I. \"About to be hanged is my status quo, not a condition that requires your repair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hags huddled again. There was much whispering and a bit of hissing. They broke their conference and Warty, who was the apparent coven leader, said, \"That Lear\u0027s a nasty piece of work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last time he went Christian a score of witches were drowned,\" said Tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKent nodded, and looked at his shoes. \"The Petite Inquisition - not a high point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, we were a decade spelling them all back to life for the revenge,\" said Warty. \"Rosemary here still seeps pond-water from the ears on damp days,\" said Tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, and carps ate my small toes while I was pond-bottom,\" said Green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her toes thus gefilted,[29] we had to seek an enchanted lynx and take two of his for replacement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosemary (who was Green) nodded gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goes through shoes in a fortnight, but there\u0027s no better witch to chase a squirrel up a tree,\" said Tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true,\" said Rosemary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beats the burnings, though,\" said Warty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, that\u0027s true,\" said Tall. \"No amount of cat toes\u0027ll fix you if you\u0027ve all your bits burnt off.

I liked these crones, they had a fine-edged wit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosemary rolled her good eye at the earl, lifted her skirts, aimed her withered bottom at Kent, and rubbed a palsied claw over it. \"Round and firm, good knight. Round and firm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKent gagged a little and backed away a few steps. \"Gods save us! Away you ghastly carbuncled tart!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have looked away, should have, but I had never seen a green one. A weaker man might have plucked out his own eyes, but being a philosopher, I knew the sight could never be unseen, so I persevered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hop on, Kent,\" said I. \"Beast-shagging is thy calling and thou surely have been called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKent backed into a tree and half cold-cocked himself. He slid down the trunk, dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosemary dropped her skirts. \"Just having you on.\" The crones cackled as they huddled again. \"We\u0027ve a proper toading for you once the fool\u0027s business is finished, though. A moment, please...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witches whispered for a moment, then resumed their march around the cauldron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nose of Turk, and Tartar\u0027s lips,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGriffin spunk and monkey hips,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandrake rubbed with tiger nads,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo divine undoing for the old king mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh bollocks,\" said Sage, \"we\u0027re all out of monkey hips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParsley looked into the cauldron and gave it a stir. \"We can make do without them.

It glowed against the misty night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Ello,\" said the giant face, sounding Cockney and a little drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, large and steamy face,\" said I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fool, Fool, you must save the Drool,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick to Gloucester, or blood will pool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for fuck\u0027s sake, this one rhymes, too?\" said I to the witches. \"Can\u0027t a bloke find a straightforward prose apparition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet, fool!\" snapped Sage, who I was back to thinking of as Warty. To the face, she said, \"Apparition of darkest power, we\u0027re clear on the where and the what, but the fool was hoping for some direction of the how variety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.
