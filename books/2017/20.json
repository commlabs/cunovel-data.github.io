Set like a faded jewel in the midst of the bewildering crowd of suns at the center of the Galaxy - in the heaps and clusters of stars piled high with aimless prodigality - it alternately dreamed of past and future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime had been when the insubstantial ribbons of control had stretched out from its metal coating to the very edges of stardom. It had been a single city, housing four hundred billion administrators; the mightiest capital that had ever been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil the decay of the Empire eventually reached it and in the Great Sack of a century ago, its drooping powers had been bent back upon themselves and broken forever. In the blasting ruin of death, the metal shell that circled the planet wrinkled and crumpled into an aching mock of its own grandeur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe survivors tore up the metal plating and sold it to other planets for seed and cattle. The soil was uncovered once more and the planet returned to its beginnings. In the spreading areas of primitive agriculture, it forgot its intricate and colossal past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr would have but for the still mighty shards that heaped their massive ruins toward the sky in bitter and dignified silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcadia watched the metal rim of the horizon with a stirring of the heart. The village in which the Palvers lived was but a huddle of houses to her - small and primitive. The fields that surrounded it were golden-yellow, wheat-cIogged tracts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there, just past the reaching point was the memory of the past, still glowing in unrusted splendor, and burning with fire where the sun of Trantor caught it in gleaming highlights. She had been there once during the months since she had arrived at Trantor. She had climbed onto the smooth, unjointed pavement and ventured into the silent dust-streaked structures, where the light entered through the jags of broken walls and partitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been solidified heartache. It had been blasphemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had left, clangingly - running until her feet pounded softly on earth once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she could only look back longingly. She dared not disturb that mighty brooding once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere on this world, she knew, she had been born - near the old Imperial Library, which was the veriest Trantor of Trantor. It was the sacred of the sacred; the holy of holies! Of all the world, it alone had survived the Great Sack and for a century it had remained complete and untouched; defiant of the universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere Hari Seldon and his group had woven their unimaginable web. There Ebling Mis pierced the secret, and sat numbed in his vast surprise, until he was killed to prevent the secret from going further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere at the Imperial Library, her grandparents had lived for ten years, until the Mule died, and they could return to the reborn Foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere at the Imperial Library, her own father returned with his bride to find the Second Foundation once again, but failed. There, she had been born and there her mother had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have liked to visit the Library, but Preem Palver shook his round head. \"It\u0027s thousands of miles, Arkady, and there\u0027s so much to do here. Besides, it\u0027s not good to bother there. You know; it\u0027s a shrine-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Arcadia knew that he had no desire to visit the Library; that it was a case of the Mule\u0027s Palace over again. There was this superstitious fear on the part of the pygmies of the present for the relies of the giants of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it would have been horrible to feel a grudge against the funny little man for that. She had been on Trantor now for nearly three months and in all that time, he and she - Pappa and Mamma - had been wonderful to her-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what was her return? Why, to involve them in the common ruin. Had she warned them that she was marked for destruction, perhaps? No! She let them assume the deadly role of protectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer conscience panged unbearably - yet what choice had she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped reluctantly down the stairs to breakfast. The voices reached her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreem Palver had tucked the napkin down his shirt collar with a twist of his plump neck and had reached for his poached eggs with an uninhibited satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was down in the city yesterday, Mamma,\" he said, wielding his fork and nearly drowning the words with a capacious mouthful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what is down in the city, Pappa?\" asked Mamma indifferently, sitting down, looking sharply about the table, and rising again for the salt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, not so good. A ship came in from out Kalgan-way with newspapers from there. It\u0027s war there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"War! So! Well, let them break their heads, if they have no more sense inside. Did your pay check come yet? Pappa, I\u0027m telling you again. You warn old man Cosker this isn\u0027t the only cooperative in the world. It\u0027s bad enough they pay you what I\u0027m ashamed to tell my friends, but at least on time they could be!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time; shmime,\" said Pappa, irritably. \"Look, don\u0027t make me silly talk at breakfast, it should choke me each bite in the throat,\" and he wreaked havoc among the buttered toast as he said it. He added, somewhat more moderately, \"The fighting is between Kalgan and the Foundation, and for two months, they\u0027ve been at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands lunged at one another in mock-representation of a space fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um-m-m. And what\u0027s doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad for the Foundation. Well, you saw Kalgan; all soldiers. They were ready. The Foundation was not, and so - poof!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly, Mamma laid down her fork and hissed, \"Fool!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dumb-head! Your big mouth is always moving and wagging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was pointing quickly and when Pappa looked over his shoulder, there was Arcadia, frozen in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"The Foundation is at war?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePappa looked helplessly at Mamma, then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027re losing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcadia felt the unbearable catch in her throat, and slowly approached the table. \"Is it over?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over?\" repeated Pappa, with false heartiness. \"Who said it was over? In war, lots of things can happen. And... and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, darling,\" said Mamma, soothingly. \"No one should talk before breakfast. You\u0027re not in a healthy condition with no food in the stomach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Arcadia ignored her. \"Are the Kalganians on Terminus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Pappa, seriously. \"The news is from last week, and Terminus is still fighting. This is honest. I\u0027m telling the truth. And the Foundation is still strong. Do you want me to get you the newspapers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read them over what she could eat of her breakfast and her eyes blurred as she read. Santanni and Korell were gone - without a fight. A squadron of the Foundation\u0027s navy had been trapped in the sparsely-sunned Ifni sector and wiped out to almost the last ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now the Foundation was back to the Four-Kingdom core - the original Realm which had been built up under Salvor Hardin, the first mayor. But still it fought - and still there might be a chance-and whatever happened, she must inform her father. She must somehow reach his ear. She must!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how? With a war in the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked Pappa after breakfast, \"Are you going out on a new mission soon, Mr. Palver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePappa was on the large chair on the front lawn, sunning himself. A fat cigar smoldered between his plump fingers and he looked like a beatific pug-dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mission?\" he repeated, lazily. \"Who knows? It\u0027s a nice vacation and my leave isn\u0027t up. Why talk about new missions? You\u0027re restless, Arkady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? No, I like it here. You\u0027re very good to me, you and Mrs. Palver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved his hand at her, brushing away her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcadia said, \"I was thinking about the war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t think about it. What can you do? If it\u0027s something you can\u0027t help, why hurt yourself over it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I was thinking that the Foundation has lost most of its farming worlds. They\u0027re probably rationing food there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePappa looked uncomfortable. \"Don\u0027t worry. It\u0027ll be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scarcely listened. \"I wish I could carry food to them, that\u0027s what. You know after the Mule died, and the Foundation rebelled, Terminus was just about isolated for a time and General Han Pritcher, who succeeded the Mule for a while was laying siege to it. Food was running awfully low and my father says that his father told him that they only had dry amino-acid concentrates that tasted terrible. Why, one egg cost two hundred credits. And then they broke the siege just in time and food ships came through from Santanni. It must have been an awful time. Probably it\u0027s happening all over, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, and then Arcadia said, \"You know, I\u0027ll bet the Foundation would be willing to pay smuggler\u0027s prices for food now. Double and triple and more. Gee, if any co-operative, f\u0027r instance, here on Trantor took over the job, they might lose some ships, but, I\u0027ll bet they\u0027d be war millionaires before it was over. The Foundation Traders in the old days used to do that all the time. There\u0027d be a war, so they\u0027d sell whatever was needed bad and take their chances. Golly, they used to make as much as two million dollars out of one trip - profit. That was just out of what they could carry on one ship, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePappa stirred. His cigar had gone out, unnoticed. \"A deal for food, huh? Hm-m-m- But the Foundation is so far away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know. I guess you couldn\u0027t do it from here. If you took a regular liner you probably couldn\u0027t get closer than Massena or Smushyk, and after that you\u0027d have to hire a small scoutship or something to slip you through the lines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePappa\u0027s hand brushed at his hair, as he calculated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo weeks later, arrangements for the mission were completed. Mamma railed for most of the time - First, at the incurable obstinacy with which he courted suicide. Then, at the incredible obstinacy with which he refused to allow her to accompany him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePappa said, \"Mamma, why do you act like an old lady. I can\u0027t take you. It\u0027s a man\u0027s work. What do you think a war is? Fun? Child\u0027s play?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why do you go? Are you a man, you old fool - with a leg and half an arm in the grave. Let some of the young ones go - not a fat bald-head like you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a bald-head,\" retorted Pappa, with dignity. \"I got yet lots of hair. And why should it not be me that gets the commission? Why, a young fellow? Listen, this could mean millions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that and she subsided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArcadia saw him once before he left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Are you going to Terminus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? You say yourself they need bread and rice and potatoes. Well, I\u0027ll make a deal with them, and they\u0027ll get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then - just one thing: If you\u0027re going to Terminus, could you... would you see my father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Pappa\u0027s face crinkled and seemed to melt into sympathy, \"Oh - and I have to wait for you to tell me. Sure, I\u0027ll see him. I\u0027ll tell him you\u0027re safe and everything\u0027s O.K., and when the war is over, I\u0027ll bring you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I\u0027ll tell you how to find him. His name is Dr. Toran Darell and he lives in Stanmark. That\u0027s just outside Terminus City, and you can get a little commuting plane that goes there. We\u0027re at 55 Channel Drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, and I\u0027ll write it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" Arcadia\u0027s arm shot out. \"You mustn\u0027t write anything down. You must remember - and find him without anybody\u0027s help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePappa looked puzzled. Then he shrugged his shoulders. \"All right, then. It\u0027s 55 Channel Drive in Stanmark, outside Terminus City, and you commute there by plane. All right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One other thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you tell him something from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to whisper it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned his plump cheek toward her, and the little whispered sound passed from one to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePappa\u0027s eyes were round. \"That\u0027s what you want me to say? But it doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll know what you mean. Just say I sent it and that I said he would know what it means. And you say it exactly the way I told you. No different. You won\u0027t forget it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I forget it? Five little words. Look-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no.\" She hopped up and down in the intensity of her feelings. \"Don\u0027t repeat it. Don\u0027t ever repeat it to anyone. Forget all about it except to my father. Promise me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePappa shrugged again. \"I promise! All right!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" she said, mournfully, and as he passed down the drive to where the air taxi waited to take him to the spaceport, she wondered if she had signed his death warrant. She wondered if she would ever see him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scarcely dared to walk into the house again to face the good, kind Mamma. Maybe when it was all over, she had better kill herself for what she had done to them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/second-foundation-foundation-3/page-20.html","bookId":2017,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:05:33 PM"}
