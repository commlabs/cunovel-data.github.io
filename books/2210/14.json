That had never happened before. I heard his fear as he discovered the burnt timbers on the floor and called out \"Master.\" A servant was what he was, and a somewhat treacherous one at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt fascinated me, this soundless hearing of his mind, but something else was disturbing me. It was his scent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted the stone lid of the sarcophagus and climbed out. The scent was faint, but it was almost irresistible. It was the musky smell of the first whore in whose bed I had spent my passion. It was the roasted venison after days and days of starvation in winter. It was new wine, or fresh apples, or water roaring over a cliff\u0027s edge on a hot day when I reached out to gulp it in handfuls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly it was immeasurably richer than that, this scent, and the appetite that wanted it was infinitely keener and more simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved through the secret tunnel like a creature swimming through the darkness and, pushing out the stone in the outer chamber, rose to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere stood the mortal, staring at me, his face pale with shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn old, withered man he was, and by some indefinable tangle of considerations in his mind, I knew he was a stable master and a coachman. But the hearing of this was maddeningly imprecise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the immediate malice he felt towards me came like the heat of a stove. And there was no misunderstanding that. His eyes raced over my face and form. The hatred boiled, crested. It was he who had procured the fine clothes I wore. He who had tended the unfortunates in the dungeon while they had lived. And why, he demanded in silent outrage, was I not there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis made me love him very much, as you can imagine. I could have crushed him to death in my bare hands for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The master!\" he said desperately. \"Where is he? Master!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what did he think the master was? A sorcerer of some kind, that was what he thought. And now I had the power. In sum, he didn\u0027t know anything that would be of use to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I comprehended all this, as I drank it up from his mind, quite against his will, I was becoming entranced with the veins in his face and in his hands. And that smell was intoxicating me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel the dim throbbing of his heart, and then I could taste his blood, just what it would be like, and there came to me some full-blown sense of it, rich and hot as it filled me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The master\u0027s gone, burned in the fire,\" I murmured, hearing a strange monotone coming from myself. I moved slowly towards him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the blackened floor. He looked up at the blackened ceiling. \"No, this is a lie,\" he said. He was outraged, and his anger pulsed like a light in my eye. I felt the bitterness of his mind and its desperate reasoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, but that living flesh could look like this! I was in the grip of remorseless appetite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he knew it. In some wild and unreasoning way, he sensed it; and throwing me one last malevolent glance he ran for the stairway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately I caught him. In fact, I enjoyed catching him, so simple it was. One instant I was willing myself to reach out and close the distance between us. The next I had him helpless in my hands, holding him off the floor so that his feet swung free, straining to kick me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held him as easily as a powerful man might hold a child, that was the proportion. His mind was a jumble of frantic thoughts, and he seemed unable to decide upon any course to save himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the faint humming of these thoughts was being obliterated by the vision he presented to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes weren\u0027t the portals of his soul anymore. They were gelatinous orbs whose colors tantalized me. And his body was nothing but a writhing morsel of hot flesh and blood, that I must have or die without.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt horrified me that this food should be alive, that delicious blood should flow through these struggling arms and fingers, and then it seemed perfect that it should. He was what he was, and I was what I was, and I was going to feast upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled him to my lips. I tore the bulging artery in his neck. The blood hit the roof of my mouth. I gave a little cry as I crushed him against me. It wasn\u0027t the burning fluid the master\u0027s blood had been, not that lovely elixir I had drunk from the stones of the dungeon. No, that had been light itself made liquid. Rather this was a thousand times more luscious, tasting of the thick human heart that pumped it, the very essence of that hot, almost smoky scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel my shoulders rising, my fingers biting deeper into his flesh, and almost a humming sound rising out of me. No vision but that of his tiny gasping soul, but a swoon so powerful that he himself, what he was, had no part in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was with all my will that, before the final moment, I forced him away. How I wanted to feel his heart stop. How I wanted to feel the beats slow and cease and know I possessed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t dare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped heavily from my arms, his limbs sprawling out on the stones, the whites of his eyes showing beneath his half-closed eyelids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I found myself unable to turn away from his death, mutely fascinated by it. Not the smallest detail must escape me. I heard his breath give out, I saw the body relax into death without struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood warmed me. I felt it beating in my veins. My face was hot against the palms of my hands, and my vision had grown powerfully sharp. I felt strong beyond all imagining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the corpse and dragged it down and down the winding steps of the tower, into the stinking dungeon, and threw it to rot with the rest there. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-lestat-the-vampire-chronicles-2/page-14.html","bookId":2210,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM"}
