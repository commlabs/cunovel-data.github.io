I\u0027d worked for hours, serving and smiling and hustling, and I\u0027d never broken down at all. Sure, I\u0027d had to ask four people to repeat their orders. And I\u0027d walked past Sam twice, and he\u0027d said something to me to which I hadn\u0027t responded - I knew this because he\u0027d stopped me to tell me so. But I\u0027d gotten the right plates and drinks to the right tables, and my tips were running about average, which meant I\u0027d been agreeable and hadn\u0027t forgotten anything crucial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re doing so good,I told myself. I\u0027m so proud of you. You just have to get through this. You can go home in fifteen minutes .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered how many women had given themselves the same lecture: the girl who\u0027d held her head up at a dance where her date was paying attention to another classmate; the woman who\u0027d been passed by for promotion at her job; the woman who had listened to a dire diagnosis and yet kept her face together. I knew men must have days like this, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, maybe not too many people had days exactly like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, I\u0027d been turning over in my head Mel\u0027s strange insistence that he was not responsible for Crystal\u0027s crucifixion, during which she\u0027d actually died. His thoughts had had the ring of truth. And really, there was no reason why he would\u0027ve balked at confessing everything when he\u0027d already confessed so much, found peace doing so. Why would someone steal the half-dead Crystal and the wood, and do a deed so disgusting? It would\u0027ve had to have been someone who\u0027d hated Crystal an awful lot, or maybe someone who had hated Mel or Jason. It was an inhuman act, yet I found myself believing in Mel\u0027s dying assertion that he had not done it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so glad to leave work that I began driving home on automatic pilot. When I\u0027d gotten almost to the turn off into my driveway, I remembered that I\u0027d told Amelia hours before that I\u0027d meet her at Tray\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d completely forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could forgive myself, considering the day I\u0027d had - if Amelia was okay. But when I remembered Tray\u0027s mean state and his ingestion of vampire blood, I felt a jolt of panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my watch and saw I was more than forty-five minutes late. Turning around in the next driveway, I drove back to town like a bat out of hell. I was trying to pretend to myself I wasn\u0027t scared. I wasn\u0027t doing a very good job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere weren\u0027t any cars in front of the small house. Its windows were dark. I could see the bumper of Tray\u0027s truck peering out from the carport behind the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove right by and turned around on a county road about half a mile farther out. Confused and worried, I returned to park outside Tray\u0027s. His house and the adjacent workshop were outside the Bon Temps city limits but not isolated. Tray had maybe a half-acre lot; his little home and the large metal building housing his repair business were right next to a similar setup owned by Brock and Chessie Johnson, who had an upholstery shop. Obviously, Brock and Chessie had retreated to their house for the night. The living room lights were on; as I watched, Chessie pulled the curtains shut, which most people out here didn\u0027t bother to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night was dark and quiet; the Johnsons\u0027 dog was barking, but that was the only sound. It was too cold for the chorus of bugs that often made the night come alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of several scenarios that could explain the dead look of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne. The vampire blood still had hold over Tray, and he\u0027d killed Amelia. Right now, he was in his house, in the dark, thinking of ways to kill himself. Or maybe he was waiting for me to come, so he could kill me, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo. Tray had recovered from his ingestion of vamp blood, and when Amelia had appeared on his doorstep, they\u0027d decided to treat their free afternoon as a honeymoon. They wouldn\u0027t be at all happy if I interrupted them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree. Amelia had come by, found no one at home, and was now back at the house cooking supper for herself and me, because she expected me to drive up at any moment. At least that explanation accounted for the absence of Amelia\u0027s car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to think of an even better series of events, but I couldn\u0027t. I pulled out my cell phone and tried my home number. I heard my own voice on the answering machine. Next, I tried Amelia\u0027s cell. It went to voice mail after three rings. I was running out of happy options. Figuring that a phone call would be less intrusive than a knock at the door, I tried Tray\u0027s number next. I could hear the faint ring of the phone inside ... but no one answered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Bill. I didn\u0027t think about it for more than a second. I just did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill Compton,\" said the familiar cool voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill,\" I said, and then couldn\u0027t finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sitting in my car outside of Tray Dawson\u0027s house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Were who owns the motorcycle repair shop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was there in less than ten minutes. His car pulled up behind mine. I was pulled over on the shoulder, because I hadn\u0027t wanted to drive up onto the gravel in front of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m weak,\" I said, when he got in beside me. \"I shouldn\u0027t have called you. But I swear to God, I didn\u0027t know what else to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t call Eric.\" It was a simple observation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take too long,\" I said. I told him what I\u0027d done. \"I can\u0027t believe I forgot Amelia,\" I said, stricken by my self-centeredness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think forgetting one thing after such a day is actually permissible, Sookie,\" Bill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it isn\u0027t,\" I said. \"It\u0027s just that ... I can\u0027t go in there and find them dead. I just can\u0027t do it. My courage has just collapsed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned over and kissed me on the cheek. \"What\u0027s one more dead person to me?\" he said. And then he was out of the car and moving silently in the faint light peeking around the curtains of the house next door. He got to the front door, listened intently. He didn\u0027t hear anything, I knew, because he opened the door and stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as he vanished, my cell phone rang. I jumped so hard I almost hit my head on the roof. I dropped the phone and had to grope for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" I said, full of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, did you call? I was in the shower,\" Amelia said, and I collapsed over the steering wheel, thinking,Thank you God thank you God thank you thank you .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" Amelia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"I\u0027m okay. Where is Tray? Is he there with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. I went to his house, but he wasn\u0027t there. I waited a while for you, but you didn\u0027t show, so I figured he\u0027d gone to the doctor, and I decided you must have been held up at work or something. I went back to the insurance agency, and I just got home about thirty minutes ago. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there soon,\" I said. \"Lock the doors and don\u0027t let anyone in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doors are locked; no one\u0027s knocking,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let me in,\" I said, \"unless I give you the password.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Sookie,\" she said, and I could tell she thought I\u0027d gone over the edge. \"What\u0027s the password?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fairypants,\" I said, and how I came up with that I have no idea. It simply seemed super unlikely that anyone else in the world would say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got it,\" Amelia said. \"Fairypants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill was back at the car. \"I\u0027ve got to go,\" I said, and hung up. When he opened the door, the dome light showed his face. It looked grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not there,\" he said immediately. \"But there\u0027s been a fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could still be alive. From the way it smelled, I don\u0027t think it was all his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shoulders slumped. \"I don\u0027t know what to do,\" I confessed, and it felt almost good to say it out loud. \"I don\u0027t know where to go to find him or how to help him. He\u0027s supposed to be working as my bodyguard. But he went out in the woods last night and met up with a woman who said she was your new girlfriend. She gave him a drink. It was bad vampire blood, and it made him sick as the flu.\" I looked over at Bill. \"Maybe she got it from Bubba. I haven\u0027t seen him to ask. I\u0027m kind of worried about him.\" I knew Bill could see me far more clearly than I could see him. I spread my hands in query. Did he know this woman?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill looked at me. His mouth curved up in a rather bitter little smile. \"I\u0027m not dating anyone,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to completely ignore the emotional slant. I didn\u0027t have the time or the energy tonight. I\u0027d been right when I\u0027d discounted the mysterious woman\u0027s identity. \"So this was someone who could pretend to be a fangbanger, someone convincing enough to overcome Tray\u0027s good sense, someone who could put him under a spell so he\u0027d drink the blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bubba doesn\u0027t have much good sense at all,\" Bill said. \"Even though some fairy magic doesn\u0027t work on vampires, I don\u0027t think he\u0027d be hard to be spelt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen him tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He came over to my place to put drinks in his cooler, but he seemed weak and disoriented. After he drank a couple of bottles of TrueBlood, he seemed to be better. The last I saw of him, he was walking across the cemetery toward your house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we better go there next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll follow you.\" Bill went to his own car, and we set off to drive the short distance to my place. But Bill caught the light at the intersection of the highway and Hummingbird Road, and I was ahead of him by quite a few seconds. I pulled up in back of the house, which was well-lit. Amelia had never worried about an electric bill in her life; it just made me want to cry sometimes when I followed her around turning off switch after switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out of the car and hurried for the back steps, all ready to say, \"Fairypants!\" when Amelia came to the door. Bill would be there in less than a minute, and we could make a plan on how to find Tray. When Bill got there, he\u0027d check on Bubba; I couldn\u0027t go out in the woods. I was proud of myself for not rushing into the trees to find the vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had so much to think about that I didn\u0027t think about the most obvious danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no excuse for my lack of attention to detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman by herself always has to be alert, and a woman who\u0027s had the experiences I\u0027ve had has extra cause for alarm when blips are on her radar. The security light was still on at the house and and the backyard looked normal, it was true. I had even glimpsed Amelia in the kitchen through a window. I hurried to the back steps, my purse slung over my shoulder, my trowel and water guns inside it, my keys in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut anything can be hiding in the shadows, and it takes only a moment\u0027s inattention for a trap to spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a few words in a language I didn\u0027t recognize, but for a second I thought, He\u0027s mumbling , and I couldn\u0027t imagine what a man behind me would be mumbling, and I was about to put my foot on the first step to the back porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I didn\u0027t know a thing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-and-gone-sookie-stackhouse-9/page-16.html","bookId":2199,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:55 PM"}
