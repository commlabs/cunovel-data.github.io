I shook the gate until I thought it would fall over. Finally I climbed over and banged the serpent knocker. The attic curtains ruffled, but no one answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack home I called the Mansion and spoke to Jameson, who said Alexander was asleep. \"I\u0027ll tell him you rang,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell him I\u0027m sorry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was afraid Jameson hated me as much as Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called every hour; each time Jameson and I had the same conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to be home-schooled from now on!\" I yelled when my mother tried to get me out of bed the next morning. Alexander wasn\u0027t taking my calls, and I wasn\u0027t taking Becky\u0027s. \"I\u0027m never going back to school!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll get over this, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you have gotten over Dad? Alexander\u0027s the only person in the universe who understands me! And I messed it all up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Trevor Mitchell messed it up. You were nice to that young man. He\u0027s lucky to have you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think so?\" I started to cry mansion-sized tears. \"I think I ruined his life!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom sat on the edge of my bed. \"He adores you, honey,\" she comforted, hugging me like I was a crying Billy Boy. I could smell the apricots in her shampooed velvet-chestnut hair and the sweet soft scent of her perfume. I needed my mom now. I needed her to tell me everything would be all right. \"I could see how much he adored you when he came to the house,\" she continued. \"It\u0027s a shame people talk about him the way they do.\" \"You were one of those people,\" I sighed. \"And I guess I was, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you weren\u0027t. You liked him for who he really was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did--I mean, do. I really do. But it\u0027s too late now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s never too late. But speaking of late, I\u0027m late! I have to take your father to the airport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call school,\" I called to her at the door. \"Tell them I\u0027m lovesick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the covers over my head. I couldn\u0027t move until night. I had to see my Alexander, to shake some sense into his pale body. To beg his forgiveness. I couldn\u0027t go to the Mansion, and I couldn\u0027t break in--he might call the cops this time. There was only one place to go--one other place where he might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed into Dullsville\u0027s cemetery with a bouquet of daffodils in my backpack. I walked quickly among the tombstones, trying to retrace the steps we had once taken together. I was as excited as I was nervous. I imagined him waiting for me, running up to me, and giving me a huge hug and showering me with kisses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I thought, Will he forgive me? Was this our first fight--or our last?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually I found his grandma\u0027s monument, but Alexander wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laid the flowers on the grave. My belly hurt, like it was caving in. Tears started welling up in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandma,\" I said out loud, looking around. But who could hear me? I could shout if I wanted to. \"Grandma, I messed up, messed up big time. There is no one in this world more wild about your grandson than I am. Could you please help me? I miss him so much! Alexander believes I think he\u0027s so different, and I do think he\u0027s different--but from other people, not from me. I love him. Could you help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited, looking for a sign, something magical, a miracle--bats flying overhead or a loud thunderclap. Anything. But there was only the sound of crickets. Maybe it takes a little bit longer for miracles and signs. I could only hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day of being lovesick turned into two days, which turned into three and four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t make me go to school!\" I shouted every morning and turned over and went back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson continued to tell me Alexander couldn\u0027t come to the phone. \"He needs time,\" Jameson offered. \"Please be patient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatient? How could I be patient when every second of our separation felt like an eternity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday morning I had an unwelcome visitor. \"I challenge you to a duel!\" my father said, throwing his tennis racket on my bed. He opened the curtains and allowed the sun to blind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need exercise.\" He threw a white T-shirt and white tennis skirt onto my bed. \"These are Mom\u0027s! I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d find anything white in your drawers. Now let\u0027s scoot! Court time is in half an hour.\" \"But I haven\u0027t played in years!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. That\u0027s why I\u0027m taking you. I want to win today,\" he said and closed the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you\u0027ll win!\" I yelled through the closed door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDullsville\u0027s country club was just as I remembered it from all those years ago--snobby and boring. The pro shop was filled with designer tennis skirts and socks, neon balls, and overpriced rackets. There was a four-star restaurant that charged five dollars for a glass of water. I almost fit in, with my mom\u0027s white threads, except for the black lipstick. But my father let it go. I think he was happy I was in an upright position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran after my dad\u0027s shots with a vengeance, each ball having Trevor Mitchell\u0027s face on it. I hit the balls as hard as I could, and naturally they either crashed into the net or into the fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You used to let me win,\" I said after we ordered lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can I let you win when you\u0027re slamming every shot into the net? Swing easy and follow through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I\u0027ve been hitting the ball in the wrong direction a lot lately. I never should have let Trevor get the best of me. I should never have believed the rumors, or wanted to believe them. I miss Alexander so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt lunch the waiter brought me a garden salad and a tuna melt for my dad. I stared at my tomatoes, eggs, and romaine lettuce. \"Dad, do you think I\u0027ll ever meet someone like Alexander again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\" he asked, taking a bite of his sandwich. \"I don\u0027t think I will. I think he\u0027s it. He\u0027s the special one people only find in movies and gushy romance novels. Like Heathcliff or Romeo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes welled up with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay, honey,\" he said, handing me his napkin. \"When I met your mother, I wore John Lennon glasses and had hair down to the middle of my back. I didn\u0027t know what a pair of scissors or a razor looked like! Her father didn\u0027t like me because of the way I looked and my radical politics. But she and I saw the world the same way. And that\u0027s all that mattered. It was a Wednesday when I first saw your mom, on the university lawn, in maroon bell-bottoms and a white halter top, twirling her long brown hair, gazing up. I walked over and asked what she was staring at. `That mother bird is feeding its baby birds. Isn\u0027t it beautiful?\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s a raven!\u0027 And she quoted some lines from Edgar Allan Poe. I laughed. `What are you laughing at?\u0027 she asked me. And I told her it was a crow, not a raven. \u0027Oh, that\u0027s what I get for partying too hard last night,\u0027 she said, laughing with me. \u0027But aren\u0027t they beautiful just the same?\u0027 And I told her right there and then that yes, they were. But she was more beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shouldn\u0027t be telling you this. Especially the part about the partying!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom always told me that\u0027s how I got my name, but she never mentioned the partying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thanked the universe my parents had been looking at a raven that day and not a squirrel. The results would have been disastrous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, what do I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to figure that one out yourself. But if the ball lands in your court again, don\u0027t smash it into the fence. Just open your eyes and swing right through.\" We got my salad to go as I couldn\u0027t chew on it and the tennis metaphors at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was greatly confused. I didn\u0027t know what to do. Hit the ball or wait for it to come to me? My father was lollygagging with a friend when I heard a voice say, \"You play a mean game, Raven!\" I turned around and saw Matt leaning against the front counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t play at all!\" I replied, surprised. I looked around for Trevor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not talking about tennis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m talking about school, about Trevor. Don\u0027t worry, he\u0027s not here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, are you trying to start something with me?\" I asked, clutching my racket. \"Here at the club?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m trying to end it. I mean, what he does to you and Becky and everyone. Even me. And I\u0027m his best friend. But you stick up for everyone here. And you don\u0027t even like us.\" He laughed. \"We\u0027re mean to you and you still get Trevor back for all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we on Spy TV?\" I asked, looking around for hidden cameras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bring spice to this town, with your funky clothes and your attitude. You don\u0027t care what people think, and this town revolves on what people think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Trevor hiding in the gift shop?\" I asked, peering over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Snow Ball really changed a lot of people\u0027s minds. Trevor used the whole school, and in the end he made fools of everyone. I think it was our wake-up call.\" I realized there were no hidden cameras or hiding Trevors. Matt wasn\u0027t joking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish Alexander could hear you say this,\" I finally said. \"I haven\u0027t seen him, and I\u0027m afraid I never will again. Trevor ruined everything,\" I said, my eyes starting to well up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Screw Trevor!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral people looked over, as it wasn\u0027t polite to swear at the club, even though they did on the court after they missed a shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotta run, Raven--see you,\" Matt said as he took off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like you to meet an old acquaintance, Raven,\" my father said, approaching with a strikingly suntanned man after Matt left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nice to see you, Raven,\" he said. \"It\u0027s been a while. You look so grown-up now. I wouldn\u0027t recognize you without the lipstick. Do you remember me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could I forget him? The first time I entered the Mansion, the basement window, the red cap. The warm kiss on my cheek from the handsome new guy trying to fit in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack Patterson! Of course I remember you, but I can\u0027t believe you remember me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll always remember you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you two know each other?\" my father asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From school,\" Jack answered, with a glint in his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what are you up to now?\" Jack asked me. \"Rumor has it that you\u0027re going into the Mansion through the front door these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I was, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack recently moved back to town and took over his father\u0027s department store,\" my dad said. \"Yeah, stop by sometime,\" Jack said. \"I\u0027ll give you a discount.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you sell combat boots and black cosmetics?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Patterson laughed. \"I guess some things haven\u0027t changed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt suddenly returned. \"Ready to go, Matt?\" Jack asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know Matt?\" I asked, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re cousins. I\u0027m glad I moved back--I have some reservations about the crowd he hangs around with.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-kisses-vampire-kisses-1/page-20.html","bookId":2137,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:52 PM"}
