She was barely recognizable, she was so covered in the dust of the past, but her eyes were bright in her smudged face. “Well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You found a room,” he said, feeling foolish for stating the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. He saw that Professor Laymon, Brad Verdun and a number of other workers were clustered at the far side of the room. They clearly understood the significance of the find far more that he did. They were talking excitedly and dusting at a wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a crypt,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A crypt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was a church here at one time, built in 1817, to be exact,” she told him. “A few years later, it burned to the ground in the fire that destroyed much of old New York. Other buildings went up on the site and were razed over the next century, and then, in the late 1930s, what we’d now call a miniskyscraper went up. That’s what was just torn down. But this is it, the proof that we’ve made an amazing find. Look! This is where the priests and the wealthy were buried, not mixed with the poorer people buried in the churchyard. We’ve already found gold crucifixes and other High Episcopalian paraphernalia, and even a storeroom of old books and documents. Isn’t it great?” she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amazing,” he told her. “And your…” He found himself lowering his voice. “Your instinct led you to it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started laughing again, delighted, elated. “No, I leaned against what I thought was an embankment, and I fell through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to appreciate the rueful humor in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Laymon let out an excited cry. “I can’t believe it! It’s a cache of sermons. There’s a protected niche here…watch the bones,” he warned, as eager workers surged forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Congratulations,” Joe said. “And thanks for getting me in here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was holding his hands, he realized, as if they were old friends. But then again, they did have a bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had both loved Matt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled him closer, rising slightly on her toes to whisper, “You had to see what I was talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The city under the city.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And,” he said softly, “you think that there might be a psycho kidnapping and killing prostitutes and then hiding the bodies in hidden crypts?” He didn’t mean to sound as skeptical as he did, but she merely stared at him, amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe not crypts, but somewhere in the abandoned places under New York. Do you have any better answers?” she inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. So let’s start exploring underground.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, smiling. “I’m just about done here, anyway. So how was your day?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to answer, and then decided not to bother. He’d spent the day retracing his steps. He’d gone back to Genevieve’s apartment. He’d studied every little scrap of paper she’d left lying around, every note. He’d checked out her last doctor’s appointment and her last dentist appointment. He’d visited the bars where she’d partied with friends, and all he’d found anywhere were people who spoke of her wistfully and with affection. He’d checked again for any evidence of her credit cards being used. Then he’d headed back to the street where Didi continued to ply her trade. She hadn’t remembered anything else, and none of the other prostitutes she’d introduced him to had anything helpful to add, either, though they had all spoken admiringly of Genevieve. In the end, it still seemed he had hit his best stroke of luck when he first met Didi—the last time anyone had seen Genevieve O’Brien had been when she had gotten into the dark sedan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe highlight of the day, of course, had been telling Didi about the waitressing job he had arranged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your friend would hire me?” she asked skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Cut the makeup by half, wear something that covers you…you know the drill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re taking a risk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Life is a risk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I owe you. I’ll be there. And I won’t let you down. Except now I won’t have Genevieve to help me get my daughter back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Start with legitimate employment, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely.” She’d hugged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe low point of the day had been talking to Eileen Brideswell and telling her that, so far, he’d traced Genevieve to a street corner and a dark sedan, and no further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leslie,” Brad Verdun called excitedly. “Come look at these.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned at the sound of her name and was looking at him when he first noticed Joe. For a minute he went dead still. Maybe it was the light, but he seemed to turn parchment white. His lips formed a single word. Matt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, no. Joe Connolly, Matt’s cousin,” Joe said, walking carefully across the uneven floor and offering his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow.” Verdun stared at him, openmouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaymon turned around then and gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Joseph Connolly,” Joe repeated. “Matt’s cousin.” Did they all believe in ghosts? Hell, these people spent their lives working with the past and the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a dead ringer for him,” Brad said, then winced. “Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all right. Leslie asked me down here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cool,” Brad said. “She just never mentioned you, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe didn’t reply. No need to say that they had just met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeslie came up behind him then. “I’m going to take off, let you guys deal with all this,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrad frowned. “Leslie, you must realize the significance—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, and we’ll be working in here for weeks,” she said cheerfully. “And for the love of God, Brad, you deal with the reporters, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know I will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on,” she said to Joe, taking his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice to meet you,” he said, letting her drag him away. The other men just stared. Neither one replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe climbed out of the hole first, then reached back to help her. They were both covered in grime, but as he helped her out, he was surprised by the sound of applause coming from the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the dirt on her face, he saw her blanch. “It’s all right. We’ll get away,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was standing, he turned to see Ken Dryer, whom he knew from his own days on the force, coming toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the dirt everywhere, Dryer still managed to look impeccable in his dress uniform. He was the perfect spokesman—tall, dark and handsome, with a voice that would have done the old crooners proud. “Leslie, the reporters are all clamoring to talk to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I fell into a hole. You tell them about it,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can, but—” He broke off, staring at Joe. “Hey, Joe. What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leslie called me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You two—oh, yeah…the Matt connection,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe shrugged. “Right, the Matt connection.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ken, please help me get out of here today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen stared at her, then shrugged and smiled. “I guess the rest of us are exhibitionists, huh? Brad and the professor love to talk. Even Hank has been giving them an earful, though his heart must be sinking. I’d say you’re looking at a good year here, holding up the building process. Oh, well, they’re going for public appeal, and this time, they’ll be paying a price. Head for the trailer. I’ll send an officer to lead you out the back gate in the fence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Ken,” she said, then took Joe’s arm. “This way,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed for the trailer. He could hear the protest of the crowd, but then Dryer’s smooth tones rose above it, followed a moment later by laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the trailer in safety. “Want water? A soda?” she asked him as soon as they were inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Water would be great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had barely supplied him with a plastic bottle before the door opened. In Joe’s opinion, the man who entered could only be described as oily. “Hey, Leslie. I heard you needed some help escaping,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe wasn’t sure why, but he hated the guy the minute he heard those simple words. The man was talking as if it were his job to protect Leslie. His voice had a proprietorial tone, and he just didn’t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the guy noticed him—how it had taken him so long, Joe didn’t know, since he was a good six-three—he went dead still, gaping. Joe found himself enjoying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Joseph Connolly,” he said, offering a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a second the fellow looked horrified, as if he were about to collapse. “Hello, sorry…I…uh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t see a ghost. I’m Matt’s cousin, and I’m just starting to realize how much he and I resembled each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot.” Hank looked at Leslie. In fact, he looked as if he’d like to come between the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think of the new discovery?” Joe asked politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Incredible. Seems Leslie’s luck is still holding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just lack of coordination, I’m afraid,” she said. “I fell through a wall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This will hold up building for a long time,” Joe said easily. “How is the company going to deal with that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to go with the flow, celebrate history,” Hank said. He grinned, and it seemed like an honest grin. “Every time those cameras roll, they’re picking up the company logo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still, you must be talking millions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And millions. Doesn’t matter. Have you ever tried to buy an ad during the Superbowl?” Hank asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t say I have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good press is expensive.” Hank touched Leslie’s cheek. A little too familiarly, Joe thought, then told himself to shut up. What right did he have, after all? “When you can’t beat trouble, you just have to deal,” he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-room-harrison-investigation-4/page-20.html","bookId":2270,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:29:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:29:33 PM"}
