Iâ€¦ confided in several people that I was being blackmailed. It appeared that it might be possible to recover the evidence without acceding to Jablon\u0027s demands. More important, it was necessary to devise some way in which Jablon\u0027s silence could be purchased on a permanent basis. The trouble with blackmail is that one never ceases to pay it. The cycle can go on forever, there\u0027s no control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So somebody tried to scare Spinner once with a car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it would seem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when that didn\u0027t work, somebody hired somebody to hire somebody to kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so. You can\u0027t prove it. What\u0027s perhaps more to the point, I can\u0027t prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you believed it all along, didn\u0027t you? Because you warned me that one payment was all I was going to get. And if I tried to tap you again, you\u0027d have me killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I really say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you remember saying it, Mr. Huysendahl. I should have seen the significance in that at the time. You were thinking of murder as a weapon in your arsenal. Because you\u0027d already used it once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never intended for a moment that Jablon should die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up. I said, \"I was reading something the other day about Thomas Becket. He was very close to one of the kings of England. One of the Henrys, I think Henry the Second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe I see the parallel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know the story? When he became Archbishop of Canterbury he stopped being Henry\u0027s buddy and played the game according to his conscience. It rattled Henry, and he let some of his underlings know it. \u0027Oh, that someone might rid me of that rebellious priest!\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he never intended that Thomas be murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was his story,\" I agreed. \"His subordinates decided Henry had issued Thomas\u0027s death warrant. Henry didn\u0027t see it that way at all, he\u0027d just been thinking out loud, and he was very upset to learn that Thomas was dead. Or at least he pretended to be very upset. He\u0027s not around, so we can\u0027t ask him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re taking the position that Henry was responsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saying I wouldn\u0027t vote for him for governor of New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished his drink. He put the glass on the bar and sat down in his chair again, crossing one leg over the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"If I run for governor-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then every major newspaper in the state gets a full set of those photographs. Until you announce for governor, they stay where they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A very safe place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I have no option.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No other choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might be able to determine the man responsible for Jablon\u0027s death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you could. It\u0027s also possible you couldn\u0027t. But what good would that do? He\u0027s sure to be a professional, and there would be no evidence to link him to either you or Jablon, let alone enough to bring him to trial. And you couldn\u0027t do anything with him without exposing yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re making this terribly difficult, Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m making it very easy. All you have to do is forget about being governor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would be an excellent governor. If you\u0027re so fond of historical parallels, you might consider Henry the Second a bit further. He\u0027s regarded as one of England\u0027s better monarchs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would.\" He told me some things about Henry. I gather he knew quite a bit about the subject. It might have been interesting. I didn\u0027t pay much attention to it. Then he went on to tell me some more about what a good governor he would make, what he would accomplish for the people of the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut him short. I said, \"You have a lot of plans, but that doesn\u0027t mean anything. You wouldn\u0027t be a good governor. You won\u0027t be any kind of governor, because I\u0027m not going to let you, but you wouldn\u0027t be a good one because you\u0027re capable of picking people to work for you who are capable of murder. That\u0027s enough to disqualify you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could discharge those people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t know if you did or not. And the individuals aren\u0027t even that important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" He sighed again. \"He wasn\u0027t much of a man, you know. I\u0027m not justifying murder when I say that. He was a petty crook and a shoddy blackmailer. He began by entrapping me, preying on a personal weakness, and then he tried to bleed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t much of a man at all,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet his murder is that significant to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like murder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe that human life is sacred, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if I believe that anything is sacred. It\u0027s a very complicated question. I\u0027ve taken human life. A few days ago I killed a man. Not long before that, I contributed to a man\u0027s death. My contribution was unintentional. That hasn\u0027t made me feel all that much better about it. I don\u0027t know if human life is sacred. I just don\u0027t like murder. And you\u0027re in the process of getting away with murder, and that bothers me, and there\u0027s just one thing I\u0027m going to do about it. I don\u0027t want to kill you, I don\u0027t want to expose you, I don\u0027t want to do any of those things. I\u0027m sick of playing an incompetent version of God. All I\u0027m going to do is keep you out of Albany.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t that constitute playing God?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say human life is sacred. Not in so many words, but that seems to be your position. What about my life, Mr. Scudder? For years now only one thing has been important to me, and you\u0027re presuming to tell me I can\u0027t have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around the den. The portraits, the furnishings, the service bar. \"It looks to me as though you\u0027re doing pretty well,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have material possessions. I can afford them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enjoy them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there no way I can buy you? Are you that devoutly incorruptible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m probably corrupt, by most definitions. But you can\u0027t buy me, Mr. Huysendahl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for him to say something. A few minutes went by, and he just remained where he was, silent, his eyes looking off into the middle distance. I found my own way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I got to St. Paul\u0027s before it closed. I stuffed a tenth of what I\u0027d taken from Lundgren into the poor box. I lit a few candles for various dead people who came to mind. I sat for a while and watched people take their turns in the confessional. I decided that I envied them, but not enough to do anything about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went across the street to Armstrong\u0027s and had a plate of beans and sausage, then a drink and a cup of coffee. It was over now, it was all over, and I could drink normally again, never getting drunk, never staying entirely sober. I nodded at people now and then, and some of them nodded back to me. It was Saturday, so Trina was off, but Larry did just as good a job of bringing more coffee and bourbon when my cup was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the time I just let my mind wander, but from time to time I would find myself going over the events since Spinner had walked in and given me his envelope. There were probably ways I could have handled things better. If I\u0027d pushed it a little and taken an interest at the beginning, I might even have been able to keep Spinner alive. But it was over and I was done with it, and I even had some of his money left after what I\u0027d paid to Anita and the churches and various bartenders, and I could relax now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This seat taken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t even noticed when she came in. I looked up and there she was. She sat down across from me and took a pack of cigarettes from her bag. She shook a cigarette loose and lit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You\u0027re wearing the white pants suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s so you\u0027ll be able to recognize me. You sure managed to turn my life inside out, Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I did. They\u0027re not going to press anything, are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They couldn\u0027t press a pants suit, let alone a charge. Johnny never knew Spinner existed. That should be my biggest headache.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got other headaches?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a manner of speaking, I just got rid of a headache. It cost me a lot to get rid of him, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your husband?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"He decided without too much trouble that I was a luxury he intended to deny himself. He\u0027s getting a divorce. And I am not getting any alimony, because if I give him any trouble he\u0027s going to give me ten times as much trouble, and I think he\u0027d probably do it. Not that there wasn\u0027t enough shit in the papers already, as far as that goes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t been keeping up with the papers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve missed some nice stuff.\" She drew on her cigarette and blew out a cloud of smoke. \"You really do your drinking in all the class joints, don\u0027t you? I tried your hotel but you weren\u0027t in, so then I tried Polly\u0027s Cage, and they said you came here a lot of the time. I can\u0027t imagine why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It suits me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked her head, studying me. \"You know something? It does. But me a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got Larry\u0027s attention, and she ordered a glass of wine. \"It probably won\u0027t be terrific,\" she said, \"but at least it\u0027s hard for the bartender to fuck it up.\" When he brought it she raised her glass to me, and I returned the gesture with my cup. \"Happy days,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Happy days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t want him to kill you, Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither did I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious. All I wanted was time. I would have handled everything on my own, one way or another. I never called Johnny, you know. How would I have known how to reach him? He called me after he got out of jail. He wanted me to send him some money. He would do that now and then, when he was up against it. I felt guilty about turning state\u0027s evidence that time, even though it had been his idea. But when I had him on the phone I couldn\u0027t keep myself from telling him I was in trouble, and that was a mistake. He was more trouble than I was ever in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was the hold he had on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But he always had it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fingered me for him. That night at Polly\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wanted to get a look at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He got it. Then I set up a meeting with you Wednesday. The cute thing about that was I wanted to tell you you were clear. I thought I already had the killer, and I wanted to let you know the blackmail routine was over and done with. Instead, you put off the meeting for a day and sent him after me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was going to talk to you. Scare you off, stall for time, something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not the way he saw it. You must have figured he\u0027d try what he tried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated for a moment, then let her shoulders drop. \"I knew it was possible. He wasâ€¦ he had a wildness in him.\" Her face brightened suddenly, and something danced in her eyes. \"Maybe you did me a favor,\" she said. \"Maybe I\u0027m a lot better off with him out of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better off than you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean there was a very good reason why he wanted me dead. I\u0027m just guessing, but I like my guesses. You would have been happy to stall me until you came into some money, which would happen once Kermit came into the principal of his inheritance. But Lundgren couldn\u0027t afford to have me around, now or later. Because he had big plans for you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/time-to-murder-and-create-matthew-scudder-2/page-22.html","bookId":2321,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:58 PM"}
