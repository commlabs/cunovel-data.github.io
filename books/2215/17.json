His dark\u001egreen eyes made me think of Merrick\u0027s, and for one moment I felt such a desire for her, such a horror of what I\u0027d done, that I couldn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Louis explained the very perceptions and sensations that were overwhelming me as I thought about all I\u0027d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never realized how much you loved this woman,\" he said. \"I never realized how very different you are from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love her, yes, and perhaps I myself didn\u0027t realize how much until I told you the history. I made myself see it. I made myself remember. I made myself experience my union with her again. But when you speak of you and me being different, you must tell me what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wise,\" he said, \"Wise in ways that only an elderly human being can be. You experienced old age in a way that none of the rest of us has ever known. Not even the great mother, Maharet, knew infirmity before she was made a vampire centuries ago. Certainly, Lestat has never grasped it, in spite of all his injuries. And I? I\u0027ve been too young for too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t condemn yourself for it. Do you think human beings are meant to know the bitterness and loneliness I knew in my last mortal years? I don\u0027t think so. Like all creatures, we\u0027re made to live until our prime. All the rest is spiritual and physical disaster. Of that I\u0027m convinced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t agree with you,\" he said modestly. \"What tribe on earth has not had elders? How much of our art and our knowledge comes from those who\u0027ve lived into old age? You sound like Lestat when you say such things, speaking of his Savage Garden. The world has never seemed a hopelessly savage place to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe so many things,\" I said. \"One has only to press you to discover them, yet you deny the value of everything you\u0027ve learned, in your constant melancholy. You do, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I can\u0027t make sense of things, David,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we\u0027re not meant to, any of us, whether we\u0027re old or very young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possibly so,\" he said. \"But what\u0027s very important now is that we both make a solemn vow. We will not injure this vital and unique woman. Her strength won\u0027t blind us. We will feed her curiosity and be just to her, and protective of her, but we will not bring her any harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. I knew his meaning quite plainly. Oh, how I knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would that I could say,\" he whispered, \"that we would withdraw our request. Would that I could endure without Merrick\u0027s magic. Would that I could leave this world without ever seeing Claudia\u0027s ghost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk of ending it, please, I can\u0027t listen to it,\" I hastened to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, but I must talk of it. It\u0027s all I think about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then think of those words I spoke to the spirit in the cave. Life belongs to those who are alive. You are alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At such a price,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Louis, we are both of us desperate to live,\" I said. \"We look to Merrick\u0027s magic for consolation. We dream of looking through the mask ourselves, don\u0027t we? We want to see something that does make it all come together, is that not so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know that I\u0027m so deliberate, David,\" he responded. His face was dark with worry, heavy with fine lines at the corners of his eyes and mouth, lines that vanished whenever his face was still. \"I don\u0027t know what I want,\" he confessed. \"Oh, but to see spirits as Merrick has seen them, as you\u0027ve seen them. Oh, if only I could hear the ghostly harpsichord that others hear in this place. Oh, if I could talk to a spirit with the strength of Honey in the Sunshine, what that would mean to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Louis, what can make you want to continue?\" I asked. \"What could make you see that we are privileged witnesses of what the world has to offer on all sides?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, a short polite but contemptuous laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A clear conscience, David,\" he replied. \"What else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then take the blood I have to give,\" I said to him. \"Take the blood Lestat has offered you more than once. Take the blood that you\u0027ve refused so many times, and be strong enough to live by the \u0027little drink\u0027 and push death out of your way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a bit surprised at the vehemence with which I recommended this, because before this conversation¡ªbefore this long night of storytelling¡ªI had thought his decision to refuse the powerful blood to be very wise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0027ve stated in this narrative, he was weak enough that the sun might easily destroy him, and in that lay an immense consolation which Lestat and I did not share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, he studied me with a look of interest. I saw no condemnation in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose and walked slowly about the room. Once again, I looked at the bright and confident painting by Monet. All my life seemed close to me suddenly; all my determination was to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I can\u0027t die by my own will,\" I murmured, \"not even if it\u0027s as simple as going into the sunlight. That I cannot do. I want to know what happens! I want to know when and if Lestat wakes from his dreamy sleep. I want to know what will become of Merrick! I want to know what will become of Armand. That I can live forever? Oh, how I cherish it! I cannot pretend to be the mortal who once refused Lestat. I cannot reach back and claim that being\u0027s unimaginative heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and it seemed the room was pulsing violently around me, all its color coalescing, as though Monet\u0027s spirit had infected the very fabric of the solid matter and the air. All the objects of the room seemed arbitrary and symbolic. And beyond lay the savage night¡ªLestat\u0027s Savage Garden¡ªand random unanswerable stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Louis, he was captivated as only he can become, yielding as men almost never yield, no matter in what shape or form the male spirit may be clothed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re all so very strong,\" he said in a low, reverent, and sad voice. \"All so very strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027ll make that vow, old friend,\" I said, \"with regard to Merrick. There will come a time when Merrick will want this magic and reproach us with our selfishness, that we have begged for hers while refusing her our own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouis seemed almost on the edge of tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t underestimate her, David,\" he said in a raw voice. \"Perhaps she\u0027s quite as invincible as you were, in her own way. Perhaps she has shocks in store for us, of which we\u0027re unaware.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I lead you to believe so?\" I asked. \"With all I\u0027ve said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve given me her picture in deep and enduring detail,\" he answered. \"Don\u0027t you think she knows my misery? Don\u0027t you think she will feel it when we meet?\" He hesitated, then continued, \"She won\u0027t want to share our existence. Why should she when she can make herself appear to others, when she can look through a jade mask and see her sister\u0027s ghost. From all you\u0027ve said, I\u0027ve drawn the conclusion that she won\u0027t be at all eager to give up forever the sight of the Egyptian sand in the noonday sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. I couldn\u0027t stop myself. I thought he was completely wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, old friend,\" I said, straining for courtesy. \"I simply don\u0027t know. I know only I\u0027m committed to our wretched purpose. And all that I\u0027ve deliberately recalled has not taught me to be wary or kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose from his chair slowly, silently, and walked to the door of the room. I realized it was time for him to go now and find his coffin, and that shortly I should do the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him, and we went out of the town house together, down the back iron steps and through the wet garden and to the front gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did see the black cat for one instant on the top of the rear wall, but I made no mention of it, determined that cats were simply common in New Orleans and I was being just a bit of a fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last it came time for us to part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll spend the next few evenings with Lestat,\" Louis said quietly. \"I want to read to him. He doesn\u0027t respond but he doesn\u0027t stop me. You\u0027ll know where to find me when Merrick returns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he never say anything to you?\" I asked, regarding Lestat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes he speaks, just a little. He\u0027ll ask for Mozart perhaps, or that I read him some old poetry. But in the main, he\u0027s as you see him yourself, unchanged.\" He paused, then looked directly at the sky. \"I want to be alone with him for a few nights, I suppose, before Merrick comes back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone had a finality to it, and a sadness that touched me to the quick. He was saying farewell to Lestat, that\u0027s what he was doing, and I knew that Lestat\u0027s slumber was so deep and so troubled, that even such a dreadful message from Louis might not rouse him at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Louis walk away as the sky grew ever more lighter. I could hear the morning birds singing. I thought of Merrick, and I wanted her. I wanted her purely as a man might want her. And as a vampire I wanted to drain her soul and have her eternally there for my visits, always safe. I was alone with her again for one precious instant in the tent in Santa Cruz del Flores, and I felt that mercurial pleasure connect my orgasmic body and brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a curse to bring too many mortal memories into vampiric existence. To have been old did mean sublime experience and knowledge. And the curse had richness to it, and a splendor I could not deny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it occurred to me, if Louis does end his life, if he does bring his supernatural journey to a conclusion, how will I ever answer for it to Lestat or Armand, or myself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT WAS A WEEK before I received a handwritten letter from Merrick. She was back in Louisiana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeloved David,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome to my old house tomorrow evening as soon as you can. The caretaker will be safely off the property. And I will be alone in the front room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s my desire to meet Louis and hear from his own lips what he wants for me to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to those items which once belonged to Claudia, I have the rosary, the diary, and the doll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the rest can be arranged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could scarce contain my exhilaration. Waiting till tomorrow would be a torment. I went at once to St. Elizabeth\u0027s, the building where Lestat spent his lonely hours sleeping on the old chapel floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouis was there, seated on the marble beside Lestat, reading in a hushed voice from an old book of English poetry when I came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read the letter to Louis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no change whatsoever in Lestat\u0027s demeanor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know where the house is,\" said Louis. He was extremely excited, though I think he struggled to conceal it. \"I\u0027ll be there. I suppose I should have asked your permission. But I went to find it last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect,\" I responded. \"I\u0027ll meet you there tomorrow evening. But listen, you must¡ª.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on, say it,\" he coaxed me gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must remember, she\u0027s a powerful woman. We\u0027ve vowed to protect her, but don\u0027t for a moment think of her as weak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so we go back and forth about her,\" he said patiently. \"I understand you. I know your meaning. When I vowed to take this path, I braced myself for disaster. And tomorrow night, I shall brace myself as completely as I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestat showed not the slightest sign of having heard our discourse. He lay as before, his red velvet coat creased and dusty, his yellow hair a tangled mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt down and laid a reverent kiss on Lestat\u0027s cheek. He continued to gaze into the gloom before him. Once again, I had the distinct impression that his soul was not in his body, not in the way that we believed it to be. I wanted so to tell him of our enterprise, but then again, I wasn\u0027t sure that I wanted him to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt struck me quite completely that if he knew what we meant to do he would stop us. How far from us his thoughts must have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I left, I heard Louis continue to read in a low, melodious, and faintly passionate voice. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/merrick-the-vampire-chronicles-7/page-17.html","bookId":2215,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:55 PM"}
