They still held the centre and fully commanded the south side of the field. Victory was still possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he would win it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his mind, drawing as much strength as he could from Akhrast Korvalain, he exhorted his soldiers into a battle frenzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Kill them! All these who have so defied us on this day – destroy them! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis horse lagging beneath him, beginning to weave, Paran cursed and slowed the beast. He fumbled in the saddlebag on his left, drew out a lacquered card. Glared at the lone rider painted on it. ‘Mathok! I know you can hear me! I’m about to open the gate for you. But listen! Come at the charge, do you understand? You wanted a damned Hood-balled blood-pissing fight, and now I’m giving it to you!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParan kicked his horse forward again, pushing the poor beast into a gallop. He fixed his eyes on the place where he would tear open the gate, and then rose in his stirrups. ‘There,’ he said to the card, and then threw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe card sailed out, level as a quarrel from a crossbow, so fast it blurred as it cut through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath Paran, his horse stumbled. Then collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw himself clear, struck hard, rolled and was still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthan Gudd fought to defy the envelopment, but even with this unknown brute of a soldier fighting at his side he could not prevent the hundreds of Kolansii from swinging round, well beyond the reach of their swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him he felt a sudden surge rip through the regulars, pushing everyone forward a step. Twisting round, Ruthan strained to see the cause – but dust filled the air, and all he could see was the reeling mass of Malazans, now breaking apart, spilling out, as if in a berserk fever they now sought to charge – but before these soldiers there were no Kolansii.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are broken. They are finally —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder spun him round, and he stared, disbelieving, as thousands of warriors rode out from an enormous gate – but no, this ragged tear in the fabric of the world did not deserve so lofty a title. It was huge, opened to a howling wind – and it was barely thirty paces from the first ranks of the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe riders bore lances, their mounts heavily armoured across chest and neck. They struck the disordered mass of heavy infantry – there had been no time to wheel, no time to draw shields round – and the concussion of that impact shuddered through the Kolansii. The wing split, broke apart – and suddenly all cohesion was lost, and the horse-warriors were delivering slaughter on all sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe regular infantryman beside him stumbled then, leaned hard against Ruthan Gudd’s hip. Startled, he stared down, saw the man pressing his forehead against his ice-sheathed side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes closed, the gasping Kanese breathed, ‘Gods below, that feels good.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara Yil saw Adjunct Tavore stumbling away from the ranks. The pressure was gone – the enemy had other foes to deal with, and those foes were driving them back, away from the Bonehunters. She stared after Tavore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct was barely recognizable. Covered in blood and gore, her helm torn off, her hair stained red, she staggered into the clear. Ten jerking, almost manic steps, her sword still in her hand but held out to one side, as if the arm had forgotten how to relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara pulled free of the ranks, moved after her – but a hand grasped her, dragged her back, and Henar’s voice was close by her ear. ‘No, love. Leave her. Just … leave her.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer steps ran out, lost all momentum, and then she was standing, alone, her back to her army. The sounds of battle seemed to be falling away, as if thick, heavy curtains were being drawn across every side of the world, shutting away every scene, every swirl of motion and dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword, still held out so awkwardly, and her head slowly tilting back, to lift her face to the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes were upon her now, but she saw them not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavore’s mouth opened, and the cry of anguish that tore from it held nothing human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt rang across the field of battle. It pushed past the witnessing Bonehunters, reached out and caressed countless corpses. It fought with the dust, rising up to vanish in the lurid green hue of the sky’s fading light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her voice gave out, all could see that cry continuing in the stretched contortion of her face. Silent now, she gave nothing to the sky, and in that nothing, there was everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf stunned by the fall from the horse, Paran staggered towards her. That sound had not come from his sister. Too terrible, too ravaged, too brutal, and yet it dragged him towards her, as if he was caught in a rushing current. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-451.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
