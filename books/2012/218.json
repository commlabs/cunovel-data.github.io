No one can .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see an end to this, when you stand alone, and the dead shall be your ground .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to the soldier. ‘You need to rest. Deliver this news to Queen Drukorlat. The blood wall has shattered. The Liosan have retreated. Half of us remain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman stared. And then looked around, as if only now realizing the full extent of the horror surrounding them, the heaps of corpses, the entire strand a mass of supine bodies under blood-soaked blankets. She saw her mouth the word half .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When in the palace, rest. Eat.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the soldier was shaking her head. ‘Highness. I have one brother left to me. I cannot stay in the palace – I cannot leave his side for too long. I am sorry. I shall deliver your message and then return at once.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis wanted to rail at her, but she bit down on her fury, for it was meant not for this woman, but for Yedan Derryg, who had done this to her people. ‘Tell me then, where is your brother?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman pointed to a boy sleeping in a press of Shake fighters resting nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vision seemed to stab deep into Yan Tovis and she struggled to stifle a sob. ‘Be with him, then – I will find another for the message.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Highness! I can—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed the waterskin into the woman’s arms. ‘When he awakens, he will be thirsty.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the soldier’s wounded expression as she backed away, Yan Tovis could only turn from her, fixing her eyes once more upon the breach. It’s not you who has failed me , she wanted to say to that soldier, it is I who have failed you . But then she was alone once more and it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother, are you down there? I cannot see you. Do you stand triumphant once more? I cannot see you .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I can see is what you did. Yesterday. A thousand years ago. In the breath just past. When there are none but ghosts left upon the Shore, they will sing your praises. They will make of you a legend that none living will ever hear – gods, the span of time itself must be crowded with such legends, for ever lost yet whispered eternally on the winds .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if that is the only true measure of time? All that only the dead have witnessed, all that only they can speak of, though no mortal life will ever hear them. All those stories for ever lost .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it any wonder we cannot grasp hold of the ages past? That all we can manage is what clings to our own lives, and what waits within reach? To all the rest, we are cursed to deafness .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, because she knew naught else to do, in her mind Yan Tovis reached out – to that moment a day past, or a breath ago, or indeed at the very dawn of time, when she saw her brother lead a sortie into the face of the Liosan centre, and his Hust sword howled with slaughter, and, with that voice, summoned a dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tightened the straps of her helm and readied her sword. Down at the breach the Liosan were pouring like foam from the wound, and Yan Tovis could see her Shake buckling. Everywhere but at the centre, where her brother hacked his way forward, and all the enemy reeling before him seemed to be moving at half his speed. He could have been cutting reeds for all the resistance they offered him. Even from this distance, blood washed like a bow wave before Yedan’s advance, and behind him Shake fighters followed, and she could see how his deadliness infected them, raised them into a state of frenzied fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom one flank two Letherii companies pushed in to bolster her people, and she watched the line stiffen, watched it plant its feet and hold fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis set off for the other flank, increasing her pace until she was jogging. Anything faster would have instilled panic in those who saw her. But the longer she took, the closer that flank edged towards routing, and the more of her people died beneath the Liosan attackers. Her heart thundered, and trembling took possession of her entire body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto the press, shouting now, forcing her way through. Her fighters found her with wild, frightened eyes, fixed upon her with sudden hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they needed more than hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her sword, and became a queen going to war. Unleashed, the battle lust of her royal line, the generation upon generation of this one necessity, this nectar of power, rising within her, taking away the words in her voice, leaving only a savage scream that made those close to her flinch and stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuddling in a corner of her mind was a bleak awareness, observing with an ironic half-smile. Do you hear me, brother? Here on your left? Do you nod in satisfaction? Do you feel my blood reaching to meet yours? Rulers of the Shake, once more fighting upon the Shore .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, we have never been as pathetic as we are at this moment, Yedan. Pathetic in our fate, trapped in our roles, our place in things. We were born to this scene. Every freedom was a lie. A terrible, heart-crushing lie . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-218.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
