You never knew what set killers off, and the quiet ones were the most dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint closed his eyes.

The sight of it thrilled his soul with majestic wonder. It was the mansion of his birth, the clean white mansion that existed somewhere in this land far from the dismal grime of his life. Hebegan to walk across the lawn toward it, but as always he couldn\u0027t get any nearer. It always drew away from him no matter how fast or how long he walked. He could hear his shoes-his shining, polished black wingtips-pressing down the velvet blades of grass. He could feel the summer breeze on his face, and see his shadow walking ahead of him. He would have to walk faster. But again the white mansion receded, a beautiful taunt. Inside that mansion lived his mother and father, and if he could only get there, he could ask them to take him in, he could tell them he forgave them for giving him up when he was a three-armed . baby with a fleshy knot on his side that had an extra mouth and set of nostrils in it. He could show them he\u0027d grown up to be a man of taste, of manners and good breeding, and he could tell them he loved them and if they took him in he would promise-he would swear to God-that he would never cause them reason to be ashameBAM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe explosion blasted Flint out of his dream. As the mansion was swept away in a heartbeat, he sat up with a jolt, his eyes bleary and the derringer held in a white-knuckled grip. His first thought was that Lambert had gone crazy and was trying to ding the cot over to W at him with his free hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan was sitting up, too, his mind still shocked by the noise that had shattered his deep and dreamless sleep. The handcuff was cutting into his right wrist. He and Flint looked at each other, both of them dazed. Mama had started barking, and Pelvis was making-a sputtering noise as he struggled back to the land of the living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly someone came into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re in here!

He started thrashing, but the arm squeezed his larynx and took the fight out of him.

Again Doc placed the automatic\u0027s. barrel to his forehead. \"Mitch, shake him down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wearin\u0027 an empty holster under his right arm,\" Mitch said as he frisked Flint. \"And he\u0027s got something\u0027 - . . holy Jesse!\" Mitch jumped aside as if his hands had been scorched, his eyes wide with shock. \"It moved!\" He fumbled under his shirt and pulled out a blue-steel revolver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It moved? What moved?\" Doc tore the front of Flint\u0027s suit jacket open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they all saw it: a serpentine shape twisting and writhin beneath Flint\u0027s shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc reached toward him, meaning to rip the shirt open, but before he could do it, Clint pushed free: first the small fingers and hand, followed by the slim, milky-white and hairless arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc stood very, very still. Everyone in the room was very, very still. Dan was starting to wonder what might\u0027ve been in that gumbo he\u0027d eaten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint\u0027s hand clenched at the air. Flint knew what would happen next; his shirt would be torn right off his back. To prevent that indignity, he undid the rest of the buttons and opened his shirt for them all to have a good look, his face tightening with rage because their eyes had taken on that old familiar glint of ravening fascination he\u0027d suffered so many times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamn!\" Doc whispered. \"He\u0027s a fuckin\u0027 freak!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother Clint.\" Flint\u0027s voice was toneless, dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Born this way. Here\u0027s his head. See?\" He drew his shirt wider to show them the \u0027 fist-size lump of Clint\u0027s eyeless face at his side. \"I used to work the carnival circuit. Alive, alive, alive,\" Flint said, and a dark and terrible grin split his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ain\u0027t never seen nothin\u0027 like that before,\" Monty observed. He still held Mama-who\u0027d given up on her snarling but was still kicking to get loose-by the scruff of the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027@n a girl with three tits before, but nothin\u0027 like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eain\u0027t real!\" The man who\u0027d gripped Flint\u0027s throat and taken away the derringer had backed halfway across the room. \"It\u0027s a trick!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You touch it and find out!\" Mitch snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc pushed Clint\u0027s hand with the automatic\u0027s barrel as Flint\u0027s insides trembled. Suddenly Clint\u0027s fingers closed around the barrel, and Doc gave a quiet laugh. \"Farrrr out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe carefully worked the pistol\u0027s barrel free. \"He\u0027d like to see this, wouldn\u0027t he? He\u0027d get a rush out of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn straight, he would,\" Monty agreed. \"He\u0027d laugh his ass off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc finished the job of frisking Flint, then-satisfied the bounty hunter had no other weapons-he spun the .45 around a finger and pushed it back into his waistband. \"Get up, Elvis. We\u0027re goin\u0027 for a boat ride. Mitch, cuff \u0027em together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me! I ain\u0027t touchin\u0027 that bastard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You pussy.\" Doc took the handcuffs and snapped Pelvis\u0027s left wrist to Flint\u0027s right. The key went into a pocket of his chinos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you takin\u0027 \u0027em?\" Dan asked, standing up from the cot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brother Dan, you really don\u0027t want to know. Just call this a gift and let it go at that. Now, if I were in your shoes- He glanced down at them. \"I\u0027d steal some new ones. Those are about shot, kemo sabe. But if I were you, I wouldn\u0027t stick too long \u0027round here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWouldn\u0027t be prudent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I have my dog, please?\" Pelvis sounded close to sobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, can I have her back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, it\u0027s my dog now!\" Monty rumbled. He held Mama up and shook her. \"Have it with some bacon and eggs come daylight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne second Pelvis was a begging sack of sad flesh; the next second he was a juggernaut, leaping forward, his teeth gritted in a snarl, his unchained hand straining for Monty\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonty jerked Mama out of Pelvis\u0027s reach and hit him, hard and fast, with a scarred fist right in the mouth. Pelvis\u0027s head snapped back, his knees giving way, and as he fell he almost dragged Flint down with him. Mitch was laughing a high-pitched giggle, Mama was snarling again, and Doc said, \"Get up, Elvis!\" He grabbed a handful of pompadour, pulled, and wound up with a wig daioing from his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" he laughed. \"This fucker\u0027s comin\u0027 apart!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePelvis was down on his knees, his head bent forward, and drops of blood were dripping on the planks. His back heaved, and now it was Dan\u0027s turn to be speared with anguish. He didn\u0027t know what to do; he didn\u0027t know if there was anything he could do. Flint shot a glare at Dan that said Look what you got us into and then he bent beside Pelvis and said, \"Hang on. Just halag on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand him up, bounty hunter.\" Doc planted the wig backward on Pelvis\u0027s naked pate. \"Let\u0027s go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you leave him alone? He\u0027s not right in the head, can\u0027t you see that7\" \"Ain\u0027t right in the teeth, ya mean,\" Monty said, and he grunted a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all Flint could do not to go for the bastard\u0027s throat himself, but he knew it would do no good. \"Come on, stand up,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll help you.\" He had to struggle with Pelvis\u0027s weight, but then Pelvis was standing on his own. Flint didn\u0027t want to look at the man\u0027s face. Some of the blood had dripped onto Clint\u0027s fingers and Flint\u0027s shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out,\" Doc told them, and Monty gave them a shove toward the back door he\u0027d kicked down. Dan stood, watching them go, the wheels spinning and smoking in his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc lingered behind the others. \"Either of those men you killed a cop?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made no sense at this precarious point to tell Doc he\u0027d killed only one man, and that by sheer bad luck. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time try for a cop.\" Doc walked out of the cabin into the dark, whistling a happy tune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Dan stood alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossbones A pounding noise brought Arden up from the slow current of sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked out the window. Still dark. What was that noise? Louder, more insistent than the machinery. It took her another few seconds, her head still cloudy, to realize somebody was at the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arden! Open up! It\u0027s me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan\u0027s voice. She stood up-slowly, a struggle against stiff muscles. When she was on her feet, she had to pause as dizziness made the room spin around her. \"Wait!\" she called. She limped to the door, then she had to use those same stiff muscles to push the sofa aside. Finally the latch was undone and Dan came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face glistened with sweat, his eyes wild. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe asked. \"I thought the bounty hunters had you-\" \"They\u0027re gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomebody came and took \u0027em away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Took \u0027em away? Where to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Takin\"em by boat somewhere. Four men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0027t seen so much firepower since \u0027Nam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The four men. I thought they were gonna shoot \u0027em right there, but then they saw Murtaugh\u0027s arm ... I mean, his brother\u0027s arm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talkin\u0027 about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he was sounding as crazy as a broken shutter in a windstorm. He had to calm down, take some deep breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed his fingertips against his temples. \"Four men broke into our cabin and took \u0027em away. To where, I don\u0027t know, but the one who was the boss said something\u0027 about a boat ride. They were all packin\u0027 guns.\" He started to tell her about Murtaugh\u0027s little secret, but he decided she wasn\u0027t ready for that yet. \"They didn\u0027t want me, but they sure as hell marched Murtaugh and Eisley out of there.\" He looked at his watch. Five-thirteen. \"Come on, we\u0027ve gotta tell somebody about this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" she said. \"Just a minute.\" She squeezed her eyes shut and then opened them again, trying to clear some of the cobwebs. Dan saw that sleep had lightened her eyes and that the birthmark had changed color @ like the rough skin of a chameleon, to a deep blue-tinged purple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bounty hunters are gone, rightt\u0027 4-Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then . . . that means you\u0027re free, doesn\u0027t it?\" She ran a hand through the unruly waves of her hair. Her fingers found the painful, blood-crusted knot where her head hill been banged in the car. \"They tried to break your neck, and mine, too. Why should you care about \u0027em?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-south/page-24.html","bookId":2479,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:53:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:53:27 PM"}
