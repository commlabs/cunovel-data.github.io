Running away from Cory was giving me an ulcer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seen any shooting stars yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCory smelled like cologne and beer and sweat, and oddly enough, it wasn’t a bad combination. The crickets were so loud and the party seemed really far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, Conklin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you still seeing that guy you brought to prom? The one with the unibrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. I couldn’t help it. “Conrad doesn’t have a unibrow. And no. We, um, broke up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cool,” he said, and the word hung in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was one of those fork-in-the-road kind of moments. The night could go either way. If I leaned in just a little to my left, I could kiss him. I could close my eyes and let myself get lost in Cory Wheeler. I could go right on forgetting. Pretending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even though Cory was cute, and he was nice, he was no Conrad. Not even close. Cory was simple, he was like a crew cut, all clean lines and everything going in the same direction. Not Conrad. Conrad could turn my insides out with one look, one smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCory reached over and flicked my arm playfully. “So, Conklin . . . maybe we—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up. I said the first thing I could think of. “Shoot, I’ve gotta pee. I’ll see you later, Cory!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrambled off the trampoline as fast I could, found my flip-flops, and headed back toward the house. I spotted Taylor by the pool and made a beeline for her. “I need to talk to you,” I hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed her hand and pulled her over by the snack table. “Like, five seconds ago, Cory Wheeler almost asked me out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And? What did you say?” Taylor’s eyes were gleaming, and I hated how smug she looked, like everything was going according to plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said I had to pee,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Belly! Get your butt back over to that trampoline and make out with him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Taylor, would you stop? I told you I wasn’t interested in Cory. I saw you talking to him earlier. Did you make him ask me out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a little shrug. “Well . . . he’s been into you all year and he’s been taking his sweet time asking you out. I might have gently pushed him in the right direction. You guys looked so cute on the trampoline together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. “I really wish you hadn’t done that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just trying to take your mind off things!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I don’t need you to do that,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you do so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at each other for a minute. Some days, days like this, I wanted to wring her neck. She was just so bossy all the time. I was getting pretty sick of Taylor pushing me in this direction and that direction, dressing me up like one of her shabbier, less fortunate dolls. It had always been like this with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the thing was, I finally had a real excuse to leave, and I was relieved. I said, “I think I’m gonna go home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about? We just got here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m just not in the mood to be here, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess she was getting sick of me too, because she said, “This is starting to get old, Belly. You’ve been moping around for months. It’s not healthy. . . . My mom thinks you should see someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? You’ve been talking to your mom about me?” I glared at her. “Tell your mom to save her psychiatric advice for Ellen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor gasped. “I can’t believe you just said that to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir cat, Ellen, had seasonal affective disorder, according to Taylor’s mother. They had her on antidepressants all winter, and when she was still moody in the spring, they sent Ellen to a cat whisperer. It didn’t do any good. In my opinion, Ellen was just plain mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a breath. “I listened to you cry about Ellen for months, and then Susannah dies and you want me to just make out with Cory and play beer pong and forget about her? Well, I’m sorry, but I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor looked around quickly before she leaned closer and said, “Don’t act like Susannah’s the only thing you’re sad about, Belly. You’re sad about Conrad, too, and you know it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t believe she said that to me. It stung. It stung because it was true. But it was still a low blow. My father used to call Taylor indomitable. She was. But for better or for worse, Taylor Jewel was a part of me, and I was a part of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot altogether meanly, I said. “We can’t all be like you, Taylor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can try,” she suggested, smiling a little. “Listen, I’m sorry about the Cory thing. I just want you to be happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her arm around me, and I let her. “It’s going to be an amazing summer, you’ll see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amazing,” I echoed. I wasn’t looking for amazing. I just wanted to get by. To keep moving. If I made it through this summer, the next one would be easier. It had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I stayed a little while longer. I sat on the porch with Davis and Taylor and I watched Cory flirt with a sophomore girl. I ate a hot dog. Then I went home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt home the sandwich was still on the counter, still wrapped in plastic. I put it in the fridge and I headed upstairs. My mother’s bedroom light was on, but I didn’t go in to say good night. I went straight to my room and got back into my big Cousins T-shirt and undid my braid, brushed my teeth, and washed my face. Then I got under the covers and lay in bed, just thinking. I thought, So this is what life is like now . Without Susannah, without the boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been two months. I’d survived June. I thought to myself, I can do this . I can go to the movies with Taylor and Davis, I can swim in Marcy’s pool, maybe I can even go out with Cory Wheeler. If I do those things, it will be all right. Maybe letting myself forget how good it used to be will make things easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when I slept that night, I dreamed of Susannah and the summer house, and even in my sleep I knew exactly how good it used to be. How right it was. And no matter what you do or how hard you try, you can’t stop yourself from dreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejeremiah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing your dad cry really messes with your mind. Maybe not for some people. Maybe some people have dads who are cool with crying and are in touch with their emotions. Not my dad. He’s not a crier, and he for sure never encouraged us to cry either. But at the hospital, and then at the funeral home, he cried like a lost little kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom died early in the morning. Everything happened so fast, it took me a minute to catch up and realize it was all really happening. It doesn’t hit you right away. But later that night, the first night without her, it was just me and Conrad at the house. The first time we’d been alone in days. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-not-summer-without-you-summer-2/page-5.html","bookId":2724,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM"}
