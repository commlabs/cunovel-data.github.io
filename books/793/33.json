A NOVEL PROPOSITION.","content":"A liberal lunch was ordered, and placed before them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My time is limited,” said Mr. Vivian, “and we will economize it by discussing lunch and your affairs at the same time. How much do you pay for board?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Six dollars a week,” answered Gilbert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is very little,” said the merchant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I room with another person, and thus secure more favorable terms.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Are your meals satisfactory?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The food is plain, but good. I have nothing to complain of. I should like nothing better than to feel sure that I could continue to pay my expenses at this rate.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is well,” said Mr. Vivian, approvingly. “I like your spirit. You are not disposed to find unnecessary 282fault. Then you cannot make six dollars a week by selling papers?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, sir; at least, I have not done so thus far. Yesterday I made seventy cents, and to-day about the same sum.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That will never do. It leaves you nothing for washing or clothes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, sir. However, I am pretty well provided with clothes. I don’t expect to require anything in that line for six months.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Probably you couldn’t put off washing for so long,” suggested Mr. Vivian, with a smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hardly,” answered Gilbert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Before you came to the city,” said Mr. Vivian, apparently changing the subject, “you were studying for college, were you not?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How far had you proceeded?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “By next summer I could easily have been ready to enter Yale College; if necessary, earlier.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then you must be a good classical scholar already.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 283“A fair one,” said Gilbert, modestly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Did you ever think of teaching?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gilbert looked surprised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t know who would employ a boy like me,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You would be competent to instruct a beginner in Latin and the common English studies, I suppose?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I ought to be, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then I will tell you an idea I have had in mind for a week or more. My boy Fred is attending a classical school, but his progress is not satisfactory to me. I don’t think him lacking in capacity, but he does not apply himself as he ought. It has occurred to me that assistance in the evening would materially aid him, and promote his standing in school. Except in Latin I could myself assist him, but after the business and perplexities of the day I am in no mood to turn teacher. Now, you are competent, and Fred has taken a fancy to you. Are you willing to give him five evenings a week?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nothing would suit me better, sir,” said Gilbert, 284quickly. “I like Fred, and would do my best to be of service to him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Vivian looked pleased.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then,” he said, “I see no reason why we should not try the experiment. The only thing remaining to be discussed is the compensation.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I leave that to you, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I may take advantage of your confidence,” said the merchant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t feel alarmed,” said Gilbert, smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Suppose, then, we say ten dollars a week for five evenings.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ten dollars!” exclaimed Gilbert, in amazement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If that is not adequate—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why, Mr. Vivian, my services would never be worth ten dollars a week. Remember, sir, I am only a boy, and inexperienced as a teacher.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I believe you will do Fred more good than an older and more experienced teacher. He takes to you, and will work cheerfully with you, while I don’t think he would with the other.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 285“But ten dollars a week is a large sum for you to pay, Mr. Vivian.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I believe in paying a good price, and requiring good, faithful work, such as I think you will render.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will try to render it, at any rate, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then it is a bargain, is it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, sir, if you say so. I need not say that it will be a very great help to me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I know that, Gilbert; and I am glad to be able to serve you, at the same time that I serve myself. When I was a boy I was in limited circumstances. The memory of my own past makes me considerate of others. Now, when will you begin?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “This evening, if you like.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I should like it. We will expect you then. Here is a week’s pay in advance.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Vivian took from his pocket-book a ten-dollar bill and placed it in Gilbert’s hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Under the circumstances,” he said, “you may as well give up selling papers.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I shall be very glad to give it up, sir, and now I shall feel able to do so.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 286“I appreciate and respect your motives in doing what you could find to do, but now you are a teacher,—a classical professor,—and must do nothing incompatible with the dignity of your learned profession.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will try to remember it, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I must leave you now. Let us see you this evening.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will be sure to come, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Gilbert left the hotel, he felt elated at his unexpected good fortune.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I believe the tide has turned,” he said to himself. “I little dreamed that my Latin would prove such a friend in need. I can’t expect to earn the liberal sum Mr. Vivian has agreed to pay me, but I will do my duty as faithfully and well as I can.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Just after dinner that evening Alphonso Jones strolled into Gilbert’s room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How is the newspaper business?” he inquired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Pretty fair,” answered Gilbert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I think we ought to patronize Mr. Greyson, eh, Mr. Ingalls?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 287“Thank you, Mr. Jones, but I have retired from the business.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You don’t say! Why, you told me it was fair.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I shall retire nevertheless.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you found another place?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have obtained another position.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You have! What is it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Professor of the Classics and English Literature.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re joking,” remarked Alphonso, rather bewildered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, I am not. I have been engaged to teach five evenings in the week.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I didn’t know you were such a scholar,” said Mr. Jones, surprised. “Do they pay you much?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Two dollars an evening.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good gracious! That is splendid pay.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, it is very good pay.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Where are you to teach?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mr. Vivian’s son.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He don’t know that you have been a newsboy, does he?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 288“Yes, he does; he saw me selling papers in the street to-day.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, Greyson, all I can say is, you are the luckiest boy I ever knew. I wish I could earn two dollars an evening.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll try to get you a chance,” said Gilbert, demurely. “What can you teach?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, I aint very fresh in my studies,” said Alphonso. “I guess it wouldn’t be of any use. Aint you going to work in the daytime?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I shall get back into the broker’s office if I can.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then you will have quite an income for a boy, Gilbert,” said Mr. Ingalls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t you think you could take me up and introduce me to the Vivians some evening?” insinuated Alphonso.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t think I could, Mr. Jones.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh! it’s of no consequence,” said Alphonso, with apparent indifference. “I have any quantity of high-toned friends who move in the first circles. Some of 289them know the Vivians, and that’s why I wanted to be introduced.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I wonder if that fellow expects to be believed,” said Mr. Ingalls, after Alphonso had retired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1888/54513.html","bookId":793,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:49:00 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:49:00 AM"}
