It was remarkably unremarkable, with dark furniture and nondescript carpeting. He grunted softly as he glanced at the insipid painting on the wall over the dresser. A monkey could have done better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrowing back the covers on the bed, he stretched out on the mattress and closed his eyes. Daisy\u0027s image quickly came to mind, her hair like a cloud of russet-colored silk, her skin smooth and clear and warm. And her eyes...they sparkled like green fire. He had often heard it said that the eyes were windows to the soul. If that was true, then Daisy O\u0027Donnell had the soul of an angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed softly. An angelic Blood Thief. That was something you didn\u0027t run into every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy. Her image lingered in his mind as his body relaxed, slowly succumbing to the lethargy that drained his strength and his consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy paced the floor of the motel room. She and Alex had finished breakfast hours ago and now Alex\u0027s soft snores told her he was asleep again. She sighed with frustration. Her brother could sleep anytime, anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at her watch, dismayed to see that it wasn\u0027t even noon yet. She switched on the air conditioner to drown out the sound of her brother sleeping. If only she had a book to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on the foot of her bed, she switched on the TV and flipped through the stations. Game shows and soap operas, soap operas and game shows. In this so-called age of enlightenment, you\u0027d think programmers could come up with something more original and interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitching off the set, she pulled her phone from her handbag and called home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother answered on the second ring. \"Daisy, is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mom, why would you think that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we haven\u0027t heard from you much lately. Your dad\u0027s been trying to get in touch with Alex, but he doesn\u0027t answer his phone. Have you talked to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex is fine, Mom. He\u0027s with me. We\u0027re on our way home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is something wrong,\" Irene O\u0027Donnell said. \"Are you hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re both fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your dad wants to know if Alex found Rhys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We found him,\" Daisy said, and quickly told her mother what had happened, omitting the part that Erik had played in saving Alex\u0027s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re both all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Daisy took a deep breath. \"And so is Rhys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll let your father know. How soon will you be home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A couple of days, I guess. I\u0027m bringing a guest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" There was a wealth of unasked questions in that simple word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mom, a man. A very special man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful, dear. You\u0027re sure you\u0027re all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mom, stop worrying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t help it. That\u0027s what mothers are for. Have you talked to Brandon lately?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Daisy asked, feigning surprise. \"Who\u0027s the girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kevin\u0027s sister, Paula, can you believe it? He just told us about it last night. It sounds serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have they been dating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only a few weeks, but he\u0027s very much in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So soon?\" Daisy asked, and then wondered why she was so surprised. There had been a time when she didn\u0027t believe in love at first sight, but that was before she met Erik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he\u0027s planning to propose. He told us he was out looking at engagement rings last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful, Mom, I\u0027m happy for him. Listen, I\u0027ve got to go, my battery\u0027s almost out of juice. I\u0027ll see you soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About that,\" Irene said. \"Your aunt Judy and I are leaving for New Zealand in the morning. We\u0027ll be gone for two weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Judy had never married. She had been a schoolteacher for twenty years. She had taken a vacation every year since she retired, and she always dragged Daisy\u0027s mother along with her. Daisy had mixed feelings about her mother being gone. On the one hand, she would miss seeing her, sure. But on the other hand, it meant her mother wouldn\u0027t be bugging her about Kevin O\u0027Reilly, although she probably wouldn\u0027t say anything as long as Erik was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I\u0027d known sooner that you were coming, but it\u0027s too late to cancel the trip now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it. Have a wonderful time. I\u0027ll see you when you get home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, dear. I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy ended the call, then sat there staring at the phone. So, her little brother was in love and thinking about getting married. It was always the quiet ones, she thought, grinning. Brandon had been shy and introverted for as long as she could remember, yet it sounded like he was going to beat both of his siblings to the altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarriage. Did vampires marry? She had never heard of such a union. When people married, they could expect to spend fifty or sixty years together. But vampires, Lordy, they could be married for centuries. People always talked about being in love forever, but could any two people really expect to stay together that long? She grinned inwardly. Maybe, if one of them was Erik. What was he doing now? Was he sleeping the sleep of the Undead, or was he sitting next door, thinking about her the way she was thinking about him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould she have stopped him earlier, if Alex hadn\u0027t interfered? What would it be like, to make love to Erik? Did vampires make love like normal people? Heat flooded her cheeks and pooled in her very center as she imagined the two of them locked in each other\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking off the image, she fanned herself with her hand. Would this day never end?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy had hoped her brother would sleep until sundown. After all, he had been badly hurt, and even though Erik\u0027s blood had saved his life, Erik had told her Alex was still healing. And there was nothing like sleep to help a body recuperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the wall that separated their room from Erik\u0027s. Was he sleeping? Would he wake up if she knocked on the door? Would he invite her inside and take up where they had left off when Alex interrupted them? Lord, what was she thinking? She tried to banish the image of herself and Erik wrapped in an embrace, but it was no use. She wanted his arms around her waist, his mouth on hers, his tongue teasing her lips. She wanted to touch him and taste him, and even though the idea excited her, there was a little part of her mind that kept asking if she knew what she was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight or wrong, she was thinking of going next door when Alex sat up. Yawning, he stretched his arms over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hungry,\" he said, glancing at Daisy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy shook her head. No matter what time he woke up, he was always hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he said, \"how about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I could eat something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, I hate to eat alone.\" A search of the bedside table turned up a phone book. After finding the phone number for the nearest pizza place, Alex ordered a couple of pizzas and two sodas, then looked at Daisy. \"Should I order something for your friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex completed the call, then went into the bathroom to take a shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe emerged twenty minutes later, shirtless, his hair still wet. \"I can\u0027t believe they don\u0027t have a blow-dryer in this place. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve got one in that handbag of yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering under his breath, he went back into the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were watching a pay-per-view movie when the pizza arrived. Alex tossed one of the boxes on Daisy\u0027s bed. \"Ham and pineapple for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you suppose your friend is doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy shrugged. \"He\u0027s probably still asleep. He drove all night, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex grunted softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate in silence for a few minutes. Daisy licked a bit of sauce from her fingers. She didn\u0027t know if the pizza was really good or if she was just really hungry, but she couldn\u0027t remember when anything had tasted so wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what do you say we hit the road? I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027m going stir-crazy in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik might still be sleeping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wake him up,\" Alex said, speaking around a mouthful of pepperoni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later. I want to take a shower, too, you know.\" She sipped her drink. It was three hours until sundown. She wondered what distraction she could come up with if Alex insisted on going next door to wake Erik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still trying to think of something when Alex said, \"There\u0027s a mall across the street. Since you don\u0027t want to disturb Sleeping Beauty, what do you say we do a little shopping after you get cleaned up? I could use a change of clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea,\" Daisy said. Her brother loved to shop almost as much as she did. With any luck, they could spend an hour or two at the mall, she thought, and then sent a wary glance at the door. Maybe leaving the motel wasn\u0027t such a great idea. What if Rhys had followed them last night? What if he was out there, waiting for them? It was said that vampires couldn\u0027t enter a dwelling without an invitation, but what if that only applied to homes, not motels? What if it was just a myth? \"Maybe we should just stay inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rhys knows who we are. What if he followed us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring him on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy? He almost killed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Daisy Mae, you\u0027re exaggerating. Do I look like someone who almost died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was on the tip of her tongue to tell him that he would be dead now if it wasn\u0027t for Erik, but of course, she couldn\u0027t say that, couldn\u0027t tell her brother that his savior was a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a close call,\" she said. \"Too close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure. You proved that the other day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, Daisy...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve never hunted a vampire as old as he is,\" she said, her trepidation growing with each passing minute. \"We don\u0027t know what he\u0027s capable of, what powers he possesses.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-26.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
