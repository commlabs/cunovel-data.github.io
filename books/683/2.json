{"id":36828,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I—STEPHEN","content":"\u0026nbsp;Stephen Norman of Normanstand had remained a bachelor until close on middle age, when the fact took hold of him that there was no immediate heir to his great estate. \u0026nbsp;Whereupon, with his wonted decision, he set about looking for a wife. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had been a close friend of his next neighbour, Squire Rowly, ever since their college days. \u0026nbsp;They had, of course, been often in each other’s houses, and Rowly’s young sister—almost a generation younger than himself, and the sole fruit of his father’s second marriage—had been like a little sister to him too. \u0026nbsp;She had, in the twenty years which had elapsed, grown to be a sweet and beautiful young woman. \u0026nbsp;In all the past years, with the constant opportunity which friendship gave of close companionship, the feeling never altered. \u0026nbsp;Squire Norman would have been surprised had he been asked to describe Margaret Rowly and found himself compelled to present the picture of a woman, not a child.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now, however, when his thoughts went womanward and wifeward, he awoke to the fact that Margaret came within the category of those he sought. \u0026nbsp;His usual decision ran its course. \u0026nbsp;Semi-brotherly feeling gave place to a stronger and perhaps more selfish feeling. \u0026nbsp;Before he even knew it, he was head over ears in love with his pretty neighbour.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Norman was a fine man, stalwart and handsome; his forty years sat so lightly on him that his age never seemed to come into question in a woman’s mind. \u0026nbsp;Margaret had always liked him and trusted him; he was the big brother who had no duty in the way of scolding to do. \u0026nbsp;His presence had always been a gladness; and the sex of the girl, first unconsciously then consciously, answered to the man’s overtures, and her consent was soon obtained.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When in the fulness of time it was known that an heir was expected, Squire Norman took for granted that the child would be a boy, and held the idea so tenaciously that his wife, who loved him deeply, gave up warning and remonstrance after she had once tried to caution him against too fond a hope. \u0026nbsp;She saw how bitterly he would be disappointed in case it should prove to be a girl. \u0026nbsp;He was, however, so fixed on the point that she determined to say no more. \u0026nbsp;After all, it might be a boy; the chances were equal. \u0026nbsp;The Squire would not listen to any one else at all; so as the time went on his idea was more firmly fixed than ever. \u0026nbsp;His arrangements were made on the base that he would have a son. \u0026nbsp;The name was of course decided. \u0026nbsp;Stephen had been the name of all the Squires of Normanstand for ages—as far back as the records went; and Stephen the new heir of course would be.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Like all middle-aged men with young wives he was supremely anxious as the time drew near. \u0026nbsp;In his anxiety for his wife his belief in the son became passive rather than active. \u0026nbsp;Indeed, the idea of a son was so deeply fixed in his mind that it was not disturbed even by his anxiety for the young wife he idolised.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When instead of a son a daughter was born, the Doctor and the nurse, who knew his views on the subject, held back from the mother for a little the knowledge of the sex. \u0026nbsp;Dame Norman was so weak that the Doctor feared lest anxiety as to how her husband would bear the disappointment, might militate against her. \u0026nbsp;Therefore the Doctor sought the Squire in his study, and went resolutely at his task.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Well, Squire, I congratulate you on the birth of your child!’ \u0026nbsp;Norman was of course struck with the use of the word ‘child’; but the cause of his anxiety was manifested by his first question:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘How is she, Doctor? \u0026nbsp;Is she safe?’ \u0026nbsp;The child was after all of secondary importance! \u0026nbsp;The Doctor breathed more freely; the question had lightened his task. \u0026nbsp;There was, therefore, more assurance in his voice as he answered:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘She is safely through the worst of her trouble, but I am greatly anxious yet. \u0026nbsp;She is very weak. \u0026nbsp;I fear anything that might upset her.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Squire’s voice came quick and strong:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘There must be no upset! \u0026nbsp;And now tell me about my son?’ \u0026nbsp;He spoke the last word half with pride, half bashfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Your son is a daughter!’ \u0026nbsp;There was silence for so long that the Doctor began to be anxious. \u0026nbsp;Squire Norman sat quite still; his right hand resting on the writing-table before him became clenched so hard that the knuckles looked white and the veins red. \u0026nbsp;After a long slow breath he spoke:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘She, my daughter, is well?’ \u0026nbsp;The Doctor answered with cheerful alacrity:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Splendid!—I never saw a finer child in my life. \u0026nbsp;She will be a comfort and an honour to you!’ \u0026nbsp;The Squire spoke again:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘What does her mother think? \u0026nbsp;I suppose she’s very proud of her?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘She does not know yet that it is a girl. \u0026nbsp;I thought it better not to let her know till I had told you.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Why?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Because—because—Norman, old friend, you know why!
