I was the first to report all this-this-trouble on Venus. Find the original report in Council headquarters. My name is on it. Why should I call in the Council if I were...And my motive? Eh? My motive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCouncilman Evans seemed uneasy. From the quick glance he shot in Turner\u0027s direction, Bigman guessed that this form of inter-Council squabble in front of an outsider was not to his liking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Evans said, \"It would explain the effort Dr. Morriss made to discredit me. I was an outsider, and I might stumble on the truth. I had found half of it, certainly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorriss was breathing heavily. \"I deny that T ever did such a thing. All this is a conspiracy of some sort against me, and it will go hard in the end for any of you who join in this. I will have justice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you implying that you wish a Council trial?\" asked Lucky. \"Do you want to plead your case before a meeting of the assembled Central Committee of the Council?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Lucky was referring to, of course, was the procedure ordained for the trial of councilmen accused of high treason against the Council and the Solar Confederation. In all the history of the Council, not one man had ever had to stand such a trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt its mention, whatever shreds of control Morriss had used to restrain his feelings vanished. Roaring, he scrambled to his feet and hurtled blindly at Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky rolled nimbly up and over the arm of the chair he occupied and, at the same time, gestured quickly at Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the signal that Bigman was waiting for. Bigman proceeded to follow the instructions Lucky had given him on board the Hilda when they were passing through the lock of Aphrodite\u0027s dome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blaster bolt shot out. It was at low intensity but its ionizing radiations produced the pungent odor of ozone in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatters remained so for a moment. All motion ceased. Morriss, his head against the overturned chair, made no move to get up. Bigman remained standing, like a small statue, with his blaster still held against his hip as though he had been frozen in the act of shooting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the target of the blaster bolt lay destroyed and in ruins upon the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou Evans found his breath first, but it was only for a sharp exclamation, \"What in space...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyman Turner whispered, \"What have you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorriss, panting from his recent effort, could say nothing, but he rolled his eyes mutely at Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Nice shot, Bigman,\" and Bigman grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in a hundred fragments Lyman Turner\u0027s black computer case lay smashed and, for the most part, disintegrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurner\u0027s voice rose. \"My computer! You idiot! What have you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said sternly, \"Only what he had to do, Turner. Now, everyone quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Morriss, helped that plump personage to his feet, and said, \"All my apologies, Dr. Morriss, but I had to make certain that Turner\u0027s attention was completely misdirected. I had to use you for that purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorriss said, \"You mean you don\u0027t suspect me of- of...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for one minute,\" said Lucky. \"I never did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorriss moved away, his eyes hot and angry, \"Then suppose you explain, Starr.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Before this conference, I never dared tell anyone that I thought some man was benind the V-frogs. I couldn\u0027t even state it in my message to Earth. It seemed obvious to me that if I were to do so, the real enemy might be desperate enough to take some action-such as actually flooding one of the cities-and hold the possibility ol a repetition over the heads of all of us as blackmail. As long as he did not know that I went past the V-frog in my suspicions, I hoped he would hold off and play for time or, at most, try to kill only my friends and myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At this conference I could speak of the matter because I believed the man in question to be present. However, I dared not take action against him without proper preparation for fear that he might place us under control despite the presence of the petroleum and for fear that his actions thereafter would be drastic. First I had to distract his attention thoroughly to make sure that, for a few seconds at least, he would be too absorbed in the surface activities of the group to detect, via his V-frog tools, the strong emotions that might be leaking out of Bigman\u0027s mind and mine. To be sure, there are no V-frogs in the building, but he might well be able to use the V-frogs in other parts of the city as he was able to use V-frogs out on the ocean\u0027s surface miles away from Aphrodite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To distract him then, I accused you, Dr. Morriss. I couldn\u0027t warn you in advance because I wanted your emotions to be authentic-and they were admirably so. Your attack on me was all that was needed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorriss withdrew a large handkerchief from a sleeve pocket and mopped his glistening forehead. \"That was pretty drastic, Lucky, but I think I understand. Turner is the man, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is,\" said Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurner was on his knees, scrabbling among the fused and shattered shards of his instrument. He looked up with hate-filled eyes, \"You\u0027ve destroyed my computer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that it was a computer,\" said Lucky. \"It was too inseparable a companion of yours. When I first met you, you had it with you. You stated you were using it to compute the strength of the inner barriers of the city against the threatened flood. Right now you have it with you presumably to help you if you should require new computations for your discussions with Dr. Morriss on the strength of those same inner barriers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky paused, then went on with a hard calmness in his voice. \"But I came to see you in your apartment the morning after the threatened flood. I was merely planning to ask you some questions that involved no computing and you knew that. Yet you had your computer with you. You could not bring yourself to leave it in the next room. It had to be with you, at your feet. Why?\"...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurner said desperately. \"It was my own construction. I was fond of it. I always carried it with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should judge it weighed some twenty-five pounds. Rather heavy, even for affection. Could it be that it was the device you used to maintain touch with the V-frogs at all tunes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you intend to prove that?\" flashed back Turner. \"You said I myself was a victim. Everyone here is witness to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Lucky, \"the man who, despite inexperience, so expertly barricaded himself at the dome lock, got his information from you. But was that information stolen from your mind or did you yourself donate it freely?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorriss said angrily, \"Let me put the question directly, Lucky. Are you or are you not responsible for the epidemic of mental control, Turner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027m not,\" cried Turner. \"You can\u0027t do anything just on the say-so of a young fool who thinks he can make guesses and have them stick because he\u0027s on the Council.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Tell me, Turner, do you remember that night when a man sat at one of the dome locks with a lever in his hand? Do you remember it well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember coming to me and telling me that if the locks were opened the inner transite barrier would not hold and that all of Aphrodite would be flooded? You were quite frightened. Almost panicky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I was. I still am. It\u0027s something to be panicky about.\" He added, with his lip curling, \"Unless you\u0027re the brave Lucky Starr.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky ignored that. \"Did you come to me with that information in order to add a little to the already existing confusion, to make sure that we were all disconcerted long enough for you to maneuver Lou Evans out of the city in order that he might be safely killed in the ocean? Evans was hard to handle, and he had learned too much concerning the V-frogs. Perhaps, also, you were trying to frighten me out of Aphrodite and off Venus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurner said, \"This is all ridiculous. The inner barriers are inadequate. Ask Morriss. He\u0027s already seen my figures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorriss noded reluctantly. \"I\u0027m afraid Turner is right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No matter,\" said Lucky. \"Let\u0027s consider that settled. There was a real danger, and Turner was justifiably panicked... You are married, Turner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurner\u0027s eyes flicked uneasily to Lucky\u0027s face and away again. \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wife is pretty and considerably younger than yourself. You have been married for not quite a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that intended to prove?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you probably have a deep affection for her. Immediately after marriage you move into an expensive apartment to please her; you allow her to decorate it according to her tastes even though your own taste differs. Surely you wouldn\u0027t neglect her safety, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand. What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you know. The one time I met your wife she told toe that she had slept through the entire excitement the night before. She seemed quite disappointed that she had. She also told me what a fine apartment house she lived in. She said it even possessed \u0027chambers.\u0027 Unfortunately, that meant nothing to me at the time, or I might have seen the truth then and there. It was only later, at the bottom of the ocean, that Lou Evans casually mentioned chambers and told me what they were. \u0027Chambers\u0027 is a word used on Venus to denote special shelters built to withstand the full force of the ocean in case a quake breaks a city dome. Now do you know what Fm talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurner was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky went on. \"If you were so frightened of city-wide catastrophe that night, why didn\u0027t you think of your wife? You spoke of rescuing people, of escaping the city. Did you never consider your wife\u0027s safety? There were chambers in the basement of her apartment house. Two minutes and she would have been safe. You had only to call her, give her one word of warning. But you didn\u0027t. You let her sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurner mumbled something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Don\u0027t say you forgot. That\u0027s completely unbelievable. You might have forgotten anything, but not your wife\u0027s safety. Let me suggest an alternative explanation. You were not worried about your wife because you knew she was in no real danger. You knew she was in no real danger because you knew the lock in the dome would never be opened.\" Lucky\u0027s voice was hard with anger. \"You knew the lock in the dome would never be opened because you yourself were in mental control of the man at the lever. It was your very fondness for your wife that betrayed you. You could not bring yourself to disturb her sleep merely in order to make your phony act more plausible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurner said suddenly, \"I\u0027m not saying anything more without a lawyer. What you have isn\u0027t evidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"It\u0027s enough to warrant a full Council investigation, though... Dr. Morriss, would you have him taken in custody in preparation for flight under guard to Earth? Bigman and I will go with him. We\u0027ll see that he gets there safely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the hotel again, Bigman said worriedly, \"Sands of Mars, Lucky, I don\u0027t see how we\u0027re going to get proof against Turner. All your deductions sound convincing and all that, but it isn\u0027t legal proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky, with a warm yeast dinner inside himself, was able to relax for the first time since he and Bigman had penetrated the cloud barrier that encircles Venus. He said, \"I don\u0027t think the Council will be mainly interested in legal proof or in getting Turner executed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky! Why not? That cobber...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. He\u0027s a murderer several times over. He definitely had dictatorial ambitions, so he\u0027s a traitor, too. But more important than either of those things is the fact that he created a work of genius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"You mean his machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I certainly do. We destroyed the only one in existence, probably, and we\u0027ll need him to build another. There are many questions we\u0027d like answered. How did Turner control the V-frogs? When he wanted Lou Evans killed, did he instruct the V-frogs in detail, tell them every step of the procedure, order them to bring up the giant patch? Or did he simply say, \u0027Kill Evans,\u0027 and allow the V-frogs to do their jobs like trained dogs in whatever way they thought best?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, too, can you imagine the use to which an instrument such as that can be put? It may offer us an entirely new method of attack on mental diseases, a new way of combating criminal impulses. It may even, conceivably, be used to prevent wars in the future or to defeat the enemies of Earth quickly and bloodlessly if a war is forced upon us. Just as the machine was dangerous in the hands of one ambition-riddled man, it can be very useful and beneficial in the hands of the Council.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"Do you think the Council will argue him into building another machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so, and with proper safeguards, too. If we offer him pardon and rehabilitation, with an alternative of life imprisonment with no chance of ever seeing his wife again, I think he\u0027ll agree to help. And, of course, one of the first uses of the machine would be to investigate Turner\u0027s own mind, help cure it of his abnormal desire for power, and save for the service of humanity a first-class brain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day they would be leaving Venus, heading once again for Earth. Lucky thought with pleasant nostalgia of the beautiful blue sky of his home planet, the open air, the natural foods, the space and scope of land life. He said, \"Remember, Bigman, it is easy to \u0027protect society\u0027 by executing a criminal, but that will not bring back his victims. If one can cure him instead and use him to make life better and brighter for that society, how much more has been accomplished!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[1] See David Starr, Space Ranger (New York, Signet, 1971).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[2] See Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids (New York, Signet, 1971). \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-oceans-of-venus-lucky-starr-3/page-17.html","bookId":1756,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:48 AM"}
