She looks over at where I\u0027m shivering, slumped in a giant white chair. In a mirror across the room I can make out my reflection and my face isn\u0027t as bruised as I feared. Chloe\u0027s asking \"Why?\" and the phone keeps ringing, a reminder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why... what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just why, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby,\" I say, holding my hands up, about to offer an explanation. \"You\u0027re a, um, great source of... inspiration to, um, me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want some kind of answer from you,\" she says calmly. \"Don\u0027t free-associate. Just tell me why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take this in. \"I can dig that, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there was just some speck of feeling in you, Victor,\" she sighs, padding over to the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh please, baby-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Victor?\" she asks again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to cry. I cried all night,\" she says. \"I\u0027m not going to cry while you\u0027re here so just be straight with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I need... I need...\" I sigh, then start again. \"Baby, see, this thing-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never really answer a question directly if you can help it, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um...\" I look up at her, confused. \"What was the question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s carefully placing T-shirts and panties on one side of the largest suitcase. She wraps the cord of a hair dryer around its handle, then places it in a smaller bag. \"It\u0027s taken me a long time to like myself, Victor,\" she says, gliding by me. \"I\u0027m not going to let you change that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t like yourself,\" I mutter wearily, shaking my head. \"Not really,\" and then, \"Baby, please stop moving around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaxter\u0027s cell phone rings. She picks it up off the bed and listens to whoever\u0027s calling, studying me until she finally turns away and says, \"Yeah, okay... I\u0027ll be ready... I just need to meet with someone... Okay, thanks... Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley?... Okay, great... No, I\u0027ll be fine... Yeah, he\u0027s here right now... No, no, no-it\u0027s okay, don\u0027t. I\u0027m fine, really... I\u0027ll see you then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clicks off, moves directly into the bathroom and closes the door. The toilet flushes twice and then she walks back into the bedroom. I want to ask her who was on the phone so she\u0027ll have to say his name but I already know who it was and in the end I don\u0027t really want to hear her say his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So can you tell me why, Victor?\" she asks. \"Why did all this happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, baby...\" I swallow. \"This is hard... Come on, baby... This is... all I know?... It\u0027s all... I am?\" I say, hoping it\u0027s the right way of explaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything you know is wrong,\" she says. \"Everything you know is wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh man,\" I sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just look at your life, Victor. You\u0027re going nowhere. You know girls named Vagina-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, her name was Yanni, baby. It just means vagina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many thousands of nightclub booths can you hang out in?\" she\u0027s asking. \"You just sit around Bowery Bar or Pravda or Indochine complaining about how much it sucks.\" She pauses, waiting. \"And you do this four times a week?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m... pretty much exhausted, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re sick,\" she says, staring deeply into the luggage, contemplating the arrangement of clothes, hands on hips. \"You\u0027re soul sick, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, it\u0027s just\"-I raise my head to look at her, confused-\"some bad coke, but whatever.\" I sigh, giving up. \"It\u0027s irrelevant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything is irrelevant with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m... baffled.
