In the six hours since she\u0027d come up here at Nicholas\u0027s insistence, her mind had cleared, and with that clarity came the full realization of what she had almost had—and lost—and she didn\u0027t know how she was going to bear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning away, she walked listlessly over to the bed and lay down, too exhausted to fight down the memories. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come, but all she saw was his lazy smile and the tender way he\u0027d looked at her at the Rutherfords\u0027 ball. \"Miss Lancaster… may I have the honor of this dance?\" Swallowing convulsively, she squeezed her eyes tighter closed, but in her mind, she felt him kissing her the way he had in the coach. \"This is why we are going to be married,\" he\u0027d said in that husky voice he used when they\u0027d been kissing. Surely, she thought achingly, he hadn\u0027t been pretending he liked to kiss her. Surely that had not been pretending. She needed to believe, had to believe, that much had been real. If she couldn\u0027t believe in that, she didn\u0027t know how she would go on after today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory of that and the other times he\u0027d kissed her were hers alone to cherish. They did not belong to \"Charise Lancaster.\" They belonged to her. She rolled onto her stomach, holding the memories close, and she fell asleep to dream of strong arms crushing her tightly and demanding kisses that stole her breath… of caressing hands that gentled and tantalized her and made her forget it was wrong to let him touch her in that intimate way. She slept, dreaming of things she would never know again in reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapped in a dressing gown, Whitney stood in the nursery, gazing down at her sleeping son\u0027s cherubic face. She looked up as the door opened, admitting a wedge of light, and her husband walked in, his face more grim than she\u0027d seen it in years. \"I couldn\u0027t sleep,\" she whispered, leaning down and smoothing the light blanket over Noel\u0027s shoulders. He already had his father\u0027s square chin and dark hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her, Clayton slid his arms around her waist, silently offering her comfort. \"Have I thanked you recently for my son?\" he whispered near her ear, smiling down at the three-year-old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not since this time last night,\" she said, tipping her face up to his and trying to smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t fooled by her smile any more than she was fooled by his careful avoidance of the discussion of today\u0027s aborted wedding. \"I feel so terrible,\" she confided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you do,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will never forget the look on Stephen\u0027s face as it became later and later and he realized she wasn\u0027t coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor I,\" he said tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He kept the vicar there until after ten o\u0027clock. How could she do a thing like that to him? How could she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of us really knew her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stephen was insane about her. I could see it every time he looked at her and when he was trying not to look at her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed,\" he said curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwallowing over the lump of sorrow in her throat, she said, \"If it hadn\u0027t been for Stephen\u0027s intervention, you would be married to Vanessa and I\u0027d be wed to someone else, and Noel wouldn\u0027t exist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClayton reached up and smoothed her tousled hair off her shoulder and pressed a reassuring kiss against her temple, as she continued in an aching voice, \"I always wanted to repay him for that, but all I could do was wish and wish that he would find someone who would make him as happy as we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to bed, darling,\" Clayton said, leaning down and lightly tousling his son\u0027s hair. \"Stephen is a grown man,\" he said as he drew her firmly toward their own bedchamber. \"He\u0027ll get over her because he wants to get over her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get over me as easily as that when we were—\" she hesitated, carefully refraining from any mention of the hideous night that had nearly destroyed all chances of a marriage between them, \"when we were estranged?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were both in bed and she had curled into his arms, he added, \"However, I had known you longer than Stephen knew Ch—Sheridan Bromleigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, her soft cheek sliding against his arm, and he tightened his hold, drawing her tighter against him because he, too, remembered the event that had nearly torn them apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time has little to say to the matter. Do you remember how long after we met again in England it was before you loved me?\" she said into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClayton smiled at the memory. \"It was the night you confessed you used to pepper your music teacher\u0027s snuffbox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If memory serves me well, I told you that story only a week or two after I came home from France.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clayton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not think Stephen is going to get over this as easily as you think. He could have any woman he wants, and yet in all this time, she was the only woman he ever wanted—except for Emily, and look how cynical he became after that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All Stephen has to do is crook his finger, and dozens of desirable women will line up to soothe him. This time, he\u0027ll let them because his pride and his heart both took a more serious beating than the last,\" Clayton predicted grimly. \"In the meantime, he\u0027ll get completely foxed and stay that way for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tipped her face up to his. \"Is that what you did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I did,\" he confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How very typically male,\" she said primly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClayton smothered a laugh at her tone and tipped her soft mouth up to his. \"Are you feeling superior, madam?\" he asked, a brow quirked in amused inquiry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very,\" she replied smugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case,\" he said, rolling onto his back and taking her with him, \"I suppose I\u0027d better let you be on top.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome time later, sleepy and sated, Clayton settled her more comfortably against his side and closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clayton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in her voice made him warily force his eyes open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if you noticed, but Charity Thornton was in tears today when Sheridan Bromleigh didn\u0027t return.\" When he didn\u0027t reply, but continued to watch her, she said, \"Did you notice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said cautiously. \"Why do you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she told me in the most—most heartbreaking way—that she\u0027d felt truly useful for the first time in decades because she was needed to act as chaperone. And she said she felt a useless old failure because she hadn\u0027t found another husband for Miss Bromleigh, besides Stephen.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-you-westmoreland-saga-3/page-80.html","bookId":1803,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM"}
