A thick white bandage was tightly wrapped around his middle finger. Reams breathlessly related the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been sawing wood with a particularly wicked little saw which had neatly sliced off the top half inch of the finger. Blood had spurted, and Reams had run in circles for a bit before calling an ambulance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan said Reams could probably have wrapped the finger in a towel and driven himself to the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too light-headed,\" Reams had explained. \"I saw stars. I never believed that about seeing stars before, but I do now. I felt I was spiraling down into a long black hole, slipping right out of the daylight, swimming toward a long cottony sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded like something Reams had read in a Raymond Chandler novel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan turned onto Reams\u0027s road. \"I\u0027m taking you home. You need to stop anywhere first, get a prescription or anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReams shook a little bottle of pills in the other hand. \"These will get me by for a day or two. Doctor had some samples. For pain.\" Reams still had his head between his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, will you sit up?\" Morgan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to sit like this. Isn\u0027t this what you\u0027re supposed to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s for airline crashes. That\u0027s crash position you\u0027re in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReams said, \"I thought I was supposed to let the blood flow to my head, or out of my head, or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have you home in a few minutes and you can stick your head in a bucket if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit all, Morgan, have a heart why don\u0027t you? I\u0027ve been mortally wounded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just your finger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I sliced an artery,\" Reams said. \"If I\u0027d passed out before I made it to the phone, I most likely would have bled to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan doubted that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m feeling a little ill even now. I\u0027ve had a shock to the system. That\u0027s how these seemingly little injuries can sometimes be serious. They shock the system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t puke in my car,\" Morgan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan parked in Reams\u0027s driveway. Sluggishly, Reams climbed out, still holding his hand over his head. It looked like he was flipping the bird to the whole neighborhood. He fished his keys out of his pocket with the other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Morgan. I didn\u0027t know who else to call, but I knew you said you\u0027d be home all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go take one of your pills,\" Morgan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" Reams closed the car door, took two steps toward his house, and stopped. He swayed. A pause. Reams tumbled, wilted facefirst into the front lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan watched for a few seconds, but Reams didn\u0027t get back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell.\" Morgan shut off the car, climbed out, and picked Reams up from the grass. \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm? What?\" Reams rubbed his head. \"See, I told you. I asked the doctor for a transfusion, but he wouldn\u0027t do it. Damn quack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" Morgan dragged Reams to the front door, took his keys, and unlocked it. They went in. Morgan draped Reams on the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Morgan. I really owe you even more now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, really. First that craziness with Pritcher and now this. I think you ought to come down to Houston with me. I know I can put in a word with that guy I know, get you a job lined up for fall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Reams squirmed on the sofa, arranged it so his hand was elevated above his head. \"What\u0027s it like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan sat in an uncomfortable wooden chair across from Reams. \"What\u0027s what like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The gypsy prof gig, moving around all the time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan thought about it. \"I used to like it, or thought I did. Changing scenery all the time helped me not think about other things. But I think I\u0027m getting tired of it. I think maybe I need some roots. It\u0027s time to start putting my energies back into my work, you know? Hard to accomplish anything when you\u0027re always worried about your next paycheck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Reams didn\u0027t hear. He snored lightly, middle finger over his head, blazing white to the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwenty-seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile waiting for Morgan to return, Ginny Conrad went through all the professor\u0027s cabinets, closets, and drawers. She realized, even as she was doing it, that her actions were the result of a minor, quirky character flaw. She hated to be left out of anything, hated the thought that something was going on and she wasn\u0027t in on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, when she was eleven years old, she\u0027d painted a Magic Marker moustache on herself and taken her father\u0027s Dodge. She\u0027d picked up two friends and went to see an R-rated movie in which there was rumored to be nudity. The policeman who brought her home warned her father he\u0027d better keep an eye on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incident had only strengthened her resolve to get away with things. She made up her own rules as she went along, and damn the consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrewing Professor Jay Morgan was a thrill. He was older (a teacher!) and a writer. He hung out with dangerous criminals! Helping Professor Morgan stash the body of the dead girl had been one of the most exciting things she\u0027d ever done. She\u0027d been so horny in the peach orchard, she\u0027d been unable to keep her hands off him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Morgan had been a bit of a dud since. He seemed timid, almost frightened, that he was going to be caught or that something would go wrong. Oh, the sex was halfway good, but she could get sex anywhere. And rummaging Morgan\u0027s closets was dullsville. Pale blue Hanes boxer shorts, a half-used tube of BENGAY, and a clip-on tie from Sears were the highlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about putting her clothes on, leaving a note for Morgan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she\u0027d wait. One more roll in the hay before cutting him loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeke Stubbs screeched into the parking space in front of the convenience store. He shut off the engine, went in, hands shaking as he pulled crumpled bills from his pants pocket. He bought another six-pack of beer and a pack of cigarettes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl behind the counter looked scared of him. Stubbs caught his reflection in the fish-eye mirror behind the girl. He looked distorted and evil, eyes red, skin waxen and moist. I\u0027m a villain, thought Stubbs, like in a creepy foreign film or a Stephen King novel. Stubbs didn\u0027t watch foreign films or read much beyond the sports page, but he knew he\u0027d crossed some line and couldn\u0027t get back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his way out to the car he ripped a phone book out of a booth. He sat in the front seat, flipped through the residential listings until he found Jay Morgan\u0027s address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe popped a beer, gulped half, lit a cigarette, and sucked it slowly. He let out a long gray breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing to do now but see this through. He nodded to himself, pleased with the grim finality of his decision. Yeah, he\u0027d have to go all the way. The Lancaster kid wasn\u0027t coming back, and it wasn\u0027t like Stubbs planned to turn himself in and say he was sorry. Rage and craziness had killed the kid. Stubbs would have to get his shit together from there on out. It was all or nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracking down the cocaine was his first priority. He\u0027d look for Annie Walsh still, and he\u0027d send the parents a bill of course. But following Annie\u0027s trail might lead him to the drugs. He was way too deep into this shit not to get some kind of payoff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubbs finished the cigarette, started the engine, and pointed the car toward Morgan\u0027s house. No more kid gloves. He\u0027d find out what Morgan knew about this the hard way or the easy way. It didn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubbs was committed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found Morgan\u0027s house and parked across from it on the street. He watched for ten minutes, but didn\u0027t see anybody in the windows. He drank one more beer while he thumbed through the Hustler again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he finished the beer, he crushed the can and tossed it into the backseat. He opened the glove compartment and pulled out his.45 automatic. No spare clip or extra bullets. He hardly used the thing. But now it was a sign he meant business. All the way. He shoved it into his coat pocket and climbed out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden cool air on his sweaty face was a shock. He woke up a little bit. Breathed deep. His chest burned with beer and too much smoking. He belched, tasted acid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spit and started up the short walkway to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knocked, waited. Nobody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis might even be better if the guy wasn\u0027t home. He could break in through the back maybe and poke around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knocked again. This time he heard movement. Somebody was coming to the door. One hand fell into his coat pocket, clutched the grip of the automatic. He heard locks turning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened a crack. A girl on the other side, hair tousled. Broad shoulders and a nice face. A hand holding up a bedsheet to her neck. Soft, round breasts floated underneath. They swung interestingly as the girl shifted her weight from one foot to the other and tried to get a better hold on the sheet. \"Yes?\" She looked through the crack at Stubbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for Morgan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not here. Can I take a message or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little frown from the girl, and Stubbs guessed what she might be thinking. She was young. Shouldn\u0027t answer the door naked, honey. Not even in a sheet. Stubbs\u0027s private-eye instinct kicked in, and he ran the possible scenarios through his brain. Maybe Morgan was married, had a little thing going with a student on the side. Anyway, she didn\u0027t like being asked who she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just a friend of his,\" she said. \"He\u0027s letting me stay here for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubbs pushed his way in. She didn\u0027t know what to do, stepped aside for him. He looked around, gave the place the once-over. Not a lot of personal stuff, like maybe Morgan hadn\u0027t lived there too long. \"I need to see him. Maybe I\u0027ll wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl didn\u0027t like that. \"He didn\u0027t say anything about when he might be back. Better maybe if you just left a message.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did he go?\" Stubbs was still looking around the house, craned his neck to see back into the kitchen. He didn\u0027t look at her. He bent over the coffee table, spread the magazines around and looked at the titles. \"Paris Review. What\u0027s that? From France?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s- Look, I don\u0027t think you should wait,\" she said. \"He might not be back for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Stubbs turned his gaze on her, red-eyed, dark bags underneath. \"Oh yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl realized her mistake. \"I mean he might be back any minute. Just that you shouldn\u0027t wait. In case he\u0027s a little late.\" She trembled now. She was talking herself into being scared. \"But he might come through the door any minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked who you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ginny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubbs stepped toward her, and she eased away from him, the sheet dragging on the floor. Stubbs stepped on it. She tugged gently, and Stubbs grinned. He breathed loudly through his mouth. Licked his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please.\" She tugged at the sheet again. Her voice was calm, but her hand shook worse where the sheet was bunched in her fist. \"I\u0027m stuck. You\u0027re on the sheet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Stubbs liked the soft, half-seen curves of her under the sheet. Big tits, round hips. He liked it when they were afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped on the sheet with his other foot. It pulled tight, and Ginny gasped, used both hands to pull back and keep herself covered. \"Don\u0027t.\" She meant to shout it, but it came out plaintive. She couldn\u0027t find breath, couldn\u0027t raise her voice. A cold, paralyzing chill ran through her. \"Don\u0027t,\" she said again, and she could only stare at him, feebly holding on to the sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved close, grabbed the sheet in his free hand, and yanked it away. He still had the other hand in his gun pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scream rose up but caught in Ginny\u0027s throat. She only made a sick, strangled bleating sound. She felt like lead, sank back against the wall. Stubbs crowded her, breathed his stink on her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I think you\u0027re ready to talk to me now, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubbs touched her hip and she jumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you\u0027re ready. I want to know about Annie Walsh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0027s it, thought Ginny. He knows. He found out about the peach orchard. Ginny\u0027s mouth fell open, and she sucked for air. She closed her eyes tight and shook her head. She couldn\u0027t breathe. The leaden feeling on her chest worsened, knees turning to cold jelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the cocaine. All of it. I know all about it so tell me. Start talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubbs slapped her on the hip, not hard, but enough to make a loud smack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat snapped her out of it. A hoarse scream. Eyes wide. Startled, even amid the terror, at the sudden slap. She pushed past Stubbs, started to run for the door. He grabbed her hair, yanked her back. She yelled again, high-pitched and panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubbs grabbed her by the upper arm, fingers sinking in soft flesh. He let go of the.45 in his pocket, used the hand to slap her face. Hard. Tears in her eyes. She kicked, twisted, pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo more slaps. Bells in her ears, flashes of light drowning her vision. Ginny shook her head, and her sight came back. She was on the floor, curling into a ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStubbs stood over her, straddling. \"Little slut.\" But Stubbs wasn\u0027t talking to her, only muttering to himself. He tugged his belt loose, unbuttoned his pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinny shook her head. No. Please. But the words wouldn\u0027t come. The weight was back on her chest, no breath. The horror of the world pinned her naked to the cold floor, the unreal thought that this was actually happening to her. She watched Stubbs reach for her, her tears turning him into a blurry apparition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan froze when he saw his front door halfway open. The house was quiet, dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran in, paused in the living room at the crumpled sheet on the floor. He picked it up, looked at it, looked around the room, dropped it again. \"Ginny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDread sprang up in his gut. \"Ginny!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran to the kitchen and back, then into the bedroom. When he tried the bathroom door it was locked. He knocked, tried the knob again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe banged with his fist. \"Ginny! You in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan backed up three steps then threw his shoulder into the door. It made a cracking sound but didn\u0027t give. Pain lanced through his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fucking shit.\" He rubbed the sore spot, gritted his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe backed up for another go at the door when he heard the voice. Weak, tentative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his ear against the wood. \"Ginny? Open up. It\u0027s me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me, Ginny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShuffling on the other side, scratching. \"Professor?\" Dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Professor Morgan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the lock work. He pushed at the door. It opened an inch then stopped. He looked in. Ginny leaned against it naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ginny, now, come on. Back up and let me in. I\u0027m going to help, just back up a bit, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head flopped. She reached, draped her arms around the toilet bowl, pulled herself out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan went in, knelt next to her. \"It\u0027s okay. I\u0027m here.\" He took her in his arms, eased her down onto the tile. Her faced turned to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan\u0027s eyes grew wide. He stifled a gasp. Both her eyes were swollen and purple. Dried blood from her nose and the corners of her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here. It\u0027ll be okay.\" Dear God. Morgan\u0027s eyes misted. He forced his voice not to choke. \"I\u0027ve got you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I need some... a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinny struggled to talk. Only half her mouth seemed to work. \"I screamed, and he... he went away. I screamed and screamed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk, Ginny. Take it easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he knew about the... drugs...\" She tried to pick her head up, neck limp, eyes unfocused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy. Just be still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan ran to the bedside phone. He had to dial three times with shaking hands before he got the 911 operator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paramedics seemed to take forever but finally found them in the bathroom, Morgan cradling Ginny\u0027s head in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Morgan got to the hospital, they\u0027d already taken Ginny back for X rays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, a nurse came and told him that Ginny might have a concussion. The nurse was short with him. Cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thinks I did that to her. Morgan felt sick in the pit of his belly. This must happen all the time. Violent parents, abusive spouses. He fell down the stairs. She ran into a doorknob. Isn\u0027t that how it is in TV movies?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan went to the men\u0027s room, splashed water on his cheeks and in his eyes. The memory of Ginny\u0027s swollen face was still too vivid, the bruises on her upper arms, the deep red welts on her legs and backside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went back to the nurses\u0027 station, tried to appear benign. \"Will I be able to see her soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be a while yet.\" The nurse was tight-lipped, didn\u0027t look at him. Shuffled papers into charts as she spoke. \"I\u0027ll notify you if she wants visitors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan noted the if.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat at the end of a line of hard, molded plastic chairs. The sick and injured passed before him, two hours dragging his eyelids down into a doze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Morgan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head jerked up, eyes focusing on the nurse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"You can go back and see her, but she\u0027s still a little groggy. The doctor gave her a mild sedative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed the nurse back, and she pointed behind a plastic curtain. Ginny lay on the other side, curled on an examination table. A stool nearby. Morgan sat, reached to stroke her hair but pulled his hand back. She\u0027d been bandaged, put in a hospital gown, a light blue blanket pulled up to her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flickered open. \"Professor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\" Her voice flat, eyes dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan couldn\u0027t imagine what she was sorry about. \"How are you?\" The dumbest question in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told him, her voice small, each word precise like she was reading the ingredients to a complex recipe. They\u0027d x-rayed her skull, nothing busted. No concussion. One cracked rib. Two stitches below her left ear. One tooth knocked loose. An orthodontist would have to be called in, but no complications were expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to talk. Rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was looking for you,\" Ginny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. He was crazy, asking about drugs and Annie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill crept over Morgan. \"What else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he\u0027d ask about the peach orchard, but he never did. He thought we had some drugs, I think. Maybe hidden. I couldn\u0027t figure out what he wanted. I\u0027d have told him anything, but I just couldn\u0027t understand what he wanted to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears welled in Ginny\u0027s eyes, spilled down her cheeks, but her voice was flat. She was detached, huddled somewhere far away. Morgan felt crushed listening to the young girl. She must\u0027ve thought the world her giant playground when they buried Annie in the orchard. Maybe she didn\u0027t think of Annie as a person then, only an elaborate prop in the big-budget movie of her life. Now Ginny\u0027s relationship with the world had dramatically changed. Her life was no longer a bright plaything. It was hard and real and had knocked the light of youth from her face. Maybe she\u0027d never get it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she would only be scared all the time. Like him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-pistol-poets/page-16.html","bookId":2247,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:02 PM"}
