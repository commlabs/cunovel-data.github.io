How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, I ought to tell you that it\u0027s not just me that believes all this about the millennium. It\u0027s not even Circle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaybreak that believes it. It\u0027s the Night World Council, Jez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The joint Council? Witches and vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh nodded again. \"They had a big meeting about it this summer. And they dug up some old\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprophecies about what\u0027s going to happen this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh looked slightly self-conscious. \"Here\u0027s one. It used to rhyme in the original, I think, but this is the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etranslation.\" He took a breath and quoted slowly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027In blue fire, the final darkness is banished. In blood, the final price is paid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat, Jez thought. Whose blood? But Hugh was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four to stand between the light and the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshadow,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour of blue fire, power in their blood. Born in the year of the blind Maiden\u0027s vision; Four less one and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edarkness triumphs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez blinked slowly. \"What\u0027s blue fire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Four to stand between the light and the shadow...\u0027 Meaning to hold off the end of the world?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what the Council thinks. They think it means that four people have been born, four Wild Powers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho\u0027re going to be instrumental in whatever\u0027s coming, whatever battle or disaster that\u0027s going to destroy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eus. Those four can stop the end of the world-but only if all of them fight together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Four less one and darkness triumphs,\" Jez said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. And that\u0027s where you come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh smiled. \"That\u0027s not what I meant. The fact is, somebody around here has already reported\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efinding a Wild Power. Circle Daybreak intercepted a message from him to the Council saying that hell\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehand the Wild Power over to them if they make it worth his while. Otherwise hell just sit tight until they\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edesperate enough to agree to his terms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez had a sinking feeling. She said one word. \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh\u0027s expression was knowing and regretful. It\u0027s one of your old gang, Jez. Morgead Blackthorn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez shut her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, that sounded like Morgead, trying to shake down the Night World Council. Only he was crazy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand nervy enough to do that. He was stubborn, too-perfectly capable of letting disaster come if he didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eget his way. But of all the people in the world, why did it have to be him? And how had he found a Wild\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower, anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh was speaking again softly. \"You can see why we need you. Somebody has to get to him and find\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout who the Wild Power is-and you\u0027re the only one who stands a chance of doing that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez pushed hair off her face and breathed slowly, trying to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need to tell you how dangerous it is,\" Hugh said, looking into the distance again. \"And I don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewant to ask you to do it. In fact, if you\u0027re smart, you\u0027ll tell me to get lost right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez couldn\u0027t tell him to get lost \"What I don\u0027t understand is why we can\u0027t just let the Council take care of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit. They\u0027ll want the Wild Powers bad, and they have a lot more resources.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh glanced back at her, startled. His gray eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere wide with an expression that Jez had never seen before. Then he smiled, and it was an incredibly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esad smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just what we can\u0027t do. You\u0027re right, the Council wants the Wild Powers. But not so they can fight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe end of the world. Jez... they only want them so they can kill them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when Jez realized what his expression was. It was gentle regret for innocence-her innocence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t believe how stupid she had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Goddess,\" she said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh nodded. \"They want it to happen. At least the vampires do. If the human world ends-well, that\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etheir chance, isn\u0027t it? For thousands of years the Night People have had to hide, to live in the shadows\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhile the humans spread all over the world. But the Council wants that to change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason Jez had been so slow was that it was hard for her to imagine anybody actually wanting to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebring on the Apocalypse. But of course it made sense. \"They\u0027re willing to risk being destroyed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethemselves,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They figure that whatever happens, it\u0027ll be worse on the humans, since the humans don\u0027t know it\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoming. Hell, some of the Night People think they\u0027re what\u0027s coming. Hunter Redfern is saying that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampires are going to wipe out and enslave the humans and that after that the Night World is going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereign.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez felt a new chill. Hunter Redfern. Her ancestor, who was over five hundred years old but looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout thirty. He was bad, and he practically ran the Council.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" she muttered. \"So my family\u0027s going to destroy the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh gave her a bleak smile. \"Hunter says the Old Powers are rising to make vampires stronger so they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan take over. And the scary thing is, he\u0027s right. Like I said before, the Night People are getting stronger,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edeveloping more powers. Nobody knows why. But most of the vampires on the Council seem to believe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we don\u0027t have much time,\" Jez said. \"We have to get the Wild Power before Morgead makes a deal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith the Night World.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Circle Daybreak is fixing up a safe place to keep the Wild Powers until we get all four. And the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCouncil knows we\u0027re doing it-that\u0027s probably why that ghoul was following me. They\u0027re watching us. I\u0027m\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust sorry I led it here,\" he added absently, with a worried look around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter. He\u0027s not telling anybody anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Thanks to you. But we\u0027ll meet someplace different next time. I can\u0027t endanger your family.\" He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked back at her. \"Jez, if the Night World manages to kill even one of the Wild Powers-well, if you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebelieve the prophecy, it\u0027s all over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez understood now. She still had questions, but they could wait. One thing was clear in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it. I have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh said very quietly, \"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, somebody has to. And you were right; I\u0027m the only one who can handle Morgead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was that she thought nobody could handle Morgead-but she certainly had a better chance than\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eany Circle Daybreaker. Of course, she wouldn\u0027t survive the assignment Even if she managed to steal the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWild Power out from under Morgead\u0027s nose, he\u0027d hunt her down and kill her for it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was irrelevant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He hates me, and I hate him, but at least I know him,\" she said out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence and she realized that Hugh was looking at her oddly. \"You think he hates you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. All we ever did was fight\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh smiled very faintly-an Old Soul look. I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It means-I don\u0027t think he hates you, Jez. Maybe he has strong emotions for you, but from what I\u0027ve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheard I don\u0027t think hate is one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez shook her head. \"You don\u0027t understand. He was always gunning for me. And if he found out I\u0027m half\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehuman-well, that would be the end. He hates humans worse than anything. But I think I can fool him for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas long as it takes to get the Wild Power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh nodded, but he didn\u0027t look happy. His eyes were bruised and tired. If you can pull it off, you\u0027ll\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esave a lot of lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knows, too, Jez thought. That I\u0027ll die doing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was some comfort that he cared-and more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomfort that he didn\u0027t understand why she was doing it. Sure, she wanted to save lives. But there was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Council had tried to mess with Hugh. They\u0027d sent a stinking ghoul after him. They would probably\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esend something different tomorrow-certainly, they\u0027d keep trying to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for that, Jez was going to wipe the floor with them. Hugh wasn\u0027t any kind of fighter. He couldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edefend himself. He shouldn\u0027t be a target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized that Hugh was still looking at her, with pain in his eyes. She smiled to show him that she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t afraid of dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a family affair,\" she told him-and that was true, too. \"Hunter\u0027s my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egreat-great-great-great-great-grandfather. It\u0027s only right that I stop him. And if anything happens to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme-well, one Redfern less is probably a blessing to the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the last part of the truth. She came from a tainted family. No matter what she did, who she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaved, or how hard she tried, there would always be vampire blood running in her veins. She was a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epotential danger to humanity by her very existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hugh was looking horrified. \"Don\u0027t you ever say that\" He stared at her for another moment and then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etook her by the shoulders, squeezing. \"Jez, you\u0027re one of the best people I know. What you did before\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elast year is-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is part of me,\" Jez said. She was trying not to feel his warm grip through her T-shirt, trying not to show\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat his little squeeze sent a shock through\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher entire body. \"And nothing can change that. I know what I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh shook her slightly. \"Jez-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And right now, I have to get rid of that ghoul. And you\u0027d better be getting home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment she thought he was going to shake her again; then he slowly let go of her. \u0027You\u0027re officially\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaccepting the assignment?\" The way he said it sounded as if he were giving her one last chance not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. He didn\u0027t ask how she planned on getting back into a gang that she\u0027d abandoned, or getting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einformation from Morgead, who hated her. Jez knew why. He simply trusted that she could do it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you know something, call this number.\" He dug in a different pocket and handed her a square of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epaper like a business card. \"I\u0027ll give you a location where I can meet you-someplace away from here. We\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshouldn\u0027t talk about anything on the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez took the card. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please be careful, Jez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Can I keep the articles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"Sure.\" Then he gave her one of those sad Old-Soul smiles. \"You probably don\u0027t need\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem, though. Just look around. Watch the news. You can see it all happening out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to stop it,\" Jez said. She reconsidered. \"We\u0027re going to try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez had a problem the next morning. The problem was Claire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were supposed to drive to school together, to ensure that Jez didn\u0027t cut school. But Jez had to cut\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eschool to go find Morgead. She didn\u0027t want to imagine the kind of trouble that was going to get her in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith Uncle Jim and Aunt Nanami-but it was crucial to get to Morgead as soon as possible. She couldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafford to waste time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the first major stoplight-and there weren\u0027t a lot of them in Clayton-she smacked her forehead with her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epalm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I forgot my chemistry book!\" She unfastened her seat belt and slid out of the Audi just as the light\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned green. \"You go ahead!\" she shouted to Claire, slamming the door and leaning in the open window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ill catch up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire\u0027s expression showed her temperature was reaching the boiling point. \"Are you crazy? Get in; I\u0027ll\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edrive back\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be late. Go on without me.\" She made a little fluttery encouraging motion with her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the three cars behind Claire honked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire opened her mouth and shut it again. Her eyes were shooting sparks. \"You did this on purpose! I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow you\u0027re up to something, Jez, and I\u0027m going to find out-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonk. Honk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez stepped back and waved goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Claire drove off, as Jez had known she would. Claire couldn\u0027t stand the peer pressure of cars telling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher to get moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez turned and began to jog for home, in a smooth, steady, ground-eating lope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got there, she wasn\u0027t even breathing hard. She opened the garage and picked up a long, slim\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebundle that had been concealed in a corner. Then she turned to her bike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides Hugh, it was the love of her life. A Harley. An 883 Sportster hugger. Just twenty-seven inches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etall and eighty-seven inches long, a lean, light, mean machine. She loved its classic simplicity, its cold\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclean lines, its spare body. She thought of it as her steel and chrome thoroughbred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she strapped the long bundle diagonally on her back, where it balanced nicely despite its odd size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put on a dark full-face helmet and swung a leg over the motorcycle. A moment later she was roaring\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway, heading out of Clayton toward San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe enjoyed the ride, even though she knew it might be her last one. Maybe because of that. It was a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edazzling end-of-summer day, with a sky of September blue and a pure-white sun. The air that parted for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez was warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can people ride in cages? she thought, twisting the throttle to shoot past a station wagon. What\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egood are cars? You\u0027re completely isolated from your surroundings. You can\u0027t hear or smell anything\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoutside; you can\u0027t feel wind or Power or a slight change in the temperature. You can\u0027t jump out to fight at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ean instant\u0027s notice. You certainly can\u0027t stake somebody at high speed while leaning out of a car window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could do it from a bike, though. If you were fast enough, you could skewer somebody as you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eroared by, like a knight with a lance. She and Morgead had fought that way once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe will again, she thought, and flashed a grim smile into the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky remained blue as she continued west, instead of clouding up as she approached the ocean. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas so clear that from Oakland she could see the entire bay and the skyline of San Francisco. The tall\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebuildings looked startlingly close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was leaving her own world and entering Morgead\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was something she didn\u0027t do often. San Francisco was an hour and fifteen minutes away from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClayton-assuming there was no traffic. It might as well have been in another state. Clayton was a tiny\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erural town, mostly cows, with a few decent houses and one pumpkin farm. As far as Jez knew, the Night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorld didn\u0027t know it existed. It wasn\u0027t the kind of place Night People cared about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was why she\u0027d managed to hide there for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now she was heading straight for the heart of the fire. As she crossed the Bay Bridge and reached\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe city, she was acutely aware of how vulnerable she was. A year ago Jez had broken the laws of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egang by disappearing. If any gang member saw her, they had the right to kill her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdiot. Nobody can recognize you. That\u0027s why you wear the full-face helmet. That\u0027s why you keep your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehair up. That\u0027s why you don\u0027t custom-paint the bike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still hyper-alert as she cruised the streets heading for one of the city\u0027s most unsavory districts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere. She felt a jolt at the sight of a familiar building. Tan, blocky, and unlovely, it rose to three stories\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplus an irregular roof. Jez squinted up at the roof without taking off her helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she went and stood casually against the rough concrete wall, near the rusty metal intercom. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewaited until a couple of girls dressed like artists came up and got buzzed in by one of the tenants. Then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe detached herself from the wall and calmly followed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t let Morgead know she was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d kill her without waiting to ask questions if he got the jump on her. Her only chance was to jump him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efirst, and then make him listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe building was even uglier inside than it was outside, with empty echoing stairwells and faceless\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eindustrial-sized hallways. But Jez found her heart beating faster and something like longing twisting in her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echest. This place might be hideous, but it was also freedom. Each one of the giant rooms behind the metal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoors was rented by somebody who didn\u0027t care about carpets and windows, but wanted a big empty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espace where they could be alone and do exactly what they wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was mostly starving artists here, people who needed large studios. Some of the doors were painted in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egemlike colors and rough textures. Most had industrial-sized locks on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t miss it, Jez told herself. But every corner brought a shock of memory. Morgead had lived here\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor years, ever since his mother ran off with some vampire from Europe. And Jez had practically lived\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehere, too, because it had been gang headquarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had some good times....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. She shook her head slightly to break off the thought and continued on her way, slipping silently\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough the corridors, going deeper and deeper into the building. At last she got to a place where there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas no sound except the humming of the naked fluorescent lights on the ceiling. The walls were closer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etogether here. There was a sense of isolation, of being far from the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one narrow staircase going up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez paused, listened a moment, then, keeping her eyes on the staircase, removed the long bundle from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher back. She unwrapped it carefully, revealing a stick that was a work of art. It was just over four feet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elong and an inch in diameter. The wood was deep glossy red with irregular black markings that looked a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elittle like tiger stripes or hieroglyphics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnakewood. One of the hardest woods in the world, dense and strong, but with just the right amount of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eresilience for a fighting stick. It made a striking and individual weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one other unusual thing about it. Fighting sticks were usually blunt at either end, to allow the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eperson holding it to get a grip. This one had one blunt end and one that tapered to an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eangled, narrow tip. Like a spear. The point was hard as iron and extremely sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could punch right through clothing to penetrate a vampire heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez held the stick in both hands for a moment, looking down at it. Then she straightened, and, holding it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein a light grip ready for action, she began up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready or not, Morgead, here I come.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-6.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
