Which nations would be broken by this conflict, and which would step in—out of altruism—to help its neighbors? How quickly would altruism become greed, the chance to hold another throne?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the rulers here were decent people. It took more than a decent person to hold that much power and not look afield. Even Elayne had gobbled up another country when the opportunity presented itself. She would do so again. It was the nature of rulers, the nature of nations. In Elayne’s case, it even seemed appropriate, as Cairhien would be better off beneath her rule than it had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many would assume the same? That they, of course, could rule better—or restore order—in another land?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody wants war\", Egwene said, drawing the crowd’s attention. \"However, I think what you are trying to do here is beyond your calling, Rand al’Thor. You cannot change human nature and you cannot bend the world to your whims. Let people live their lives and choose their own paths\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not, Egwene\", Rand said. There was a fire in his eyes, like the one she’d seen when he first sought to bring the Aiel to his cause. Yes, that emotion seemed very like Rand—frustration that people didn’t see the world as clearly as he thought he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t see what else you can do\", Egwene said. \"Would you appoint an emperor, someone to rule over us all? Would you become a true tyrant, Rand al’Thor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t snap back a retort. He held out his hand to the side, and one of his Asha’man slipped a rolled paper into it. Rand took it and placed it on the table. He used the Power to unroll it and to keep it flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oversized document was filled with tight, cramped letters. \"I call it the Dragon’s Peace\", Rand said softly. \"And it is one of the three things which I will require of you. Your payment, to me, in exchange for my life\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see that\". Elayne reached for it, and Rand obviously let it go, because she was able to snatch it off the table before any of the other surprised rulers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It locks the borders of your nations to their current positions\", Rand said, arms behind his back again. \"It forbids country from attacking country, and it requires the opening of a great school in each capital—fully funded and with doors open to those who wish to learn\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does more than that\", Elayne said, one finger to the document as she read. \"Attack another land, or enter into a minor armed border dispute, and the other nations of the world have an obligation to defend the country attacked. Light! Tariff restrictions to prevent the strangling of economies, barriers on marriage between rulers of nations unless the two lines of rule are clearly divided, provisions for stripping the land from a lord who starts a conflict . . . Rand, you really expect us to sign this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outrage from the rulers was immediate, though Egwene stood calmly, and shot a few glances at the other Aes Sedai. They seemed troubled. As well they should be—and this was only part of Rand’s \"price\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rulers muttered, each wanting a chance at the document, but not wanting to shoulder in and look over Elayne’s shoulder. Fortunately, Rand had thought ahead, and smaller versions of the document were distributed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there are very good reasons for conflict, sometimes!\" Darlin said, looking over his document. \"Such as creating a buffer between you and an aggressive neighbor\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or what if some people from our country do be living across the border?\" Gregorin added. \"Do we not have the mandate to step in and protect them, if they do be oppressed? Or what if someone like the Seanchan do claim land that is ours? Forbidding war do seem ridiculous!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree\", Darlin said. \"Lord Dragon, we should have the mandate to defend land that is rightfully ours!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\", Egwene said, cutting through the arguments, \"am more interested to hear his other two requirements\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know one of them\", Rand said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The seals\", Egwene said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Signing this document would mean nothing to the White Tower\", Rand said, apparently ignoring the comment. \"I cant very well forbid all of you to influence the others; that would be foolishness\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Its already foolishness\", Elayne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne was not feeling so proud of him any longer, Egwene thought. \"And as long as there are political games to be played\", Rand continued to Egwene, \"the Aes Sedai will master them. In fact, this document benefits you. The White Tower always has believed war to be, as they say, shortsighted. Instead, I demand something else of you. The seals\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am their Watcher\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In name only. They were only just discovered, and I possess them. It is out of respect for your traditional title that I approached you about them first\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Approached me? You didn’t make a request\", she said. \"You didn’t make a demand. You came, told me what you were going to do and walked away\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have the seals\", he repeated. \"And I will break them. I won’t allow anything, not even you, to come between me and protecting this world\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll around them arguments over the document continued, rulers muttering with their confidants and neighbors. Egwene stepped forward, facing Rand across the small table, the two of them ignored for the moment. \"You won’t break them if I stop you, Rand\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you want to stop me, Egwene? Give me a single reason why it would be a bad idea\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A single reason other than that it will let the Dark One loose on the world?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was not loose during the War of Power\", Rand said. \"He could touch the world, but the Bore being opened will not loose him. Not immediately\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what was the cost of letting him touch the world? What are they now? Horrors, terrors, destruction. You know what is happening to the land. The dead walking, the strange twisting of the Pattern. This is what happens with the seals only weakened! What happens if we actually break them? The Light only knows\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is a risk that must be taken\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t agree. Rand, you don’t know what releasing his seals will do—you don t know if it might let him escape. You don’t know how close he was to getting out when the Bore was last secured. Shattering those seals could destroy the world itself! What if our only hope lies in the fact that he’s hindered this time, n \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-53.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
