No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack,\" she said. \"You have to see a lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe in a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack. What\u0027s the matter with you? This is what you\u0027ve told me. Your wife is acting cold and angry toward you. She\u0027s lying to you. She\u0027s acting strange with the kids. She doesn\u0027t seem to care about her family. She\u0027s angry and absent a lot. It\u0027s getting worse. You think she\u0027s involved with someone else. Last night, she doesn\u0027t even show up or call. And you\u0027re just going to let this go without doing anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you. See a lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re damn right I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, a long exasperated hiss. \"Jack. Look. I know you\u0027re a little passive at times, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not passive,\" I said. And I added, \"I hate it when you shrink me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wife is screwing around on you, you think she\u0027s building a case to take the kids away from you, and you\u0027re just letting it happen. I\u0027d say that\u0027s passive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I supposed to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you.\" Another exasperated sigh. \"Okay. I\u0027m taking a couple of days and coming up to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ellen-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t argue. I\u0027m coming. You can tell Julia I\u0027m going to help out with the kids. I\u0027ll be up there this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t argue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she got off the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not passive. I\u0027m thoughtful. Ellen\u0027s very energetic, her personality\u0027s perfect for a psychologist, because she loves to tell people what to do. Frankly, I think she\u0027s pushy. And she thinks I\u0027m passive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is Ellen\u0027s idea about me. That I went to Stanford in the late seventies, and studied population biology-a purely academic field, with no practical application, no jobs except in universities. In those days population biology was being revolutionized by field studies of animals, and by advances in genetic screening. Both required computer analysis, using advanced mathematical algorithms. I couldn\u0027t find the kind of programs I needed for my research, so I began to write them myself. And I slid sideways into computer science-another geeky, purely academic field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my graduation just happened to coincide with the rise of Silicon Valley and the personal-computer explosion. Low-number employees at startup companies were making a fortune in the eighties, and I did pretty well at the first one I worked for. I met Julia, and we got married, had kids. Everything was smooth. We were both doing great, just by showing up for work. I got hired away by another company; more perks, bigger options. I just rode the advancing wave into the nineties. By then I wasn\u0027t programming anymore, I was supervising software development. And things just fell into place for me, without any real effort on my part. I just fell into my life. I never had to prove myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s Ellen\u0027s idea of me. My idea is different. The companies of Silicon Valley are the most intensely competitive in the history of the planet. Everybody works a hundred hours a week. Everybody is racing against milestones. Everybody is cutting development cycles. The cycles were originally three years to a new product, a new version. Then it was two years. Then eighteen months. Now it was twelve months-a new version every year. If you figure beta debugging to golden master takes four months, then you have only eight months to do the actual work. Eight months to revise ten million lines of code, and make sure it all works right. In short, Silicon Valley is no place for a passive person, and I\u0027m not one. I hustled my ass off every minute of every day. I had to prove myself every day-or I\u0027d be gone. That was my idea about myself. I was sure I was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen was right about one part, though. A strong streak of luck ran through my career. Because my original field of study had been biology, I had an advantage when computer programs began to explicitly mimic biological systems. In fact, there were programmers who shuttled back and forth between computer simulation and studies of animal groups in the wild, applying the lessons of one to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut further, I had worked in population biology-the study of groups of living organisms. And computer science had evolved in the direction of massively parallel networked structures-the programming of populations of intelligent agents. A special kind of thinking was required to handle populations of agents, and I had been trained in that thinking for years. So I was admirably suited to the trends of my field, and I made excellent progress as the fields emerged. I had been in the right place at the right time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat much was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgent-based programs that modeled biological populations were increasingly important in the real world. Like my own programs that mimicked ant foraging to control big communications networks. Or programs that mimicked division of labor among termite colonies to control thermostats in a skyscraper. And closely related were the programs that mimicked genetic selection, used for a wide range of applications. In one program, witnesses to a crime were shown nine faces and asked to choose which was most like the criminal, even if none really were; the program then showed them nine more faces, and asked them to choose again; and from many repeated generations the program slowly evolved a highly accurate composite picture of the face, far more accurate than any police artist could make. Witnesses never had to say what exactly they were responding to in each face; they just chose, and the program evolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there were the biotech companies, which had found they could not successfully engineer new proteins because the proteins tended to fold up weirdly. So now they used genetic selection to \"evolve\" the new proteins instead. All these procedures had become standard practice in a matter of just a few years. And they were increasingly powerful, increasingly important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, yes, I had been in the right place at the right time. But I wasn\u0027t passive, I was lucky. I hadn\u0027t showered or shaved yet. I went in the bathroom, stripped off my T-shirt, and stared at myself in the mirror. I was startled to see how soft I looked around the gut. I hadn\u0027t realized. Of course I was forty, and the fact was, I hadn\u0027t been exercising as much lately. Not because I was depressed. I was busy with the kids, and tired a lot of the time. I just didn\u0027t feel like exercising, that was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at my own reflection, and wondered if Ellen was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s one problem with all psychological knowledge-nobody can apply it to themselves. People can be incredibly astute about the shortcomings of their friends, spouses, children. But they have no insight into themselves at all. The same people who are coldly clear-eyed about the world around them have nothing but fantasies about themselves. Psychological knowledge doesn\u0027t work if you look in a mirror. This bizarre fact is, as far as I know, unexplained. Personally, I always thought there was a clue from computer programming, in a procedure called recursion. Recursion means making the program loop back on itself, to use its own information to do things over and over until it gets a result. You use recursion for certain data-sorting algorithms and things like that. But it\u0027s got to be done carefully, or you risk having the machine fall into what is called an infinite regress. It\u0027s the programming equivalent of those funhouse mirrors that reflect mirrors, and mirrors, ever smaller and smaller, stretching away to infinity. The program keeps going, repeating and repeating, but nothing happens. The machine hangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI always figured something similar must happen when people turn their psychological insight-apparatus on themselves. The brain hangs. The thought process goes and goes, but it doesn\u0027t get anywhere. It must be something like that, because we know that people can think about themselves indefinitely. Some people think of little else. Yet people never seem to change as a result of their intensive introspection. They never understand themselves better. It\u0027s very rare to find genuine self-knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s almost as if you need someone else to tell you who you are, or to hold up the mirror for you. Which, if you think about it, is very weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe it\u0027s not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s an old question in artificial intelligence about whether a program can ever be aware of itself. Most programmers will say it was impossible. People have tried to do it, and failed. But there\u0027s a more fundamental version of the question, a philosophical question about whether any machine can understand its own workings. Some people say that\u0027s impossible, too. The machine can\u0027t know itself for the same reason you can\u0027t bite your own teeth. And it certainly seems to be impossible: the human brain is the most complicated structure in the known universe, but brains still know very little about themselves. For the last thirty years, such questions have been fun to kick around with a beer on Friday afternoons after work. They were never taken seriously. But lately these philosophical questions have taken on new importance because there has been rapid progress in reproducing certain brain functions. Not the entire brain, just certain functions. For example, before I was fired, my development team was using multi-agent processing to enable computers to learn, to recognize patterns in data, to understand natural languages, to prioritize and switch tasks. What was important about the programs was that the machines literally learned. They got better at their jobs with experience. Which is more than some human beings can claim. The phone rang. It was Ellen. \"Did you call your lawyer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. For Christ\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on the 2:10 to San Jose. I\u0027ll see you around five at your house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Ellen, it really isn\u0027t necessary-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that. I\u0027m just getting out of town. I need a break. See you soon, Jack.\" And she hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now she was handling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, I figured there was no point in calling a lawyer today. I had too much to do. The dry cleaning had to be picked up, so I did that. There was a Starbucks across the street, and I went over to get a latte to take with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was Gary Marder, my attorney, with a very young blonde in low-cut jeans and crop top that left her belly exposed. They were nuzzling each other in the checkout line. She didn\u0027t look much older than a college student. I was embarrassed and was turning to leave when Gary saw me, and waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Gary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out his hand, and I shook it. He said, \"Say hello to Melissa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Hi, Melissa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh hi.\" She seemed vaguely annoyed at this interruption, although I couldn\u0027t be sure. She had that vacant look some young girls get around men. It occurred to me that she couldn\u0027t be more than six years older than Nicole. What was she doing with a guy like Gary? \"So. How\u0027s it going, Jack?\" Gary said, slipping his arm around Melissa\u0027s bare waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. \"Pretty good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? That\u0027s good.\" But he was frowning at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, uh, yeah ...\" I stood there, hesitating, feeling foolish in front of the girl. She clearly wanted me to leave. But I was thinking of what Ellen would say: You ran into your lawyer and you didn\u0027t even ask him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I said, \"Gary, could I speak to you for a minute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" He gave the girl money to pay for the coffee, and we stepped to one side of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered my voice. \"Listen, Gary,\" I said, \"I think I need to see a divorce lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I think Julia is having an affair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think? Or you know for a fact?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I don\u0027t know for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you just suspect it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary sighed. He gave me a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"And there\u0027s other things going on, too. She\u0027s starting to say that I am turning the kids against her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alienation of affection,\" he said, nodding. \"Legal cliche du jour. She makes these statements when?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we have fights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother sigh. \"Jack, couples say all kinds of shit when they fight. It doesn\u0027t necessarily mean anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it does. I\u0027m worried it does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is upsetting you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen a marriage counselor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two reasons. First, because you should. You\u0027ve been married to Julia a long time, and as far as I know it\u0027s been mostly good. And second, because you\u0027ll start to establish a record of trying to save the marriage, which contradicts a claim of alienation of affection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re right that she is starting to build a case, then you have to be extremely careful, my friend. Alienation of affection is a tough argument to defend against. The kids are pissed at Mom, and she says you\u0027re behind it. How can you prove it\u0027s not true? You can\u0027t. Plus you\u0027ve been home a lot, so it\u0027s easier to imagine that it might be true. The court will see you as dissatisfied, and possibly resentful of your working spouse.\" He held up his hand. \"I know, I know none of that\u0027s true, Jack, but it\u0027s an easy argument to make, that\u0027s my point. And her attorney will make it. In your resentment, you turned the kids against her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. I know that.\" He slapped me on the shoulder. \"So see a good counselor. If you need names, call my office and Barbara\u0027ll give you a couple of reputable ones.\" I called Julia to tell her that Ellen was coming up for a few days. Of course, I didn\u0027t reach Julia, just her voice mail. I left a longish message, explaining what was happening. Then I went to do the shopping because with Ellen staying over, we\u0027d need some extra supplies. I was rolling my cart down the supermarket aisle when I got a call from the hospital. It was the beardless ER doctor again. He was calling to check on Amanda and I said her bruises were almost gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good,\" he said. \"Glad to hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"What about the MRI?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor said the MRI results were not relevant, because the machine had malfunctioned and had never examined Amanda. \"In fact, we\u0027re worried about all the readings for the last few weeks,\" he said. \"Because apparently the machine was slowly breaking down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was being corroded or something. All the memory chips were turning to powder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a chill, remembering Eric\u0027s MP3 player. \"Why would that happen?\" I said. \"The best guess is it\u0027s been corroded by some gas that escaped from the wall lines, probably during the night. Like chlorine gas, that\u0027d do it. Except the thing is, only the memory chips were damaged. The other chips were fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings were getting stranger by the minute. And they got stranger still a few minutes later, when Julia called all cheerful and upbeat, to announce that she was coming home in the afternoon and would be there in plenty of time for dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be great to see Ellen,\" she said. \"Why is she coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she just wanted to get out of town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027ll be great for you to have her around for a few days. Some grown-up company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for her to explain why she hadn\u0027t come home. But all she said was, \"Hey, I got to run, Jack, I\u0027ll talk to you later-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia,\" I said. \"Wait a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, wondering how to put it. I said, \"I was worried about you last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you didn\u0027t come home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, I called you. I got stuck out at the plant. Didn\u0027t you check your messages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you didn\u0027t have a message from me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t know what happened. I left you a message, Jack. I called the house first and got Maria, but she couldn\u0027t, you know, it was too complicated ... So then I called your cell and I left you a message that I was stuck at the plant until today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I didn\u0027t get it,\" I said, trying not to sound like I was pouting. \"Sorry about that, honey, but check your service. Anyway listen, I really have to go. See you tonight, okay? Kiss kiss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my cell phone out of my pocket and checked it. There was no message. I checked the phone log. There were no calls last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia hadn\u0027t called me. No one had called me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to feel a sinking sensation, that descent into depression again. I felt tired, I couldn\u0027t move. I stared at the produce on the supermarket shelves. I couldn\u0027t remember why I was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had just about decided to leave the supermarket when my cell phone rang in my hand. I flipped it open. It was Tim Bergman, the guy who had taken over my job at MediaTronics. \"Are you sitting down?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got some pretty strange news. Brace yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don wants to call you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon Gross was the head of the company, the guy who had fired me. \"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants to hire you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I know. It\u0027s crazy. To hire you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re having some problems with distributed systems that we\u0027ve sold to customers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which ones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, PREDPREY.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s one of the old ones,\" I said. \"Who sold that?\" PREDPREY was a system we\u0027d designed over a year ago. Like most of our programs, it had been based on biological models. PREDPREY was a goal-seeking program based on predator/prey dynamics. But it was extremely simple in its structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Xymos wanted something very simple,\" Tim said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sold PREDPREY to Xymos?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Licensed, actually. With a contract to support it. That\u0027s driving us crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t working right, apparently. Goal seeking has gone haywire. A lot of the time, the program seems to lose its goal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not surprised,\" I said, \"because we didn\u0027t specify reinforcers.\" Reinforcers were program weights that sustained the goals. The reason you needed them was that since the networked agents could learn, they might learn in a way that caused them to drift away from the goal. You needed a way to store the original goal so it didn\u0027t get lost. The fact was you could easily come to think of agent programs as children. The programs forgot things, lost things, dropped things. It was all emergent behavior. It wasn\u0027t programmed, but it was the outcome of programming. And apparently it was happening to Xymos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Tim said, \"Don figures you were running the team when the program was originally written, so you\u0027re the guy to fix it. Plus, your wife is high up in Xymos management, so your joining the team will reassure their top people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure that was true, but I didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, that\u0027s the situation,\" Tim continued. \"I\u0027m calling you to ask if Don should call you. Because he doesn\u0027t want to get rejected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a burst of anger. He doesn\u0027t want to get rejected. \"Tim,\" I said. \"I can\u0027t go back to work there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you wouldn\u0027t be here. You\u0027d be up at the Xymos fab plant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes? How would that work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don would hire you as an off-site consultant. Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" I said, in my best noncommittal tone. Everything about this proposal sounded like a bad idea. The last thing I wanted to do was go back to work for that son of a bitch Don. And it was always a bad idea to return to a company after you\u0027d been fired-for any reason, under any arrangement. Everybody knew that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut on the other hand, if I agreed to work as a consultant, it would get rid of my shelf-life problem. And it would get me out of the house. It would accomplish a lot of things. After a pause, I said, \"Listen, Tim, let me think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to call me back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will you call?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tension in his voice was clear. I said, \"You\u0027ve got some urgency about this ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, some. Like I said, that contract\u0027s driving us crazy. We have five programmers from the original team practically living out at that Xymos plant. And they\u0027re not getting anywhere on this problem. So if you\u0027re not going to help us, we have to look elsewhere, right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ll call you tomorrow,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow morning?\" he said, hinting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. \"Yes, tomorrow morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim\u0027s call should have made me feel better about things, but it didn\u0027t. I took the baby to the park, and pushed her in the swing for a while. Amanda liked being pushed in the swing. She could do it for twenty or thirty minutes at a time, and always cried when I took her out. Later I sat on the concrete curb of the sandbox while she crawled around, and pulled herself up to standing on the concrete turtles and other playthings. One of the older toddlers knocked her over, but she didn\u0027t cry; she just got back up. She seemed to like being around the older kids. I watched her, and thought about going back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you told them yes,\" Ellen said to me. We were in the kitchen. She had just arrived, her black suitcase unpacked in the corner. Ellen looked exactly the same, still rail-thin, energetic, blond, hyper. My sister never seemed to age. She was drinking a cup of tea from teabags that she had brought with her. Special organic oolong tea from a special shop in San Francisco. That hadn\u0027t changed, either-Ellen had always been fussy about food, even as a kid. As an adult, she traveled around with her own teas, her own salad dressings, her own vitamins neatly arranged in little glassine packs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t tell them yes. I said I\u0027d think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about it? Are you kidding? Jack, you have to go back to work. You know you do.\" She stared at me, appraising. \"You\u0027re depressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have some of this tea,\" she said. \"All that coffee is bad for your nerves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tea has more caffeine than coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack. You have to go back to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that, Ellen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if it\u0027s a consulting job ... wouldn\u0027t that be perfect? Solve all your problems?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? What don\u0027t you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m getting the full story,\" I said. \"I mean, if Xymos is having all this trouble, how come Julia hasn\u0027t said anything about it to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen shook her head. \"It sounds like Julia isn\u0027t saying much of anything to you these days.\" She stared at me. \"So why didn\u0027t you accept right away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to check around first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check what, Jack?\" Her tone conveyed disbelief. Ellen was acting like I had a psychological problem that needed to be fixed. My sister was starting to get to me, and we\u0027d only been together a few minutes. My older sister, treating me like I was a kid again. I stood up. \"Listen, Ellen,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve spent my life in this business, and I know how it works. There\u0027s two possible reasons Don wants me back. The first is the company\u0027s in a jam and they think I can help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what they said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. That\u0027s what they said. But the other possibility is that they\u0027ve made an incredible mess of things and by now it can\u0027t be fixed-and they know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they want somebody to blame?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. They want a donkey to pin the tail on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. I saw her hesitate. \"Do you really think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, that\u0027s the point,\" I said. \"But I have to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which you will do by ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By making some calls. Maybe paying a surprise visit to the fab building tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. That sounds right to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad I have your approval.\" I couldn\u0027t keep the irritation out of my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack,\" she said. She got up and hugged me. \"I\u0027m just worried about you, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate that,\" I said. \"But you\u0027re not helping me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Then what can I do to help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch the kids, while I make some calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured I would first call Ricky Morse, the guy I\u0027d seen in the supermarket buying Huggies. I had a long relationship with Ricky; he worked at Xymos and he was casual enough about information that he might tell me what was really going on there. The only problem was that Ricky was based in the Valley, and he\u0027d already told me that the action was all at the fab building. But he was a place for me to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called his office, but the receptionist said, \"I\u0027m sorry, Mr. Morse is not in the office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When is he expected back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really couldn\u0027t say. Do you want voice mail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left Ricky a voice-mail message. Then I called his home number. His wife answered. Mary was getting her Ph.D. in French history; I imagined her studying, bouncing the baby, with a book open on her lap. I said, \"How are you, Mary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s the baby? Ricky tells me you never get diaper rash. I\u0027m jealous.\" I tried to sound casual. Just a social call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary laughed. \"She\u0027s a good baby, and we didn\u0027t have colic, thank God. But Ricky hasn\u0027t been around for the rashes,\" she said. \"We\u0027ve had some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Actually, I\u0027m looking for Ricky. Is he there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Jack. He\u0027s been gone all week. He\u0027s out at that fab plant in Nevada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right.\" I remembered now that Ricky had mentioned that, when we had met in the supermarket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been out to that plant?\" Mary said. I thought I detected an uneasy tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I haven\u0027t, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia is there a lot, isn\u0027t she? What does she say about it?\" Definitely worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, not much. I gather they have new technology that\u0027s very hush-hush. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated. \"Maybe it\u0027s my imagination ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sometimes when Ricky calls, he sounds kind of weird to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s distracted and working hard, but he says some strange things. He doesn\u0027t always make a lot of sense. And he seems evasive. Like he\u0027s, I don\u0027t know, hiding something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hiding something ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a self-deprecating laugh. \"I even thought maybe he\u0027s having an affair. You know, that woman Mae Chang is out there, and he always liked her. She\u0027s so pretty.\" Mae Chang used to work in my division at MediaTronics. \"I hadn\u0027t heard she was at the fab plant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I think a lot of the people who used to work for you are there, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t think Ricky is having an affair, Mary. It\u0027s just not like him. And it\u0027s not like Mae.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the quiet ones you have to watch out for,\" she said, apparently referring to Mae. \"And I\u0027m still nursing, so I haven\u0027t lost my weight yet, I mean, my thighs are as big as sides of beef.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prey/page-6.html","bookId":1714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:35 AM"}
