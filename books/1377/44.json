{"id":11449,"no":44,"title":"CHAPTER XLIV. FRANK JONES COMES BACK AGAIN.","content":"These last words had been spoken after the coming of Frank Jones, but something has to be said of the manner of his coming, and of the reasons which brought him, and something also which occurred before he came. It could not be that Mr. Moss should be wounded after so desperate a fashion and that not a word should be said about it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of what happened at the time of the wounding Rachel knew nothing. She had been very brave and high in courage till the thing was done, but as soon as it was done she sent for the servant and fainted away. She knew nothing of what had occurred till she had been removed out of the room on one side, and he on the other. She did not hear, therefore, of the suggestion made by Mr. Moss that some vital part of him had been reached.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did bleed profusely, but under the aid of the doctor and Mr. O\u0027Mahony, who was soon on the scene, he recovered himself more quickly than poor Rachel, who was indeed somewhat neglected till the hero of the tragedy had been sent away. He behaved with sufficient courage at last, though he had begun by declaring that his days were numbered. At any rate he had said when he found the power of ordinary speech, \"Don\u0027t let a word be whispered about it to Miss O\u0027Mahony; she isn\u0027t like other people.\" Then he was taken back to his private lodging, and confided to the care of Madame Socani, where we will for the present leave him. Soon after the occurrence,—a day or two after it,—Frank Jones appeared suddenly on the scene. Of course it appeared that he had come to mourn the probable death of Mr. Moss. But he had in truth heard nothing of the fatal encounter till he had arrived in Cecil Street, and then could hardly make out what had occurred amidst the confused utterances.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Frank Jones!\" she exclaimed. \"Father, what has brought him here?\" and she blushed up over her face and head to the very roots of her hair. \"Come up, of course he must come up. When a man has come all the way from Castle Morony he must be allowed to come up. Why should you wish to keep him down in the area?\" Then Frank Jones soon made his appearance within the chamber.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was midsummer, and Rachel occupied a room in the lowest house in the street, looking right away upon the river, and her easy-chair had been brought up to the window at which she sat, and looked out on the tide of river life as it flowed by. She was covered at present with a dressing gown, as sweet and fresh as the morning air. On her head she wore a small net of the finest golden filigree, and her tiny feet were thrust into a pair of bright blue slippers bordered with swans-down. \"Am I to come back?\" her obedient father had asked. But he had been told not to come back, not quite at present. \"It is not that I want your absence,\" she had said, \"but he may. He can tell me with less hesitation that he is going to set up a pig-killing establishment in South Australia than he could probably you and me together.\" So the father simply slapped him on the back, and bade him walk upstairs till he would find No. 15 on the second landing. \"Of course you have heard,\" he said, as Frank was going, \"of what she has been and done to Mahomet M. Moss?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not a word,\" said Frank. \"What has she done?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Plunged a dagger into him,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony,—in a manner which showed to Frank that he was not much afraid of the consequences of the accident. \"You go up and no doubt she will tell you all about it.\" Then Frank went up, and was soon admitted into Rachel\u0027s room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Frank!\" she said, \"how are you? What on earth has brought you here?\" Then he at once began to ask questions about poor Moss, and Rachel of course to answer them. \"Well, yes; how was I to help it? I told him from the time that I was a little girl, long before I knew you, that something of this kind would occur if he would not behave himself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And he didn\u0027t?\" asked Frank, with some little pardonable curiosity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, he did not. Whether he wanted me or my voice, thinking that it would come back again, I cannot tell, but he did want something. There was a woman who brought messages from him, and even she wanted something. Then his ideas ran higher.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He meant to marry you,\" said Frank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose he did,—at last. I am very much obliged to him, but it did not suit. Then,—to make a short story of it, Frank, I will tell you the whole truth. He took hold of me. I cannot bear to be taken hold of; you know that yourself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He could only remember how often he had sat with her down among the willows at the lake side with his arm round her waist, and she had never seemed to be impatient under the operation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And though he has such a beautiful shiny hat he is horribly awkward. He nearly knocked me down and fell on me, by way of embracing me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Frank thought that he had never been driven to such straits as that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To be knocked down and trampled on by a beast like that! There are circumstances in which a girl must protect herself, when other circumstances have brought her into danger. In those days—yesterday, that is, or a week ago—I was a poor singing girl. I was at every man\u0027s disposal, and had to look after myself. There are so many white bears about, ready to eat you, if you do not look after yourself. He tried to eat me, and he was wounded. You do not blame me, Frank.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, indeed; not for that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you blame me for?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I cannot think you right,\" he answered with almost majestic sternness, \"to have accepted the offer of Lord Castlewell.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You blame me for that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He nodded his head at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What would you have had me do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Marry a man when you love him, but not when you don\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Frank! I couldn\u0027t. How was I to marry a man when I loved him,—I who had been so treated? But, sir,\" she said, remembering herself, \"you have no right to say I did not love Lord Castlewell. You have no business to inquire into that matter. Nobody blames you, or can, or shall, in that affair,—not in my hearing. You behaved as gentlemen do behave; gentlemen who cannot act otherwise, because it is born in their bones and their flesh. I—I have not behaved quite so well. Open confession is good for the soul. Frank, I have not behaved quite so well. You may inquire about it. I did not love Lord Castlewell, and I told him so. He came to me when my singing was all gone, and generously renewed his offer. Had I not known that in his heart of hearts he did not wish it,—that the two things were gone for which he had wooed me,—my voice, which was grand, and my prettiness, which was but a little thing, I should have taken his second offer, because it would be well to let him have what he wanted. It was not so; and therefore I sent him away, well pleased.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But why did you accept him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Frank! do not be too hard. How am I to tell you—you, of all men, what my reasons were? I was alone in the world; alone with such dangers before me as that which Mr. Moss brought with him. And then my profession had become a reality, and this lord would assist me. Do all the girls refuse the lords who come and ask them?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he stood close over her, and shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I should have done so,\" she continued after a pause. \"I recognise it now; and let there be an end of it. There is a something which does make a woman unfit for matrimony.\" And the tears coursed themselves down her wan cheeks. \"Now it has all been said that need be said, and let there be an end of it. I have talked too much about myself. What has brought you to London?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Just a young woman,\" he whispered slowly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A pang shot through her heart; and yet not quite a pang, for with it there was a rush of joy, which was not, however, perfect joy, because she felt that it must be disappointed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bother your young woman,\" she said; \"who cares for your young woman! How are you going on in Galway?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sadly enough, to tell the truth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No rents?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nothing but murders and floods?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The same damnable old story running on from day to day.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And have the girls no servants yet?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not a servant; except old Peter, who is not quite as faithful as he should be.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And,—and what about that valiant gay young gentleman, Captain Clayton?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Everything goes amiss in love as well as war,\" said Frank. \"Between the three of them, I hardly know what they want.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think I know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very likely. Everything goes so astray with all of us, so that the wanting it is sufficient reason for not getting it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is that all you have come to tell me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose it is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you might have stayed away.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I may as well go, perhaps.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go? no! I am not so full of new friends that I can afford to throw away my old like that. Of course you may not go, as you call it! Do you suppose I do not care to hear about those girls whom I love,—pretty nearly with all my heart? Why don\u0027t you tell me about them, and your father? You come here, but you talk of nothing but going. You ain\u0027t half nice.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can I come in yet?\" This belonged to a voice behind the door, which was the property of Mr. O\u0027Mahony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not quite yet, father. Mr. Jones is telling me about them all at Morony Castle.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should have thought I might have heard that,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The girls have special messages to send,\" said Rachel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll come back in another ten minutes,\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony. \"I shall not wait longer than that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Only their love,\" said Frank; upon which Rachel looked as though she thought that Frank Jones was certainly an ass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course I want to hear their love,\" said Rachel. \"Dear Ada, and dear Edith! Why don\u0027t you tell me their love?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My poor sick girl,\" he said, laying his hand upon her shoulder, and looking into her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Never mind my sickness. I know I am as thin and as wan as an ogre. Nevertheless, I care for their love.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rachel, do you care for mine?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I haven\u0027t got it! Oh, Frank, why don\u0027t you speak to me? You have spoken a word, just a word, and all the blood is coming back to my veins already.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dearest, dearest, dearest Rachel.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now you have spoken; now you have told me of your sisters and your father. Now I know it all! Now my father may come in.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you love me, then?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Love you! That question you know to be unnecessary. Love you! Why I spend every day and every night in loving you! But, Frank, you wouldn\u0027t have me when I was going to be rich. I ought not to have you now that I am to be poor.\" But by this time she was in his arms and he was kissing her, till, as she had said, the blood was once again running in her veins. \"Oh, Frank, what a tyrant you are! Did I not tell you to let poor father come into the room? You have said everything now. There cannot be another word to say. Frank, Frank, Frank! I have found it out at last. I cannot live without you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But how are you to live with me? There is no money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bother money. Wealth is sordid. Washing stockings over a tub is the only life for me,—so long as I have you to come back to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And your health?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I tell you it is done. I was merely sick of the Jones complaint. Oh, heavens! how I can hate people, and how I can love them!\" Then she threw herself on the sofa, absolutely worn out by the violence of her emotions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. O\u0027Mahony was commissioned, and sat down by his girl\u0027s side to comfort her. But she wanted no comforting. \"So you and Frank have made it up, have you?\" said Mr. O\u0027Mahony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We have never quarrelled so far as I am concerned,\" said Frank. \"The moment I heard Lord Castlewell was dismissed, I came back.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" said she, raising herself half up on the sofa. \"Do you know his story, father? It is rather a nice story for a girl to hear of her own lover, and to feel that it is true. When I was about to make I don\u0027t know how many thousand dollars a year by my singing, he would not come and take his share of it. Then I have to think of my own disgrace. But it enhances his glory. Because he was gone, I brought myself to accept this lord.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, Rachel, you shall not exert yourself,\" said Frank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will, sir,\" she replied, holding him by the hand. \"I will tell my story. He had retreated from the stain, and the lord had come in his place. But he was here always,\" and she pressed his hand to her side. \"He could not be got rid of. Then I lost my voice, and was \u0027utterly dished,\u0027 as the theatrical people say. Then the lord went,—behaving better than I did however,—and I was alone. Oh, what bitter moments there came then,—long enough for the post to go to Ireland and to return! And now he is here. Once more at my feet again, old man, once more! And then he talks to me of money! What is money to me? I have got such a comforting portion that I care not at all for money.\" Then she all but fainted once again, and Frank and her father both knelt over her caressing her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a long time before Frank left her, her father going in and out of the room as it pleased him the while. Then he declared that he must go down to the House, assuring Frank that one blackguard there was worse than another, but saying that he would see them to the end as long as his time lasted. Rachel insisted that Frank should go with him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am just getting up from my death-bed,\" she said, laughing, \"and you want me to go on like any other man\u0027s young woman. I can think about you without talking to you.\" And so saying she dismissed him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the next morning, when he came again, she discussed with him the future arrangement of his life and hers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course you must stay with your father,\" she said. \"You do not want to marry me at once, I suppose. And of course it is impossible if you do. I shall go to the States with father as soon as this Parliament affair is over. He is turned out of the House so often that he will be off before long for good and all. But there is the mail still running, and remember that what I say is true. I shall be ready and willing to be made Mrs. Frank Jones as soon as you will come and fetch me, and will tell me that you are able to provide me just with a crust and a blanket in County Galway. Whatever little you will do with, I will do with less.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then she sat upon his knee, and embraced him and kissed him, and swore to him that no other Lord Castlewell who came should interfere with his rights.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And as for Mr. Moss,\" she added, \"I do not think that he will ever appear again to trouble your little game.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2744/75582.html","bookId":1377,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:56:12 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:56:12 AM"}
