He did not seem to care about anything that was happening in the outside world. The only things that mattered were the thick bloody light at the bottom of his eyes and the frightening will that seemed to lean towards dying together with his enemies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Tenebrous Demon Dragon said in a low voice, “Young man, I do not know what has happened, but you need to calm down.
