In the middle of a hectic day, David received a message that Tim O\u0027Neil, the friend of an important American diamond buyer, was in Klip-drift and asking if David would be good enough to welcome him and perhaps take him to dinner. David had no time to waste on tourists, but he did not want to offend his customer. He would have asked Kate to entertain the visitor, but she was on a tour of the company\u0027s plants in North America with Brad Rogers. I\u0027m stuck, David decided. He called the hotel where O\u0027Neil was staying and invited him to dinner that evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My daughter is with me,\" O\u0027Neil told him. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind if I bring her along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was in no mood to spend the evening with a child. \"Not at all,\" he said politely. He would make sure the evening was a short one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey met at the Grand Hotel, in the dining room. When David arrived, O\u0027Neil and his daughter were already seated at the table. O\u0027Neil was a handsome, gray-haired Irish-American in his early fifties. His daughter, Josephine, was the most beautiful woman David had ever seen. She was in her early thirties, with a stunning figure, soft blond hair and clear blue eyes. The breath went out of David at the sight of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m late,\" he said. \"Some last-minute business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosephine watched his reaction to her with amusement. \"Sometimes that\u0027s the most exciting kind,\" she said innocently. \"My father tells me you\u0027re a very important man, Mr. Black-well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really - and it\u0027s David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"That\u0027s a good name. It suggests great strength.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the dinner was over, David decided that Josephine O\u0027Neil was much more than just a beautiful woman. She was intelligent, had a sense of humor and was skillful at making him feel at ease. David felt she was genuinely interested in him. She asked him questions about himself that no one had ever asked before. By the time the evening ended, he was already half in love with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your home?\" David asked Tim O\u0027Neil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"San Francisco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you be going back soon?\" He made it sound as casual as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosephine smiled at David. \"If Klipdrift is as interesting as it promises to be, I might persuade Father to stay a little longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I intend to make it as interesting as possible,\" David assured her. \"How would you like to go down into a diamond mine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d love it,\" Josephine answered. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one time David had personally escorted important visitors down into the mines, but he had long since delegated that task to subordinates. Now he heard himself saying, \"Would tomorrow morning be convenient?\" He had half a dozen meetings scheduled for the morning, but they suddenly seemed unimportant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the O\u0027Neils down a rockshaft, twelve hundred feet below ground. The shaft was six feet wide and twenty feet long, divided into four compartments, one for pumping, two for hoisting the blue diamondiferous earth and one with a double-decked cage to carry the miners to and from work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve always been curious about something,\" Josephine said. \"Why are diamonds measured in carats?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The carat was named for the carob seed,\" David explained, \"because of its consistency in weight. One carat equals two hundred milligrams, or one one-hundred-forty-second of an ounce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosephine said, \"I\u0027m absolutely fascinated, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he wondered if she was referring only to the diamonds. Her nearness was intoxicating. Every time he looked at Josephine, David felt a fresh sense of excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really should see something of the countryside,\" David told the O\u0027Neils. \"If you\u0027re free tomorrow, I\u0027d be happy to take you around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore her father could say anything, Josephine replied, \"That would be lovely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was with Josephine and her father every day after that, and each day David fell more deeply in love. He had never known anyone as bewitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen David arrived to pick up the O\u0027Neils for dinner one evening and Tim O\u0027Neil said, \"I\u0027m a bit tired tonight, David. Would you mind if I didn\u0027t go along?\" David tried to hide his pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir. I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosephine gave David a mischievous smile. \"I\u0027ll try to keep you entertained,\" she promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid took her to a restaurant in a hotel that had just opened. The room was crowded, but David was recognized and given a table immediately. A three-piece ensemble was playing American music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid asked, \"Would you like to dance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, Josephine was in his arms on the dance floor, and it was magic. David held her lovely body close to his, and he could feel her respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josephine, I\u0027m in love with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put a finger to his lips. \"Please, David...don\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I couldn\u0027t marry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you love me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled up at him, her blue eyes sparkling. \"I\u0027m crazy about you, my darling. Can\u0027t you tell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I could never live in Klipdrift. I\u0027d go mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could give it a try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David, I\u0027m tempted, but I know what would happen. If I married you and had to live here, I\u0027d turn into a screaming shrew and we\u0027d end up hating each other. I\u0027d rather we said good-bye this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to say good-bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up into his face, and David felt her body melt into his. \"David, is there any chance that you could live in San Francisco?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an impossible idea. \"What would I do there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s have breakfast in the morning. I want you to talk to Father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim O\u0027Neil said, \"Josephine has told me about your conversation last night. Looks like you two have a problem. But I might have a solution, if you\u0027re interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very interested, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO\u0027Neil picked up a brown-leather briefcase and removed some blueprints. \"Do you know anything about frozen foods?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They first started freezing food in the United States in 1865. The problem was transporting it long distances without the food thawing out. We\u0027ve got refrigerated railway cars, but no one\u0027s been able to come up with a way to refrigerate trucks.\" O\u0027Neil tapped the blueprints. \"Until now. I just received a patent on it. This is going to revolutionize the entire food industry, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid glanced at the blueprints. \"I\u0027m afraid these don\u0027t mean much to me, Mr. O\u0027Neil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m not looking for a technical expert. I have plenty of those. What I\u0027m looking for is financing and someone to run the business. This isn\u0027t some wild pipe dream. I\u0027ve talked to the top food processors in the business. This is going to be big - bigger than you can imagine. I need someone like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The company headquarters will be in San Francisco,\" Josephine added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid sat there silent, digesting what he had just heard. \"You say you\u0027ve been given a patent on this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. I\u0027m all set to move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you mind if I borrowed these blueprints and showed them to someone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no objection at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing David did was to check on Tim O\u0027Neil. He learned that O\u0027Neil had a solid reputation in San Francisco. He had been head of the science department at a Berkeley College there and was highly regarded. David knew nothing about the freezing of food, but he intended to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be back in five days, darling. I want you and your father to wait for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as you like. I\u0027ll miss you,\" Josephine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll miss you, too.\" And he meant it more than she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid took the train to Johannesburg and made an appointment to see Edward Broderick, the owner of the largest meatpacking plant in South Africa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want your opinion on something.\" David handed him the blueprints. \"I need to know if this can work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know a damned thing about frozen foods or trucks, but I know people who do. If you come back this afternoon, I\u0027ll have a couple of experts here for you, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt four o\u0027clock that afternoon David returned to the packing plant. He found that he was nervous, in a state of uncertainty, because he was not sure how he wanted the meeting to go. Two weeks earlier, he would have laughed if anyone had even suggested he would ever leave Kruger-Brent, Ltd. It was a part of him. He would have laughed even harder if they had told him he would have considered heading a little food company in San Francisco. It was insane, except for one thing: Josephine O\u0027Neil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two men in the room with Edward Broderick. \"This is Dr. Crawford and Mr. Kaufman. David Blackwell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey exchanged greetings. David asked, \"Have you gentlemen had a chance to look at the blueprints?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Crawford replied, \"We certainly have, Mr. Blackwell. We\u0027ve been over them thoroughly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid took a deep breath. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand that the United States Patent Office has granted a patent on this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Mr. Blackwell, whoever got that patent is going to be one very rich man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid nodded slowly, filled with conflicting emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like all great inventions - it\u0027s so simple you wonder why someone didn\u0027t think of it sooner. This one can\u0027t miss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid did not know how to react. He had half-hoped that the decision would be taken out of his hands. If Tim O\u0027Neil\u0027s invention was useless, there was a chance of persuading Josephine to stay in South Africa. But what O\u0027Neil had told him was true. It did work. Now David had to make his decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of nothing else on the journey back to Klipdrift. If he accepted, it would mean leaving the company, starting up a new, untried business. He was an American, but America was a foreign country to him. He held an important position in one of the most powerful companies in the world. He loved his job. Jamie and Margaret McGregor had been very good to him. And then there was Kate. He had cared for her since she was a baby. He had watched her grow up from a stubborn, dirty-faced tomboy to a lovely young woman. Her life was a photo album in his mind. He turned the pages and there was Kate at four, eight, ten, fourteen, twenty-one - vulnerable, unpredictable...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the train arrived at Klipdrift, David had made up his mind. He was not going to leave Kruger-Brent, Ltd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove directly to the Grand Hotel and went up to the O\u0027Neils\u0027 suite. Josephine opened the door for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her in his arms and kissed her hungrily, feeling her warm body pressing against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, David, I\u0027ve missed you so much. I don\u0027t ever want to be away from you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t have to,\" David said slowly. \"I\u0027m going to San Francisco...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid had waited with growing anxiety for Kate to return from the United States. Now that he had made his decision, he was eager to get started on his new life, impatient to marry Josephine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now Kate was back, and he was standing in front of her saying, \"I\u0027m getting married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate heard the words through a roaring in her ears. She felt suddenly faint, and she gripped the edge of the desk for support. I want to die, she thought. Please let me die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, from some deep wellspring of will, she managed a smile. \"Tell me about her, David.\" She was proud of how calm her voice sounded. \"Who is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name is Josephine O\u0027Neil. She\u0027s been visiting here with her father. I know you two will be good friends, Kate. She\u0027s a fine woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She must be, if you love her, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"There\u0027s one more thing, Kate. I\u0027m going to be leaving the company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world was falling in on her. \"Just because you\u0027re getting married, doesn\u0027t mean you have to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t that. Josephine\u0027s father is starting a new business in San Francisco. They need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So - so you\u0027ll be living in San Francisco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Brad Rogers can handle my job easily, and we\u0027ll pick a top management team to back him up. Kate, I - I can\u0027t tell you what a difficult decision this was for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, David. You - you must love her very much. When do I get to meet the bride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid smiled, pleased at how well Kate was taking the news. \"Tonight, if you\u0027re free for dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would not let the tears come until she was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of them had dinner at the McGregor mansion. The moment Kate saw Josephine, she blanched, Oh God! No wonder he\u0027s in love with her! She was dazzling. Just being in her presence made Kate feel awkward and ugly. And to make matters worse, Josephine was gracious and charming. And obviously very much in love with David. Bloody hell!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring dinner Tim O\u0027Neil told Kate about the new company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds very interesting,\" Kate said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s no Kruger-Brent, Limited, Miss McGregor. We\u0027ll have to start small, but with David running it, we\u0027ll do all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With David running it, you can\u0027t miss,\" Kate assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evening was an agony. In the same cataclysmic moment, she had lost the man she loved and the one person who was indispensable to Kruger-Brent, Ltd. She carried on a conversation and managed to get through the evening, but afterward she had no recollection of what she said or did. She only knew that every time David and Josephine looked at each other or touched, she wanted to kill herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way back to the hotel, Josephine said, \"She\u0027s in love with you, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Kate? No. We\u0027re friends. We have been since she was a baby. She liked you a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosephine smiled. Men are so naive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn David\u0027s office the following morning, Tim O\u0027Neil and David sat facing each other. \"I\u0027ll need about two months to get my affairs in order here,\" David said. \"I\u0027ve been thinking about the financing we\u0027ll need to begin with. If we go to one of the big companies, they\u0027ll swallow us up and give us a small share. It won\u0027t belong to us anymore. I think we should finance it ourselves. I figure it will cost eighty thousand dollars to get started. I\u0027ve saved the equivalent of about forty thousand dollars. We\u0027ll need forty thousand more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have ten thousand dollars,\" Tim O\u0027Neil said. \"And I have a brother who will loan me another five thousand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, we\u0027re twenty-five thousand dollars short,\" David said. \"We\u0027ll try to borrow that from a bank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll leave for San Francisco right away,\" O\u0027Neil told David, \"and get everything set up for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosephine and her father left for the United States two days later. \"Send them to Cape Town in the private railway car, David,\" Kate offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s very generous of you, Kate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning Josephine left, David felt as though a piece of his life had been taken away. He could not wait to join her in San Francisco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next few weeks were taken up with a search for a management team to back up Brad Rogers. A list of possible candidates was carefully drawn up, and Kate and David and Brad spent hours discussing each one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...Taylor is a good technician, but he\u0027s weak on management.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Simmons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s good, but he\u0027s not ready yet,\" Brad decided. \"Give him another five years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Babcock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a bad choice. Let\u0027s discuss him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Peterson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not enough of a company man,\" David said. \"He\u0027s too concerned with himself.\" And even as he said it, he felt a pang of guilt because he was deserting Kate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued on with the list of names. By the end of the month, they had narrowed the choice to four men to work with Brad Rogers. All of them were working abroad, and they were sent for so that they could be interviewed. The first two interviews went well. \"I\u0027d be satisfied with either one of them,\" Kate assured David and Brad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the morning the third interview was to take place, David walked into Kate\u0027s office, his face pale. \"Is my job still open?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate looked at his expression and stood up in alarm. \"What is it, David?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I - \" He sank into a chair. \"Something has happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate was out from behind the desk and by his side in an instant. \"Tell me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just got a letter from Tim O\u0027Neil. He\u0027s sold the business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what I said. He accepted an offer of two hundred thousand dollars and a royalty for his patent from the Three Star Meat Packing Company in Chicago.\" David\u0027s voice was filled with bitterness. \"The company would like to hire me to manage it for them. He regrets any inconvenience to me, but he couldn\u0027t turn down that kind of money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate looked at him intently. \"And Josephine? What does she say? She must be furious with her father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a letter from her, too. We\u0027ll marry as soon as I come to San Francisco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re not going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027m not going!\" David exploded. \"Before, I had something to offer. I could have built it into a great company. But they were in too much of a damned hurry for the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David, you\u0027re not being fair when you say \u0027they.\u0027 Just be - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"O\u0027Neil would never have made that deal without Josephine\u0027s approval.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I don\u0027t know what to say, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is nothing to say. Except that I almost made the biggest mistake of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate walked over to the desk and picked up the list of candidates. Slowly, she began to tear it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the weeks that followed, David plunged himself deeply into his work, trying to forget his bitterness and hurt. He received several letters from Josephine O\u0027Neil, and he threw them all away, unread. But he could not get her out of his mind. Kate, deeply aware of David\u0027s pain, let him know she was there if he needed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix months had passed since David received the letter from Tim O\u0027Neil. During that time, Kate and David continued to work closely together, travel together and be alone together much of the time. Kate tried to please him in every way she could. She dressed for him, planned things he would enjoy and went out of her way to make his life as happy as possible. As far as she could tell, it was having no effect at all. And finally she lost her patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and David were in Rio de Janeiro, checking on a new mineral find. They had had dinner at their hotel and were in Kate\u0027s room going over some figures late at night. Kate had changed to a comfortable kimono and slippers. When they finished, David stretched and said, \"Well, that\u0027s it for tonight. I guess I\u0027ll go on to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate said quietly, \"Isn\u0027t it time you came out of mourning, David?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her in surprise. \"Mourning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Josephine O\u0027Neil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s out of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then act like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just what would you like me to do, Kate?\" he asked curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate was angry now. Angry at David\u0027s blindness, angry about all the wasted time. \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027d like you to do - kiss me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bloody hell, David! I\u0027m your boss, damn it!\" She moved close to him. \"Kiss me.\" And she pressed her lips against his and put her arms around him. She felt him resist and start to draw back. And then slowly his arms circled her body, and he kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kate...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispered against his lips. \"I thought you\u0027d never ask...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were married six weeks later. It was the biggest wedding Klipdrift had ever seen or would see again. It was held in the town\u0027s largest church and afterward there was a reception in the town hall and everyone was invited. There were mountains of food and uncounted cases of beer and whiskey and champagne, and musicians played and the festivities lasted until dawn. When the sun came up, Kate and David slipped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go home and finish packing,\" Kate said. \"Pick me up in an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the pale dawn light, Kate entered the huge house alone and went upstairs to her bedroom. She walked over to a painting on the wall and pressed against the frame. The painting flew back, revealing a wall safe. She opened it and brought out a contract. It was for the purchase of the Three Star Meat Packing Company of Chicago by Kate McGregor. Next to it was a contract from the Three Star Meat Packing Company purchasing the rights to Tim O\u0027Neil\u0027s freezing process for two hundred thousand dollars. Kate hesitated a moment, then returned the papers to the safe and locked it. David belonged to her now. He had always belonged to her. And to Kruger-Brent, Ltd. Together, they would build it into the biggest, most powerful company in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Jamie and Margaret McGregor would have wanted it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/master-of-the-game/page-16.html","bookId":2358,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:36 AM"}
