He nodded at a house in the distance that had a few garbage cans knocked over in the front yard and a real estate sign. “That’s the one. It’s usually a stash house. Guess they’re stashing people there now too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around in his seat and looked at Camden. “What guns do you have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None. I had to drop mine back at the compound.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDerek jerked his head to the back of the car. “Come around back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamden put his hand on my shoulder and applied light pressure. “Stay here, Ellie. Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t promise him anything. I just watched as he got out of the car and went to the back. The trunk opened and Derek started going through the guns that the team had left behind before we went traversing through the jungle. I watched them with curiosity as Derek handed Camden a shiny new 9mm and picked up a sawed-off shotgun for himself, his eyes glinting feverishly at the weapon in his hands. Derek was in his element once again. I only hoped it was enough to get Gus out of there in one piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDerek and Camden both shot me one last look before they closed the trunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be right back,” Derek said. Then they ran off toward the house, their feet quiet on the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited a few moments, watching them as they split up and disappeared around the back of the house. In my emotional, drug-infused state there was something supremely romantic about the sight of Camden running off with a gun to save my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still couldn’t believe it. Gus was my father. I had to say it to myself again and again. It’s not that it didn’t feel true, it’s just I had a hard time wrapping my head around what family meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich, of course, is why I reached into the back and searched for a pistol until my hand closed around a .40 Glock. Gus and Camden were my family now and I had to protect them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the car door and climbed out, careful not to put any pressure on my bad leg, and limped swiftly and silently toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned at the neighbor’s yard and hid behind one of the lemon trees, peering around the trunk at the stash house. The lights in the house were all off and I couldn’t hear anything, not Camden or Derek, not Spanish. Just the sound of the breeze as it ruffled the leaves around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took in a deep but shaky breath. The pain in my leg was starting to flare up again and I needed to push past it. I looked up at the second story of the house. Climbing was out of the question. Almost everything was out of the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was until a light upstairs went on, streaming out the window between the cracks of a blackout curtain. In a stash house, its purpose wasn’t to keep out the sun, but to keep eyes from looking in. That’s where Gus had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could even formulate a plan or try and figure out how far Camden and Derek had gotten, voices rang out into the humid night air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpanish and English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe curtain at the window moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShots were fired, echoing down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all happening so fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped away from the tree, wincing at my leg, just as there was a terrific crash and a man fell from the window in a shower of glass and onto the lawn below, landing with a thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Gus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped, heart lodged at the back of my throat, and scampered over to him as quick as I could. Just before I reached him, I looked up at the window and saw a man with a gun pointed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot Camden. Not Derek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd therefore he had to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI aimed just as the man spotted me and fired three times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the bullets struck him in the chest, causing him to pitch back into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped to my good knee and rolled Gus over, holding my breath, holding onto every second that passed for fear of the next one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled onto his back. His eyes open. I hadn’t seen those eyes in years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked once. Twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooked at me, face scrunched up, all beard and grey hair and friendly eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gus!” I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to sit up and then looked past me, his expression of terror. “Ellie!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twisted at the waist, gun out and was about to shoot without even lining up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was lucky I didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have shot Camden who was running up the side of the house toward me, weaponless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe at least saw me and my gun clearly enough to drop to the ground and duck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving the man chasing him an easy target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Camden on the ground, I pulled the trigger and hit the man at the knees, bringing him down. He struggled, reaching for the gun that he dropped but I shot him in the head before he could even move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated how easy this had become for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Camden lifted his head and gave me an incredulous look that said it all. That took my soul from black to grey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promised to keep you safe, too,” I told him earnestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned back to Gus as Camden pulled me up to my feet. “Are you hurt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I’m hurt,” Gus said, grunting as Camden pulled him up next. “But I’ll live.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Derek?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamden shook his head. “I don’t know. We have to go back to the car, now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at the house and still heard yelling inside, the breaking of glass. There was still chaos. Still a fight and someone was losing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t leave him behind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellie,” Camden said, sharp enough to make my head snap to him. “We have Gus. We have each other. We can’t lose that. We have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. He was always right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took off running toward the Escalade, Camden supporting both me and Gus the best he could. Gus was bent over, the fall probably reopening the bullet wound in his stomach, wheezing for breath. It was so weird being with him now, knowing what he was to me. Did he know himself? I thought back to all our interactions over the years, the way he talked to me, kept in contact with me, watched over me. He must have known. All this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got Gus in the back and I climbed in the front, just as Camden got behind the wheel and started to peel away. We drove past the house, an explosion now blasting open the front door in mess of flames, and it wasn’t until we were zooming halfway down the street that Camden’s eyes went to the rear view mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I turned to look, he popped the SUV in reverse and we started speeding backward toward a man running toward us, hell bent, Tom Cruise style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDerek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamden screeched to a stop just before he collided into him and I leaned back to open the back door for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” he said as he jumped in beside Gus. His face was covered in a layer of soot, the gash on his face reopened and he smiled, widely, for the first time. “That was a rush.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamden shook his head and pressed his foot to the pedal. We roared away from the fire and destruction and though Gus was hurt and I’d been shot and Camden was missing his son, it felt good to have all three of them. They were my family. They were my home. And we were going to California.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER FIFTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ended saying goodbye to Derek in Acapulco. Even though we felt a camaraderie with him after everything we went through, he still wanted his money. All the money we had was still in checks that we hadn’t cashed yet, so we had to promise him an IOU through monthly PayPal installments. The funny part was that he trusted us to do so and I knew I would make good on my promise. Maybe I’d picked a lot of locks in the last few days, but the scamming days were truly gone for me. I had the second chance I asked for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we dropped him off (and after he bought us all clean clothes from a local Wal-Mart), we continued on with the Escalade to Zihuatanejo, a beach town that Gus had always wanted to go to because Morgan Freeman ended up there at the end of The Shawshank Redemption. I’d put fake plates on the Escalade back in Acapulco, knowing now that I could never ever be too careful again, though we planned to steal a new car once we were heading up to California. For now, we needed to catch our breaths and take stock in the fact that we were still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us were sitting on the patio of a restaurant that lined the silky sand beach, enjoying gigantic margaritas, when Camden got up to go to the washroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, Ellie,” Gus said, sitting back in his chair with controlled movement. In the end, his gunshot wound was healing nicely. For whatever reason, Javier hadn’t mistreated Gus. After he’d been shot by Raul and after Camden came running for me, Javier took Gus immediately to a doctor who removed the bullet and stitched him up. Then Gus was knocked up full of roofies (Javier’s drug of choice, it seemed) and the next thing he remembered was waking up in the stash house where he was guarded by three formidable men and two idiots (according to him). He wasn’t allowed to leave the bedroom upstairs and was tethered to the first half of the room by a chain around his leg, thus not allowing him to reach the windows. He was permitted bathroom breaks though, he could watch TV and he ate whatever food the rest of his captors ate. He was more comfortable than I thought he would have been, certainly more than my mother was. If that was the way Javier treated the people he captured, he had shown he wasn’t as much of an animal as Travis was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he’d shown he was an animal in so many other ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, Gus,” I said, pulling my shades on to my head so I could look him in the eye, even though the sun was setting, causing the ocean to refract in beams of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a smile that could only be described as shy. And Gus was not a shy man. Suddenly I realized why Camden had excused himself with a knowing look on his face. Gus and I had not discussed what I learned yet. But I had a feeling it was about to come up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made me feel as awkward as a child. I rubbed my hands on my linen pants and smiled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed at his beard and said, “I think you and I have something to … talk about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what your mother told you back at … back where you saw her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh god. Don’t tell me he wasn’t my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She said that I’m your dad,” he went on. He picked up a chip from the tortilla basket and started spinning it around on the tablecloth. “That we had an affair before you were born.” He looked up at me, his eyes sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh please no. Please don’t take this away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I loved your mother very much, Ellie,” Gus said. “I loved your father too. I never really understood how I could do that to my friend, but I did. And your mother stayed on my mind ever since. I was still allowed to see you from time to time. You remember me around. But I could never be your father. I hope I can be now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exhaled, smiling so wide that my face hurt. “You really are my father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was even a paternity test. Your father knew of course. He was a good man, Ellie, he really was. And I regret what I did but I don’t regret the consequences.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sound a lot like Camden, there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Camden is a good man too. That boy, he’s so in love with you that he can’t even see straight. I can’t even begin to tell you how hard he fought to get you back. He never gave up, even when he was knocked down. You were the most important thing in the world to him, you still are. I hope you can give your heart to him, I know how hard that is for you, to trust, to let go.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bold-tricks-the-artists-trilogy-3/page-30.html","bookId":2734,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:05 PM"}
