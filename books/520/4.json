I didn\u0027t quite make up the Judy though. \n\u003cbr\u003e That\u0027s what Freddy Perkins used to call me before he could\n\u003cbr\u003e talk plainly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I wish Mrs. Lippett would use a little more ingenuity about choosing\n\u003cbr\u003e babies\u0027 names. She gets the last names out of the telephone book--\n\u003cbr\u003e you\u0027ll find Abbott on the first page--and she picks the Christian\n\u003cbr\u003e names up anywhere; she got Jerusha from a tombstone. I\u0027ve always\n\u003cbr\u003e hated it; but I rather like Judy. It\u0027s such a silly name. \n\u003cbr\u003e It belongs to the kind of girl I\u0027m not--a sweet little blue-eyed thing,\n\u003cbr\u003e petted and spoiled by all the family, who romps her way through\n\u003cbr\u003e life without any cares. Wouldn\u0027t it be nice to be like that? \n\u003cbr\u003e Whatever faults I may have, no one can ever accuse me of having been\n\u003cbr\u003e spoiled by my family! But it\u0027s great fun to pretend I\u0027ve been. \n\u003cbr\u003e In the future please always address me as Judy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do you want to know something? I have three pairs of kid gloves. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve had kid mittens before from the Christmas tree, but never real\n\u003cbr\u003e kid gloves with five fingers. I take them out and try them on every\n\u003cbr\u003e little while. It\u0027s all I can do not to wear them to classes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e (Dinner bell.
