I didn’t know, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She nearly cut out my heart with her needle and thread when I told her you would be gone for an entire day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “Give her a raise. I like her style.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the house a few minutes later. I shifted to command the door to open, but Michael caught my wrist in his hand. His features tightened. “Eden,” he began. “You know I love you, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach instantly clenched. “What’s wrong?” I asked, my concern making the words sharper than I’d intended. He told me he loved me all the time, but there was something in his voice this time—something deep and filled with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” he said, turning away. “Nothing’s wrong. I just wanted to remind you how I feel about you, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Michael—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe emerged from the car without another word to me, leaving me mystified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill reeling from Michael’s words, I grabbed my bag and tugged Agent Luc from the car. We quickly stormed the house, leaving the heat of the afternoon behind us, along with the trees and birds and colorful flowers that encompassed the home. I had every intention of hunting my father down and demanding an explanation. I didn’t buy his “I just like to remind you” line. He liked to remind me, sure, but never with such stark pain in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I found him, however, the seamstress—Celeste—found me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgent Luc plopped protectively at my feet as Celeste bounded down the stairs, needle and thread in hand. “Where have you been?” she scolded. “I have eleven dresses and six pantsuits to finish, and yet you abandon me at the most pivotal part of my work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t need me here to finish.” Frowning, I hoisted the weight of my bag over my shoulder. “You have my measurements.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExasperation flittered over her pretty features, and she tossed her hands in the air. “Fine. You want the clothes to slip from your shoulders, tear when you run, and reveal your precious weapons, that’s fine with me. I will sew another’s name in the garments so no one knows they are my creation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great idea,” I said and turned toward the study where I knew Michael had gone. The doors were closed, most likely locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeleste screeched, the high-pitched sound echoing off the walls. “Go to your room and try on those clothes, Eden Black. Now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun and faced her. I opened my mouth to offer her a stinging retort, but noticed how her chest heaved, how her eyes gleamed. She was as passionate about her work as I was about mine. I respected that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you waiting for?” she prompted. “An engraved invitation from the Rakan king? Go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t a good time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed a breath from her pursed lips, and her shoulders drooped slightly. “There is never a good time with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cast one last glance toward the study door, then reluctantly leapt up the stairs with Agent Luc close to my heels. “Next time someone talks to me like that, you attack. Understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. Useless canine. Thankfully, the pinching and poking of my fitting only lasted an hour, and Celeste quite happily went on her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Agent Luc slept on the bed, I allowed myself a long, lingering shower, letting the steamy water wash away the trials of the last few days. Afterward, I brushed my hair and changed into comfortable lounge pants and a shirt, then strode into Michael’s office. He was absent, but two women were cleaning and dusting. I fought a wave of disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come back later,” I told the women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey nodded and hurried out. I reallydid need my own place, I realized. Somewhere private and all my own. Unlike Michael, I’d do my own damn laundry and cleaning. I didn’t like how freely he admitted his staff. Yes, he took precautions against theft and spying, but was that ever enough?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone, I logged onto the computer with a spoken “Eden F. Black.” I e-mailed Colin Foley, a quantum physics instructor I’d once dated, asking for information on solar flares and potential transportational properties. He might know nothing; he might know something. We’d ended our two-year relationship amicably, so I didn’t doubt he’d return my message. I stressed the importance of a speedy reply—which I hoped to receive before I left for New Dallas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stared at the screen, willing him to replynow, my eyes began to burn and water. I yawned. I’d been up the last two days and needed sleep. Pushing out a breath, I shut down the computer and left the comforting familiarity of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trudged up the stairs into my room and flopped onto the bed beside Agent Luc. Hopefully taking an hour or so to rest and center my energy would grant me a measure of peace and sanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and commanded every limb, cell, and organ to relax. Slowly my mind smoothed, beginning its gradual slide into calmness and tranquillity. In gentle increments, my chaotic thought patterns coalesced into a focused whole. The pulse of my heartbeat harmonized with the steady stream of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when I was congratulating myself on a job well done, an image of Lucius appeared, upsetting my equanimity. My heartbeat sped up and thumped eagerly; my blood heated. I bit my bottom lip and mentally shoved his picture out of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt slid right back to center, taunting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyelids fluttered open, and I shifted to my side. The dog opened her eyes, checking her surroundings. When she realized all was well, she closed her eyes again and continued slumbering peacefully—taking up half the bed. If only I could find such peace. Lucius, I decided in the next instant, was a disease. A stinking, festering disease that rotted my common sense and might very well be the death of me. I needed some sort of antidote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe battle to cast out the haunting presence of his image was in full force when my phone erupted in a series of beeps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI uttered a low growl and picked up the cell unit from the side table, anchoring the main piece to my ear. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss me?” A rough voice crackled over the other end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I miss you about as much as I miss the copper bullet I had to dig out of my stomach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucius laughed, the sound husky and rich as it washed over me. Neither of us commented on the fact that we didn’t have to state our names, that we’d only known each other a short time but already recognized each other’s voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love it when you play hard-to-get. Tell me how things are going,” he said with barely a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On schedule.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s this I hear about solar flares?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed, and I glared at the far wall. “When did you talk to Michael?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Answer me first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did, and my speech was followed by a long silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to investigate this,” he finally said. “Michael’s doing some research, but I think we need to do some on our own. The more the merrier, right?” He paused. “There’s got to be something to this flare shit. You did good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be validated by someone as stern and unbending as Lucius was intoxicating. “Thank you,” I said. I tried to keep the elation out of my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must have failed because he said, “You cryin’ tears of joy over there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks heated. “Shut the hell up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t bite my head off.” He laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which one?” I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Either.” Another pause reigned before he blew out a breath. “I like you more every time I talk to you, you know that, cookie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI faked a southern drawl (quite well, I might add). “Is that why you’re calling me, Agent Luscious? So you can like me more?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t call me that,” he snapped. “I had a spare minute and thought I’d check on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t Michael tell you how I was doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to hear it from you, all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” I said, and let the subject drop. I didn’t admit that I was glad he’d called, that I’d wanted to hear from him. “Let’s finish our conversation about the solar flares, and you telling me what a good job I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. “Just look into them. We can compare notes when you get here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyebrows winged up as a tide of anticipation hit me. “I bet I’ll have more information than you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled huskily. “My God,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you hear yourself? I’ll have more information than you,” he mimicked. “I doubt I’ve ever heard a more obvious challenge. You have got to be the most competitive woman in the entire world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now that’s hardly a fair statement. You haven’t met every woman in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doesn’t matter. I accept the challenge. We’ll just see who has more information.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned, invigorated. “So, how are things with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parker sympathizes with my obsession for you and plans to help me win you. He’s throwing a party and made sure your new boss received an invitation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that, I almost said, but thankfully stopped myself. He had no idea I’d listened and watched his interaction with Jonathan Parker, and I needed to keep it that way. “What exactly do you plan to do to win me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s keep that a surprise so your reaction is real. I wouldn’t worry except that your acting sucks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy grip on the unit box tightened, and I lost my grin. “I can act.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heaved a sigh. Fine. “What’s my apartment like?” I gritted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe offered no denial about the fact that he’d sneaked inside. “Looks good. Spacious. Well guarded. Expensive. You’ll have no trouble fitting in. And in case you were wondering, your bed is big enough for two people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s good to know. I’m sure Agent Luc will be glad we can both fit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.Dark, heavy silence that crackled with tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who the hell,” he said haltingly, “is Agent Luc?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A friend of mine.” I stroked a hand down the dog’s soft fur, and she snorted blissfully in her sleep. “Luc is helping me with the case.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did not have my permission to include this man in our mission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t correct his assumption that Luc was a male.How’s my acting now? “I don’t need your permission for anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it, Eden. Does Michael know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Are you going to run and complain to the boss?” I taunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a sharp grinding noise and pictured Lucius working his jaw. I smiled because I’d just ensured he wouldn’t ask Michael about Luc for any reason. Ah, male pride. So predictable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If this man steps one foot—one damn foot—inside your apartment, I’ll shove those feet so far up his ass he’ll vomit them out. Understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy smile grew wider. I couldn’t help myself. “Oh, I understand all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. “What’s that supposed to mean?” He no longer sounded angry. He sounded hesitant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your jealousy is cute, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe abrupt disconnection and sudden silence caused my ears to ring. My smile became a chuckle. I rolled to my back, letting the cell unit drop beside me. I even kissed Luc on her wet nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, the phone rang again. Still grinning, I picked up on the fourth ring. “Yes,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never make threats, Eden. Only promises. I didn’t want a partner, but I’ve resigned myself to you. I will not tolerate anyone else on this case.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t either, but I was not about to let this man think his threats—oopsie,promises —cowed me. I would not let him think he called the shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agent Luc and I will be there on schedule,” I said. With that,I severed the connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling more at peace than I would have after a ten-hour slumber, I affectionately scruffed Luc atop her shaggy brown head. She opened her eyes and stared up at me adoringly. “Better watch your paws, girl. Agent Luscious is a jealous man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the day arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretending to be an employee of Michael’s sent to check on his daughter’s accommodations, I flew into New Dallas. After a quick stop at Michael’s farmhouse, I visited my apartment. For the event, I dressed in a short, spiky black wig and wore a fake pregnancy belly under a synthetic cotton dress. My skin was heavily caked in makeup. I looked a sight, I’m sure, but I needed to map an escape route. Or two. I needed to know what to expect when I, as pampered Eden Black, arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, it was hot. Sweat dripped from me as I walked down the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blamed EenLi for the extreme heat and wouldn’t have doubted if he was one of the Mecs who could control the weather. They did like it hot and dry, but the boiling temperature nearly felled me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSituated in the bustling heart of New Dallas, the apartment building was enhanced chrome and bullet-resistant glass. Eighty-seven stories high. I stepped inside. Fingerprint scanners were at every door. Holographic guides. High-tech, just like Lucius had said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/enslave-me-sweetly-alien-huntress-2/page-14.html","bookId":1767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:54 AM"}
