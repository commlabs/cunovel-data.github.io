and, indeed, to walk through the church, grey and cool, with the hush that seems to belong only to buildings of stupendous age, is in itself a religious service.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Concha was passing across the nave, hat in hand, a gaunt, ill-clad, and somewhat pathetic figure, when he caught sight of Sir John Pleydell. \u0026nbsp;The Englishman paused involuntarily and looked at the Spaniard. \u0026nbsp;Concha bowed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘We met,’ he said, ‘for a moment in the garden of General Vincente’s house at Ronda.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘True,’ answered Sir John. \u0026nbsp;‘Are you leaving the Cathedral? \u0026nbsp;We might walk a little way together. \u0026nbsp;One cannot talk idly—here.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He paused and looked up at the great oak screen—at the towering masonry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘No,’ answered Concha gravely. \u0026nbsp;‘One cannot talk idly here.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Concha held back the great leathern portière, and the Englishman passed out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘This is a queer country, and you are a queer people,’ he said presently. \u0026nbsp;‘When I was at Ronda I met a certain number of persons—I can count them on my fingers. \u0026nbsp;General Vincente, his daughter, Se?ora Barenna, Se?orita Barenna, the Englishman Conyngham, yourself, Se?or Concha. \u0026nbsp;I arrived in Toledo yesterday morning;

older, more experienced, and probably no more scrupulous.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Yes,’ said the priest, ‘I can tell you that. \u0026nbsp;Larralde lodges in the house of a malcontent, one Lamberto, a scribbling journalist, who is hurt because the world takes him at its own valuation and not at his. \u0026nbsp;The house is next to the little synagogue in the Calle de Madrid, a small stationer’s shop, where one may buy the curse of this generation—pens and paper.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Thank you,’ said Sir John, civilly and simply. \u0026nbsp;This man has no doubt been ill-painted, but some may have seen that with different companions he wore a different manner. \u0026nbsp;He was, as all successful men are, an unconscious actor, and in entering into the personality of the companion of the moment he completely sank his own. \u0026nbsp;He never sought to be all things to all men, and yet he came near to the accomplishment of that hard task. \u0026nbsp;Sir John was not a sympathetic man; he merely mistook life for a court of justice, and arraigned all human nature in the witness-box, with the inward conviction that this should by rights be exchanged for the felon’s dock.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With Concha he was as simple, as direct, and as unsophisticated as the old priest himself, and now took his leave without attempting to disguise the fact that he had accomplished a foreset purpose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Without difficulty he found the small stationer’s shop next to the synagogue in the Calle de Madrid, and bade the stationer—a spectacled individual with upright hair and the air of seeking something in the world which is not usually behind a counter—take his card to Se?or Larralde. \u0026nbsp;At first the stationer pretended ignorance of the name, but on discovering that Sir John had not sufficient Spanish to conduct a conversation of intrigue, disappeared into a back room, whence emanated a villanous smell of cooking.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While Sir John waited in the little shop, Father Concha walked to the Plazuela de l’Iglesia Vieja, which small square, overhanging the Tagus and within reach of its murmuring voice, is deserted except at midday, when the boys play at bull-fighting and a few workmen engage in a grave game of bowls. \u0026nbsp;Concha sat, book in hand, opened honestly at the office of the day and hour, and read no word. \u0026nbsp;Instead, he stared across the gorge at the brown bank of land which commands the city and renders it useless as a fortress in the days of modern artillery. \u0026nbsp;He sat and stared grimly, and thought perhaps of those secret springs within the human heart that make one man successful and unhappy, while another, possessing brains and ability and energy, fails in life, yet is perhaps the happier of the two. \u0026nbsp;For it had happened to Father Concha, as it may happen to writer and reader at any moment, to meet one who in individuality bears a resemblance to that self which we never know and yet are ever conscious of.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sir John Pleydell, a few hundred yards away, obeyed the shopman’s invitation to step upstairs with something approaching alacrity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Larralde was seated at a table strewn with newspapers and soiled by cigarette ash. \u0026nbsp;He had the unkempt and pallid look of one who has not seen the sun or breathed fresh air for days. \u0026nbsp;For, as Concep?ion had said, this was a conspirator who preferred to lurk in friendly shelter while others played the bolder game at the front. \u0026nbsp;Larralde had, in fact, not stirred abroad for nearly a week.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Well, se?or,’ he said, with a false air of bravado. \u0026nbsp;‘How fares it with your little undertaking?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘That,’ replied Sir John, ‘is past—and paid for. \u0026nbsp;And I have another matter for your consideration. \u0026nbsp;Conyngham is not, after all, the man I seek.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sir John’s manner had changed. \u0026nbsp;He spoke as one having authority. \u0026nbsp;And Larralde shrugged his shoulders, remembering a past payment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Ah!’ he said, rolling a cigarette with a fine air of indifference.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘On the one hand,’ continued Sir John judicially, ‘I come to make you an offer which can only be beneficial to you;
