The scent of burning flesh wasn\u0027t helping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to catch a glimpse of whoever had shot Charlie and Mrs. Beasly, but I saw no one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon shadowed more than illuminated, and the graveyard was chock-full of tombs. Go figure. The shooter could be biding anywhere. However, if they had meant us harm, they wouldn\u0027t have stopped at two bullets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get out of here.\" Cassandra bent to snatch her knife out of the gravel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now she wants to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never wanted to come here in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored the comment, tugging me toward the rear of the burial ground. I hung back, peering longingly at the streetlights. \"What\u0027s wrong with the front door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those gunshots are going to bring cops, if not mugs.

I didn\u0027t want to explain why there were two flaming dead people in the middle of St Louis Cemetery Number One. I doubted I even could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, if the police found Cassandra here they\u0027d definitely think she\u0027d been stealing bodies, and then some. I needed her free and able to help me figure out what was going on, not locked up for body snatching and desecration of the dead. If they even locked people up for that anymore, although I kind of thought they did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led me past a huge monument, which I recognized from the film Easy Rider. Peter Fonda had climbed up to sit in the lap of an angel. I\u0027d thought the scene a bit sacrilegious even then. Now, in the silver-tinged night, I thought it more so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a sacred place, a haunted place, a place where the living did not belong, and I wanted out of here as fast as I could go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left the white stone monuments behind and stepped into a small rectangle filled with more traditional markers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Protestant section.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder it was so small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There.\" Cassandra pointed to a path that seemed to cut through someone\u0027s backyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shouldn\u0027t - \" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn exclamation from the front of the cemetery was followed by more voices and the patter of feet. Flashlight beams began to flicker round and round. I practically dived out of the city of the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra and I emerged onto Robertson Street, which divided St Louis Number One from St Louis Number\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo. From the guidebooks, I knew that where we were now was even rougher than where we\u0027d been. But after what I\u0027d just seen, I had a hard time caring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe cut down the side of the cemetery, headed for the lights, but when we reached Basin Street we turned in the opposite direction of the increasing number of police cars. A fire engine and an ambulance passed within minutes. They weren\u0027t going to be much help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think they were?\" Cassandra asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not zombies.

It\u0027s perfectly sane to see dead people with fangs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I wasn\u0027t even being sarcastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the same thing you did,\" I said. \"But I don\u0027t know what I saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explain it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead people rising, growing fangs, and acquiring superhuman strength. You do the math.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never been very good at math, but I could see where she was headed. \"Vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is New Orleans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keep saying that.

Hamilton.\" She shrugged \"I like vampire books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you call yourself a voodoo priestess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Voodoo and vampires, not the same thing,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll take your word for it\" I went silent as we made our way to Royal Street. \"What\u0027s the common thread in all of the books?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The undead live forever.

Then again, this was New Orleans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached Cassandra\u0027s shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any books?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the paranormal?\" She unlocked the door and flicked on the lights. \"I think I might\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed her across the shop, skirting the snake cage, even though Lazarus appeared fast asleep or dead. Considering his name, I doubted either one was a permanent condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra opened a glass-fronted case and pulled out one, two, three huge old volumes. Dust puffed as she set them on the counter.

A cross. Times a hundred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held the necklace in front of my nose. The links themselves were in the shape of tiny fleurs-de-lis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This should work even better in theory,\" she continued. \"The fleur-de-lis is the symbol of the \u0027Virgin Mary and, in some cases, the Trinity. Every little bit helps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, but in the end, I took the gift and put it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t go around your neck,\" Cassandra murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where else would it go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra reached out and lifted the thing over my head. \"Pull up your shirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax.

I decided on flattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you ever seen a belly chain?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With a belly like mine?

Pull up that shirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of draping jewelry across my gut, of accenting a part of me that did not need any accenting, went against everything I\u0027d learned as a big girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t I just wear it as a necklace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too easy to yank off. A protective amulet is supposed to be hidden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed so certain - and really, what did I know about protective amulets? - I gave in and tugged up my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra quickly secured the chain. The cool links slid across my skin. Looking down, I was surprised the jewelry wasn\u0027t tight, had in fact disappeared below the waistband of my jeans. Knowing it was there, I felt kind of sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said, and really meant it. \"What does fleur-de-lis mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rower of the lily. Represents perfection, light, and life. Christian symbolism again - always in threes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understandable. Do you have a computer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at my speedy change of subject. \"In back. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know if Mrs. Beasly was ever found. I also want to research the name on that tomb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra smiled. \"You are good at this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t so sure. I\u0027d never found anything I was searching for. But as dream Simon had told me, I needed to believe. After tonight, I believed, all right. I just wasn\u0027t sure in what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this time I wouldn\u0027t let anything escape my attention. I was going to find a paranormal entity - be it a loup-garou, a vampire, a zombie, or something I\u0027d never heard of - and expose it to the world. Maybe then Simon could rest Maybe then I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed Cassandra to her office. Huge, old, and slow, at least the computer worked. Arianna Beasly\u0027s name popped up in today\u0027s obituaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Heart attack after being bitten by a vicious dog,\u0027\" I read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure she was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her maiden name was Favreau, which explains where she was buried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Although it doesn\u0027t explain how she got dumped in the tomb so fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced up. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how they do things in your neck of the woods, but down here a funeral takes a few days. And that\u0027s if there are no suspicious circumstances to warrant the police or an autopsy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True.\" I frowned. \"Did you see any bite marks on her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As many as I saw on Charlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weird, but I guess that answers my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were bom killed in basically the same way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wound inflicted by a mystery canine,\" Cassandra murmured \"With said wound miraculously disappearing before the body rises and takes a little walk. So what does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as I know, you will.\" I picked up the books and headed for the mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t realize how much I wanted Adam to be waiting for me until I came through the door and discovered the place empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo not get used to him, Diana. You have to leave, and he doesn\u0027t want you to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a peanut butter sandwich and coffee - you\u0027d think the way I ate, I\u0027d waste away to nothing, but no such luck - then I settled onto my sleeping bag and began to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the events of the evening had worn me out, and I didn\u0027t get much done before I succumbed to sleep. As soon as I awoke, I spent the next day and well into the night researching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe books were antiques, worth a small fortune. They were also full of great stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crucifix, holy water, the Eucharist,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Christian items, which was fascinating considering the idea of night-flying, bloodsucking demons was not only pre-Christian but also a belief held around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did they protect themselves B.C.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight, salt, and -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Garlic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A member of the lily family.\" I fingered the fleur-de-lis chain at my waist, feeling better about it already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued to read, eating another peanut butter sandwich, drinking way too much coffee.
