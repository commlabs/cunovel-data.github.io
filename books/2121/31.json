Schuyler\u0027s eyes were red from crying, and she was blowing her nose with a tissue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your maid let me in. I hope that\u0027s okay. Are your parents around?\" Schuyler asked, still sniffing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They\u0027re at some campaign fund-raiser. What else is new. Come on in. Not that they\u0027d care anyway. You know they like you,\" Bliss said. As soon as she said it, Bliss realized she wasn\u0027t sure if it was true. Her parents had never shown any interest in her friends. They still assumed she hung out with Mimi Force. That\u0027s how clueless they were. They\u0027d never even met Schuyler or Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Bliss asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler shook her head. She followed Bliss into her bedroom and climbed onto her bed, leaning back on the pillows and closing her eyes. \"Oliver hates me,\" she said with a strangled cry as she rubbed her eyes. \"He saw...the...two of us...Jack and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows.\" Bliss nodded. So that\u0027s what Mimi was telling Oliver that afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer, Schuyler grabbed a fluffy pillow from among the huge goose-down heap and put it behind her neck. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss sighed. She picked up the television remote and started flipping through recorded programs. \"Did you see the latest episode of The Beach?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, put it on,\" Schuyler urged. The fabricated \"reality show\" about the lives of three vacuous and yet strangely fascinating blond girls from Los Angeles was their favorite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how\u0027d he find out?\" Bliss asked, keeping her eyes on the screen. Then she paused the action and turned to Schuyler. \"Although, I guess it doesn\u0027t matter. You know he would eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Schuyler said. \"I wish you wouldn\u0027t look at me that way. I know what you\u0027re thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss rubbed Schuyler\u0027s back. She was sympathetic, but Schuyler had known what she was doing when she hooked up with Jack. She\u0027d alienated a friend, and for what - Jack Force? What did she see in him anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I\u0027ve got to tell you something: Mimi and I visited Dylan today,\" Bliss said. She repeated everything the doctor had told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler was astonished and confused. \"So if it wasn\u0027t Dylan who killed Aggie and all those others - who was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does anyone else know about this? That he didn\u0027t do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other than Mimi and me? Yeah. Forsyth,\" Bliss said. She realized she somehow couldn\u0027t bring herself to call him \"Dad\" lately. \"Dr. Andrews said he\u0027d called him once the tests came in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But your dad didn\u0027t mention anything to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or to the Conclave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mimi said Forsyth didn\u0027t tell them about Dylan at all,\" Bliss said, feeling more and more embarrassed about her father\u0027s actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder why ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he did it to help me,\" Bliss said defensively. \"He knew the Conclave would want Dylan destroyed, so he hid him from them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Dylan\u0027s not a Silver Blood,\" Schuyler said. \"And he never was. So there was no threat that he would be destroyed. They performed the test, and he passed. Hey, what\u0027s with the suitcase?\" she asked, motioning to the half-packed Tumi rollers at the foot of Bliss\u0027s bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah, we\u0027re going away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rio. Forsyth said Nan Cutler called a major Conclave meeting, told them your grandfather needed help, and now everyone\u0027s going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of help?\" Schuyler demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey - don\u0027t worry,\" Bliss said, seeing the panicked expression on her friend\u0027s face. \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t heard from Lawrence in a long time,\" Schuyler admitted. \"I\u0027ve been so caught up with Jack I didn\u0027t even notice. What else did Forsyth say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss was reluctant to say, but decided Schuyler had a right to know. \"I\u0027m not one hundred percent sure, but it sounded like Lawrence was in some sort of trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could tell you. All I know is this morning Forsyth told us we were going to Rio. Conclave business.\" She pointed the remote control in the direction of the television screen and fast-forwarded through the commercials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe show came back on, and Bliss reached under her bed and handed Schuyler a bag of her favorite jalape§⭠potato chips. \"Anyway, don\u0027t worry about Ollie. He\u0027ll come around. You know he will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know about that. I really think he hates me, Bliss. He told me it was him or Jack. That I had to choose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\" Schuyler blinked back fresh tears. \"I can\u0027t choose. You know I can\u0027t.\" She tossed the empty bag and kicked at a pillow. \"Everything\u0027s rotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss kept one eye on the television and the other on her friend. She heartily agreed with Schuyler\u0027s assessment. Everything did feel rotten. Like how Forsyth had never been straight with her about Dylan. Sometimes it felt as if everyone was lying about everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes of watching the main star of the show break up with her boyfriend for the nth time, Schuyler spoke. \"You know, I haven\u0027t heard anything from Lawrence since he\u0027s been there, except that he wishes the weather were cooler. If he\u0027s truly in danger, don\u0027t you think he would have said something to me? Maybe sent me a message?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he doesn\u0027t want you to worry,\" Bliss said. \"He\u0027s probably just doing it to protect you. If there\u0027s something wrong with Corcovado, he did say he wanted to keep you away from it,\" she reminded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess.\" Schuyler played with a tassel on her pillow. \"But it feels weird, you know? I mean, Lawrence doesn\u0027t trust the Conclave with anything. Not since Plymouth,\" she said. \"Why would he call for them now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you thinking?\" Bliss asked. She noticed there was a purposeful look in Schuyler\u0027s eye. At least the girl had finally stopped crying about those boys. This was the Schuyler she knew and admired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going down there. If Lawrence is really in danger, I have to help him. I couldn\u0027t live with myself otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAUDIO RECORDINGS ARCHIVE:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepository of History\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCONDUIT: Hazard-Perry, Oliver\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePOSITION: Van Alen family\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal Report filed 5/19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e?Transcript notes two minutes of tape were lost in feedback. Transcript begins as follows:?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler will tell you that I had no choice in the matter. She believes that I love her because I have to, or because I had no choice, but she\u0027s wrong. She gives herself too much credit sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what we were doing, when we did the Caerimonia. I knew exactly what it meant. I knew what it would do. More importantly I knew she didn\u0027t feel the same about me. I\u0027ve known that for a very long time. Do you think I\u0027m stupid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why did I do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know. I wasn\u0027t going to. In my defense, I had told her no the first time. We were sitting there in that hotel room, and she was sitting on my lap, and it felt nice, you know. Being so close to her. Yeah, I guess it felt great. I don\u0027t want to get into it - I\u0027m not a suck-and-tell kind of guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thinks I\u0027ve been in love with her since we were kids, or since I first laid eyes on her, or some other romantic crap. But it wasn\u0027t like that. We were friends. We got along. I liked the way she thinks. Liked the sound of her laugh. Liked how she dressed-in all those dark layers. What was she hiding from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I think she was beautiful? I\u0027m not blind, am I? Of course I thought she was beautiful. But it was more than that - I liked that she used to wear this ugly shade of blue eyeshadow-girls think guys\u0026nbsp; don\u0027t notice stuff like makeup, but we do - and it would get all cakey and smudged at the end of the day. She would have these huge blue raccoon eyes, and she wouldn\u0027t even notice ... I don\u0027t know. I was charmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t feel that way about her back then. Not even in eighth grade when we had to go to the Sadie Hawkins dance together and she asked me to be her date, and we spent the evening sitting in a corner making fun of everyone. We didn\u0027t dance once, and she wore this hideous, baggy dress. No, I wasn\u0027t in love with her then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell in love with her when she found out she was a vampire. Just a few months ago. When she accepted her heritage and didn\u0027t flinch from her destiny. Because you know who she\u0027s supposed to be, right? I mean, Gabrielle\u0027s daughter. Heavy stuff. She\u0027s so strong it scares me. I wasn\u0027t lying when I told her that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, yeah - again, you\u0027re asking me why I did it. Why I let her take my blood, let her mark me as her own. Do that whole \"familiar\" thing. All that jazz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t even know why I bother with these reports. Who\u0027s listening to them, anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I guess the truth of the matter was, I didn\u0027t want her to have to do it with someone else. I didn\u0027t want to share. She was already so different from me, changing already. She is different. She\u0027s going to live forever, while I\u0027m only going to get to go around once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to hold on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause yeah, I do love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved her when she came to me that night at The Bank. When she was looking for me and was so relieved to see me. When she accepted everything I told her, and she didn\u0027t even freak out that much when I told her I already knew. That I was her Conduit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s why I took the next plane out of the city to Rio after hers. Yeah, Bliss told me what was going on. Do you think I would let her go there alone? You\u0027re kidding, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you think I walked into this blind, you\u0027re wrong. I knew being her familiar wouldn\u0027t change anything. I knew that even if she knew I was in love with her, it wouldn\u0027t change how she felt about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I would lose in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do I think of Jack Force? I don\u0027t. I don\u0027t think much of him. Just another guy who thinks he\u0027s God\u0027s gift to Earth. In his case, probably literally. But, you know - he\u0027s irrelevant to me. He just doesn\u0027t factor in. Even if they end up together, which I highly doubt given the strength of that particular bond -\u0026nbsp; Mimi is no joke, I wouldn\u0027t mess around with Azrael - but even if Schuyler still loves him, or thinks she does, it doesn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Jack is going to leave her one day. I know he will. He\u0027s too much for Schuyler. They\u0027re wrong for each other. Anyone can see that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when he leaves her, I\u0027ll be there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever long it takes, I\u0027ll still be there for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I guess Schuyler\u0027s wrong. I guess I\u0027m a pretty romantic guy after all. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-31.html","bookId":2121,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM"}
