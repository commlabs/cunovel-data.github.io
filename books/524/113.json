{"id":21364,"no":113,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"About three years later Sir Ralph Bardon died. He died of typhus caught on one of Reuben\u0027s insanitary cottages, where he had been nursing a sick boy. The village was inclined to look upon him as a martyr and Reuben as his murderer, but Reuben himself preserved a contemptuous attitude. \"If I\u0027d wanted anything as much as he wanted them houses o\u0027 mine, I\u0027m hemmed if I wudn\u0027t have had \u0027em,\" he said, \"and all he could do wur to die of \u0027em\"—and he spat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sir Ralph had never married and there was no direct heir; Anne was about as likely to produce offspring as a Latin grammar, and the property went to a distant cousin, Eustace Fleet. The very name of Bardon was now extinct. For two hundred years it had been coupled with Flightshot and Whig politics and the idea of a gentleman, till the last had finally been the downfall of the other two. The race of Bardon had died of its own virtues.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben\u0027s hopes of the Fair-place now revived, and he at once approached the new Squire with a view to purchase; but Sir Eustace turned out to be quite as wrong-headed as Sir Ralph on the matter of popular rights.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course I know the Fair has no legal title to this ground, but one must respect public feeling. I will sell you the forty acres adjoining the crest with pleasure, Mr. Backfield, they are no use to me, and you certainly seem to do wonders with the land when you get it—but[Pg 396] the Place itself must be preserved for the people. I\u0027m sure you understand.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben didn\u0027t, nor pretended that he did.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He started licking his forty acres into shape, with many inward vows that he would have the rest of them soon, he was hemmed if he didn\u0027t. He was on the high ground now, he could throw a stone into the clump of firs which still mocked his endeavours. The soil was all hard and flinty, matted with heather roots and the fibres of gorse. Reuben\u0027s men grumbled and cursed as the earth crumbled and rattled against their spades, which sometimes broke on the big flints and bits of limestone. They scoffed incredulously when old Beatup told them that the lower pastures and the Totease oatfields had once been like this.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Boarzell was almost unrecognisable now. When one climbed the Forstal Hill behind Peasmarsh and looked southward, one no longer saw a great roughness of Moor couching like something wild and untrapped in the midst of the tame fields and domestic cottages. The fields had licked up its sides till all they had left was the brown and golden crest with its central clump of firs. Behind this to the north was the Grandturzel inclosure, but Reuben\u0027s land was nibbling round the edge of it, and everyone knew that Grandturzel would not be able to hold out much longer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Opinion in Peasmarsh was divided. There was a general grudging admiration of the man who seemed able, in defiance of the Scriptures, to make Leviathan his servant. No one could deny that Backfield had performed a job which the neighbourhood from the first had declared to be impossible. He was disliked—not because anyone particularly envied him the land he bought so eagerly and so strenuously shaped, but because of his utter disregard of what other men prized and his willingness to sacrifice it for the sake of what they did not prize at all. He was a living insult to their[Pg 397] hearths, their homes, their wives, their children, their harmless recreations, the delights of their flesh, all those things which he had so readily set aside to win his great ambition. It was not for what he wanted that they hated him so much as for the things he did not want.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e However, everyone viewed with dislike and suspicion his covetous eye cast on the Fair-place. He might have the rest of Boarzell and welcome, for no other man had any use for flints, but the Fair was sacred to them through the generations, and they gauged his sacrilegious desire to rob them of it for his own ends. He might have the Grandturzel inclosure, though all the village sympathised with the beaten Realf—beaten, they said, because he hadn\u0027t it in him to be as hard-hearted as the old Gorilla, and sacrifice his wife and children to his farm—but they would far rather see Grandturzel swallowed up than Boarzell Fair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When his failure to buy the crest became known there were great rejoicings throughout Peasmarsh. The Fair that year was more than usually crowded, and the merriment was increased by the sight of Reuben stalking among the booths, and glaring at them as if he wished them all at blazes.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59485.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:30 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:30 PM"}
