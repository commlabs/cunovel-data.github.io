Lucky for you he doesn\u0027t take offense.\" Laura chuckled, well aware of her friend\u0027s opinion about using one\u0027s education and abilities. \"When will Jonas and your father be back from their business trip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any day now.\" Verity drummed her fingers on the edge of the pool and ignored the unspoken questions in Laura\u0027s eyes. She could hardly explain that Emerson and Jonas had gone off to Mexico to rescue an old, highly disreputable family friend who had gotten himself kidnapped. Such friends did not reflect well on the family. She had told Laura that Jonas was simply helping Emerson settle a private business matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure how long the Warwicks will wait around for him,\" Laura said dubiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the Warwicks have a legitimate job for Jonas, I don\u0027t want to put them off by telling them I don\u0027t know when he\u0027ll be back. If the deal looks good, I\u0027ll have to find a way to keep them here. Why don\u0027t you send them over at lunchtime tomorrow, Laura. Tell them I\u0027m in charge of booking Jonas\u0027s business arrangements or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura tilted her head. \"Are you in charge of booking Jonas\u0027s business arrangements?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity brightened. \"As a matter of fact, I just appointed myself his business manager. Don\u0027t look at me like that, Laura. Nobody else is stepping forward to handle the job, least of all Jonas. Looks like it\u0027s up to me.\" She frowned intently, thinking quickly. \"You know, with a little publicity work, this sort of thing could turn into a very lucrative sideline for Jonas. I know I\u0027ll never persuade him to go back to the academic world, but he could still use his abilities as a consultant for people like the Warwicks. Hey, that\u0027s it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll call Jonas a consultant. An historical consultant. How does that sound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see the wheels turning in your head.\" Laura stood up. \"Okay, I\u0027ll send \u0027em over tomorrow for lunch. I just hope Jonas doesn\u0027t have any objections when he gets home and finds out you\u0027ve been booking \u0027consulting\u0027 assignments for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll handle Jonas,\" Verity said with more assurance than she felt. \"He\u0027ll just have to understand that I\u0027m doing this for his own good. He\u0027s got far too fine a mind to be a dishwasher all his life. One day he\u0027ll thank me for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I were you, I\u0027d think twice about forcing upward mobility on a perfectly good dishwasher-waiter-handyperson. It\u0027s hard to find reliable help these days. But far be it from me to spoil your fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura grinned. \"Don\u0027t play innocent with me. You and Jonas seem to understand each other perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou give orders, lecture him on self-improvement, and generally bully him until he\u0027s had enough. Then he puts his foot down and carries you off to bed just like he did last week. Clement, the bartender, and everyone else had a good laugh after you two left. Your father howled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity\u0027s cheeks turned bright pink. She remembered the incident clearly. \"That was so embarrassing. I could have killed Jonas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had all started when she had begun to nag Jonas about doing another journal article. Having just received the twenty copies she had ordered of the Journal of Renaissance Studies, Verity had decided she was on a roll. Convinced that important doors were opening for Jonas, she had pushed her luck—and Jonas—one step too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas had tolerated her enthusiastic lectures all afternoon and into the evening. It wasn\u0027t until late that night, when they were having a nightcap with Laura and Rick in the resort\u0027s cocktail lounge, that he had finally lost his patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d listened to one more tirade on the importance of writing another article while he was still a hot literary property. Then he had taken Verity\u0027s glass of juice out of her hand, picked her up, and carried her all the way back to the cabin in that humiliating position. Then he\u0027d made love to her until Verity had temporarily forgotten all about journal articles and self-improvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might have been embarrassing for you,\" Laura said, smiling, \"but it certainly provided memorable entertainment for everyone in the lounge. Quite a show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose side are you on, anyway?\" Verity glowered at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe amusement faded from Laura\u0027s eyes. \"I\u0027m on your side,\" she said with unexpected seriousness. \"You know that, don\u0027t you? We\u0027re friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity smiled ruefully. \"I know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And speaking as your friend… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity tilted her head. \"Yeah, friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure how to ask this, so I\u0027ll come right out with it. Is anything wrong, Verity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity stiffened. \"Wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know. As in \u0027not quite right\u0027? There\u0027s something a little different about you lately. As if you\u0027ve got something on your mind. I just wondered if you\u0027ve got problems. If so, you know you can tell sister Laura all about them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity swept her hands back and forth just under the surface of the crystal-clear water. Small waves rippled out to the sides of the pool. \"I know, Laura. And thanks. But nothing\u0027s wrong. Really. I\u0027ve just been doing some thinking lately, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thinking about Jonas and the future?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s about time. When are you going to marry the man, Verity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity\u0027s head came up with a snap. \"I haven\u0027t been asked,\" she replied tartly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since when does Verity Ames wait around for someone else, least of all a man, to make a major decision in her life?\" Laura\u0027s mouth curved upward. \"You don\u0027t fool me one bit. If you wanted to marry Jonas, you\u0027d find a way to nag him into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you yourself have pointed out, Jonas can only be nagged so far,\" Verity retorted dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. But somehow I don\u0027t think he\u0027d fight too hard if you tied him up and dragged him to the altar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly a romantic image.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No smart woman lets romantic illusions get in the way once she\u0027s decided what she wants. And you\u0027re one smart woman, Verity. Ergo, I have to assume you haven\u0027t made up your mind about Jonas Quarrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we\u0027re back to my original question. What\u0027s wrong, pal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity thought about the pregnancy-test kit she had surreptitiously examined and then put back on the shelf at the local pharmacy that afternoon. Then she remembered how casually Jonas had left for Mexico, carrying only a few changes of underwear and a wicked-looking knife that he knew how to use quite well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s wrong, Laura. I\u0027ve just been feeling a little depressed lately. I think I need a vacation.\" She took one hand out of the water and picked up a glossy brochure. Water dripped on the photograph of the beachfront hotel. \"Hawaii sounds nice.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-7.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
