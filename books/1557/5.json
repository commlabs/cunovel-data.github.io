It came out and when it did, he longed for the deep freeze to return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone. He turned it over in his hand, studying it as if he\u0027d never seen it before. The screen, he reminded himself, was small. The images were jerky. The tint and color were off. The glare had also been a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded to himself. Keep going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia was not a platinum blonde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. More, more...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew her. He loved her. He was not the best catch. He was an ex-con with few bright prospects. He had a tendency to withdraw emotionally. He did not love or trust easily. Olivia, on the other hand, had it all. She was beautiful. She was smart, had graduated summa cum laude from the University of Virginia. She even had some money her father left her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t helping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Yes, it was because, despite all that, Olivia had still chosen him- the ex-con with zero prospects. She had been the first woman he\u0027d told about his past. No other had hung around long enough for it to become an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer reaction?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it hadn\u0027t been all flowers. Olivia\u0027s smile- that drop-you-to-your-knees pow- had dimmed for a moment. Matt wanted to stop right there. He wanted to walk away because there was no way he could handle being responsible for dimming, even for a brief moment, that smile. But the flicker hadn\u0027t lasted long. The beam soon returned to full wattage. Matt had bitten down on his lip in relief. Olivia had reached across the table and taken his hand and, in a sense, had never let it go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, as Matt sat here, he remembered those first tentative steps when he left the prison, the careful ones he took when he blinked his eyes and stepped through the gate, that feeling- that feeling that has never totally left him- that the thin ice beneath him could crack at any time and plunge him into the freezing water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow does he explain what he just saw?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt understood human nature. Check that. He understood subhuman nature. He had seen the Fates curse him and his family enough to come up with an explanation or, if you will, an anti-explanation for all that goes wrong: In sum, there is no explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world is neither cruel nor joyous. It is simply random, full of particles hurtling, chemicals mixing and reacting. There is no real order. There is no preordained cursing of the evil and protecting of the righteous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChaos, baby. It\u0027s all about chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the swirl of all that chaos, Matt had only one thing- Olivia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as he sat in his office, eyes still on that phone, his mind wouldn\u0027t let it go. Now, right now, at this very second... what was Olivia doing in that hotel room?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and sought a way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it wasn\u0027t her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain: the screen, it was small. The video, it was jerky. Matt kept going with that, running similar rationalizations up the flagpole, hoping one would fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sinking feeling in his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImages flooded in. Matt tried to battle them, but they were overwhelming. The guy\u0027s blue-black hair. That damned knowing smirk. He thought about the way Olivia would lean back when they made love, biting her lower lip, her eyes half closed, the tendons in her neck growing taut. He imagined sounds too. Small groans at first. Then cries of ecstasy...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up and found Rolanda still staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was there something you wanted?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been standing here so long, I forget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolanda shrugged, spun, left the office. She did not close the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt stood and moved to the window. He looked down at a photograph of Bernie\u0027s sons in full soccer gear. Bernie and Marsha had used this picture for their Christmas card three years ago. The frame was one of those faux bronze numbers you get at Rite-Aid or a similar drugstore-cum-frame store. In the photograph Bernie\u0027s boys, Paul and Ethan, were five and three and smiled like it. They didn\u0027t smile like that anymore. They were good kids, well-adjusted and all, but there was still an inescapable, underlying sadness. When you looked closely, the smiles were more cautious now, a wince in the eye, a fear of what else might be taken from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what to do now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe obvious, he decided. Call Olivia back. See what\u0027s what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded rational on one level and ridiculous on another. What did he really think would happen here? Would the first sound he heard be his wife breathing heavily, a man\u0027s laughter in the background? Or did he think Olivia would answer with her usual sunny voice and then- what?- he\u0027d say, \"Hi, hon, say, what\u0027s up with the motel?\"- in his mind\u0027s eye it was no longer a hotel room, but now a dingy no-tell motel, changing the h to an m adding a whole new significance-\"and the platinum wig and the smirking guy with the blue-black hair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat didn\u0027t sound right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was letting his imagination run away with him. There was a logical explanation for all this. Maybe he couldn\u0027t see it yet, but that didn\u0027t mean it wasn\u0027t there. Matt remembered watching those TV specials about how magicians did their tricks. You watched the trick and you couldn\u0027t fathom the answer and once they showed it to you, you wondered how you could have been so stupid to miss it the first time. That was what this was like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing no other option, Matt decided to call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia\u0027s cell was programmed into his speed dial in the number one spot. He pressed down on the button and held it. The phone began to ring. He stared out the window and saw the city of Newark. His feelings for this city were, as always, mixed. You see the potential, the vibrancy, but mostly you see the decay and shake your head. For some reason he flashed back to the day Duff had visited him in prison. Duff had started bawling, his face red, looking so like a child. Matt could only watch. There was nothing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang six times before going into Olivia\u0027s voice mail. The sound of his wife\u0027s animated voice, so familiar, so... his, made his heart stutter. He waited patiently for Olivia to finish. Then the beep sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, it\u0027s me,\" he said. He could hear the tautness in his tone and fought against it. \"Could you give me a call when you have a second?\" He paused. He usually ended with a perfunctory \"love you,\" but this time he hit the end button without adding what had always come so naturally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept looking out the window. In prison what eventually got to him was not the brutality or the repulsion. Just the opposite. It was when those things became the norm. After a while Matt started to like his brothers in the Aryan Nation- actually enjoyed their company. It was a perverse offshoot of the Stockholm syndrome. Survival is the thing. The mind will twist to survive. Anything can become normal. That was what made Matt pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about Olivia\u0027s laugh. How it took him away from all that. He wondered now if that laugh was real or just another cruel mirage, something to mock him with kindness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Matt did something truly strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the camera phone out in front of him, arm\u0027s distance, and snapped a picture of himself. He didn\u0027t smile. He just looked into the lens. The photograph was on the little screen now. He looked at his own face and was not sure what he saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed her phone number and sent the picture to Olivia. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-innocent/page-5.html","bookId":1557,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:54 PM"}
