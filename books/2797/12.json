He still wasn\u0027t certain what the name should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had begun to feel that it should not be a name referring to any ingredients or to any body mechanics: no licking or chewing or munching references. No. It needed something unusual—something sweet—as a name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was actually thinking about naming the new candy bar after his child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs in the mansion, Baby Ruth was playing, as she often did, in the front hall. She had just learned to walk. Still unsteady on her chubby legs, she toddled across the Oriental rug, trying to catch the cats, who twitched their tails mischievously to tease her but were adept at leaping just out of her reach as she approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twins were playing a game of checkers in the parlor, and Tim was industriously putting together a model airplane out of balsa wood, being very careful not to sniff the glue. In the kitchen Jane was helping Nanny frost some cupcakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Melanoff came down from the laboratory to announce the final perfection of the candy he\u0027d been working on now for a month. He had a proud look, thinking of his candy; and when he stood on the lowest landing of the elegant staircase and saw his family busy with their happy enterprises, his look became fond, as well. Such a short time ago he had been a grieving, miserable, and messy—yes, he had to admit, messy—man who thought there was nothing left to look forward to. Now there were delicious odors wafting in from the kitchen. There were five children in residence who were old-fashioned, well behaved, clean, healthy, and bright. Twilight streamed in through the high windows, and the windows were clean and well polished. The floors gleamed with wax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Melanoff looked around and smiled with pride and satisfaction. The only thing within his sight that was slightly jarring—a little off-putting, a wee bit out of order—was the huge stack of crumpled and yellowing papers against the wall. It had been there so long that the cats no longer batted at it, and Baby Ruth had outgrown her interest in it now that she could walk and had other things to examine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the commander noticed it now, and thought briefly about what it represented of his sad past. He considered what he should do. Then he cleared his throat loudly, as if preparing to make an announcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked up, even the cats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanny emerged from the kitchen with a spatula in one hand and Jane by her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve made a decision,\" Commander Melanoff announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve chosen a name for the candy?\" asked Tim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander shook his head. \"Oh, that. Yes, I think so. But that is not the topic of my decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarnaby A surreptitiously made his move on the checkerboard, took one of his brother\u0027s men, and kinged himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dinner\u0027s almost ready. Chicken,\" Nanny pointed out. \"Not to rush you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be brief,\" the commander replied. \"Gather round, everyone. Nanny. Baby Ruth. Willoughbys: Tim, A, B, and Jane.\" (He had become accustomed to the names A and B, but he thought again, as he often had, that there was something puzzlingly familiar about the name Willoughby.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at all of them from the stairs when they had gathered curiously to hear his announcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This house,\" he began, \"has changed greatly in the past months. All because of you. Each one of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby Ruth, of course, who appeared so mysteriously and soothed my grief.\" The toddler, recognizing her name, grinned and giggled. \"One day, quite soon, a fabulous candy bar will be named for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tim.\" The commander looked at the boy fondly. \"What can I say about a fine old-fashioned lad? Of course we all lament the regrettable and mysterious loss of your parents. But in the true spirit of orphanhood you have pulled yourself up by your bootstraps, and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are bootstraps, exactly?\" whispered Jane loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh,\" Tim told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander continued.\"—and one day in the future, I will send you to law school and you shall become \u0027of counsel\u0027 to Melanoff Industries\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A and B?\" Commander Melanoff looked benignly at the twins. It was a Tuesday, and Barnaby B was wearing the sweater. The overlong sleeves had made it difficult to move his checkers on the board. But the twins were accustomed to that obstacle. Tomorrow Barnaby A would wear the sweater and the handicap would be reversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I say about these lovely boys? They remind me of—\" He sniffed and wiped his eyes. \"They are the age that—\" He dabbed again with his hanky. \"Well. I won\u0027t dwell on my own tragedy. I will only say that one day, when you come of age, I will select names for you so that you will no longer be labeled inadequately by letters. I will—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have names,\" the twins said, in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh,\" Tim told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And dear Jane,\" the commander went on. \"Such an adorable, self-assured little girl, who—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hungry,\" Jane said loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh,\" Tim told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander blew Jane a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finally, dear Nanny.\" Commander Melanoff fixed his eyes on Nanny with a lovesick gaze. \"She has made my house a home. Once it was filthy; now it is clean. Once it was cold; now it is warm. Once it was quiet; now it rejoices. Once—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander,\" said Nanny in her no-nonsense voice, \"it\u0027s not just chicken. It is chicken breasts cooked in a lemon-and-caper sauce, and it is congealing and will soon be inedible. Could we hurry this speech along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander chuckled. \"I\u0027m sorry. I do meander, conversationally. And all of this speechmaking was just preliminary to my announcement. We\u0027ll go and eat our dinner right away. The announcement was simply that I have decided to do away with The Stack!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured dramatically toward the immense pile of unopened letters and telegrams from Switzerland. \"After dinner—is there dessert, by the way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanny nodded. \"Crème caramel,\" she told him, \"if it hasn\u0027t burned to a crisp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After dessert,\" he went on, \"we will make a fire in the fireplace and we will burn The Stack, little by little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we open everything first?\" asked Tim. \"It would take forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need,\" Commander Melanoff said. \"It is simply repetitions of terrible news. I stopped opening them after the first year and a half. We will burn them unopened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey began to move toward the dining room, where the table was set for dinner. Nanny picked up Baby Ruth and carried her to her mahogany high-chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right,\" Jane said sweetly from her seat as she unfolded her linen napkin and laid it tidily on the lap of her ruffled frock. \"I opened a lot of them. They were very boring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you, dear?\" Nanny placed the platter of chicken in front of Commander Melanoff. \"Were you practicing your reading, like a good girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane nodded. \"Yes. But it was just \u0027when are you coming to get us, when are you coming to get us\u0027 over and over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was supposed to come get who?\"Tim asked. He began to pass the plates, each with its serving of chicken, around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whom, dear,\" Nanny reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Melanoff drizzled some of the lemon-and-caper sauce on his chicken. He tasted a bit and closed his eyes in delight. \"Yummy, Nanny,\" he said. \"As always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was supposed to come get whom, Jane?\" Tim asked again, grammatically correct this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. She never said. And then the next year, she was angry. The letters kept saying, \u0027I never liked you anyway, you old goat. You never picked up your dirty socks.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old goat is not a very pleasant phrase,\" Nanny told her. \"Let\u0027s never use it ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you pass me some of that broccoli, A?\" Commander Melanoff said politely. \"Help yourself first\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said worse than \u0027old goat,\u0027\" Jane pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did, dear?\" the commander asked. \"Have you tried the broccoli? There\u0027s a smidgen of grated cheese on it, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know who. She didn\u0027t ever say her name.\" Jane tasted the broccoli. \"But that last letter, the one that came last month, the one you put on the very tippy-top of the stack? That one had a bad word in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Melanoff sighed. \"Those rescuers. It must have become so frustrating for them over the years. I should have told them to stop digging long ago. I\u0027m sorry they used a bad word, Jane. Let\u0027s never think about it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t a they,\" Jane told him. \"It was a she. May I say the bad word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just once, and very softly.\" Nanny gave her permission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hush fell over the table as everyone waited for Jane, sweet Jane, to say a bad word. Jane scrunched up her face, remembering the letter exactly. Then she recited softly what she had read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027You old fart, your son is just like you; he never picks up after himself. My new husband and I have sent him off to make his own way in the world. Good riddance to you both.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane glanced at Nanny. \"Riddance is a very bad word and I won\u0027t ever say it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no one heard Jane. They heard only the crashing sound of Commander Melanoff\u0027s chair tipping over as he leaped to his feet, dashed to the hall, and began pawing through the stack of mail. They could hear him sobbing loudly and repeating the words \"My son! My son!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, still sitting there stunned by the turn of events, they heard the shrill ring of the doorbell. Nanny rose abruptly and ran forward, and all of the children followed except Baby Ruth, who, confined to her highchair, banged her spoon happily and chortled when the two cats jumped onto the table and began eating the chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell whoever it is to go away,\" sobbed Commander Melanoff. He was kneeling on the floor surrounded by envelopes, which he was tearing open one by one as he wept. \"I can\u0027t face anyone now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNanny opened the door politely, prepared to follow his instructions. But she stepped back, startled, at the sight of a young boy, shivering in the chilly evening. His hair was uncut, shaggy, and down to his shoulders. His face was dirty. He was thin and unkempt, wearing an odd pair of short leather pants that were ragged and grease stained. His exposed knees were scraped and bruised, and his woolen socks were torn and sagging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Peter the goat-herd,\" murmured Tim in astonishment, \"right out of Heidi! We can teach him to read and write, and then we\u0027ll all smile and hug and say religious things!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh,\" Nanny scolded him. She stood aside and allowed the bedraggled boy to enter. He looked around at each of them in turn with no sign of recognition. But his face changed when he caught sight of the heavy man in the tweed jacket who was kneeling and weeping on the hall floor. His eyes lit up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Papa!\" he said. \"I\u0027ve come home!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpilogue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, what is there to say at the happy conclusion of an old-fashioned story?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are details to be filled in and explained, of course, and reference made to future events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did Commander Melanoff\u0027s young son make his way halfway around the world, with only a silly feathered hat full of Swiss francs and no passport or other official documents? Well, he was an old-fashioned, enterprising lad. In Rotterdam, one of the major seaports of Europe, he stowed away on a vessel heading across the Atlantic with its cargo. He was discovered, of course, and put to work as a cabin boy: badly treated, overworked, never paid, and his clean underwear was stolen by brigands in the Azores. But he made it to his destination and was the better for it, having overcome hardships so successfully. He would go on eventually to become the president of his father\u0027s company and to maintain its reputation for the finest of confectionaries. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-willoughbys/page-12.html","bookId":2797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:14 PM"}
