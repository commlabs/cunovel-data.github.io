We need a firm idea of how we are going to push those Trollocs out of Caemlyn so we can fight them on even ground\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours later, Elayne stepped from the pavilion, her mind spinning with details of tactics, supply needs and troop placements. When she blinked, she could see maps in her mind’s eye, covered with Gareth Bryne’s cramped notations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others from the meeting began trailing away to their separate camps to begin executing their battle plans. The dimming sky had required lanterns to be set up around the pavilion. She vaguely remembered both lunch and dinner being brought to the meeting. She’d eaten, hadn’t she? There had simply been so much to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded to those rulers who passed her, giving farewells. Most of the initial planning details had been worked out. On the morrow, Elayne would take her troops to Andor and begin the first leg of the counterattack against the Shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground here was now soft and springy with deep green grass. Rand’s influence lingered, though he had departed. As Elayne inspected those towering trees, Gareth Bryne stepped up beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, surprised he hadn’t left the pavilion already. The only ones still here now were the servants and Elayne’s guards. \"Lord Bryne?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to say that I’m proud\", Bryne told her softly. \"You did well in there\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had hardly anything to add\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You added leadership\", Bryne said. \"You aren’t a general, Elayne, and nobody expects you to be one. But when Tenobia complained about Saldaea being left exposed, you were the one who diverted her back to what matters. Tensions are high, but you kept us together, smoothed over bad feelings, prevented us from snapping at one another. Good work, Your Majesty. Very good work\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. Light, but it was hard not to positively beam at his words. He wasn’t her father, but in many ways, he was as close to one as she had. \"Thank you. And Bryne, the crown apologizes for—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a word of that\", he said. \"The Wheel weaves as it wills. I don’t blame Andor for what happened to me\". He hesitated. \"I’m still going to fight together with the White Tower, Elayne\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bowed to her and strode off toward Egwene’s section of camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBirgitte stepped up to Elayne. \"Back to our camp, then?\" the woman asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . \". Elayne hesitated, hearing something. A faint sound, yet somehow deep and powerful. She frowned, walking toward it, holding up a hand to still Birgitte as she started to ask what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them rounded the pavilion, crossing green grass and blossoming morning’s breath, walking toward the sound, which grew stronger and stronger. A song. A beautiful song, unlike any she had ever heard, that made her tremble with its striking sonority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt washed over her, enveloped her, vibrated through her. A joyful song, a song of awe and wonder, though she could not understand the words. She approached a group of towering creatures, like trees themselves, standing with their hands on the gnarled trunks of the trees Rand had grown, their eyes closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree dozen Ogier of various ages, from those with eyebrows as white as new snow to those as young as Loial. He stood there with them, a smile raising the sides of his mouth as he sang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin, arms folded, stood nearby with his wife. \"Your talk of going to the Asha’man had me thinking—if we need allies, what about the Ogier? I was going to see if I could find Loial, but before I could set out, I found them already here among these trees\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne nodded, listening to the Ogier song reach its climax, then fade, the Ogier bowing their heads. For a moment, all was peaceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, an ancient Ogier opened his eyes and turned toward Elayne. His white beard reached low on his chest, below the white mustaches that drooped on either side of his mouth. He stepped forward, other ancients both male and female joining him. With them came Loial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are the Queen\", the ancient Ogier said, bowing to her. \"The one who leads this journey. I am Haman, son of Dal son of Morel. We have come to lend our axes to your fight\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am pleased\", Elayne said, nodding to him. \"Three dozen Ogier will add strength to our battle\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three dozen, young one?\" Haman laughed a rumbling laugh. \"The Great Stump did not meet, did not debate this long time, to send you three dozen of our numbers. The Ogier will fight alongside humans. All of us. Every one of us who can hold an axe or long knife\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful!\" Elayne said. \"I will put you to good use\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn older Ogier woman shook her head. \"So hasty. So quick. Know this, young one. There were some who would have abandoned you, and the world, to the Shadow\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne blinked in shock. \"You would have actually done it? Just . . . left us alone? To fight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some argued for it\", Haman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I myself took that position\", the woman said. \"I made the argument, though I did not truly believe it was right\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Loial asked, stumbling forward. This seemed news to him. \"You didn’t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman looked to him. \"Trees will not grow if the Dark One claims this world\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoial looked surprised. \"But why did you—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An argument must have opposition if it is to prove itself, my son\", she said. \"One who argues truly learns the depth of his commitment through adversity. Did you not learn that trees grow roots most strongly when winds blow through them?\" She shook her head, though she did seem fond. \"That is not to say you should have left the stedding when you did. Not alone. Fortunately, that has been taken care of\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taken care of?\" Perrin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoial blushed. \"Well, you see, Perrin, I am married now\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn’t mention this earlier!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything has come so quickly. I am married to Erith, though, you see. She’s just over there. Did you hear her singing? Isn’t her song beautiful? Being married is not so bad, Perrin. Why didn’t you tell me it was not so bad? I think I am rather fond of it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am pleased for you, Loial\", Elayne cut in. Ogier could talk quite long on tangents if one was not careful. \"And thankful, to all of you, for joining us\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is worth the price, perhaps\", Haman said, \"just to see these trees. In all my life, men have only cut Great Trees. To see someone growing them instead . . . We made the correct decision. Yes, yes, we did. The others will nee \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-65.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
