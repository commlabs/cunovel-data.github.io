That always won a lady\u0027s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her left eyebrow. \"They\u0027re free,\" she said. \"It\u0027s a hosted bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis roguish smile swelled. \"In that case, how about two?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just stared at him with green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thrust out a hand. \"Ben Brust. From Sydney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could\u0027ve guessed from your accent,\" she said with a ghost of a smile. \"But the drawl sounds more like western Australia than the New South Wales territory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said, lowering his arm and stumbling for cover, \"I actually was raised on my daddy\u0027s sheep station outside Perth. Western Australia. But most people don\u0027t know Sydney from-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought so.\" Collecting her drink, she began to turn away. \"The meeting should be starting soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she left, he begged for at least one bone. \"And you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ashley Carter.\" She slipped past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen watched her walk away. No professor\u0027s stroll, that. He swallowed the dregs of his beer while appreciating her exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuenos Aires, Argentina\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eASHLEY CROSSED TO THE YOUNG SPANISH GENTLEMAN, who checked her identification. Nodding, he opened the door. The room was lined with some fifty seats, only a quarter occupied. An usher guided her to a reserved seat in the front row, then vanished. Shivering in the light skirt and jacket she wore, she wished they\u0027d turn up the thermostat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that she was seated, her mind began sifting over the events of the past weeks; her old anxieties wormed to the surface. One, especially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hated leaving her son alone in the hotel room upstairs. He had seemed so quiet this evening, not his usual boisterous self. Her fingers tightened on her purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this mission. A letter with airplane tickets had arrived in the mail with instructions to be prompt. \"Everything else has been taken care of,\" the letter had stated. No other details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man sat down in the seat next to her. \"Well, hi, there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over. It was the Australian fellow again. Goddamn it. Couldn\u0027t she get a moment of peace? The empty canyons of her New Mexico home had never seemed so appealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me try this againâ€¦\" He held out a hand. \"Benjamin Brust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot wanting to insult him, she gave his hand one shake. Now go away, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her, white teeth against a ruddy background, his cheekbones hard, sun wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. Full lips. \"So what do you know about all this?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley shrugged, trying to discourage conversation, and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So many secrets,\" Ben mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"Perhaps shortly we\u0027ll have a few answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remained quiet. Still, she sensed his presence at her shoulder. His cologne was musky and rich; his breathing, deep and even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifted. The auditorium was almost full. Now it was getting warm in here. She wished they would fix the thermostat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you trust him?\" he asked in a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she answered, looking straight ahead. She knew who he was talking about. \"Not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a doorway, Blakely watched the auditorium fill. His team was gathered in the five front seats. He signaled his assistant, Roland, across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoland nodded and raised a microphone to his lips. \"Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. We\u0027re ready to begin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few more moments of bustling and last-minute arrivals, the doors to the auditorium were closed and the lights dimmed slightly. Blakely climbed the dais and stood behind the lighted podium. He dabbed his forehead with a handkerchief. He knew his speech by heart, words carefully crafted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlakely tapped the microphone, testing it. His tapping also signaled the murmuring crowd to hush. \"First, thank you all for joining us.\" He paused. \"I know it has been a hardship to leave your regular lives behind so abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in a few moments, I\u0027m sure you will be convinced that the disruption was well worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up a remote control for the slide projector and pressed a button. A photograph of a snowcapped mountain with a plume of dirty smoke appeared on the screen. \"Mount Erebus on Ross Island just off the coast of Antarctica. One of three volcanic cones on this continent. At the base of this volcano is the U.S. research station, McMurdo. My home for the past five years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clicked the button to zero in on a group of low metal buildings clinging to the surface of a gray glacier. A satellite array sprouted like a bizarre spider from the rooftops. \"I have been conducting geothermal studies for the past ten years on some hot rifts still active deep under the cone and under the neighboring Ross Sea. NASA assisted with this research. Their third shuttle, six years ago, made radio scans of the earth\u0027s crust, looking for oil fields and other such pockets. I commissioned a scan of Mount Erebus and found some amazing things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped the button, and a cross-sectional diagram of the crust under the volcanic cone appeared on screen. A murmur arose from the crowd. \"As you can see, an intricate cavern system was discovered below Erebus, spreading hundreds of miles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clicked to the next slide. \"Closer investigation with sonar and radar revealed a huge cavern separated from the deepest rift by a mere six hundred meters of stone.\" He guided a pointer to show the network of rifts that led to the massive pocket. \"We named this cave Alpha Cavern. Almost five miles in diameter, the cavern floor was plumbed at two miles below the surface of the continent. Almost three times deeper than man has ever stepped foot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next picture showed a group of smiling men, faces encrusted in dirt and dust, posing in front of a large raw-edged hole. \"After three years of work, we blasted and mined our way into this chamber. It took another year to wire and set up a camp on this chamber\u0027s floor.\" A spot-lighted set of Quonset huts and tents appeared next on the screen. A three-story wooden building protruded from the middle. A second, similar building, a mere skeleton of wooden framing and scaffolding, was under construction. \"Alpha Base,\" he noted. \"We worked in secret. Access restricted to those with the proper clearance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next slide caused his audience to gasp. Blakely smiled slightly. \"Ladies and gentlemen, I present a mystery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley, who had been rubbing her eyes and yawning, wondering what all this talk of volcanic activity and mining had to do with her, bolted out of her seat. It had to be a hoax. What she saw blew a mile-wide hole in accepted anthropologic theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photograph projected on the screen revealed a spot-lighted section of the cavern wall. Dug into the wall was a network of cliff-dwelling homes, rising several hundred feet up the wall. Unlike the organized Anasazi cliff dwellings she had studied in New Mexico, dwellings with distinct terraces and geometric conformations, these cavern dwellings were more rudimentary, crude, a haphazard series of rough caves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlakely continued after the audience\u0027s reaction had subsided to a quiet murmur. \"Unfortunately, no one was home\"-nervous laughter tickled across the room-\"but we discovered a few scattered artifacts.\" He clicked through the next series of slides. One of the slides was the diamond fertility figurine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley was numb as she settled back into her seat. She raised her hand. \"Excuse me, Dr. Blakely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe acknowledged her with a wave, then paused to sip from a glass of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has the site been dated?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed, nodding. \"We did some cursory radio-carbon dating. As near as we can tell, about five-point-two million years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What!\" Ashley jumped out of her seat a second time. \"That\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been repeated at several labs,\" he replied, his smile condescending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes of the auditorium were now upon her. Some lighting technician even highlighted her with a small spot. She shaded her eyes with a hand. \"But the first hominids, the earliest ancestor of modern man, only appeared on the planet four million years ago. And these early hominids did not have the tools or social structure to build anything like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"That\u0027s why we\u0027re here.\" He clicked for the next slide: a photograph of a tunnel in the base of the wall. \"These tunnels leave this colossal chamber in many different directions, connecting to other caverns and tunnels. We believe that down one of these passages lie the answers to the questions raised by Professor Carter. Who built the dwellings? Who made the carvings? Where are they now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe audience remained stunned, silent. Ashley sat back down, still in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have put together a small team to begin that exploration. To venture deeper into the maze of tunnels and discover what else may lie below. The group will be led by Professor Ashley Carter, an expert in paleoanthropology and archaeology. The others on the team are leaders in their respective fields.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to a blond-haired woman seated several chairs over from Ashley. \"Accompanying the team will be Professor Linda Furstenburg, a biology professor from the University of Vancouver, to study the unique biosphere we\u0027ve discovered down there. Also a geologist, Khalid Najmon,\" he said with a nod toward an Arab gentleman seated with his legs crossed to Linda\u0027s left. \"He, as many of you know, will be assisting us in mapping the riches below Antarctic ice. His findings may alter our view of this continent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlakely finished by pointing out the other two men seated in the front row. \"All the way from Australia, Benjamin Brust, a world-renowned cave explorer, will be mapping the intricacies of this unique cavern system. And that smartly dressed man in the uniform is Major Michaelson of the U.S. Marines, who, with two other trained military men, will be accompanying the team to aid in logistics and protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved his arm to encompass the group before him. \"Ladies and gentlemen, here is your team.\" A murmur of applause spattered across the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley tried to sink deeper into her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some further details were explained and a handful of questions answered, the meeting ended. Satisfied, Blakely left the podium. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-4.html","bookId":1526,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM"}
