I\u0027m watching television when she arrives. I know it\u0027s her by the sound of her motorbike, which is much louder than Dervish\u0027s, but I wait for her to knock before going to let her in. I don\u0027t want to appear overly desperate for company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey girl, looking good,\" Meera laughs, giving me a quick hug before I can duck. She breaks away quickly, spotting Dervish on the stairs. I don\u0027t take much from her, but what I do soak up is new, memories I hadn\u0027t absorbed before. It seems like every time I touch a person, I steal something fresh. That\u0027s useful to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How have you two been?\" Meera shouts, taking the stairs three at a time. She grabs Dervish hard, halfway up the giant staircase which forms the backbone of the house, and hugs him as if he was a teddy bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been fine,\" Dervish replies, smiling warmly. He never smiles at me that way, but why should he? I\u0027m an interpreter, not a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry I haven\u0027t been by more. Busy, busy. It must be spring in Monsterland-demons are bursting out all over. Or trying to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard,\" Dervish says. \"Shark has been in touch. It sounds bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeera shrugs. \"Demons trying to invade are nothing new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But in such numbers...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs again, but this time jerks her head in my direction. Dervish frowns. Then it clicks- \"Not in front of the girl. You might frighten her.\" I see a small, unconscious sneer flicker across his lips. He doesn\u0027t think of me as a girl, certainly not one who can be frightened by anything as mundane as talk of demons. But he respects Meera\u0027s wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on up,\" he says. \"We can discuss business in my study.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To hell with business,\" Meera laughs, pushing him away \"I\u0027m here to let my hair down. I thought it was time me and Bec had a girls\u0027 night in. I bought some lipstick, mascara, a few other bits and pieces I thought might suit you,\" she says to me. \"We can test them out later, discover what matches your eyes and gorgeous red hair. Unless you don\u0027t want to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I grin. \"That would be coolio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish winces-that was one of Bill-E\u0027s favourite words-but I don\u0027t care. For the first time in months I have something to look forward to. I experience a feeling I haven\u0027t known for ages and it takes me a while to realise what it is-happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe eat dinner together, which is a rarity. I normally dine alone. Eating is one of the few pleasures I\u0027ve been able to relish since my return. I love the tastes of the new world. I never imagined anything as delicious as fish and chips, pizza, sweet and sour chicken. The strange flavours baffled and repulsed me to begin with, but now I look forward to my meals as I never did before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dinner Meera banishes Dervish to his study and the two of us shut ourselves in my bedroom. Sitting on the edge of my huge four-poster bed, Meera teaches me the basic tricks of applying make-up. It\u0027s harder than I imagined, requiring a subtle wrist and deft flicks of the fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe try different shades of lipstick, blusher, eyeliner and mascara. It all looks strange and out of place to me, but Meera likes the various effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t people wear make-up in your day?\" she asks, working on my eyelashes for the fourth time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing like this. The warriors were the most intricately decorated. Many had tattoos, and some used to colour their hair with blood and dung.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charming,\" Meera says drily and we laugh. She runs a hand through my hair and tuts. It\u0027s longer and wirier than it\u0027s ever been. \"We must do something with this. And pierce your ears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that,\" I smile. \"I couldn\u0027t grow my hair long or be pierced before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Meera asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was a priestess\u0027s apprentice,\" I explain. \"Priestesses couldn\u0027t marry, so we weren\u0027t meant to make ourselves attractive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet that was a man\u0027s idea!\" Meera snorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually it was practical. Our magic worked best if we were unsullied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you lost your powers if you made out with a guy?\" Meera asks sceptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rubbish,\" she snorts. \"I\u0027ve made out plenty and it hasn\u0027t done me any harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" I insist. \"Things were different. Magic was in the air, all around us. It wasn\u0027t like when a window opens now. We were more powerful than modern mages, but we had to live a certain way to tap into the magic. Love of any kind was a weakening distraction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" Meera says dubiously, brushing my hair from left to right. I\u0027m soaking up memories each time she touches me, but contact is brief so I\u0027m not taking too much. I try not to absorb anything at all, to block her memories, but I can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like Billy sometimes,\" Meera says casually. \"You said \u0027coolio\u0027 earlier, and \u0027weakening distraction\u0027 was the sort of thing he\u0027d say too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a lot of him in me,\" I admit. \"Bill-E spoke much faster than I did, and he used odd words sometimes. I find myself mimicking him. It isn\u0027t intentional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have his handwriting too,\" I confess, lowering my voice to a whisper. \"I never wrote before. I wouldn\u0027t have been able to without Bill-E\u0027s memories to show me how. When I write, I do it the way he did, exactly the same style.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder if you have the same fingerprints?\" Meera says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I frown, studying the tips of my fingers, recalling the whorls from before. \"This is my flesh. I moulded it into my own shape. On the outside there\u0027s nothing of Bill-E left. But in here...\" I tap the side of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That must be weird for Dervish,\" Meera chuckles. I go very quiet. She applies new lipstick in silence, then says, \"Dervish never talks about you. I haven\u0027t been able to phone often, but whenever I call, I ask how you\u0027re doing. He\u0027s always vague. Says you\u0027re fine, no problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grunt sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know about your time,\" Meera says slowly, \"but in today\u0027s world, girls love to share. Boys don\u0027t so much-they bottle things up inside, hide their pain even from their best friends. But girls know that a problem shared is a problem halved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill-E hated that clich¨¦,\" I tell her. \"He thought if that was true, all you had to do was tell your problem to dozens of people. Each time you told it, the problem would be halved, until eventually it would be of no real importance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That definitely sounds like Billy,\" Meera laughs, then looks at me seriously \"If I can help, I will, but first I need to know what\u0027s troubling you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chew my newly painted lower lip, wondering how much-if anything-I should tell her. She\u0027s Dervish\u0027s friend, loyal and once in love with him. Maybe she can only see his side of things and will turn against me if I...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. She\u0027s not like that. Meera\u0027s criticised Dervish before when she thought he was in the wrong. She believes in being honest with everyone. I\u0027ve no guarantee that she\u0027ll side with me, but from what I\u0027ve absorbed, I believe she\u0027ll give me a fair hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s only interested in Bill-E,\" I whisper, then fill her in on all that\u0027s happened since I stepped out of the cave, only holding back the information about my gift, since that has no bearing on what\u0027s been going on with Dervish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listens silently, her brows slowly creasing into an angry frown. \"The idiot,\" she growls when I finish. \"I guess anyone in his position would want to know what was going on inside Billy\u0027s head, but he\u0027s taken this way too far. Who does he think he is, treating you like dirt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stands up, fire in her eyes, and strides towards the door. My heart leaps with excitement-she\u0027s going to confront Dervish and subject him to a tongue-lashing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrilliant! But then she slows, stops, thinks a moment and turns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she says quietly. \"I can\u0027t say anything to him about this. You have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\" I cry, disappointment almost bringing tears to my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can take you away from here,\" Meera says, returning to my side. \"Dervish is no kin to you, so you don\u0027t have to stay with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually,\" I correct her, \"we are distantly related.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waves that away. \"Like I said, I can take you from him, but I don\u0027t think you\u0027d be any happier. If you run away now, you\u0027ll always be running. You need to talk to Dervish, make him see you\u0027re not Billy\u0027s ghost, but a real child with real needs. I wouldn\u0027t treat a dog the way Dervish has treated you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t do it on purpose,\" I mutter, surprised to find myself sticking up for him. \"He\u0027s sad and lonely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you!\" Meera exclaims. \"If I was in your place, I\u0027d have set him straight long ago. But you\u0027re just a girl. You were afraid to hurt his feelings... maybe afraid of what he might do if he lost his temper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod softly, amazed that she can read me so easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve known Dervish a long time,\" Meera says. \"He\u0027s not as shallow as he must seem. You\u0027ve caught him at a bad time, the worst of his life. He\u0027s lost Billy... Grubbs... that horrible Swan cow didn\u0027t help matters.\" Dervish had been in love with Lord Loss\u0027s assistant, Juni Swan. He thought she was a wonderful, kind-hearted woman. When he learnt the truth in the cave, he killed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any other time, Dervish would have welcomed you warmly,\" Meera continues. \"But he\u0027s mixed up and you\u0027ve become part of all that\u0027s wrong with his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That has to change,\" she says sternly. \"He can\u0027t carry on like a spoilt child. If he can\u0027t see sense himself, we have to make him. You have to. Because you\u0027re the one who lives with him. I could shake him up, but he\u0027d feel guilty and shameful, and that might makes things worse. You need to sort this out yourself.\" She smiles encouragingly and nods at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What... now?\" I stammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No time like the present,\" she grins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what to say,\" I protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll think of something,\" she assures me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if you\u0027re wrong? What if he doesn\u0027t want to hear from me? What if he only wants access to Bill-E?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t have it,\" Meera says softly. \"Billy\u0027s dead. Dervish has manipulated you to hide from that, but he can\u0027t anymore. It\u0027s not healthy. Now quit stalling, get up there and put him in his place. And remember,\" she grins, \"he\u0027s only a man. They\u0027re the inferior half of the species. He\u0027ll be putty in your hands.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-s-shadow-the-demonata-7/page-6.html","bookId":2181,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:53 PM"}
