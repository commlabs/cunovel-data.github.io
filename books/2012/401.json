You lied!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorrent lay on his back. The red sleet was diminishing now – he could see the Jade Strangers and the sun itself. From below his hips he could feel nothing. Frozen. Bloodless. I haven’t got long .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where are they?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced himself on to one elbow, pointed off to the right and slightly downslope. ‘There, behind that rise – stand atop it, witch, and you may see them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That is all I need from you – now you can die, pup. Did I not say you would?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You did, Olar Ethil.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, she set off for the rise of hard-packed snow and ice. Twenty-five, maybe thirty paces away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorrent twisted round, dragged himself closer to his bow. ‘I promised,’ he whispered. Half-numb fingers closed about the bow’s shaft. He scrabbled one-handed for the quiver, drew out a stone-tipped arrow. Rolling on to his back, he lay gasping for a moment. It was getting hard – hard to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIce squealed and then cracked and he slid half a pace – back towards that fissure, but now it was wider – now it could take all of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorrent forced the nock’s slitted mouth round the gut-string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was almost there, tackling the ragged side of the rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used his elbows and shoulders to push himself up against a heap of rubbled ice. Brought the bow round and drew the arrow back. This is impossible. I’m lying all wrong. She’s too far away! Wretched panic gripped him. He struggled to calm his breath, deafened by the pounding of his own heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlar Ethil scrambled on to the rise, straightened and stared downslope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw her fists clench, half-heard her howl of fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquinting, his muscles starting to tremble, he stared at her shoulders – waiting, waiting – and when he saw them pivot, he released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will make him pay for the lies! Olar Ethil, eldest among all the Bonecasters and now reborn, spun round towards Torrent—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arrow caught her in the left eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stone tip tore through the eyeball, punched through the back of the socket, where the bone was thin as skin, and the spinning chipped-stone point drilled a gory tunnel through her brain, before shattering against the inside of the back of her skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw her head snap back, saw the shaft protruding from her face, and by the way her body fell – collapsing like a sack of bones – he knew that she was dead – killed instantly. Gasping, he sagged back. Did you see that, Toc? Did you see that shot?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, gods. It’s done, brother .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s done. I am Torrent, last warrior of the Awl .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he slid towards the fissure, he was helpless to resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorrent. Last warrior of the …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy bellowed in agony as Gesler dragged him away. The red-haired Falari had been stabbed through his right thigh. But the blood was slow, gushing only when the muscles moved, telling Gesler that the fool wouldn’t bleed out before he got him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ve’Gath were all drawing back – and back …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause she’s coming. Because she’s finally joining this fight .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods help us all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling Stormy on to the blood-soaked embankment of the third trench, he looked back upslope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was walking alone towards the massed Kolansii. Little more than a child, stick-thin, looking undernourished. Pathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Gesler saw her raise her hands, he flinched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a terrible roar a wall of fire engulfed the highest trench. Scalding winds erupted in savage gusts, rolling back down the slope – Gesler saw the corpses nearest the girl crisp black, limbs suddenly pulling, curling inward in the heat’s bitter womb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Sinn began walking, and, as she did so, she marched the wall of fire ahead of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalyth stumbled to her knees beside Gesler. ‘You must call her back! She can’t just burn them all alive!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler sagged back. ‘It’s too late, Kalyth. There’s no stopping her now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalyth screamed – a raw, breaking sound, her hands up at her face – but even she could not tear her eyes from the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire devoured the army crouched against the base of the Spire. Bodies simply exploded, blood boiling. Thousands of soldiers burst into flames, their flesh melting. Everything within the fire blackened, began crumbling away. And still the firestorm raged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunth Mach was crouched down over Stormy, oil streaming from her clawed hands and sealing the wound on his leg, but he was already pushing those hands away. ‘Gesler – we got to reach those stairs—’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-401.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
