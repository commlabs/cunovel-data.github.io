THE ESCAPE OF CROSS AND HUSKIN.","content":"For the moment Robert was dumfounded, for he had not dreamed that this pleasant stranger was about to attack him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you hear? Give me that money,\" repeated Huskin, and tightened his grip.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me go!\" returned Robert. \"Would you rob me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I want that money you drew out of the post-office. And I want it instantly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I won\u0027t give you a cent,\" cried Robert, and began to struggle with all the strength at his command.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Although but a boy, he was strong, and soon it looked as if he might break away in spite of all the sharper could do to hold him. Seeing this, Huskin whistled loudly three times,—a signal that Andy Cross must join him at once.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The signal had scarcely come to an end when Andy Cross pushed his way into the hallway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 170]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Quick—hold him!\" shouted Jim Huskin. \"He\u0027s a regular eel.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve got him,\" answered Andy Cross, and caught Robert from behind, and soon his bony fingers were pressing themselves directly into the poor youth\u0027s windpipe, so that it looked as if Robert would be choked to death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert could not see Cross, but he recognized the sharper\u0027s voice, and at once came to the conclusion that the two men had laid a plot to rob him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nearly strangled, he let go his hold of Huskin, and tried to break Andy Cross\u0027 grip.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The moment Jim Huskin felt himself free he wrenched Robert\u0027s watch and chain from their fastening and placed them in his own pocket.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he dove into the boy\u0027s coat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let—let me go!\" spluttered Robert. \"Help! thiev——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He could go no farther, for now his wind was cut off entirely. All grew black before his eyes, and it was only in a hazy fashion that he felt Huskin snatch the money from where he had placed it with care.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Got what you want?\" asked Andy Cross.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure about the money?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 171]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here is a package of five and ten dollar bills.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s it. And the watch?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Safe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then we had better make tracks.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ram his head against the wall first. We don\u0027t want him to give the alarm too soon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Andy Cross understood what Huskin meant, and between them the sharpers raised the boy\u0027s body up and threw him with great violence against the hard wall close at hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The shock landed mainly upon Robert\u0027s head, as was intended, and with a groan, the youth sank down in a heap unconscious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I guess he\u0027s done for,\" said Cross.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is for a while, anyway,\" responded Huskin. \"Come, the sooner we get out of this neighborhood the better off we will be.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Running to the doorway of the tenement, both sharpers peered forth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A man is coming!\" cried Cross.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let us get out by the back way,\" said his companion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They hurried back past Robert, and into the kitchen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here, to their surprise, a fire was burning in a dilapidated stove.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 172]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hullo! I thought this place was deserted,\" ejaculated Jim Huskin, in astonishment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We must not be caught,\" added Cross. \"Here is a back door and another alleyway.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The door was unlocked, and they slipped outside. Soon the rascals had placed several blocks between themselves and the scene of the nefarious encounter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile the man coming up the alleyway paused at the tenement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He lived in the place, paying no rent. He was very old, and could hardly walk, and his eyesight was poor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had been to the corner grocery to buy himself a few of the necessities of life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Entering the semi-dark hallway he shambled along until his foot struck Robert\u0027s body.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, what can this be?\" he muttered, and bent over that he might see.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was greatly amazed to find a boy there, suffering from a slight cut over one eye, from which the blood was flowing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Something is wrong,\" he thought. \"Has the lad met with foul play?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was half of a mind to summon the police, but was afraid he could not find an officer short of six or seven blocks off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 173]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Setting down his basket, he raised up Robert\u0027s head. As he did this, our hero gave a groan and a shiver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t, don\u0027t hit me again,\" he murmured. \"Don\u0027t!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I ain\u0027t hit ye,\" answered the old man. \"How did ye git here?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Robert did not answer, having relapsed again into unconsciousness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not without considerable trouble did the old man bring some cold water and bathe Robert\u0027s face, and bind up the wound with an old towel. He carried the boy to the kitchen and set him down on a worn-out lounge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How do you feel?\" he asked as Robert opened his eyes and stared around him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are they—the rascals?\" asked Robert. He was completely bewildered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who do you mean?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I mean the men who attacked me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know anything about \u0027em. I found ye in the hallway in a heap.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Two men attacked me and robbed me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Gee shoo! Did they git much?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\" Robert gave a groan. \"They got my watch and over a hundred and fifty dollars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 174]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At this announcement the eyes of Lemuel Branley almost started from their sockets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A hundred and fifty dollars!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; and a watch worth twenty-five more.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What was ye a-doing with so much money about ye?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was expecting to use the most of it to buy something with. So you didn\u0027t see the men?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lemuel Branley shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They couldn\u0027t have left so long ago.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then they didn\u0027t go out by the front door, for I was at the top of the alleyway quite a spell.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is there a rear way out?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; and come to think of it, the back door was wide open when I first came in for the water.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then they went out that way.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a pause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you know them?\" asked the old man, curiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I knew one of them in a way. The other introduced himself to me while I was on my way over here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Robert related how he had fallen in with Jim Huskin, and how the sharper had gotten him to enter the tenement hallway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re lucky to escape with your life,\" said[Pg 175] Lemuel Branley. \"You don\u0027t know how bad some of the criminals in Chicago are.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I must try to get on their track. I can\u0027t afford to lose my money, nor the watch, either.\" And Robert\u0027s face grew serious. The watch was the one his father had given him, and without the money how was he to purchase the map Dick Marden was so anxious to possess?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ll have to hustle to find them rogues, to my way of thinking,\" said Lemuel Branley. \"Like as not they\u0027ll quit Chicago just as soon as possible.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert stood up. He felt strangely weak and far from able to pursue anybody.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you call a policeman?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lemuel Branley made off, and while he was gone the boy brushed off his clothing and washed himself. Luckily he had a bit of court-plaster in his pocket, and this he plastered over the cut on forehead, thus doing away with the ragged towel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By the time he had finished he felt a little stronger. Soon the old man came back, followed by a tall, heavy-set officer of the law.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I saw you and one of the men a while ago,\" said the policeman, after our hero had told his story. \"The man didn\u0027t impress me very favor[Pg 176]ably. I rather think I\u0027ve seen his picture in the rogues\u0027 gallery.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you would know him again?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think I would.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wish you would try to hunt him up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will. Will you go along.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Robert was willing, and they left the tenement by the back way, our hero first thanking Lemuel Branley for what he had done.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But nothing was to be seen of Andy Cross and Jim Huskin, and in an hour the policeman and the youth gave up the hunt. The officer directed Robert to the nearest station house, and here the particulars of the robbery were taken down. A large book of photographs was placed before Robert, and he soon found Jim Huskin\u0027s portrait.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s the man,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are certain.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I would know him out of a thousand.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Andy Cross\u0027 photograph could not be found, since he had not yet sat for the rogues\u0027 gallery, even though he richly deserved it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The officer in charge took down Robert\u0027s address, and told our hero if anything was learned he would let the youth know.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With this small consolation Robert had to be[Pg 177] content. He left the station house much crestfallen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Everything seems to be going wrong,\" he mused. \"I do hope those rascals are caught, and that very soon.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801/52305.html","bookId":1053,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:38:29 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:38:29 AM"}
