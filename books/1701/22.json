They fall down from the sky, and they\u0027re very beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no response from the child who had once been so curious and alert. Jonas looked down through the dusk at the little head against his chest. Gabriel\u0027s curly hair was matted and filthy, and there were tearstains outlined in dirt on his pale cheeks. His eyes were closed. As Jonas watched, a snowflake drifted down and was caught briefly for a moment\u0027s sparkle in the tiny fluttering eyelashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWearily he remounted the bicycle. A steep hill loomed ahead. In the best of conditions, the hill would have been a difficult, demanding ride. But now the rapidly deepening snow obscured the narrow road and made the ride impossible. His front wheel moved forward imperceptibly as he pushed on the pedals with his numb, exhausted legs. But the bicycle stopped. It would not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got off and let it drop sideways into the snow. For a moment he thought how easy it would be to drop beside it himself, to let himself and Gabriel slide into the softness of snow, the darkness of night, the warm comfort of sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had come this far. He must try to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memories had fallen behind him now, escaping from his protection to return to the people of his community. Were there any left at all? Could he hold onto a last bit of warmth? Did he still have the strength to Give? Could Gabriel still Receive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed his hands into Gabriel\u0027s back and tried to remember sunshine. For a moment it seemed that nothing came to him, that his power was completely gone. Then it flickered suddenly, and he felt tiny tongues of heat begin to creep across and into his frozen feet and legs. He felt his face begin to glow and the tense, cold skin of his arms and hands relax. For a fleeting second he felt that he wanted to keep it for himself, to let himself bathe in sunlight, unburdened by anything or anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the moment passed and was followed by an urge, a need, a passionate yearning to share the warmth with the one person left for him to love. Aching from the effort, he forced the memory of warmth into the thin, shivering body in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel stirred. For a moment they both were bathed in warmth and renewed strength as they stood hugging each other in the blinding snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas began to walk up the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory was agonizingly brief. He had trudged no more than a few yards through the night when it was gone and they were cold again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his mind was alert now. Warming himself ever so briefly had shaken away the lethargy and resignation and restored his will to survive. He began to walk faster on feet that he could no longer feel. But the hill was treacherously steep; he was impeded by the snow and his own lack of strength. He didn\u0027t make it very far before he stumbled and fell forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his knees, unable to rise, Jonas tried a second time. His consciousness grasped at a wisp of another warm memory, and tried desperately to hold it there, to enlarge it, and pass it into Gabriel. His spirits and strength lifted with the momentary warmth and he stood. Again, Gabriel stirred against him as he began to climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the memory faded, leaving him colder than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only he had had time to receive more warmth from The Giver before he escaped! Maybe there would be more left for him now. But there was no purpose in if-onlys. His entire concentration now had to be on moving his feet, warming Gabriel and himself, and going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed, stopped, and warmed them both briefly again, with a tiny scrap of memory that seemed certainly to be all he had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top of the hill seemed so far away, and he did not know what lay beyond. But there was nothing left to do but continue. He trudged upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he approached the summit of the hill at last, something began to happen. He was not warmer; if anything, he felt more numb and more cold. He was not less exhausted; on the contrary, his steps were leaden, and he could barely move his freezing, tired legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he began, suddenly, to feel happy. He began to recall happy times. He remembered his parents and his sister. He remembered his friends, Asher and Fiona. He remembered The Giver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemories of joy flooded through him suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the place where the hill crested and he could feel the ground under his snow-covered feet become level. It would not be uphill anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re almost there, Gabriel,\" he whispered, feeling quite certain without knowing why. \"I remember this place, Gabe.\" And it was true. But it was not a grasping of a thin and burdensome recollection; this was different. This was something that he could keep. It was a memory of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hugged Gabriel and rubbed him briskly, warming him, to keep him alive. The wind was bitterly cold. The snow swirled, blurring his vision. But somewhere ahead, through the blinding storm, he knew there was warmth and light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing his final strength, and a special knowledge that was deep inside him, Jonas found the sled that was waiting for them at the top of the hill. Numbly his hands fumbled for the rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe settled himself on the sled and hugged Gabe close. The hill was steep but the snow was powdery and soft, and he knew that this time there would be no ice, no fall, no pain. Inside his freezing body, his heart surged with hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas felt himself losing consciousness and with his whole being willed himself to stay upright atop the sled, clutching Gabriel, keeping him safe. The runners sliced through the snow and the wind whipped at his face as they sped in a straight line through an incision that seemed to lead to the final destination, the place that he had always felt was waiting, the Elsewhere that held their future and their past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced his eyes open as they went downward, downward, sliding, and all at once he could see lights, and he recognized them now. He knew they were shining through the windows of rooms, that they were the red, blue, and yellow lights that twinkled from trees in places where families created and kept memories, where they celebrated love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownward, downward, faster and faster Suddenly he was aware with certainty and joy that below, ahead, they were waiting for him; and that they were waiting, too, for the baby. For the first time, he heard something that he knew to be music. He heard people singing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, across vast distances of space and time, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-22.html","bookId":1701,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM"}
