Lisa listened without comment, her face pinched and strained, her hands clasped tensely in her lap. Below the ship, the war-ravaged rural countryside spread out like a relief map, the vacant regions between cities crater-pitted and dotted with the ruins of farms and small industrial plants.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder,\" she said, when he had finished, \"how many times this has happened before.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"A minority report? A great many times.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, one precog misphased. Using the report of the others as data—superseding them.\" Her eyes dark and serious, she added, \"Perhaps a lot of the people in the camps are like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Anderton insisted. But he was beginning to feel uneasy about it, too. \"I was in a position to see the card, to get a look at the report. That\u0027s what did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\" Lisa gestured significantly. \"Perhaps all of them would have reacted that way. We could have told them the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It would have been too great a risk,\" he answered stubbornly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLisa laughed sharply. \"Risk? Chance? Uncertainty? With precogs around?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnderton concentrated on steering the fast little ship. \"This is a unique case,\" he repeated. \"And we have an immediate problem. We can tackle the theoretical aspects later on. I have to get this tape to the proper people—before your bright young friend demolishes it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re taking it to Kaplan?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I certainly am.\" He tapped the reel of tape which lay on the seat between them. \"He\u0027ll be interested. Proof that his life isn\u0027t in danger ought to be of vital concern to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom her purse, Lisa shakily got out her cigarette case. \"And you think he\u0027ll help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"He may—or he may not. It\u0027s a chance worth taking.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you manage to go underground so quickly?\" Lisa asked. \"A completely effective disguise is difficult to obtain.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All it takes is money,\" he answered evasively.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs she smoked, Lisa pondered. \"Probably Kaplan will protect you,\" she said. \"He\u0027s quite powerful.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought he was only a retired general.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Technically—that\u0027s what he is. But Witwer got out the dossier on him. Kaplan heads an unusual kind of exclusive veterans\u0027 organization. It\u0027s actually a kind of club, with a few restricted members. High officers only—an international class from both sides of the war. Here in New York they maintain a great mansion of a house, three glossy-paper publications, and occasional TV coverage that costs them a small fortune.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you trying to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Only this. You\u0027ve convinced me that you\u0027re innocent. I mean, it\u0027s obvious that you won\u0027t commit a murder. But you must realize now that the original report, the majority report, was not a fake. Nobody falsified it. Ed Witwer didn\u0027t create it. There\u0027s no plot against you, and there never was. If you\u0027re going to accept this minority report as genuine you\u0027ll have to accept the majority one, also.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly, he agreed. \"I suppose so.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Ed Witwer,\" Lisa continued, \"is acting in complete good faith. He really believes you\u0027re a potential criminal—and why not? He\u0027s got the majority report sitting on his desk, but you have that card folded up in your pocket.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I destroyed it,\" Anderton said, quietly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLisa leaned earnestly toward him. \"Ed Witwer isn\u0027t motivated by any desire to get your job,\" she said. \"He\u0027s motivated by the same desire that has always dominated you. He believes in Precrime. He wants the system to continue. I\u0027ve talked to him and I\u0027m convinced he\u0027s telling the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnderton asked, \"Do you want me to take this reel to Witwer? If I do—he\u0027ll destroy it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" Lisa retorted. \"The originals have been in his hands from the start. He could have destroyed them any time he wished.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true.\" Anderton conceded. \"Quite possibly he didn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he didn\u0027t. Look at it this way. If Kaplan gets hold of that tape, the police will be discredited. Can\u0027t you see why? It would prove that the majority report was an error. Ed Witwer is absolutely right. You have to be taken in—if Precrime is to survive. You\u0027re thinking of your own safety. But think, for a moment, about the system.\" Leaning over, she stubbed out her cigarette and fumbled in her purse for another. \"Which means more to you—your own personal safety or the existence of the system?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"My safety,\" Anderton answered, without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re positive?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"If the system can survive only by imprisoning innocent people, then it deserves to be destroyed. My personal safety is important because I\u0027m a human being. And furthermore—\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom her purse, Lisa got out an incredibly tiny pistol. \"I believe,\" she told him huskily, \"that I have my finger on the firing release. I\u0027ve never used a weapon like this before. But I\u0027m willing to try.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAfter a pause, Anderton asked: \"You want me to turn the ship around? Is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, back to the police building. I\u0027m sorry. If you could put the good of the system above your own selfish—\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep your sermon,\" Anderton told her. \"I\u0027ll take the ship back. But I\u0027m not going to listen to your defense of a code of behavior no intelligent man could subscribe to.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLisa\u0027s lips pressed into a thin, bloodless line. Holding the pistol tightly, she sat facing him, her eyes fixed intently on him as he swung the ship in a broad arc. A few loose articles rattled from the glove compartment as the little craft turned on a radical slant, one wing rising majestically until it pointed straight up.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBoth Anderton and his wife were supported by the constraining metal arms of their seats. But not so the third member of the party.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of his eye, Anderton saw a flash of motion. A sound came simultaneously, the clawing struggle of a large man as he abruptly lost his footing and plunged into the reinforced wall of the ship. What followed happened quickly. Fleming scrambled instantly to his feet, lurching and wary, one arm lashing out for the woman\u0027s pistol. Anderton was too startled to cry out. Lisa turned, saw the man—and screamed. Fleming knocked the gun from her hand, sending it clattering to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGrunting, Fleming shoved her aside and retrieved the gun. \"Sorry,\" he gasped, straightening up as best he could. \"I thought she might talk more. That\u0027s why I waited.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You were here when—\" Anderton began—and stopped. It was obvious that Fleming and his men had kept him under surveillance. The existence of Lisa\u0027s ship had been duly noted and factored in, and while Lisa had debated whether it would be wise to fly him to safety, Fleming had crept into the storage compartment of the ship.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" Fleming said, \"you\u0027d better give me that reel of tape.\" His moist, clumsy fingers groped for it. \"You\u0027re right—Witwer would have melted it down to a puddle.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Kaplan, too?\" Anderton asked numbly, still dazed by the appearance of the man.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Kaplan is working directly with Witwer. That\u0027s why his name showed on line five of the card. Which one of them is the actual boss, we can\u0027t tell. Possibly neither.\" Fleming tossed the tiny pistol away and got out his own heavy-duty military weapon. \"You pulled a real flub in taking off with this woman. I told you she was back of the whole thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe that,\" Anderton protested. \"If she—\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got no sense. This ship was warmed up by Witwer\u0027s order. They wanted to fly you out of the building so that we couldn\u0027t get to you. With you on your own, separated from us, you didn\u0027t stand a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA strange look passed over Lisa\u0027s stricken features. \"It\u0027s not true,\" she whispered. \"Witwer never saw this ship. I was going to supervise—\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You almost got away with it,\" Fleming interrupted inexorably. \"We\u0027ll be lucky if a police patrol ship isn\u0027t hanging on us. There wasn\u0027t time to check.\" He squatted down as he spoke, directly behind the woman\u0027s chair. \"The first thing is to get this woman out of the way. We\u0027ll have to drag you completely out of this area. Page tipped off Witwer on your new disguise, and you can be sure it has been widely broadcast.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStill crouching, Fleming seized hold of Lisa. Tossing his heavy gun to Anderton, he expertly tilted her chin up until her temple was shoved back against the seat. Lisa clawed frantically at him; a thin, terrified wail rose in her throat. Ignoring her, Fleming closed his great hands around her neck and began relentlessly to squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No bullet wound,\" he explained, gasping. \"She\u0027s going to fall out—natural accident. It happens all the time. But in this case, her neck will be broken first.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed strange that Anderton waited so long. As it was, Fleming\u0027s thick ringers were cruelly embedded in the woman\u0027s pale flesh before he lifted the butt of the heavyduty pistol and brought it down on the back of Fleming\u0027s skull. The monstrous hands relaxed. Staggered, Fleming\u0027s head fell forward and he sagged against the wall of the ship. Trying feebly to collect himself, he began dragging his body upward. Anderton hit him again, this time above the left eye. He fell back, and lay still.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStruggling to breathe, Lisa remained for a moment huddled over, her body swaying back and forth. Then, gradually, the color crept back into her face.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you take the controls?\" Anderton asked, shaking her, his voice urgent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I think so.\" Almost mechanically she reached for the wheel. \"I\u0027ll be all right. Don\u0027t worry about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"This pistol,\" Anderton said, \"is Army ordnance issue. But it\u0027s not from the war. It\u0027s one of the useful new ones they\u0027ve developed. I could be a long way off but there\u0027s just a chance—\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed back to where Fleming lay spread out on the deck. Trying not to touch the man\u0027s head, he tore open his coat and rummaged in his pockets. A moment later Fleming\u0027s sweat-sodden wallet rested in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTod Fleming, according to his identification, was an Army Major attached to the Internal Intelligence Department of Military Information. Among the various papers was a document signed by General Leopold Kaplan, stating that Fleming was under the special protection of his own group—the International Veterans\u0027 League.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFleming and his men were operating under Kaplan\u0027s orders. The bread truck, the accident, had been deliberately rigged.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt meant that Kaplan had deliberately kept him out of police hands. The plan went back to the original contact in his home, when Kaplan\u0027s men had picked him up as he was packing. Incredulous, he realized what had really happened. Even then, they were making sure they got him before the police. From the start, it had been an elaborate strategy to make certain that Witwer would fail to arrest him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You were telling the truth,\" Anderton said to his wife, as he climbed back in the seat. \"Can we get hold of Witwer?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMutely, she nodded. Indicating the communications circuit of the dashboard, she asked: \"What—did you find?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Get Witwer for me. I want to talk to him as soon as I can. It\u0027s very urgent.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJerkily, she dialed, got the closed-channel mechanical circuit, and raised police headquarters in New York. A visual panorama of petty police officials flashed by before a tiny replica of Ed Witwer\u0027s features appeared on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember me?\" Anderton asked him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWitwer blanched. \"Good God. What happened? Lisa, are you bringing him in?\" Abruptly his eyes fastened on the gun in Anderton\u0027s hands. \"Look,\" he said savagely, \"don\u0027t do anything to her. Whatever you may think, she\u0027s not responsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already found that out,\" Anderton answered. \"Can you get a fix on us? We may need protection getting back.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Back!\" Witwer gazed at him unbelievingly. \"You\u0027re coming in? You\u0027re giving yourself up?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, yes.\" Speaking rapidly, urgently, Anderton added, \"There\u0027s something you must do immediately. Close off the monkey block. Make certain nobody gets it—Page or anyone else. Especially Army people.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Kaplan,\" the miniature image said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"He was here. He—he just left.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnderton\u0027s heart stopped beating. \"What was he doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Picking up data. Transcribing duplicates of our precog reports on you. He insisted he wanted them solely for his protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he\u0027s already got it,\" Anderton said. \"It\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlarmed, Witwer almost shouted: \"Just what do you mean? What\u0027s happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you,\" Anderton said heavily, \"when I get back to my office.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/265/417.html","bookId":363,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 6:26:42 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 6:26:42 AM"}
