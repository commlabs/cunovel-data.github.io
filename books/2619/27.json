I couldn’t really wash my troubles right out of my hair, when What the hell had happened to Gideon was continually at the forefront of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon had been horrifying before, but my brain could grasp the ways he was damaged—I’d seen other people injured similarly at work. Now he was changed in ways I couldn’t comprehend. I almost stepped out onto bloody tiles. Then I grabbed an extra towel and threw it down to step on instead. I didn’t have the strength to clean anything else just now. Bleach would have to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked into my bedroom. It would be day for a few more hours. I wanted to feel safe, but it was getting hard in between all the crazy. There was too much going on, and nothing I could do about it. Maybe once Anna’s ceremony was done, and Gideon and Veronica were out of my house, it would all start making sense. Then I’d only have to worry about stalkery vampires and stalkery weres. It would mean that my problems had been halved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the box Anna had given me. At least Grandfather hadn’t assimilated Asher’s silver bracelet. I put the bracelet on, feeling a bit like Wonder Woman, pulled the sheets back on my bed, and tucked myself inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t set my alarm clock, and it felt late when I woke up. I blinked and reached for my phone. It was five P.M. I was still safe, inside my house. As safe as could be expected anyway. I remembered today’s To Do list: dinner with Jake, ask a were-leader for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went toward my bathroom to brush my teeth, then remembered the huge bloodstain on the floor, and my apartment’s other, non-feline, non-vampire occupant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Gideon—” I said, walking into my living room. He stood with his back to me, against the far wall. His shoulders were slumped—it looked like he was urinating, only I didn’t smell pee and there was no corresponding sound. “Grandfather?” I tried instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim having his back to me, with no hint he’d heard either name, was creepy. I walked over, feeling like that chick in a horror movie who always does what she shouldn’t, no matter how many times you throw popcorn or yell at the screen. As I sidled around him, I saw he was plugged into the wall simultaneously via an outlet and a phone jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m still not okay with this,” I said. The cords looked umbilical—I tried not to follow them too far into the shadows my bathrobe created on his chest. Wait—my bathrobe. “Gideon,” I said, my voice low. Was nothing sacred? He’d taken the shoulder and torn it, so that my laptop’s webcam could peek through. I took a step nearer. “Do you even need food now? Water?” I asked, and got no response. “Okay. Fine. I’ll just be in the bathroom, cleaning up your mess.” I resisted the urge to poke him, to see if he would move or what he would do, and went under my kitchen sink to get bleach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d need a new jug of bleach soon and some additional cheap towels. Hopefully that trip could wait until after the holidays. I wondered exactly how Grandfather-Gideon was communing with the outside world just now, and to what effect—I imagined him lodging serious complaints on assorted message boards and snorted. Honestly, it seemed like the sort of thing I ought to tell—or warn—someone about, but I wasn’t entirely sure who, and since so far the only detriment was that he was probably using electricity like I was harboring a grow-light, it could wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrubbed until no one would know that my bathroom had been a crime scene unless they possessed a forensic degree. Empowered by cleanliness, high on bleach fumes, I got ready to go out to dinner with Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled on my scrubs and all the silver that I currently owned. Between my belt, bracelet, and badge—which might warn me a second or two before any attack—I’d give myself even odds on surviving for five seconds once I was outside my door. Five whole seconds, although not necessarily painless ones. Hooray for me. I estimated where I’d parked was about ten seconds away, and technically being in my car wasn’t any safer than being outside it, really. If a certain crazed unknown someone in a black truck decided to run me over, my little Chevy Cavalier wouldn’t stand a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I was standing there waiting, measuring assorted odds, Gideon came up behind me, looming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got to get to my car. Are you willing to spot me?” I wasn’t sure what Gideon could do precisely—but once upon a time, I’d seen Grandfather laser out from the inside of a pissed-off dragon. Gideon nodded, then pointed at the doorknob with his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a second to catch his drift. “Ah. Opposable thumbs must be high on your To Do list.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once I leave, don’t open the door up for anyone but me, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon nodded again, and with one last look at my badge, I opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing I had to be afraid of on my way to my car was ice. The weather wasn’t letting up—instead of snowing enough to run the city into the ground, it kept warming just enough to put a slick sheet of ice over everything as it refroze. I hopped inside and my engine took quickly. With a moment of forethought, I took my ibuprofen out of my purse and tossed it into my glove box—I’d hate to find out Jake had swiped it two weeks from now, when I was on my period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake was waiting for me on the curb outside the Armory. When he saw my car, he put his thumb out like a hitchhiker, and I flashed my high beams at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Sissy!” he said as he got in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To what do I owe the honor?” I said, pulling away from the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The usual. Your good taste in siblings, the fact that we share a mom.” He grinned at me in the rearview mirror. “How’s it going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh. I’m tired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You work night shift. You’re always tired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I have a surprise for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dinner’s on me tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped the right-hand turn signal on in my car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m driving toward the nearest Burger King.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. “Go straight two lights, before making a left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did what he said, and there were directions after that. We wound up in a diner at an area just this side of decent. I’d been here before, long ago, when Mom would drop Jake and me off at a forgotten arcade with a fistful of quarters to kill an afternoon. The arcade was gone now, but the diner remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, this is a blast from the past,” I said, pulling into a small parking lot nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you’d like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. I think I do.” He held the door for me as we went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I passed, I could see he was wearing nice clothes—he looked pulled together. It was hard for me to wrap my mind around this version of Jake: clean, polite, kind. The waitress took us to a booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just like old times. Want a chocolate milk shake?” Jake asked as the waitress waited for our drink order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe a hot chocolate, instead. And a burger, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too. A double.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress took our order and went away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” I said, looking at Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soooo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really, Jake. What is up.” I took my hat off and set it down. It was nice and warm in here at least. Plus, there were no eyeless cyborgs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does there always have to be something up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With you, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wish you could trust me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many times have you stolen things from me, Jake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to hash over the past.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How convenient.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do we have to have the same conversation every single time we hang out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squinted at him. “Unless we’re not talking that day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed his arms, and childishly stuck out his tongue. I couldn’t help but laugh. The waitress came by with our hot chocolates, and we busied ourselves stirring in marshmallows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t blame you,” Jake began, and I expected one of the reversals that had followed the last few times he’d said those words. I can’t blame you for whatever problems you have, like not trusting me, he’d say, without ever owning up to his own flaws. But instead he continued, “I can’t blame you for being mad at me. But I want you to know, I’ve turned over a new leaf.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe irony that it was the dead of winter, and we wouldn’t see any new foliage till late spring didn’t avoid me. “How so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For starters, I’m buying us dinner tonight. And then next month, I’ll be paying for my half of the cell phone bill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pursed my lips. If we were normal, these things would have pleased me; they’d be signs my erstwhile brother was getting back up on his feet. But if Jake had taught me one thing, it was that everything always came with a hitch. “How are you affording it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake shrugged nonchalantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Seriously, Jake. I need to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been working very hard lately is all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About that, Jake.” I couldn’t very well tell my brother to quit hanging out with other homeless people—just white guys with dreadlocks who probably sold drugs. “What is it that you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This and that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Selling drugs,” I guessed, getting ready to scoot out of the booth. Was this the right time to make a scene? Was there ever a right time? Of all the things I would have thought that Jake could do to push me away, this was the last, biggest, final, straw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Energy supplements.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what they’re calling meth these days?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inhaled and exhaled. “I knew you would make this difficult, Edie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry. I’m glad you’re doing well. But if you’re taking money for running drugs, and then trying to buy me dinner with it, I just can’t stand for that.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moonshifted-edie-spence-2/page-27.html","bookId":2619,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:07 PM"}
