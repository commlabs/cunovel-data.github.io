Grady eyed the wound in the man’s side, then called for one of the Aes Sedai to handle the Healing. They bustled around—some of the Two Rivers men calling out that Lord Goldeneyes had returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaile. Faile had been here at Merrilor with the Horn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to find her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand was alone, unguarded in the wolf dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurn it, that doesn’t matter! Perrin thought. If I lose Faile . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Rand died, he would lose Faile. And everything else. There were still Forsaken out there. Perrin wavered. He had to go look for her, didn’t he? Wasn’t that his duty, as her husband? Couldn’t someone else look after Rand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut . . . if not him, then who?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough it ripped him apart, Perrin sought the wolf dream one last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoridin scooped Callandor up off the floor. It burst alight with the One Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand stumbled away, holding his aching hand to his chest. Moridin laughed, raising the weapon high. \"You are mine, Lews Therin. You are finally mine! I . . \". He trailed off, then looked up at the sword, perhaps in awe. \"It can amplify the True Power. A True Power sa’angreal? How? Why?\" He laughed louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA maelstrom churned about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Channeling the True Power is death here, Elan!\" Rand yelled. \"It will burn you to a cinder!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is oblivion!\" Moridin yelled. \"I will know that release, Lews Therin. I will take you with me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword’s glow turned a violent crimson. Rand could feel the power emanating from Moridin as he drew in the True Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the most dangerous part of the plan. Min had figured it out. Callandor had such flaws, such incredible flaws. Created so that a man using it needed women to control him, created so that if Rand used it, others could take control of him . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was Rand to need a weapon with such flaws? Why did the prophecies mention it so? A sa’angreal for the True Power. Why would he ever need such a thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was so simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now!\" Rand yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNynaeve and Moiraine channeled together, exploiting the flaw in Callandor as Moridin tried to bring it to bear against Rand. Wind whipped in the tunnel. The ground quivered, and Moridin yelled, eyes going wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took control of him. Callandor was flawed. Any man using it could be forced to link with women, to be placed in their control. A trap . . . and one he used on Moridin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Link!\" Rand commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fed it to him. Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaidar from the women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe True Power from Moridin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaidin from Rand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoridin’s channeling the True Power here threatened to destroy them all, but they buffered it with saidin and saidar; then directed all three at the Dark One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand punched through the blackness there and created a conduit of light and darkness, turning the Dark Ones own essence upon him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand felt the Dark One beyond, his immensity. Space, size, time . . . Rand understood how these things could be irrelevant now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a bellow—three Powers coursing through him, blood streaming down his side—the Dragon Reborn raised a hand of power and seized the Dark One through the Bore, like a man reaching through water to grab the prize at the rivers bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark One tried to pull back, but Rand\u0027s claw was gloved by the True Power. The enemy could not taint saidin again. The Dark One tried to withdraw the True Power from Moridin, but the conduit flowed too freely, too powerfully to shut off now. Even for Shai’tan himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it was that Rand used the Dark One’s own essence, channeled in its full strength. He held the Dark One tightly, like a dove in the grip of a hawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd light exploded from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 48\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Brilliant Lance\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne trotted her horse among heaps of dead Trollocs. The day was won. She had everyone who could stand searching for the living among the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many dead. Hundreds of thousands of men and Trollocs, lying in piles all across Merrilor. The rivers banks were slaughterhouses, the bogs mass graves, floating with corpses. Ahead of her, across the river, the Heights groaned and rumbled. She’d pulled her people away from there. She could barely sit on her horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire plateau collapsed upon itself, burying the dead. Elayne watched, feeling numb, feeling the ground shake. It—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up straight, feeling the swelling of power in Rand. Her attention flew away from the Heights, instead focused on him. The feeling of supreme strength, the beauty of control and domination. A light shot into the sky far to the north, so bright that she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThom stumbled back from the entrance to the Pit of Doom, shading his eyes with his arm as light—radiant as the sun itself—burst out of the cavern. Moiraine!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Light\", Thom whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight it was, breaking out of the top of the mountain of Shayol Ghul, a radiant beam that melted the mountain’s tip and shot straight into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin raised her hand to her breast, stepping away from the rows of wounded for whom she’d been changing linens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand, she thought, feeling his agonized determination. Far to the north, a beam of light rose into the air, so bright that it lit the Field of Merrilor even such a great distance away. The helpers and the wounded alike blinked, stumbling to their feet, shading their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat light, a brilliant lance in the heavens, burned away the clouds and opened up the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha blinked at the light, and knew it was Rand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt drew her back from the brink of darkness, flooding her with warmth. He was winning. He was winning. He was so strong. She saw the true warrior in him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearby, Graendal stumbled to her knees, eyes glazed over. The unraveling gateway had exploded, but not with as large a blast as last time. Weaves and the One Power had sprayed out, just as Graendal tried to spin Compulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Forsaken turned to Aviendha, and she adopted an adoring gaze. She bowed down, as if worshipping Aviendha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe explosion, Aviendha realized, numb. It had done something to the Compulsion weave. Honestly, she had expected that blast to kill her. It had done something else instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, glorious one\", Graendal said. \"Tell me what you wish of me. Let me serve you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAviendha looked back to the light that was Rand and held her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogain stepped from the ruins, holding a toddler—maybe two years of age—in his arms. The child’s weeping mother took her son from his hands. \"Thank you.
