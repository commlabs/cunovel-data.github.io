All were frozen in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, there rang out a soft but powerful sound, a clear note, golden, one long tone that encompassed everything. The sound of a horn, pure and beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat had heard that sound once before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMellar knelt beside Elayne, pressing the medallion against her head to stop her from channeling. \"This could have gone in a very different way, my Queen\", he said. \"You should have been more accommodating\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight. That leer was an awful thing. He had gagged her, of course, but she did not give him the satisfaction of crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would find a way to escape this. She had to shake free of the medallion. Of course, if she did, there was still the channeler. But if she could evade the medallion, then strike quickly . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pity that your little Captain-General isn’t alive to watch\", Mellar said. \"Fool that she was, I really do think she believed that she was Birgitte from the legends\". Elayne heard a soft sound in the distance. The ground vibrated. An earthquake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to concentrate, but she could only think that Birgitte had been right all along. It was fully possible for the babes to be safe, as Min had foretold, while Elayne herself was left dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite mist climbed up from the ground around them, like the souls of the dead, curling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMellar stiffened, suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElayne blinked, looking up at him. Something silvery jutted from the front of Mellar’s chest. It looked like . . . an arrowhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMellar turned, knife dropping from his fingers. Behind him, Birgitte Silverbow stood over her corpse, one foot to either side of the headless body. She raised a bow, bright as newly polished silver, and released another arrow, which seemed to trail light as it struck Mellar in the head and pitched him to the ground. Her next shot took Mellar’s channeler, killing the Dreadlord with a silver arrow before the man could respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll around them, Mellar’s men stood as if paralyzed, gaping at Birgitte. The clothing she now wore seemed to glow. A short white coat, a voluminous pair of pale yellow trousers and a dark cloak. Her long golden hair hung in an intricate braid, down to her waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Birgitte Silverbow\", Birgitte announced, as if to dispel doubt. \"The Horn of Valere has sounded, calling all to the Last Battle. The heroes have returned!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Mandragoran held aloft the head of one of the Forsaken—their battle commander, supposedly invincible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shadow’s army could not ignore what had happened, none of them, wherever they were on the battlefield. The voice that had come out of nowhere had proclaimed it. That the attacker should stand while the Chosen lay dead . . . it stunned them. Frightened them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the Horn sounded in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Press forward!\" Mat yelled. \"Press forward!\" His army threw themselves ferociously on to the Trollocs and Sharans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cauthon, what was that sound?\" Arganda demanded, stumbling up beside Pips. The man still had one arm in a sling and carried a bloodied mace in the other hand. Around Mat, the Deathwatch Guard fought and grunted, cutting down Trollocs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat yelled, throwing himself into the fight. \"That was the bloody Horn of Valere! We can still win this night!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Horn. How had the bloody Horn been sounded? Well, it looked like Mat wasn’t tied to the thing any longer. His death at Rhuidean must have broken him from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome other unlucky fool could bear that burden now. Mat howled a battlecry, shearing the arm off a Trolloc, then stabbing it through the chest. The Shadow’s entire army became disoriented at the sound of the Horn. Those Trollocs nearest Lan scrambled back, clawing over one another in desperate urgency to escape him. That left the Trollocs fighting along the slope spread thin, without reserves. And nobody seemed to be in charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMyrddraal nearby raised swords against their own Trollocs, trying to get those that were fleeing to turn back and fight, but flaming arrows shot by the Two Rivers archers fell from the sky and riddled the Fades’ bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTam al’Thor, Mat thought, I’m going to bloody send you my best pair of boots. Light burn me, but I will. \"To me!\" Mat shouted. \"All riders that can hold a flaming weapon, to me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat kicked Pips into a gallop, shoving his way through Trollocs that were still fighting. Mat’s attack opened the way for Furyk Karede and his few remaining men to punch the hole in the horde of Trollocs wider. Following that, the full force of the remaining Borderlanders poured through after Mat, toward Lan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sharan army showed signs of weakening, but they continued their offensive, their discipline forcing them to do what their hearts were calling them to end. Lan’s victory wouldn’t win the battle outright—there were far too many enemies—but without Demandred, the Shadow had lost direction. Even the Fades were showing the lack of a leader. The Trollocs began to fall back and regroup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat and the Borderlanders galloped southwest across the Heights and came to where Lan was standing. Mat jumped from his horse and grabbed Lan by the shoulder as the Malkieri king faltered. Lan looked at Mat with grim thanks, and then his eyes rolled back in his head and he started to fall, dropping Demandred\u0027s head to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man in a black coat rode over. Mat hadn’t realized that Narishma was still there, fighting alongside the Borderlanders. The Kandori Asha’man threw himself off his horse and took Lan by the other arm, then concentrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brief Healing was enough to bring Lan back to consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get him on a horse, Narishma\", Mat said. \"You can work on him more when we get back to our army. I don’t want to be stuck behind enemy lines if those Trollocs below decide to come back up the Heights\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rode back northeast, laying into the back of the Trollocs’ right flank with swords and lances as they swept past, which unsettled the beasts even more. Once past, the Borderlanders swung their mounts around and charged directly into the Trolloc hordes again, who were looking around in all directions, not sure where the next attack would be coming from. Mat and Narishma continued to ride toward their own back lines, with Lan in tow. Narishma eased the Malkieri off his horse and had him lie on the ground to continue the Healing, while Mat paused to consider their situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, mist gathered. Mat was struck with a terrible thought. He had ignored a terrible possibility. The Horn of Valere still called, a distant—yet unmistakable sound. Oh, Light, Mat thought. Oh, bloody stumps on a battlefield. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-280.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
