And as for The Vampire Lestat, when he came forth with his mighty rock music I thought it hysterically funny. What more perfect guise for a vampire, I thought, than that of a rock musician?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as his many short rock video films appeared, I realized that he was putting forth in that form the entire history which I had revealed to him. And I realized as well that blood drinkers all over the world were setting their cannons against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were young beings of whom I had taken no notice, and I was quite amazed now to hear their voices lifted in the Mind Gift, searching diligently for others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, I thought nothing of it. I did not dream his music could affect the world \u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;not the world of mortals or our world\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;not until the very night that I came down to the underground shrine and discovered my King, Enkil, a hollow being, a mere husk, a creature drained of all blood, sitting so perilously on the throne that when I touched him with my fingers, he fell onto the marble floor, his black plaited hair breaking into tiny splinters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn shock I stared at this spectacle! Who could have done such a thing, who could have drained him of every drop of blood, who could have destroyed him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where was my Queen, had she met the same fate, had the whole legend of Those Who Must Be Kept been a deception from the beginning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that it was not a lie, and I knew the one being who could have visited this fate upon Enkil, the only being in all the world who had such cunning, such intimacy, such knowledge and such power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds, I turned from the fallen husk of Enkil to discover her standing not three inches from me. Her black eyes were narrowed and quickened with life. Her royal raiment was the clothing I had placed upon her. Her red lips formed a mocking smile, and then there came from her a wicked laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated her for that laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feared her and hated her that she laughed at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll my sense of possession came to the fore, that she was mine and that she now dared to turn on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was the sweetness of which I had dreamt? I stood in the midst of a nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear servant,\" she said, \"you have never had the power to stop me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was inconceivable that this creature whom I had so protected throughout time could turn on me. It was inconceivable that this one whom I so completely adored now taunted me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething hasty and pathetic came from my lips:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what do you want? \" I asked, as I tried to grasp what was taking place. \"What do you mean to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a wonder that she even gave some mocking answer to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was lost in the sound of the television screen exploding, in the sound of metal ripping, in the sound of the ice falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith incalculable power she rose from the depths of the house, sending its walls, its ceilings, and its surrounding ice down upon me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself buried, calling for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the reign of the Queen of the Damned had commenced, though she had never taken that name for herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou saw her as she moved through the world. You saw her as she slew blood drinkers all around her, you saw her as she slew blood drinkers who would not serve her purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid you see her as she took Lestat as her lover? Did you see her as she sought to frighten mortals with her petty displays of old-fashioned power?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all the while I lay crushed beneath the ice\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;spared for what purpose I could not imagine\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;sending out my warning to Lestat that he was in danger, sending out my warning to all that they were in danger. And pleading as well with any Child of the Millennia who might come to help me rise from the crevasse in which I\u0027d been buried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as I called in my powerful voice I healed. I began to move the ice around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at last two blood drinkers came to assist me. I caught the image of one in the mind of the other. And it seemed impossible to me, but the one whom I saw so radiantly in the other\u0027s vision was none other than my Pandora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, with their help, I broke the ice that kept me from the surface, and I climbed free under the arctic sky, taking Pandora\u0027s hand, and then gathering her in my arms, refusing for a moment to think of anything, even of my savage Queen and her deadly rampage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no words now, no vows, no denials. I held Pandora in love and she knew it, and when I looked up, when I cleared my eyes of pain and love and fear, I realized that the blood drinker who had come North with her, he who had answered my summons, was none other than Santino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, I was filled with such hatred I meant to destroy him completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Pandora said, \"Marius, you can\u0027t. All of us are needed now. And why do you think he has come if not to repay you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there in the snow in his fine black garments, the wind whipping his black hair and I could see he was consumed with fear, but he would not confess it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is no repayment for what you did to me,\" I said to him. \"But I know Pandora is right, we\u0027re all needed, and for that reason, I spare you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my beloved Pandora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a council forming now,\" I said. \"It\u0027s in a great house in the coastal forest, a place of glass walls. We\u0027ll go there together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know of what happened then. We gathered at our great table in the redwood trees\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;as if we were a new and passionate Faithful of the Forest\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;and when the Queen came to us with her plan to bring harm to the great world, we all sought to reason with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her dream to be the Queen of Heaven to humankind, to slay male children by the billions, and make the world a \"garden\" of tender-spirited women. It was a horrific and impossible conception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one sought more diligently than your red-haired Maker Maharet to turn her from her goals, condemning her that she would dare to change the course of human history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI myself, thinking bitterly of the beautiful gardens I\u0027d seen when I had drunk her blood, risked her deadly power over and over by pleading with her to give the world time to follow its own destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, it was a chilling thing to see this living statue now speaking to me so coldly yet with such strong will and contemptuous temper. How grand and evil were her schemes, to slay male children, to gather women in a superstitious worship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat gave us courage to fight her? I don\u0027t know except that we knew that we had to do it. And all along, as she threatened us repeatedly with death, I thought: I could have prevented this, I could have stopped it from ever happening had I put an end to her and to all of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it is, she will destroy us and go on; and who will prevent her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point she knocked me backwards with her arm, so quick was her rage at my words. And it was Santino who came to my assistance. I hated him for this but there was no time for hating him or anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last she laid her condemnation down on all of us. As we would not side with her, we would be destroyed, one after another. She would begin with Lestat, for she took his insult to her to be the greatest. And he had resisted her. Bravely he had sided with us, pleading with her for reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this dreadful moment, the elders rose, the ones of the First Brood who had been made blood drinkers within her very lifetime, and those Children of the Millennia such as Pandora and myself and Mael and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before the murderous little struggle could begin, there came another into our midst, approaching loudly up the iron steps of the forest compound where we met, until in the doorway we beheld the twin of Maharet: her mute sister, the sister from whom Akasha had torn the tongue: Mekare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was she who, snatching the long black hair of the Queen, bashed her head against the glass wall, breaking it, and severing the head from the body. It was she and her sister who dropped down on their knees, to retrieve from the decapitated Queen, the Sacred Core of all the vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether that Sacred Core\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;that fatal root\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;was imbibed from heart or brain, I know not. I know only that the mute Mekare became its new tabernacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd after a few moments of sputtering darkness in which we all of us wondered whether or not death should take us now, we regained our strength and looked up to see the twins standing before us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaharet put her arm around Mekare\u0027s waist, and Mekare, come from brutal isolation I know not where, merely stared into space as though she knew some quiet peace but no more than that. And from Maharet\u0027s lips there came the words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Behold. The Queen of the Damned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reign of my beloved Akasha\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;with all its hopes and dreams\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf; had come abruptly to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I carried through the world the burden of Those Who Must Be Kept no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE LISTENER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe End of the Story of Marius \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-35.html","bookId":2594,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:49 PM"}
