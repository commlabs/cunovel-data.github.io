Then we see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe rang his bell and got no response. We went inside and climbed three flights of stairs, and the house was about what I\u0027d expected, with a Lysol smell battling the odors of cooking and mice and urine. Carlos led us to what he said was Shorter\u0027s door and banged on it with a heavy fist. \"Hey, open up,\" he called. \"This gen\u0027man wants to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not home,\" Carlos said, and shrugged. \"You want to write him a note, put it under the door, an\u0027 when he comes home-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you should open the door,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worried about him,\" I said. \"I think he might have had an accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bad one. Open the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say that,\" he said, \"but I\u0027m the one gets in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take the responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do I say, huh? \u0027This guy took the responsibility.\u0027 It\u0027s still my ass inna crack, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t open it,\" I told him, \"I\u0027ll kick it in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You serious?\" He looked at me and decided I was. \"You think maybe he\u0027s sick in there, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or worse than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s worse\u0027n sick?\" I guess it came to him, because he winced at the thought. \"Shit, I hope not.\" He hauled out a ring of keys, found his master passkey, and fitted it in the lock. \"Anyway,\" he said, \"you wouldn\u0027t have to kick it in, less\u0027n he got the chain on. These locks is nothin\u0027, you can slip \u0027em with a plastic card. But if the chain\u0027s on, shit, you still gonna have to kick it in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the chain wasn\u0027t on. He turned the lock, paused to knock on the door one final unnecessary time, and pushed the door inward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood in the doorway. I pushed past him, walked around the little room. It was as neat and bare as a monk\u0027s cell. There was an iron bedstead, a chest of drawers, a bedside table. The bed was made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drawers were empty. So was the closet. I looked under the bed. There were no personal articles anywhere, just the thrift-shop furniture that had been there when he moved in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess he moved out,\" Carlos said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone was on the beside table. I slipped a pencil under the receiver and lifted it enough to get a dial tone, then allowed it to drop back in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t say nothin\u0027 to nobody,\" Carlos said. \"He pays a week at a time, so he\u0027s paid through Sunday. Funny, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTJ walked over to the bed, picked up the pillow. There was a booklet under it. He took a close look at it and handed it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already knew what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It don\u0027t make sense,\" Carlos said. \"You gonna move out, why you gonna make the bed first? I got to change it anyway before I rent it to somebody else, don\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Course I do.\" He frowned, puzzled. \"Maybe he\u0027s comin\u0027 back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the AA meeting book, the one I\u0027d bought him, the only thing he\u0027d left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"He\u0027s not coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e25\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartin Banszak took off his rimless glasses and fogged the lenses with his breath, then polished each in turn with his handkerchief. When he was satisfied with the results he put them on and turned his sad blue eyes on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must know the caliber of men we get,\" he said. \"Guard work pays just one or two dollars an hour over the minimum wage. It\u0027s a job that requires no experience and minimal training. Our best men are retired police officers looking to supplement a city pension, but men like that can usually find something better for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We get fellows who are out of work and looking for stopgap employment until something opens up for them. They\u0027re often good workers, but they don\u0027t stay with us long. And then we get men who work for us because they can\u0027t do any better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of checks do you run on them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do the minimum. I try not to hire convicted felons. After all, this is security work. You don\u0027t hire the fox to guard the henhouse, do you? But it\u0027s hard to avoid. I can run computer checks, but what good is that when the name\u0027s a common one? \u0027Query: Has William Johnson been an inmate in the New York State prison system?\u0027 Well, there are probably half a dozen William Johnsons in prison in this state on any given day, so how am I to know? And when a man comes to me and says his name is William Johnson, how can I tell if it\u0027s the name he was born with? If a man shows me a Social Security card and a driver\u0027s license, what can I do but accept it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you run their prints?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It takes too long,\" he said. \"By the time I get a response from Washington, two weeks or more have passed. The applicant\u0027s found other work in the meantime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t you hire him provisionally? And let him go if he doesn\u0027t check out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that how they do it at Reliable? Well, I\u0027m sure you charge more for your services. A Manhattan firm, a fancy address. That\u0027s all well and good for the clients who can afford to cover your overhead for you.\" He picked up a pencil, tapped its eraser end on the desktop. \"I can\u0027t have half my employees checking up on the other half,\" he said. \"I\u0027d be out of business in no time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two years ago,\" he said, \"we tried taking fingerprints when we accepted applications for employment. You know what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your applications dropped off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s exactly right. People didn\u0027t want to go through a messy and demeaning process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Especially the ones with outstanding warrants,\" I said. \"It would have been particularly messy and demeaning for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared at me. \"And the ones who had stopped paying alimony,\" he said. \"And the ones running away from bad debts. And, yes, the ones who\u0027d served time for minor narcotics violations and other low-level criminal behavior. It\u0027s hard to grow up in certain neighborhoods without getting arrested and fingerprinted along the way. The bulk of those men do just fine in this line of work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Who was I to judge him, and what did I care how he ran his business? He fired men for drinking because it bothered the clients. But what client was bothered by the fact that the man guarding his warehouse had failed to pay child support, or sold a gram of cocaine to an undercover police officer? Those weren\u0027t offenses you could smell on a man\u0027s breath, or spot in his walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get back to Shorter,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShorter\u0027s file contained the application he\u0027d filled out, along with a record of the hours he\u0027d worked and the compensation he\u0027d received. No photograph, and I asked about that. Wasn\u0027t it part of the routine to photograph all employees?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" he said. \"We need a photo for their ID. We take them right here, in front of that wall. It\u0027s a perfect backdrop.\" So where was the photo? Laminated to the ID card, I was told, which Shorter would have turned in when they let him go, and which would have been routinely destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he turn it in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it was destroyed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must have been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the negative?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"We use a Polaroid. Everybody does. You want to be able to make up the ID right away, not wait for the film to come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So there\u0027s no negative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you only take the one shot? You don\u0027t shoot a backup to have on file?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do, actually,\" he said, and shuffled through the file. \"It doesn\u0027t seem to be here. It may have been misfiled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr removed from the file by Shorter, I thought. Or not taken in the first place, because Martin Banszak didn\u0027t seem to run the tightest ship around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another look at the application. Shorter had had the same address on East Ninety-fourth Street when he\u0027d applied for the job back in July of \u002792.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly of \u002792?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked the date with Banszak. Had Shorter actually been working there for seven months by the time Alan Watson was killed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and he was very steady, very reliable,\" he said. \"That\u0027s why I was inclined to give him a break when he had the first incident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The drinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He must have been ashamed, because he didn\u0027t even offer an argument in his own defense, just hung his head waiting to be fired. But his record was excellent, and he\u0027d been with us for over seven months, so I gave him that second chance.\" He frowned. \"The next time, of course, there was an official complaint called in. I had to let him go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven months. Waiting, biding his time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the application. \"I\u0027ll need a copy of this,\" I said. \"Is there a place in the neighborhood where I can get it copied?\" He said he had a desktop copier and would run it for me. He went into another room, came back with the copy but held on to it for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I\u0027m not sure I understand. If Shorter knows something, if he\u0027s disappeared in order to escape from the man who killed Watson\"- that was the explanation I\u0027d devised for him- \"shouldn\u0027t the police be brought into the picture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it comes to that,\" I said. \"But it looks as though Shorter\u0027s been living under an assumed name, and that he might have invented most of what\u0027s on that application. If I can spare him the embarrassment of official attention from the police-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course,\" he said. \"By all means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d carried a New York State driver\u0027s license, and its number was listed on his job application. But the DMV never heard of him, and the license number he\u0027d written down was unassigned. The Social Security number was real, but the account was that of a State Farm insurance agent in Emporia, Kansas, whose name was Bennett Gunnarson, not James Shorter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would have made my life easier if Banszak had fingerprinted his employees, even if he\u0027d done nothing with the prints but file them away. Earlier, I\u0027d left TJ on guard at the rooming house and cabbed down to the Flatiron Building and back, borrowing a fingerprint kit from Wally Donn at Reliable. Before I left Shorter\u0027s room I had fogged the telephone receiver with my breath the way Banszak had fogged his glasses. I hadn\u0027t seen any prints then, but sometimes they show up better when you dust for them. And the telephone wasn\u0027t the only surface in the room that would hold a print.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack on East Ninety-fourth, I dusted the phone, the window, the washbasin, the headboard and footboard, the switchplate, and everything else that looked at all promising. There was nothing, not even smudges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He cleaned up,\" I told TJ. \"He deliberately wiped every surface in the room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man be neat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man\u0027s a killer,\" I said. \"He killed Alan Watson back in February. A few days ago he killed Helen Watson, and- Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Helen Watson,\" I said. \"One time I was talking to him and he asked me if I\u0027d reached Helen Watson yet. How did he know her first name? He never heard it from me. Jesus, how long was he stalking them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had my answer now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been stalking Alan Watson for a minimum of seven months, from the time he\u0027d started work with Queensboro-Corona to the night he seized his opportunity and stuck a knife in the commodity broker\u0027s heart. God knows how many opportunities he must have had in all that time, but he\u0027d been in no hurry, he\u0027d been content to bide his time, waiting, letting the anticipation build. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-36.html","bookId":2330,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:24 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:24 AM"}
