This won\u0027t work with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s already working, thought Ramsey. He said, \"This is going to be a really gay bunch when we get to Novaya Zemlya. All of us looking over each other\u0027s shoulders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know where we\u0027re headed?\" gritted Bonnett. \"You weren\u0027t here when Skipper announced our destination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read tea leaves.\" Ramsey nodded toward the depth-gauge graph tape. \"Are we looking for that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett snapped his attention back to the tape. A sharp line broke off the tape, came back on after a brief interval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That a development,\" said Bonnett. \"Buzz the skipper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey depressed the black toggle of the number-one call button. \"Shall I hold course?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Quarter back on --Signal!\" He slapped the button for the range computer, shut off the drive. \"Eighteen miles.

They coasted silently while he watched the pipes on his screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow entered the control room. \"Signal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heading 270 degrees,\" said Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the depth here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four hundred feet, give or take a few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re forgetting something,\" said Ramsey. He pointed to the tape record of the deep fissure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hide in that thing?\" Bonnett\u0027s voice rose half an octave. \"We couldn\u0027t maneuver.

He watched the pulse-reader showing bottom depth below them. Abruptly, it fell off beyond the meter setting. Without being told, Ramsey brought the helm up to left until they were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover the fissure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down into it,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if it narrows down to nothing?\" asked Bonnett. \"We couldn\u0027t back out without fouling our tow-lines.
