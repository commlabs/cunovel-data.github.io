But when I saw those velvet lips, that chiseled jaw, I knew I had my Earthee! He was quirky and totally lunar, changing his hair color with the changing tide. I laughed when he didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find your seat!\" Mrs. Hanover commanded. \"You\u0027re disrupting my class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Hanover walked back toward her desk, but I didn\u0027t move and she bumped into me. Her pointer dropped to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Child!\" she said with an evil glare, bending her titanic body over, leaving a clear path to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raced out of the classroom and into a hallway filled with glittery white-and-blue students wearing huge feathery hats and carrying musical instruments that sounded like bellows from a whale. I pushed my way through. Which way had Earthdude gone? Left? Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chose left and raced down the stairwell, where a teacher was holding the door open for her musical students. \"Did you see a guy in a black shirt with blue hair?\" I asked desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guy kicking the lockers from one end of the hall to the other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded my head with a cheeky smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told him to get a drum,\" she said, pointing toward the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher opinion mattered. And she had seen everything through those angel blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to get away. The beach was my only solace, my surfboard my only friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran to the back of Seaside High, where I finally found the stadium. Thirty Earthteens sprinted around the track. Everyone was wearing white shirts and blue shorts. And not one of them sported blue hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw a group of students sitting on the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExhausted, I tried to catch my breath. A girl sitting on the first step was engrossed in a book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see a guy with blue hair?\" I asked her. She shook her head, not taking her eyes off the book. Seaside\u0027s white-and-blue band could have noisily\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time is it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held the book with one arm and extended her other, exposing her watch. Eleven forty-five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t see the ocean from here, but I could feel it calling me. I had been so close to completing my mission, and now success seemed so far away. I couldn\u0027t spend any more time scouring the Earth. My necklace and my Earthdude had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only had one choice. I had to go home! Tell Waverly all my new experiences - Earthdudes in blue jeans, Earthdudettes with different-colored toenails, and me walking through a crowded corridor instead of swimming through a winding tunnel. But worse, I\u0027d have to confess to the crime of borrowing and losing a family heirloom. Take all that was due me, and remember my Earthly experience with melancholy, far underneath the waves in a frigid boarding school in the Atlantic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel the ocean\u0027s waves inside me. I took off my shoes and walked down Seaside High\u0027s warm paved road, wanting to feel all there was to feel through my Earthly feet for the last time. I found the warm, grainy sand comforting, yet sad. I was leaving my dreams behind, as I made my way down the sandy beachfront. I passed the lifeguard stand and raced along the tide, not letting it catch my feet. Out of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if I would now be a famous merexplorer, celebrated throughout Pacific Reefs history as the one who made it back, winning awards, featured on talk shows, pictured in encyclopedias - but knowing in reality that I\u0027d only be able to tell Waverly of my experience. I stood up and, for one final time, gazed back at my new world and all its beauty - Seaside High peering over the hill, palm trees extending their branches to the sky, happy tourists sunning underneath the glistening sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd outside Mickey\u0027s Surfboard Hut - one Earthdude with illuminating blue hair!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raced back over the rocks, jumped onto the warm sand, and ran as hard as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me!\" I proclaimed, waving my arms. \"It\u0027s me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of breath, I finally reached my Earthdude, who stared wide-eyed, like he was drowning again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- glistening underwater, sparkling through an algebra classroom window, and giggling in Hanover\u0027s class. Now she was standing in front of me almost out of breath herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could I say to her now that I had the chance? I had waited what seemed like an eternity to see her again. Hadn\u0027t I made a fool of myself enough today?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I was elated. While she recovered her breath and pushed back her hair, I wished it were my hand exposing her perfect face. A million questions raced through my mind. Had she seen my ad? Where was she from? What was she doing in the ocean yesterday? I could barely believe that this beauty had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know who I am, don\u0027t you?\" she asked forcefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI now realized why she was here. Not to let me thank her, like I\u0027d originally intended, but just to get her necklace back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nervously fingered the chain in my pocket, as if I had ripped it off from a jewelry store. \"I waited at the stadium. Did you get my note?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I overslept. I looked all over school for you,\" she said, agitated. \"But I thought your hair was dark red.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I change it every week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that normal? Do you change your name every week, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s normal for me. But my name\u0027s always Spencer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Spencer, can I have the necklace?\" she asked suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I returned it to her now, I\u0027d lose her. She\u0027d show up for school tomorrow, hand in hand with Calvin Todd. I\u0027d be destined for the rest of my high-school days to watch her sparkling smile radiate toward him at football games as he scored touchdowns and more. I only had one choice. \"You saved my life, and I don\u0027t even know your name,\" I said urgently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Candy, I wanted to ask you something first. Before I give you back the necklace,\" I began, my grip slipping on the surfboard as I tried to muster up courage. \"I\u0027d like to pay you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want money,\" she insisted. \"I want my necklace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I want to thank you, properly. After school . . . Take you to the pier for dinner . . . Then I\u0027ll give it back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t respond, but impatiently looked toward the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your favorite restaurant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stay for dinner,\" she blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around, wishing Chainsaw were here. What would he say now? Then I noticed the Starbucks on the pier. \"Then how about a cup of coffee now, on the pier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up with sudden interest. \"I\u0027ve never been on the pier before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a first time for everything,\" I said, leading her to my favorite hangout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- I mean Spencer - make him feel he\u0027s not indebted to me anymore, and at the same time catch a few more Earthly sights, smells, and tastes. After half an hour, I\u0027ll say, \"It\u0027s been great, thanks, gotta go.\" He\u0027ll hand over great-grandpa\u0027s necklace, and when he looks away for a second, I\u0027ll dive safely back into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was overwhelmed by the pier\u0027s magical brilliance. Previously I had only glimpsed it from the rocks below or viewed it from the ocean, miles away. And now it was within my reach. A huge white wheel with red and silver dangling chairs stood in the distance,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wheezed from climbing the stairs and leaned on the boardwalk railing that overlooked the ocean, trying to recover my breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of coffee do you like?\" Spencer asked kindly, leading me into a shop with a freakish mermaid on the sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLatte, Frappuccino, cappuccino. The funny words I read meant nothing to me. I didn\u0027t even know what coffee was! \"I\u0027ll have whatever you have,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two double lattes,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never thought I\u0027d even visit Earth for a minute, much less a day, and here I was standing in a shop ordering drinks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my fingers over everything - drinking cups, bottles, hardened treats inside beautiful papers. I gazed at objects shaped like sponges and sea cucumbers beneath a glass counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want something?\" he offered, close behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\" I asked, looking for guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. But you pick this time. Anything in the store,\" he said proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was overwhelmed with choices and scanned the counter. There were mudlike squares displayed on a dish, a jar filled with red and white striped tubes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love some tips!\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re hilarious!\" he said, as he and the perky counter girl laughed at my choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two scones, please,\" he ordered, pointing to a puffy sand-colored orb inside the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led me outside where we sat on a wide wooden bench facing the ocean. I ingested my Earthly world at the same time I ingested my hardened spongy scone. Children ran along the beach, a young couple splashed each other in the water, two elderly Earthees walked arm in arm, an athletic man ran along the shoreline with his panting black dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So tell me everything,\" Spencer began between bites. \"Were you swimming or surfing the other day? Where did you live? Why did you transfer? Where do you live now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh . . . I live west.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the planetarium?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Closer to the beach . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh . . . by Yates Bluff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you?\" I asked, as a seagull called out overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I live with my dad in Pacific Cliffs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you ever see her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. In fact, I never even got to say good-bye to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never got to say good-bye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She ran off with a used car salesman. My dad wanted her to trade in our Chevy and she traded him instead. Now we only buy new cars!\" he said, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s so sad. Where I\u0027m from nobody ever leaves anyone - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I pretty much raised myself with the help of my friend Chainsaw, my surfboard, and a Blockbuster card.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Blockbuster card?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your story, Candy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh . . . me? I like to swim, my parents get majorly on my nerves, I hate high school. And I have a best friend, Waverly. But my life is so boring! It\u0027s not worth asking about. Can\u0027t we just sit?\" I asked. \"It\u0027s been a long day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure,\" he said, leaning back and staring off toward the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, I\u0027d rather know about you. Do you hang here often?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not during school. But don\u0027t worry. Seaside\u0027s a tourist trap, so no one really can tell who\u0027s who if you skip out of class. A major mistake, if you ask me, to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up at his chiseled face, the light in his eyes. I\u0027d been so distracted with these spectacular Earthly sights, that I failed to notice the spectacular sight right in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer caught my gaze and, embarrassed, I turned away. \"Well, Spencer . . . it\u0027s been . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you like your coffee?\" he asked, breaking the white plastic rim of his own cup into tiny pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, sure,\" I said. I took a gulp and almost choked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It tastes like mud!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes sparkled when he laughed, as if I had said the cutest thing he\u0027d ever heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get you some water,\" he offered with a smile. \"You sit tight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay. I have to - \" I began. But he bolted off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned back on the bench and pulled my legs up and hugged them with all my might. Spencer was really special. I felt drawn to him the same way I felt drawn to the ocean. I wondered what it would be like to sit in class with him every day, have him teach me to surf, lie in the grass and look up at the puffy clouds. But he\u0027d be returning with my water and I\u0027d have to get my necklace and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a tap on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Spencer?\" I said, turning around. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/teenage-mermaid/page-7.html","bookId":2151,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:09 PM"}
