Little and James Brown.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This little volume would have received an earlier notice, if we had been at all careful to proclaim our favorite books. The genius of this book is religious, and reaches an extraordinary depth of sentiment. The author, plainly a man of a pure and kindly temper, casts himself into the state of the high and transcendental obedience to the inward Spirit. He has apparently made up his mind to follow all its leadings, though he should be taxed with absurdity or even with insanity. In this enthusiasm he writes most of these verses, which rather flow through him than from him. There is no composition, no elaboration, no artifice in the structure of the rhyme, no variety in the imagery; in short, no pretension to literary merit, for this would be departure from his singleness, and followed by loss of insight. He is not at liberty even to correct these unpremeditated poems for the press; but if another will publish them, he offers no objection. In this way they have come into the world, and as yet have hardly begun to be known. With the exception of the few first poems, which appear to be of an earlier date, all these verses bear the unquestionable stamp of grandeur. They are the breathings of a certain entranced devotion, which one would say, should be received with affectionate and sympathizing curiosity by all men, as if no recent writer had so much to show them of what is most their own. They are as sincere a litany as the Hebrew songs of David or Isaiah, and only less than they, because indebted to the Hebrew muse for their tone and genius. This makes the singularity of the book, namely, that so pure an utterance of the most domestic and primitive of all sentiments should in this age of revolt and experiment use once more the popular religious language, and so show itself secondary and morbid. These sonnets have little range of topics, no extent of observation, no playfulness; there is even a certain torpidity in the concluding lines of some of them, which reminds one of church hymns; but, whilst they flow with great sweetness, they have the sublime unity of the Decalogue or the Code of Menu, and if as monotonous, yet are they almost as pure as the sounds of Surrounding Nature. We gladly insert from a newspaper the following sonnet, which appeared since the volume was printed.\n\u003cbr\u003e The Barberry Bush.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bush that has most briers and bitter fruit,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wait till the frost has turned its green leaves red,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Its sweetened berries will thy palate suit,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And thou may’st find e’en there a homely bread.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Upon the hills of Salem scattered wide,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Their yellow blossoms gain the eye in Spring;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And straggling e’en upon the turnpike’s side,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Their ripened branches to your hand they bring,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I ‘ve plucked them oft in boyhood’s early hour,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That then I gave such name, and thought it true;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But now I know that other fruit as sour\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Grows on what now thou callest Me and You;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yet, wilt thou wait the autumn that I see,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Will sweeter taste than these red berries be.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1378/41319.html","bookId":1432,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 11:30:11 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 11:30:11 AM"}
