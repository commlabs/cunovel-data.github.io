Sinter shook her head. ‘She’s not the running type.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, and neither are you. And now, it turns out, neither am I.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not my sister .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think,’ Kisswhere resumed, ‘tomorrow will be our last march. And you know, it’s all right. It was worth the try. Someone should tell her that. It was worth the try.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No spiders,’ said Hellian, settling her head back on the bedroll. ‘This is the best there is. This desert, it’s paradise. Let the flies and capemoths take my corpse. Even those damned meat-eating locusts. You won’t find a spider making a nest in my skull’s eye sockets – what could be better than that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What got you so scared of ’em, Sergeant?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about that. But then her mind wandered away, and she saw heaps of skulls, all of them smiling. And why not? Oh, yes, no spiders. ‘My father tells a story, especially when he’s drunk. He thinks it’s damned funny, that story. Oh, wait, is that my father? Could be my uncle. Or even my stepfather. Might even be my brother’s father, who lives down the lane. Anyway, it was a story and how he laughed. You got to know Kartool, Maybe. Spiders big enough to eat gulls, right?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Been there once, aye, Sergeant. Creepy place.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The redbacks are the worst. Not big, not much poisonous by themselves. One at a time, I mean. Thing is, when they hatch, there’s thousands, and they stick together for days, so they can kill big prey and all of them feed on it, right? And the egg-sacs, why, they can be hidden anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So, I was maybe two. Spent all day in a crib, every day, since my mother had another baby on the way only she kept getting fevers and eventually she went and lost it, which was stupid, since we had a good healer down the street, but Father drank up all the coin he made. Anyway. I had this doll—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh gods, Sergeant—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, they came out of its head. Ate right through the stuffing, and then out through the eyes and the mouth and everywhere else. And there I was: food. It was my half-brother who came in and found me. My head was swollen to twice its size – couldn’t even see my eyes – and I was choking. Counted two hundred bites, maybe more, since they were mostly in my hair. Now, as far as prey goes, I was too big even for a thousand redback babies. But they tried damned hard.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And that story made him laugh? What kind of fucked-up—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Watch it, that’s my father you’re talking about there. Or uncle, or stepfather, or the guy down the lane.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now I see it, Sergeant,’ said Touchy. ‘It’s all right. I see it. That’d scar anyone for life.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The story ain’t finished, Corporal. I ain’t got to the whole point of it. Y’see, I was eating them damned spiders. Eating ’em like candy. They said my belly was more swollen than my head, and that’s why I was choking so bad – they were biting me all the way down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So they brought in the healer, and she conjured up big chunks of ice. Into my mouth. Back of the throat. And all around my neck, too. Story goes that I had a stroke, from all that ice. Killed the part of my brain that knows when it’s time to stop.’ She stared up at the brightening sky. ‘They say I stole my first jug from my father’s stash when I was six. Got so drunk they needed to bring the healer back a second time. And that’s when she scried me inside and said I was in for a life of trouble.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand brushed her upper arm. ‘That’s a heartbreaking tale, Sergeant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is it?’ I suppose it is. Of course, I just made it up. Tug those heartstrings, see all that sweet sympathy in their sweet little faces. They’ll forgive me anything now .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do I hate spiders? Gods, who doesn’t? What a stupid question .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Faces in the Rock,’ said Urugal the Woven, crouching to scrape patterns in the hard ground. ‘Seven of the Dying Fires. The Unbound. These are our titles – we T’lan Imass cast out from our clans. We who failed in the wars. We who were cursed to witness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNom Kala shifted to look back upon the human camp – a dissolute column forming a jagged line across the hardpan. All motion was dying away there, the growing heat stealing all that was left. The humps of prostrate bodies stretched long shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We chose a Knight of Chains,’ Urugal went on, ‘and by his will we were freed from our prison, and by his will the chains shall one day shatter. Then we awaited the sanctification of the House of Chains.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-252.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
