I made Dickory a secret member of an entirely different secret club. Same with Mom, Dad and Babar. I was all about the secret clubs when I was nine, apparently. I couldn\u0027t even tell you what the name of that secret club was now. But Hickory still used the knock whenever my bedroom door was closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in,\" I said. I was standing by my bedroom window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHickory came in. \"It\u0027s dark in here,\" it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what happens when it\u0027s late and the lights are out,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you walking about,\" Hickory said. \"I came to see if you needed anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a warm glass of milk?\" I said. \"I\u0027m fine, Hickory. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll leave you,\" Hickory said, backing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"Come here a minute. Look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHickory walked over to stand next to me at the window. He looked where I pointed, to two figures in the road in front of our house. Mom and Dad. \"She has been out there for some time,\" Hickory said. \"Major Perry joined her a few minutes ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said. \"I saw him walk out.\" I heard her walk out, too, about an hour earlier; the squeaking of the springs on the screen door had gotten me out of bed. I hadn\u0027t been sleeping, anyway. Thinking about leaving Huckleberry and colonizing somewhere new was keeping my brain up, and then made me pace around. The idea of leaving was sinking in. It was making me twitchier than I thought it would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know about the new colony?\" I asked Hickory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do,\" Hickory said. \"Lieutenant Sagan informed us earlier this evening. Dickory also filed a request to our government for more information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you call them by their rank?\" I asked Hickory. My brain was looking for tangents at the moment, it seemed, and this was a good one. \"Mom and Dad. Why don\u0027t you call them \u0027Jane\u0027 and \u0027John\u0027 like everyone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not appropriate,\" Hickory said. \"It\u0027s too familiar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve lived with us for seven years,\" I said. \"You might be able to risk a little familiarity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you wish us to call them \u0027John\u0027 and \u0027Jane,\u0027 then we will do so,\" Hickory said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call them what you want,\" I said. \"I\u0027m just saying that if you want to call them by their first names, you could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will remember that,\" Hickory said. I doubted there would be a change in protocol anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be coming with us, right?\" I asked, changing the subject. \"To the new colony.\" I hadn\u0027t assumed that Hickory and Dickory would not be joining us, which when I thought about it might not have been a smart assumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our treaty allows it,\" Hickory said. \"It will be up to you to decide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course I want you to come,\" I said. \"We\u0027d just as soon leave Babar behind than not take you two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am happy to be in the same category as your dog,\" Hickory said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think that came out wrong,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHickory held up a hand. \"No,\" it said. \"I know you did not mean to imply Dickory and I are like pets. You meant to imply Babar is part of your household. You would not leave without him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not just part of the household,\" I said. \"He\u0027s family. Slobbery, sort of dim family. But family. You\u0027re family, too. Weird, alien, occasionally obtrusive family. But family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Zoe,\" Hickory said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome,\" I said, and suddenly felt shy. Conversations with Hickory were going weird places today. \"That\u0027s why I asked about you calling my parents by rank, you know. It\u0027s not a usual family thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we are truly part of your family, then it is safe to say it\u0027s not a usual family,\" Hickory said. \"So it would be hard to say what would be usual for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis got a snort from me. \"Well, that\u0027s true,\" I said. I thought for a moment. \"What is your name, Hickory?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hickory,\" it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean, what was your name before you came to live with us,\" I said. \"You had to have been named something before I named you Hickory. And Dickory, too, before I named it that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" it said. \"You forget. Before your biological father, Obin did not have consciousness. We did not have a sense of self, or the need to describe ourselves to ourselves or to others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would make it hard to do anything with more than two of you,\" I said. \"Saying \u0027hey, you\u0027 only goes so far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had descriptors, to help us in our work,\" Hickory said. \"They were not the same as names. When you named Dickory and me, you gave us our true names. We became the first Obin to have names at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I had known that at the time,\" I said, after I took this in. \"I would have given you names that weren\u0027t from a nursery rhyme.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like my name,\" Hickory said. \"It\u0027s popular among other Obin as well. \u0027Hickory\u0027 and \u0027Dickory\u0027 both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are other Obin Hickorys,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" Hickory said. \"Several million, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no possible intelligible response to that. I turned my attention back to my parents, who were still standing in the road, entwined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They love each other,\" Hickory said, following my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back at it. \"Not really where I was expecting the conversation to go, but okay,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes a difference,\" Hickory said. \"In how they speak to each other. How they communicate with each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose it does,\" I said. Hickory\u0027s observation was an understatement, actually. John and Jane didn\u0027t just love each other. The two of them were nuts for each other, in exactly the sort of way that\u0027s both touching and embarrassing to a teenage daughter. Touching because who doesn\u0027t want their parents to love each other, right down to their toes? Embarrassing because, well. Parents. Not supposed to act like goofs about each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey showed it in different ways. Dad was the most obvious about it, but I think Mom felt it more intensely than he did. Dad was married before; his first wife died back on Earth. Some part of his heart was still with her. No one else had any claim on Jane\u0027s heart, though. John had all of it, or all of it that was supposed to belong to your spouse. No matter how you sliced it, though, there\u0027s nothing either of them wouldn\u0027t do for each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why they\u0027re out here,\" I said to Hickory. \"In the road right now, I mean. Because they love each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How so?\" Hickory asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it yourself,\" I said. \"It makes a difference in how they communicate.\" I pointed again to the two of them. \"Dad wants to go and lead this colony,\" I said. \"If he didn\u0027t, he would have just said no. It\u0027s how he works. He\u0027s been moody and out of sorts all day because he wants it and he knows there are complications. Because Jane loves it here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than you or Major Perry,\" Hickory said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah,\" I said. \"It\u0027s where she\u0027s been married. It\u0027s where she\u0027s had a family. Huckleberry is her homeworld. He\u0027d say no if she doesn\u0027t give him permission to say yes. So that\u0027s what she\u0027s doing, out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHickory peered out again at the silhouettes of my parents. \"She could have said so in the house,\" it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"No,\" I said. \"Look how she\u0027s looking up. Before Dad came out, she was doing the same thing. Standing there and looking up at the stars. Looking for the star our new planet orbits, maybe. But what she\u0027s really doing is saying good-bye to Huckleberry. Dad needs to see her do it. Mom knows that. It\u0027s part of the reason she\u0027s out there. To let him know she\u0027s ready to let this planet go. She\u0027s ready to let it go because he\u0027s ready to let it go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it was part of the reason she\u0027s out there,\" Hickory said. \"What\u0027s the other part?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The other part?\" I asked. Hickory nodded. \"Oh. Well. She needs to say good-bye for herself, too. She\u0027s not just doing it for Dad.\" I watched Jane. \"A lot of who she is, she became here. And we may never get back here. It\u0027s hard to leave your home. Hard for her. I think she\u0027s trying to find a way to let it go. And that starts by saying good-bye to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you?\" Hickory said. \"Do you need to say good-bye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it for a minute. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I admitted. \"It\u0027s funny. I\u0027ve already lived on four planets. Well, three planets and a space station. I\u0027ve been here longest, so I guess it\u0027s my home more than any of the rest of them. I know I\u0027ll miss some of the things about it. I know I\u0027ll miss some of my friends. But more than any of that... I\u0027m excited. I want to do this. Colonize a new world. I want to go. I\u0027m excited and nervous and a little scared. You know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHickory didn\u0027t say anything to this. Outside the window, Mom had walked away a little from Dad, and he was turning to head back into the house. Then he stopped and turned back to Mom. She held out her hand to him. He came to her, took it. They began to walk down the road together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good-bye, Huckleberry,\" I said, whispering the words. I turned away from the window and let my parents have their walk. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zoe-s-tale-old-man-s-war-4/page-5.html","bookId":1561,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:36:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:36:55 PM"}
