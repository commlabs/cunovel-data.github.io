Clear Skies. [1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day started like every other day. When Sun Jicheng got out of bed, his clothing was already prepared by Liu Jin’niang, a former Imperial maid responsible for dressing the Emperor, and the sixteen young women she oversaw. [2, 3] In the hall outside his bedroom, he drank some Oolong tea from the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://tinyurl.com/24ebrvu\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eWuyi Mountains\u003c/a\u003e in Fujian, and then got into his special carriage and began his inspection tour of the 79 businesses he owned in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://tinyurl.com/pf2akvf\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eJinan city\u003c/a\u003e. [4, 5]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not the type of person who conformed to the normal patterns of everyday life. For example, he would often stay out drinking with clients all night. And yet, he would never let this interfere with his daily inspection. In fact, the route upon which he traveled would never change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting businesses wasn’t easy, and maintaining them successfully was even harder. Anyone who wanted to achieve such success must pay a price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng understood that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved his businesses in much the same way that a beautiful woman loves her good looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would often tell his friends, “Wealth might not make you happy, but it’s a lot better than being poor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng was about six feet tall. Stalwart and dashing, he knew how to enjoy himself, much unlike the other wealthy and powerful merchants who were his peers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the years of delicious food and drink had caused his belly to slowly protrude, but thanks to carefully tailored clothing, he looked much younger than his actual age. He could still race horses, drink liquor, and satisfy the most difficult to satisfy woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would never forget to remind others about this, and they would never forget this fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, a person like this had no death wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo every day when he left home, various experts from famous bodyguard agencies would accompany him. One of them was Qiu Budao, also called “As Stable as Mount Tai,” who in past years had successfully accomplished 91 bodyguard missions with no losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng’s carriage was specially manufactured, impervious to blades and arrows. The horses came from the stables of the “General Who Attacks the West,” every one exceedingly fine, with unmatchable stamina and speed, capable of running over 400 miles in one day without stopping. [6, 7]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis enormous mansion was similarly protected. Day and night, multiple shifts of guards watched over everything, each one a top-notch expert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo send someone like Sun Jicheng to the grave could not be considered a simple matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one would try to do such a thing. No one would dare take the risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho could ever imagine that he would die!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarring unforeseen circumstances, Sun Jicheng would usually eat lunch at at the Great Three Yuan restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps because he worried about his growing belly, or because of constant drinking, he would usually eat or drink nothing else during the day other than his Oolong tea. So of course he was very picky about his lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were many reasons why he chose to eat at Great Three Yuan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of the 79 businesses he owned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts head chef was a celebrity, specially hired from South China [8]. His “Marinated Shark’s Fin” and “Grilled Shark’s Fin” both were secret family recipes, handed down through the generations, and as luck would have it, Sun Jicheng’s favorite dish was Shark’s Fin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager of Great Three Yuan, Zheng Nanyuan, was not only picky about food, but when it came to wit and conversational ability, he was just the type of person Sun Jicheng liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most important thing was that Great Three Yuan was a very successful business with many customers. Sun Jicheng liked to look at people, and he liked people to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday was a day like any other. Big Boss Sun ate lunch at Great Three Yuan, drank a little alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually he would drink Chu Ye Ching, \u003ca href\u003d\"http://tinyurl.com/5l5z2e\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eMaotai\u003c/a\u003e, Daqu, Nu’er Hong, Mei Kuei Lu, and sometimes even Barley wine or Gucheng liquor shipped from distant regions. [9]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, he drank something even more difficult to acquire: Persian Red Wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat Three Yuan was the last stop on his inspection tour. Upon finishing his meal, he would go home. He would return to his room, which others rarely visited, take a nap, then once again resume his unique living routine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e— Being rich really was much more enjoyable than being poor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng was richer than almost anyone in the world, and happier too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had any way to kill him, nor any reason to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could he possibly die?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng truly understood how to enjoy himself, and wanted everything to be very exquisite, including his clothing, his food, his residence and his business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo of course, his bedroom was comfortable and resplendent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone with a brain could imagine that, but few could imagine what exactly his room was like. This was because few people had ever entered his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis room was a place for rest and sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it came time for rest and sleep, he never wanted women. And when it came time for women, he never wanted rest and sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e— A “wife” and a “woman” are different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA “wife” is not merely a “woman,” but someone with whom to share trials and tribulation, bitterness and sweetness, a support, a comfort, a partner, and a friend during times of loneliness, pain, disappointment and old age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng had no wife, and neither did he have friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrictly speaking, the friends he had were not truly his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e— It is lonely at the top; if a person manages to reach the pinnacle of something, that person will often find themselves quite lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs usual, it was about dusk when Sun Jicheng returned to that room so rarely seen by anyone else, but if seen, became the source of amazement, praise and envy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually, when he returned, he would take a short nap. But this time, he made an exception. From a secret compartment located next to his bed he pulled out a necklace crafted from Persian platinum, embedded with emeralds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the bedroom was a resplendent reception hall. On the walls hung paintings by \u003ca href\u003d\"http://tinyurl.com/kt7ylsc\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eWu Daozi\u003c/a\u003e and calligraphy by \u003ca href\u003d\"http://tinyurl.com/3fvxyd8\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eWang Xizhi\u003c/a\u003e [10, 11], and placed on a shelf was a vase carved from pure white jade. Facing the door was a reception armchair said to have been used by the emperor himself in the Imperial palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he sat down, a musical clinking could be heard coming from outside. The person he was waiting to see had arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Liu Jin’niang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Jiniang was a beautiful, gentle, mature and paid close attention to detail. Her skills in tailoring were unparalleled. She’d entered the Imperial Palace at the age of 11 and returned to at the age of 21 to manage Sun Jicheng’s clothing, footgear and headgear. No one in the world was more familiar with his physique and body structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat of course is a requirement for anyone tasked with creating a comfortable set of clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo truly, completely understand the body of a man is not easy, and she had used the most direct and effective method.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a beautiful woman, healthy and strong. The spring wind that night had blown oh so gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut from that night on, she never brought up the incident ever again. It seemed he, too, had forgotten. The two of them maintained a very professional working relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong ago in the deep recesses of the Imperial palace, she had learned to live in loneliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe setting sun shone in through the window. Sun Jicheng looked at her cold, beautiful face, and let out a soft sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s been ten years,” he said with a sigh. “It’s ten years, correct?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Jin’niang’s face appeared completely cold and emotionless. A woman of her upbringing would surely never allow emotions to show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, she felt a stab of pain in her heart. She knew exactly how many days had passed since that spring night. She would forever remember, completely clearly. It was ten years, one month and three days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you been happy throughout these years?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would say neither happy nor unhappy,” she said coolly. “Now that I think about it, the ten years seem to have passed in the blink of an eye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many frigid winter nights spent alone, so many lonely spring evenings, could they really pass in the blink of an eye?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng sighed again, then suddenly stood up and walked over to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know I’ve let you down,” he said. He lifted up the necklace. “This is a little something from me. Would you allow me to put it on you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Jin’niang nodded her head silently. And yet, as soon as Sun Jicheng reached her and placed the necklace around her neck, she suddenly wanted to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be that after ten years of indifference, he had suddenly recalled that one night of passion and tenderness?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as the tears began to pour down her face, he suddenly tightened his grip, using the beautiful necklace to send her to her death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not die in suffering, because she truly did not believe that he would treat her with such vicious treachery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one could possibly figure out why he killed her, because, truthfully, he had no reason to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beautiful necklace hung from the beautiful neck. And yet, the beauty had long since passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe setting sun slowly began to fade, replaced gradually by evening gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng, steady and cool-headed as usual, slowly pushed open the rear window and vanished into the night like a wisp of smoke, disappearing into the darkness in the twinkling of an eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 4\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark of evening approached. Qiu Budao still lay on his bed. Last night, he had been on duty for the graveyard shift and hadn\u0027t been able to go to sleep until morning. When on duty, he gave it his all, just as he did when working bodyguard missions. Even though he knew nothing untoward would happen, he still refused to display the slightest negligence or complacency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had taken much blood and sweat to earn the moniker “As Stable as Mount Tai,” but it would take only one moment of negligence to lose it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter experiencing countless risks to life and limb, he truly had achieved the “stability.” No matter what type of arrow or sword were thrust toward him, he would not become flustered. Even if his whole family’s fate rested on the roll of a die, he wouldn’t bat an eye if the roll turned out to be a one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut recently, he often felt tired. In actuality, a 55-year-old man shouldn’t be doing this type of work. Sadly, a force existed behind him which lashed him forward like a donkey chained to a millstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed the wheel of life gradually was crushing his robust frame into a bloody slab of meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed to himself, preparing to get out of bed and light the lamp on the table. He never imagined that just as he began to walk forward, a hand would suddenly tap his shoulder from behind. His entire body instantly turned ice-cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, someone had entered his room without him being aware of it and then sneaked up on him. This should be fundamentally impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold sweat broke out all over his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand neither took advantage of the situation to strike at his jugular, nor did it stab further into his shoulder. Instead, a mild voice spoke: “There’s no need to light the lamp. I can see you, just as you can see me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiu Budao recognized the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monstrous demon behind him was none other than his employer, Big Boss Sun Jicheng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng removed his hand, allowing Qiu Budao to turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the darkness of twilight, Qiu Budao’s face was a pale white as paper, but his expression calm and collected. He had been through countless battles, and every time he bounced back from an unfavorable situation was by relying on “stability.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng\u0027s eyes shone with admiration, but the warmth turned to coldness in a flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot allowing Qiu Budao to even open his mouth, he asked a very strange question, one word at a time: “When did you find out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Find out what?” he replied, confused. The question was so sudden, he didn’t know how to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng laughed. But the laughter did not touch his eyes. He looked at Qiu Budao for a while, and then one word at a time said: “My secret.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your secret? What secret?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since you already know, do I really need to say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiu Budao said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see that the person standing in front of him was not someone who could be fooled easily. Trying to put on a front would do no good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did you find out?” he suddenly replied. “When did you realize I’d uncovered your secret?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis question was also a reply of sorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve always been a poor gambler, always losing horribly. And yet, during the past two months you’ve slowly been repaying your debts. Who is helping you to pay off your creditors?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiu Budao refused to answer, and Sun Jicheng didn’t press him further. Instead, he continued, “Of the 72 guards in the three squads you command, 13 have been replaced in the last two months. Every three to five days, you switch someone out. When on duty, you place them as far away from me as possible.” He smiled. “Did you think I wouldn’t notice?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, just before Sun Jicheng opened his mouth to reply, Qiu Budao’s hand shot out like a thunderbolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiu Budao usually trained with a broadsword, and trained quite well. No one could call his technique anything but first-rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet he rarely used a broadsword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fists could be considered deadly weapons, even more powerful and fearsome than his broadsword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had always believed that if you use a weapon, there will eventually be a time when that weapon is not at hand. When his second uncle “Invincible Double Whips” Qiu Sheng’s trademark double whips had been stolen, he had subsequently died a bitter death in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFists could never be stolen. So from childhood he had trained in fist techniques. And even though it had entailed countless hardships and tribulations, he had trained under the banner of the Shaolin Temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone acknowledged that Shaolin’s “Dragon Subduing, Tiger Vanquishing Lohan Divine Fist” was an unrivaled fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fist technique was fierce and potent, incredibly swift and strong. Especially the first form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnd things with one stance, a fatal fist. When experts fight, victory and defeat are usually decided in one stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had always reckoned the first stance to be the most crucial, and this viewpoint was beyond doubt correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his fist shot out, although he couldn’t be completely certain it would strike his opponent, he believed that he would at least be able to open an opportunity to make an escape. Forty years of bitter, year-round training and three hundred blood-soaked battles gave him supreme confidence in his sense of judgement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, this time he’d erred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as his fist shot out with a power like lightning, he saw a blur, and the opponent he wished to devastate with his strike, was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in that exact moment, he felt his wrist being restrained. All the power in his body suddenly dissipated and his wrist was twisted around behind his back. He had no strength to resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiu Budao was petrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis iron fists, which had smashed the noses and ribs and even souls of countless Shaolin Temple experts, had been restrained in the duration of one stance. Forty years of fist training seemed like child’s play to this person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat poured down the shocked face of “As Stable as Mount Tai” Qiu Budao. He had never dreamed that a multi-millionaire playboy would be so fearsome, and would possess such demonic kung fu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng sighed. “I made a mistake,” he said. “This time it’s my mistake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one who made a mistake was Qiu Budao, wasn’t it? Not him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiu Budao couldn’t help but ask, “You made a mistake? What mistake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no way to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Know what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know my secret,” he said coldly. “And you don’t know who I am. I challenge you to make even one more move against me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” said Unstoppable Qiu hoarsely. “Just who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng didn’t respond.

But Qiu Budao was an exception, because even more so than Sun Jicheng, he wanted to know the truth of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Who was this mysterious and fearsome multi-millionaire? What was his secret?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only way to find out the truth behind others’ secrets, is to first be honest—everyone in Jianghu understood this truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Although I never believed that you built your own fortune from scratch, I never even imagined that you would be a consummate expert of the martial world.

Among them, only four have yet to be caught. And yet, you could not be one of those four. As far as your age, appearance and stature, you don’t match any of their descriptions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng smiled. “As of now you can surely see that my martial arts far exceed yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiu Budao conceded this point.

I’ve never heard of anyone with their names in Jianghu before, nor seen anyone like them.” His voice seemed to be filled with a strange dread. “They suddenly appeared, as if they’d arrived from a strange place that no one has ever been to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun Jicheng’s smile had disappeared; his pupils constricted.

They didn’t require much of me. Just for me to allow them to place some people in my three squads. So…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you agreed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he said. “I agreed.

Qiu Budao had also figured out what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Of course Sun Jicheng hadn’t built up a business from scratch into a fortune. And he actually was not rich businessman, picky about food, in love with doing business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—He was someone entirely different, a person who for some reason, because he needed to keep his true identity hidden, had brought his ill-gotten hundreds of millions along with hands reeking of blood here, to hide from his foes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—But he knew that the net of heaven is wide, and none can escape its mesh. [12] His secret would get out eventually, and so he’d already prepared someone to die in his place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—This person looked exactly like him in every way. Only his voice was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Because by the time others found him, he would be dead, and dead men cannot speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not die in pain, because Sun Jicheng struck him with a mortal fist blow.

That is definitely the killing method that ‘As Stable as Mount Tai’ Qiu Budao would use. So this Sun Jicheng clearly died by your hand, and had nothing to do with anyone else. Everyone will be able to see that clearly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe washed his hands in a silver basin and then dried them with a snow-white cloth.

Up to now, he hadn’t been able to see everything clearly. The necklace with the emerald pendants was actually his, something left behind by his deceased wife. He’d kept it for so long, not willing to part with it even during his worst episodes of gambling loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t look at it often, because the memories it dredged up were sweet, yet too sorrowful.

Even if you can’t think of one, others will come up with their own ideas for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “They will probably all come up with unique ideas.

Thankfully, whatever ideas they have don’t really affect you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiu Budao stared at him for a long time, and then, one word at a time, said, “I understand what you mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should,” said Sun Jincheng. “Sun Jicheng is already dead, as is Liu Jin’niang.
