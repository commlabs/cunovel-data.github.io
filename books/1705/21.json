He was so disoriented he no longer remembered where he was on the wing. Was the ladder in front of him or behind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother creak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to fix the sound. It was coming somewhere in front of him. That meant he was facing the tail, the rear of the wing. Facing the ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother creak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many steps were there? Roughly six feet, six steps. Benson would be standing on the wing soon. What could he use for a weapon? Morris patted his pockets. His clothes were soaked and clinging with sweat. He had a momentary thought that this was all ridiculous, that Benson was the patient and he was the doctor. Benson would listen to reason. Benson would do as he was told.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother creak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shoe! Quickly, he slipped off his shoe, and cursed the fact that it had a rubber sole. But it was better than nothing. He gripped the shoe tightly, held it above his head, ready to swing. He had a mental image of the beaten mechanic, the disfigured, bloody face. And he suddenly realized that he was going to have to hit Benson very hard, with all the strength he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to have to try to kill Benson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no more creaking sounds, but he could hear breathing. And then, distant at first but growing rapidly louder, he heard sirens. The police were coming. Benson would hear them, too, and would give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother creak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenson was going back down the ladder. Morris breathed a sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he heard a peculiar scratching sound and felt the wing beneath his feet shake. Benson had not climbed down. He had continued to climb up, and was now standing on the wing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Morris?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorris almost answered, but didn\u0027t. He knew then that Benson couldn\u0027t really see, either. Benson needed a voice fix. Morris said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Morris? I want you to help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sirens were louder each moment. Morris had a momentary elation at the thought that Benson was going to be caught. This whole nightmare would soon be over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please help me, Dr. Morris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps he was sincere, Morris thought. Perhaps he really meant it. If that were so, then as his doctor he had a duty to help him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorris stood. \"I\u0027m over here, Harry,\" he said. \"Now, just take it easy and- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething hissed in the air. He felt it coming before it hit. Then he felt agonizing pain in his mouth and jaw, and he was knocked backward, rolling across the wing. The pain was awful, worse than anything he had ever felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he fell into blackness. It was not far to fall from the wing to the ground. But it seemed to be taking a long time. It seemed to take forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Ross stood outside the treatment room in the emergency ward, watching through the small glass window. There were six people in there taking care of Morris, all clustered around him. She couldn\u0027t see much. All she could really see were his feet. He had one shoe on; the other was off. There was a lot of blood; most of the EW people were spattered with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding outside with her, Anders said, \"I don\u0027t have to tell you what I think of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man is terribly dangerous. Dr. Morris should have waited for the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the police didn\u0027t catch him,\" she said, suddenly angry. Anders didn\u0027t understand anything. He didn\u0027t understand how you could feel responsible for a patient, how you could want to take care of somebody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morris didn\u0027t catch him, either,\" Anders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why didn\u0027t the police get him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Benson was gone when they got to the hangar. There are several exits from the hangar, and they couldn\u0027t all be covered. They found Morris under the wing and the mechanic on top of the wing, and they were both pretty badly hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe treatment-room door opened. Ellis came out, looking haggard, unshaven, defeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is he?\" Ross said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s okay,\" Ellis said. \"He won\u0027t have much to say for a few weeks, but he\u0027s okay. They\u0027re taking him to surgery now, to wire up his jaw and get all the teeth out.\" He turned to Anders. \"Did they find the weapon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnders nodded. \"Two-foot section of lead pipe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must have got it right in the mouth,\" Ellis said. \"But at least he didn\u0027t inhale any of the loose teeth. The bronchi are clean on lung films.\" He put his arm around Janet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll fix him up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the other one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The mechanic?\" Ellis shook his head. \"I wouldn\u0027t place bets. His nose was shattered and the nasal bones were driven up into the substance of the brain. He\u0027s leaking CSF through the nostrils. Lot of bleeding and a big problem with encephalitis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnders said, \"How do you assess his chances?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s on the critical list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Anders said. He walked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss walked with Ellis out of the emergency ward toward the cafeteria. Ellis kept his arm around her shoulders. \"This has turned into a horrible mess,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will he really be all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was kind of good-looking...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll get his jaw back together. He\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cold?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cold,\" she said, \"and tired. Very tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had coffee with Ellis in the cafeteria. It was 6:30, and there were a lot of staff people eating. Ellis ate slowly, his movements showing fatigue. \"It\u0027s funny,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a call this afternoon from Minnesota. They have a professorship in neurosurgery to fill. Asked me if I was interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that funny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told them I wasn\u0027t considering anything until I was fired here,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure that\u0027ll happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you?\" he said. He stared across the cafeteria at all the nurses and interns and residents in white. \"I wouldn\u0027t like Minnesota,\" he said. \"It\u0027s too cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s a good school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. A good school.\" He sighed. \"A fine school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt sorry for him, and then suppressed the emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had brought it on himself, and against her advice. For the last twenty-four hours, she had not allowed herself to say \"I told you so\" to anyone; she had not allowed herself to think it. For one thing, it wasn\u0027t necessary to say it. For another, it would not be useful in helping Benson, which was her chief concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t have much sympathy now for the brave surgeon. Brave surgeons risked other people\u0027s lives, not their own. The most a surgeon could lose was his reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said, \"I better get back to the NPS. See how things are going. You know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope they kill him,\" Ellis said. And he walked away toward the elevators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operation began at 7 p.m. She watched from the overhead glass viewing booth as Morris was wheeled into the OR, and the surgeons draped him. Bendixon and Curtiss were doing the procedure; they were both good plastic surgeons; they would fix him up as well as anybody possibly could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was still a shock to watch as the sterile gauze packs were taken away from Morris\u0027s face and the flesh exposed, The upper part of his face was normal, though pale. The lower part was a red mash, like butcher\u0027s meat. It was impossible to find the mouth in all the redness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllis had seen that in the emergency ward. It was shocking to her now, even at a distance. She could imagine the effect much closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stayed to watch as the drapes were placed over the body, and around the head. The surgeons were gowned and gloved; the instrument tables set in position; the scrub nurses stood ready. The whole ritual of preparing for surgery was carried out smoothly and efficiently. It was a wonderful ritual, she thought, so rigid and so perfect that nobody would ever know - and the surgeons themselves probably didn\u0027t consider - that they were operating on a colleague. The ritual, the fixed procedure, was anaesthetic for the surgeon just as gas was anaesthetic for the patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stayed a few moments longer, and then left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she approached the NPS, she saw that a cluster of reporters had cornered Ellis outside the building. He was answering their questions in clear bad humor; she heard the words \"mind control\" repeated several times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling slightly guilty, she cut around to the far entrance and took the elevator to the fourth floor. Mind control, she thought. The Sunday supplements were going to have a field day with mind control. And then there would be solemn editorials in the daily papers, and even more solemn editorials in the medical journals, about the hazards of uncontrolled and irresponsible research. She could see it coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMind control. Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was that everybody\u0027s mind was controlled, and everybody was glad for it. The most powerful mind controllers in the world were parents, and they did the most damage. Theorists usually forgot that nobody was born prejudiced, neurotic, or hung-up; those traits required a helping hand. Of course, parents didn\u0027t intentionally damage their children. They merely inculcated attitudes that they felt would be important and useful to their children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewborn children were little computers waiting to be programmed. And they would learn whatever they were taught, from bad grammar to bad attitudes. Like computers, they were undiscriminating; they had no way to differentiate between good ideas and bad ones. The analogy was quite exact: many people had remarked on the childishness and the literalness of computers. For example, if you could instruct a computer to \"Put on your shoes and socks,\" the computer would certainly reply that socks could not be fitted over shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the important programming was finished by the age of seven. Racial attitudes, sexual attitudes, ethical attitudes, religious attitudes, national attitudes. The gyroscope was set, and the children let loose to spin off on their predetermined courses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMind control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about something as simple as social conventions? What about shaking hands when you meet someone? Facing forward in elevators? Passing on the left? Having your wineglass on the right? Hundreds of little conventions that people needed in order to stereotype social interaction- take away any of them, and you produce unbearable anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople needed mind control. They were glad to have it. They were hopelessly lost without it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut let a group of people try to solve the greatest problem in the world today - uncontrolled violence - and suddenly there are shouts from all sides: mind control, mind control!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was better, control or uncontrol?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got off at the fourth floor, brushed past several policemen in the hallway, and went into her office. Anders was there, hanging up the telephone. And frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just got our first break,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" Her irritation dissipated in a wave of expectancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Anders said, \"but I\u0027ll be damned if I know what it means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Benson\u0027s description and his pictures are being circulated downtown, and somebody recognized him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A clerk in Building and Planning, in City Hall. He said Benson came in ten days ago. Building and Planning files specifications on all public structures erected within city limits, and they administer certain building codes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Benson came in to check specs on a building. He wanted to review electrical blueprints. Said he was an electrical engineer, produced some identification.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss said, \"The girls at his house said he\u0027d come back for some blueprints.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, apparently he got them from Building and Planning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"University Hospital,\" Anders said. \"He has the complete wiring system for the entire hospital. Now what do you make of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy eight o\u0027clock, she was almost asleep standing up. Her neck was hurting badly, and she had a headache. She realized that she didn\u0027t have a choice any more - either she got some sleep, or she\u0027d pass out. \"I\u0027ll be on the floor if you need me,\" she told Anders, and left. She walked down the corridor of the NPS, past several uniformed cops. She no longer noticed them; it seemed as if there had always been cops in the hallways for as long as she could remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked into McPherson\u0027s office. He was sitting behind his desk, head on his shoulder, sleeping. His breath came in short, ragged gasps. It sounded as if he were having nightmares. She closed the door quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn orderly walked past her, carrying filled ashtrays and empty coffee cups. It was strange to see an orderly doing cleaning duties. The sight triggered a thought in her mind - something unusual, some question she couldn\u0027t quite formulate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt nagged at her mind, but she finally gave up on it. She was tired; she couldn\u0027t think clearly. She came to one of the treatment rooms and saw that it was empty. She went in, closed the door, and lay down on the examination couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was almost instantly asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the lounge, Ellis watched himself on the 11-o\u0027clock news. It was partly vanity and partly morbid curiosity that made him do it. Gerhard was also there, and Richards, and the cop Anders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the screen, Ellis squinted slightly into the camera as he answered the questions of a group of reporters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrophones were jammed up toward his face, but he seemed to himself calm. That pleased him. And he found his answers reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporters asked him about the operation, and he explained it briefly but clearly. Then one asked, \"Why was this operation done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The patient,\" Ellis answered, \"suffers from intermittent attacks of violent behavior. He has organic brain disease - his brain is damaged. We are trying to fix that. We are trying to prevent violence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one could argue with that, he thought. Even McPherson would be pleased with it as a polite answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that common, brain damage associated with violence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know how common it is,\" Ellis said. \"We don\u0027t even know how common brain damage alone is. But our best estimates are that ten million Americans have obvious brain damage, and five million more have subtle brain damage.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-terminal-man/page-21.html","bookId":1705,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
