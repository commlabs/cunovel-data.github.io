Dasha cried, which he hated, because he hated to see women cry, and she pleaded, which he also did not like much. But he did not relent. Alexander could not tell Dasha he was furious with her younger sister. Furious with a shy, tiny thing who could fit into the palm of his hand if she crouched, yet who would not surrender one stride, not even for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days later Alexander almost felt glad he wasn’t seeing Tatiana’s face anymore. He found out that the Germans were just eighteen kilometers south of the barely fortified Luga line, which in turn was just eighteen kilometers south of Tolmachevo. Information came into the garrison that the Germans had combed through the entire town of Novgorod in a matter of a few hours. Novgorod, the town southeast of Luga, was where Tatiana cartwheeled into Lake Ilmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe People’s Volunteer Army, though tens of thousands strong, had just begun digging the trenches in Luga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnticipating the threat of the Finns, most of the resources for field mining, antitank trenching, and concrete reinforcements had gone to the north of Leningrad. The Finnish-Soviet front line in southern Karelia was the best-defended line in the Soviet Union — and the quietest. Dimitri must be happy, Alexander thought. Hitler’s precipitous advance south of Leningrad, however, had caught the Red Army by surprise. They scrambled to build a line of defense along 125 kilometers of the Luga River from Lake Ilmen to Narva. There were some entrenchments, some gun emplacements, some tank traps dug, but not nearly enough. The Leningrad command, realizing that something had to be done and done immediately, loaded the concrete tank barriers from Karelia and trucked them down to Luga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all the while the Red Army had been retreating after days of constant fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t just retreating. It was relinquishing ground to the Germans at the rate of 500 kilometers in the first three weeks of war. There was no more air support, and the few tanks the Red Army had were insufficient, despite Tatiana’s best efforts. In the middle of July the army comprised mostly rifle squads against the German Panzer units of tanks, mobile artillery, planes, and foot soldiers. The Soviets were running out of arms and out of men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hope for defending the Luga line now fell to the hordes of People’s Volunteers, who had no training and, worse, no rifles. They were just a wall of old men and young women standing up against Hitler. What weapons they could pick up, they picked up from the dead Red Army soldiers. Some volunteers had shovels, axes, and picks, but many did not have even that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander didn’t want to think about how sticks held up to German tanks. He knew.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bronze-horseman-the-bronze-horseman-1/page-14.html","bookId":1855,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:28 PM"}
