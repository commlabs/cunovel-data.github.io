Frank’s father also received from the railroad company the sum of two thousand dollars for the accident on the road, and these combined sums gave him a sufficient capital with which to start life anew.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I feel like a rich man,” said Mr. Hardy. “I shall take good care not to let my money slip through my fingers again.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What business will you go into, father?” asked Frank.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will see about that later.
