Jake saves me by pointing out the animals in the pens, \"What\u0027s that Andy?\" Andy giggles and takes his hand to show him something called a cheep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar comes up with a grin and muscles like I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve never seen on a girl. I point, \"What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs, \"Been learning to be a smithy.\" She wraps her arms around me, hugging me fiercely. She pulls back, \"How\u0027s the farmhouse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe means how\u0027s Will, but she won\u0027t ask. I appreciate that. I nod, \"Good. Everyone is good.\" I point behind me, \"I\u0027m going to say hi to Meg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winks, \"Say hi to Bernie while you\u0027re there. It\u0027s his bush too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and walk toward the massive rose bush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man walks up to me, meeting me along the way, \"Emma!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile when I see him, \"Mitch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wraps his arms around me, smelling my hair and shaking his head, \"I heard about Will and Bernie. I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull back, \"Will\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face drops, \"He\u0027s alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, \"Oh thank God. I heard he was killed. I nearly died myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s at the farmhouse I used to hide at. We built a wheat farm there. Got a lot of the retreat people there for the winters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile is still sweet. He nudges me, \"You\u0027re taking me with you when you go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No way. You gotta stay here and help out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolls his eyes, \"It\u0027s already bigger than it needs to be. Star is figuring out how to make bullets now. She\u0027ll have a factory in no time.\" He stares at her for a second, like he\u0027s getting lost in thought and repressed emotions. When he snaps out of it, he shakes his head, \"No, I need to leave here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand and nod, \"Alright. We ride out tomorrow. Sully wants me to take two more horses, so you can ride one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. Leo comes strolling up, sniffing Mitch. He makes his happy wolf face after a second. Mitch squats to scratch Leo\u0027s face, grinning up at me, \"You know you need my skills anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort, \"It\u0027s sad, but you could be the difference between survival and not. We don’t have a lot of snipers at the farmhouse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winks, \"I hear you got a lot of ladies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fold my arms over my chest, \"We do. You know how to deliver a baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles, standing up, \"I do. I did it once. It was scary as shit, but I can I do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slap his arm, \"Then you\u0027ll be popular.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face blushes a little. He\u0027s normally the strong, silent type; he\u0027s me but a guy. Star strolls over, looking strong and confident, \"You hear the towns have started up law enforcement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"They always had guards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"Sheriffs. They started swearing in sheriffs and judges. With no farms and camps, and no city, the towns are becoming real towns. They\u0027re trying to get rid of the corruption.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes, \"Kind of a day late and a dollar short.\" I read that in one of Granny\u0027s novels. I love that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs, \"It\u0027s better than nothing. We\u0027ve been thinking since we have ten houses, we might do the same. You guys should too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Mitch, \"You wanna be my sheriff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods once, \"I\u0027d do anything for you, Em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe comment makes me uncomfortable, just a little. I pretend it\u0027s nothing and nod, \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar points at Sully, I barely recognize him. He\u0027s a beast of a man somehow. In the month I\u0027ve been gone, he has gained massive amounts of muscle, like Star, but more bulging. \"He wants you guys to take four horses, one is a stud and not related to any of the females at the farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Okay. Just tell Jake what you want. He\u0027s the horse guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs, \"Who knew he had a purpose, beyond making the view that much better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winks, \"Studding horses suits him.\" She walks away and her shorts and tee shirt suddenly suit her. Her body is strong and fit now. She doesn’t giggle and she doesn’t hug people. She slaps them on the arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s so different now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at Mitch and nod, \"So different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallows, \"I almost miss the giggly massage girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know that was an act right? That never was who she was. She was trying to blend in, keep information flowing from Marshall and her brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me a smirk, \"I know. I still liked that sweet smile and funny laugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, \"Men are animals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs and walks with me to Jake. Sully\u0027s sees us, his dirty face brightens, \"Emma!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wave but he comes over, giving me a bulging, muscled, and sweat-laden hug. My back cracks when he shakes me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts me down, \"How\u0027s Will, Anna, and Sarah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. They\u0027re all great. Anna is getting a small belly. It\u0027s like a tiny little hump. And she\u0027s not sick anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles, \"Cool. Me and Star wanna get some officials around here, so that when the little bambino comes we can come up there.\" He nods behind the barn, \"We\u0027re making a cart into a sled. You all should do the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smart. I\u0027ll tell Will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrow a little, \"How\u0027s he feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"He doesn’t say much. You know what he\u0027s like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorts, \"Yeah, he\u0027s you, but he\u0027s got a dick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs. I don’t see what\u0027s funny about that statement. Sometimes I still get lost in conversations, but I\u0027ve come a long way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch nudges me, \"Emma doesn’t like talking about dicks, she likes killing shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face is getting red. I glance at Meg\u0027s grave where Leo is sitting alone and point, \"I\u0027m going to say hi to Meg.\" I walk past them and try to not hear their laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes me a minute to pull the dead branches and leaves off the mound of rocks. Leo sits, looking regal. His eyes always get sad when he\u0027s with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kneel beside him and run my hands down his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t look down into the rock pile though. I look up and smile, \"Hey, Meg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know she\u0027s there. I know very few things, but I know that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a minute Jake is there beside me. The warmth of his body next to mine is nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Meg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo whines a little and lies down. Jake nods his head. I can tell he\u0027s saying something in his head. I reach over, taking his hand in mine. He doesn’t look at me but he squeezes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear boots behind us, \"Wanna take a hot shower? I got the power up and running now. The inverter is finally fixed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance back at Star, \"Seriously?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake winks at me, \"I\u0027ll race you to the showers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stick my tongue out, \"Just go first. My legs are broken from that damned horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helps me up, \"No, you go first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar laughs, \"Always the gentleman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes burn, \"Not always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twelve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day the saddle instantly picks a fight with my butt. I wince and wait for the numb to take over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch laughs, \"Oh, that was a face. Sore arse, Emma?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growl and give him a hard look. He puts his hands up defensively but continues laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake gives me a shitty grin too. I snarl and nod at Star, \"I\u0027ll send word when the snow hits, and if anything remarkable happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winks, \"I\u0027ll send word if I find Daddy Dearest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have created a monster. She is more like me daily, like she\u0027s picking up the cold hateful pieces I am losing. I nod, \"Don’t go after him without me.\" I don’t want him to kill her. We may not be close, but she\u0027s all I have left. She\u0027s my blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slaps the butt of the horse, \"Have a safe trip.\" My horse leaps into action. I almost cry out. I need to learn to ride horses better. Flopping around in the seat might be the death of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully waves us off at the gate. I can\u0027t make myself trust him. He does everything he can to earn our trust and help us, but to me he was one of them. I have to force myself to see Jack when I look at him. No matter what, I see the picture I made in my head of them eating people. It makes me gag a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch and Jake pass me, making dust for me to follow. I see movement to the right as we pass the crater. I pull an arrow and make an attempt at the matted, red hair of the monster stumbling along the grass. I loose two arrows but they both miss. Leo looks at me and then sprints off to the side. He snaps her neck and catches up to me. I sigh, I need to learn to shoot from a horse. This is my new goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pass the place where Fish and the gang captured us, and I try again on a deer running alongside the destroyed road. I\u0027m going to run out of arrows at this rate. Leo doesn\u0027t even attempt the deer. I think he\u0027s starting to feel sorry for me so he\u0027s pretending to not see my sucky aim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard on the platform in the tree is an amazing sight. He waves at us as we ride in. Jake has the extra horse tied to him so he goes directly to the right when we break the forest. The farmhouse and the small village look bigger than before. More people maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill comes out smiling. He looks red, not burnt, but winded. I\u0027m going to smack him around. He grabs my horse\u0027s reigns but smiles at Mitch, \"Hey, man. How\u0027s it going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch hops off his horse like we just did a quick jaunt around the yard. He doesn\u0027t look like he might die any second. I can\u0027t get off the horse fast enough, but when I do my legs buckle. Leo is there when I fall. I lean on his huge back, \"Thanks, buddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch and Will are hugging. I can see relief on Mitch\u0027s face. \"I heard you were gone, brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill glances at me, \"Yeah, I was for a little while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch smacks his arm, \"Even the devil didn’t want you, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill chuckles, \"Naw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch sees Anna, I see the sadness on his face. He nods that way, \"Going to go see how the momma-to-be is doing.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-28.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
