The Two Things At The Very Top Of My Things-I-Never-Want-To-Do List\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam started moving the others into formation while i was still on the ground. Embry and Quil were at my sides, waiting for me to recover and take the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel the drive, the need, to get on my feet and lead them. The compulsion grew, and I fought it uselessly, cringing on the ground where I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbry whined quietly in my ear. He didn\u0027t want to think the words, afraid that he would bring me to Sam\u0027s attention again. I felt his wordless plea for me to get up, for me to get this over with and be done with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was fear in the pack, not so much for self but for the whole. We couldn\u0027t imagine that we would all make it out alive tonight. Which brothers would we lose? Which minds would leave us forever? Which grieving families would we be consoling in the morning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind began to work with theirs, to think in unison, as we dealt with these fears. Automatically, I pushed up from the ground and shook out my coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbry and Quil huffed in relief. Quil touched his nose to my side once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir minds were filled with our challenge, our assignment. We remembered together the nights we\u0027d watched the Cullens practicing for the fight with the newborns. Emmett Cullen was strongest, but Jasper would be the bigger problem. He moved like a lightning strike - power and speed and death rolled into one. How many centuries\u0027 experience did he have? Enough that all the other Cullens looked to him for guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etake point, if you want flank, Quil offered. There was more excitement in his mind than most of the others. When Quil had watched Jasper\u0027s instruction those nights, he\u0027d been dying to test his skill against the vampire\u0027s. For him, this would be a contest. Even knowing it was his life on the line, he saw it that way. Paul was like that, too, and the kids who had never been in battle, Collin and Brady. Seth probably\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould\u0027ve been the same - if the opponents were not his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake?Quil nudged me. How do you want to roll?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just shook my head, t couldn\u0027t concentrate - the compulsion to follow orders felt like puppet strings hooked intoall of my muscles. One foot forward, now another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth was dragging behind Collin and Brady - Leah had assumed point there. She ignored Seth while planning with the others, and I could see that she\u0027d rather leave him out of the fight.There was a maternal edge to her feelings for her younger brother. She wished Sam would send him home. Seth didn\u0027t register Leah\u0027s doubts. He was adjusting to the puppet strings, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe if you stopped resisting...,Embry whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust focus on our part. The big ones. We can take them down. We own them!Quil was working himself up - like a pep talk before a big game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see how easy it would be - to think about nothing more than my part. It wasn\u0027t hard to imaging attacking Jasper and Emmett. We\u0027d been close to that before. I\u0027d thought of them as enemies for a very long time. I could do that now again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just had to forget that they were protecting the same thing I would protect. I had to forget the reason why I might want them to win....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake,Embry warned. Keep your head in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet moved sluggishly, pulling against the drag of the strings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no point fighting it,Embry whispered again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. I would end up doing what Sam wanted, if he was willing to push it. And he was. Obviously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a good reason for the Alpha\u0027s authority. Even a pack as strong as ours wasn\u0027t much of a force without a leader. We had to move together, to think together, in order to be effective. And that required the body to have a head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what if Sam was wrong now? There was nothing anyone could do. No one could dispute his decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there it was - a thought I\u0027d never, never wanted to have. But now, with my legs all tied up in strings, I recognized the exception with relief - more than relief, with a fierce joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one could dispute the Alpha\u0027s decision - except for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t earned anything. But there were things that had been born in me, things that I\u0027d left unclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never wanted to lead the pack. I didn\u0027t want to do it now. I didn\u0027t want the responsibility for all our fates resting on my shoulders. Sam was better at that than I would ever be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was wrong tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I had not been born to kneel to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bonds fell off my body the second that I embraced my birthright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel it gathering in me, both a freedomand also a strange, hollow power.Hollow because an Alpha\u0027s power came from his pack, and I had no pack. For a second, loneliness overwhelmed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no pack now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was straight and strong as I walked to where Sam stood, planning with Paul and Jared. He turned at the sound of my advance, and his black eyes narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA/o, I told him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard it right away, heard the choice that I\u0027d made in the sound of the Alpha voice in my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jumped back a half step with a shocked yelp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob? What have you done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t follow you, Sam. Not for something so wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me, stunned. You would... you would choose your enemies over your family?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey aren\u0027t - I shook my head, clearing it - they aren\u0027t our enemies. They never have been. Until I really thought about destroying them, thought it through, I didn\u0027t see that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn\u0027t about them,he snarled at me. This is about Bella. She has never been the one for you, she has never chosen you, but you continue to destroy your life for her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were hard words, but true words. I sucked in a big gulp of air, breathing them in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe you\u0027re right. But you\u0027re going to destroy the pack over her, Sam. No matter how many of them survive tonight, they will always have murder on their hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have to protect our families!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what you\u0027ve decided, Sam. But you don\u0027t decide for me, not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob - you can\u0027t turn your back on the tribe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the double echo of his Alpha command, but it was weightless this time. It no longer applied to me. He clenched his jaw, trying to force me to respond to his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared into his furious eyes. Ephraim Black\u0027s son was not born to follow Levi Uley\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs this it, then, JacobBlack? His hackles rose and his muzzle pulled back from his teeth. Paul and Jared snarled and bristled at his sides. Even if you can defeat me, the pack will never follow you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow jerked back, a surprised whine escaping my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefeat you? I\u0027m not going to fight you, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen what\u0027s your plan? I\u0027m not stepping aside so that you can protect the vampire spawn at the tribe\u0027s expense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not telling you to step aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you order them to follow you -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever take anyone\u0027s will away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tail whipped back and forth as he recoiled from the judgment in my words. Then he took a step forward so that we were toe to toe, his exposed teeth inches from mine. I hadn\u0027t noticed till this moment that I\u0027d grown taller than him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere cannot be more than one Alpha. The pack has chosen me. Will you rip us apart tonight? Will you turn on your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebrothers? Or will you end this insanity and join us again?Every word was layered with command, but it couldn\u0027t touch me. Alpha blood ran undiluted in my veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcould see why there was never more than one Alpha male in a pack. My body was responding to the challenge. I could feel the instinct to defend my claim rising in me. The primitive core of my wolf-self tensed for the battle of supremacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI focusedall my energy to control that reaction. I would not fall into a pointless, destructive fight with Sam. He was my brother still, even though I was rejecting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is only one Alpha for this pack. I\u0027m not contesting that I\u0027m just choosing to go my own way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you belong to acoven now, Jacob?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t know, Sam. But I do know this -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrunk back as he felt the weight of the Alpha in my tone. It affected him more than his touched me. Because I had been born to lead him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewill stand between you and the Cullens. I won\u0027t just watch while the pack kills innocent - it was hard to apply that word to vampires, but it was true - people. The pack is better than that. Lead them in the right direction, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my back on him, and a chorus of howls tore into the air around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigging my nails into the earth, I raced away from the uproar I\u0027d caused. I didn\u0027t have much time. At least Leah was the only one with a prayer of outrunning me, and I had a head start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe howling faded with the distance, and I took comfort as the sound continued to rip apart the quiet night. They weren\u0027t after me yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to warn the Cullens before the pack could get it together and stop me. If the Cullens were prepared,it might give Sam a reason to rethink this before it was too late. I sprinted toward the white house Istill hated, leaving my home behindme. Home didn\u0027t belong to me anymore. I\u0027d turned my back on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday had begun like any other day. Made it home from patrol with the rainy sunrise, breakfast with Billy and Rachel, bad TV, bickering withPaul... How did it change so completely, turn all surreal? How did everything get messed up and twisted so that I was here now, all alone, an unwilling Alpha, cut off from my brothers, choosing vampires over them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound I\u0027d been fearing interrupted my dazed thoughts - it was the soft impact of big paws against the ground, chasing after me. I threw myself forward, rocketing through the black forest. I just had to get close enough so that Edward could hear the warning in my head. Leah wouldn\u0027t be able to stop me alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I caught the mood of the thoughts behind me. Not anger, but enthusiasm. Not chasing... but following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stride broke. I staggered two steps before it evened out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait up. My legs aren\u0027t as long as yours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSETH! What do you think you\u0027re DOING? GO HOME!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer, but I could feel his excitement as he kept right on after me. I could see through his eyes as he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould see through mine. The night scene was bleak for me - fullof despair. For him, it was hopeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t realized I was slowing down, but suddenly he was on my flank, running in position beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eam not joking, Seth! This is no place for you. Get out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gangly tan wolf snorted. I\u0027ve got your back, Jacob. I think you\u0027re right. And I\u0027m not going to stand behind Sam when -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yes you are the hell going to stand behind Sam! Get your furry butt back to La Push and do what Sam tells you to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo, Seth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that anorder. Jacob?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis question brought me up short. I skidded to a halt, my nails gouging furrows in the mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not ordering anyone to do anything. I\u0027m just telling you what you already know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plopped down on his haunches beside me. tell you what I know - I know that it\u0027s awful quiet. Haven\u0027t you noticed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. My tail swished nervously as I realized what he was thinking underneath the words. It wasn\u0027t quiet in one sense. Howls still filled the air, far away in the west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey haven\u0027t phased back,Seth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that. The pack would be on red alert now. They would be using the mind link to see all sides clearly. But I couldn\u0027t hear what they were thinking. I could only hear Seth. No one else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooks to me like separate packs aren\u0027t linked. Huh. Guess there was no reason for our fathers to know that before. \u0027Cause there was no reason for separate packs before. Never enough wolves for two. Wow. It\u0027sreally quiet. Sort of eerie. But also kinda nice, don\u0027t you think? I bet it was easier, like this, for Ephraim and Quil and Levi. Not such a babble with just three. Or just two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up, Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, sir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop that! There are not two packs. There is THE pack, and then there is me. That\u0027s all. So you can go home now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there aren\u0027t two packs, then why can we hear each other and not the rest? I think that when you turned your back on Sam, that was a pretty significant move. A change. And when I followed you away, I think that was significant, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve got a point,I conceded. But what can change can change right back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and started trotting toward the east. No time to argue about it now. We should be moving right along before Sam...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right about that part. There was no time for this argument. Ifell into a run again, not pushing myself quite as hard. Seth stayed on my heels, holding the Second\u0027s traditional place on my right flank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan run somewhere else, he thought, his nose dipping a little. didn\u0027t follow you because I was after a promotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun wherever you want. Makes no difference to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sound of pursuit, but we both stepped it up a little at the same time. I was worried now. If I couldn\u0027t tap into the pack\u0027s mind, it was going to make this more difficult. I\u0027d have no more advance warning of attack than the Cullens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ll run patrols,Seth suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what do we do if the pack challenges us?My eyes tightened. Attack our brothers? Your sister?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo - we sound the alarm and fall back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood answer. But then what? I don\u0027t think...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know,he agreed. Less confident now. don\u0027t think I can fight them, either. But they won\u0027t be any happier with the idea of attacking us than we are with attacking them. That might be enough to stop them right there. Pius, there\u0027re only eight of them now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop being so...Took me a minute to decide on the right word. Optimistic. It\u0027s getting on my nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo problem. You want me to be all doom and gloom, or just shut up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally? Doesn\u0027t seem like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was finally quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then we were across the road and moving through the forest that ringed the Cullens\u0027 house. Could Edward hear us yet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe we should be thinking something like,\u0027We come in peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo for it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward?He called the name tentatively. Edward, you there? Okay, now I feel kinda stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou sound stupid, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink he can hear us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were less than a mile out now. think so. Hey, Edward. If you can hear me - circle the wagons, bloodsucker. You\u0027ve got a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve got a problem, Seth corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we broke through the trees into the big lawn. The house was dark, but not empty. Edward stood on the porch between Emmett and Jasper. They were snow white in the pale light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob? Seth? What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowed and then paced back a few steps. The smell was so sharp through this nose that it felt like it was honestly burning me. Seth whined quietly, hesitating, and then he fell back behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo answer Edward\u0027s question, I let my mind run over the confrontation with Sam, moving through it backward. Seth thought with me, filling in the gaps, showing the scene from another angle. We stopped when we got to the part\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout the \"abomination,\" because Edward hissed furiously and leaped off the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want to kill Bella?\" he snarled flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett and Jasper, not having heard the first part of the conversation, took his inflectionless question for a statement. They were right next to him in a flash, teeth exposed as they moved on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, now,Seth thought, backing away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Em, Jazz - not theml The others. The pack is coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett and Jasper rocked back on their heels; Emmett turned to Edward while Jasper kept his eyes locked on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s their problem?\" Emmett demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same one as mine,\" Edward hissed. \"But they have their own plan to handle it. Get the others. Call Carlisle! He and Esme have to get back here now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whined uneasily. They were separated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They aren\u0027t far,\" Edward said in the same dead voice as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to go take a look,Seth said. Run the western perimeter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you be in danger, Seth?\" Edward asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth and I exchanged a glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t think so,we thought together. And then I added, But maybe I should go. Just in case...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027ll be less likely to challenge me,Seth pointed out. I\u0027m just a kid to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re just a kid to me, kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m outta here. You need to coordinate with the Cullens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wheeled and darted into the darkness. I wasn\u0027t going to order Seth around, so I let him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward and I stood facing each other in the dark meadow, i could hear Emmett muttering into his phone. Jasper was watching the place where Seth had vanished into the woods. Alice appeared on the porch and then, after staring at me with anxious eyes for a long moment, she flitted to Jasper\u0027s side. I guessed that Rosalie was inside with Bella. Still guarding her - from the wrong dangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t the first time I\u0027ve owed you my gratitude, Jacob,\" Edward whispered. \"I would never have asked for this from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of what he\u0027d asked me for earlier today. When it came to Bella, there were no lines he wouldn\u0027t cross. Yeah, you would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about it and then nodded. \"I suppose you\u0027re right about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed heavily. Well, this isn\u0027t the first time that I didn\u0027t do it for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry I didn\u0027t do any good today. Told you she wouldn\u0027t listen to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I never really believed she would. But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou had to try. I get it. She any better?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice and eyes went hollow. \"Worse,\" he breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to let that word sink in. I was grateful when Alice spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob, would you mind switching forms?\" Alice asked. \"I want to know what\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head at the same time Edward answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He needs to stay linked to Seth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then would you be so kind as to tell me what\u0027s happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe explained in clipped, emotionless sentences. \"The pack thinks Bella\u0027s become a problem. They foresee potential danger from the... from what she\u0027s carrying. They feel it\u0027s their duty to remove that danger. Jacob and Seth disbanded from the pack to warn us. The rest are planning to attack tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice hissed, leaning away from me. Emmett and Jasper exchanged a glance, and then their eyes ranged across the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody out here,Seth reported. All\u0027s quiet on the western front\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey may go around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll make a loop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carlisle and Esme are on their way,\" Emmett said. \"Twenty minutes, tops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should take up a defensive position,\" Jasper said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward nodded. \"Let\u0027s get inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erun perimeter with Seth. If I get too far for you to hear my head, listen for my howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iwill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey backed into the house, eyes flickering everywhere. Before they were inside, I turned and ran toward the west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m still not finding much,Seth told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etake half the circle. Move fast - we don\u0027t want them to have a chance to sneak past us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth lurched forward in a sudden burst of speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ran in silence, and the minutes passed. I listened to the noises around him, double-checking his judgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey - something coming up fast!he warned me after fifteen minutes of silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my way!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHold your position - don\u0027t think it\u0027s the pack. It sounds different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he caught the approaching scent on the breeze, and I read it in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVampire. Bet it\u0027s Carlisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth, fall back. It might be someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it\u0027s them. I recognize the scent Hold up, I\u0027m going to phase to explain it to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth, I don\u0027t think -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnxiously, I raced along the western border. Wouldn\u0027t it be just peachy if I couldn\u0027t take care of Seth for one freaking night? What if something happened to him on my watch? Leah would shred me into kibble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least the kid kept it short. It wasn\u0027t two minutes later when I felt him in my head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYep, Carlisle and Esme. Boy, were they surprised to see me! They\u0027re probably inside by now. Carlisle said thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s a good guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. That\u0027s one of the reasons why we\u0027re right about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy\u0027re you so down, Jake? I\u0027ll bet Sam won\u0027t bring the pack tonight. He\u0027s not going to launch a suicide mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. It didn\u0027t seem to matter, either way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. This isn\u0027t about Sam so much, is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made the turn at the end of my patrol. I caught Seth\u0027s scent where he\u0027d turned last. We weren\u0027t leaving any gaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou think Bella\u0027s going to die anyway,Seth whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, she is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Edward. He must be crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiterally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s name brought other memories boiling to the surface. Seth read them in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he was howling. Oh, man! No way! You did notThat just plain oT sucks rocks, Jacob! And you know it, too! I can\u0027t believe you said you\u0027d kill him. What is that? You have to tell him no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up, shut up, you idiot! They\u0027re going to think the pack is coming!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOops!He cut off mid-howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wheeled and started loping in toward the house. Just keep out of this, Seth. Take the whole circle for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth seethed and I ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalse alarm, false alarm,I thoughtas I ran closer in. Sorry. Seth is young. He forgets things. No one\u0027s attacking. False alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got to the meadow, I could see Edward staring out of a dark window. I ran in, wanting to be sure he got the message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s nothing out there - you got that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would be a lot easier if the communication wasn\u0027t one way. Then again, I was kinda glad I wasn\u0027t in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over his shoulder, back into the house, and I saw a shudder run through his whole frame. He waved me away without looking in my direction again and then moved out of my view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike I was going to get an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat very still in the meadow and listened. With these ears, I could almost hear SetlYs soft footfalls, miles out into the forest. It was easy to hear every sound inside the dark house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a false alarm,\" Edward was explaining in that dead voice, just repeating what I\u0027d told him. \"Seth was upset about something else, and he forgot we were listening for a signal. He\u0027s very young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to have toddlers guarding the fort,\" a deeper voice grumbled. Emmett, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve done us a great service tonight, Emmett,\" Carlisle said. \"At great personal sacrifice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know. I\u0027m just jealous. Wish I was out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seth doesn\u0027t think Sam will attack now,\" Edward said mechanically. \"Not with us forewarned, and lacking two members of the pack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does Jacob think?\" Carlisle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027snot as optimistic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one spoke. There was a quiet dripping sound that I couldn\u0027t place. I heard their low breathing - and I could separateBella\u0027s from the rest. It was harsher, labored. It hitched and broke in strange rhythms. I could hear her heart. It seemed... too fast. I paced it against my own heartbeat, but I wasn\u0027t sure if that was any measure. It wasn\u0027t like I was normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch her! You\u0027ll wake her up,\" Rosalie whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rosalie,\" Carlisle murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t start with me, Carlisle. We let you have your way earlier, but that\u0027s all we\u0027re allowing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like Rosalie and Bella were both talking in plurals now. Like they\u0027d formed a pack of their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paced quietly in front of the house. Each pass brought me a little closer. The dark windows were like a TV set running in some dull waiting room - it was impossible to keep my eyes off them for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few more minutes, a few more passes, and my fur was brushing the side of the porch as I paced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldsee up through the windows - see the top of the walls and the ceiling, the unlit chandelier that hung there. I was tall enough thatall I would have to do was stretch my neck a little... and maybe one paw up on the edge of the porch....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peeked into the big, open front room, expecting to see something very similar to the scene this afternoon. But it had changed so much that I was confused at first. For a second I thought I\u0027d gotten the wrong room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass wall was gone - it looked like metal now. And the furniture was all dragged out of the way, withBella curled up awkwardly on a narrow bed in the center of the open space. Not a normal bed - one with rails like in a hospital. Also like a hospital were the monitors strapped to her body, the tubes stuck into her skin. The lights on the monitors flashed, but there was no sound. The dripping noise was from the IV plugged into her arm - some fluid that was thick and white, not clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe choked a little in her uneasy sleep, and both Edward and Rosalie moved in to hover over her. Her body\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejerked, and she whimpered. Rosalie smoothed her hand across Bella\u0027s forehead. Edward\u0027s body stiffened - his back was to me, but his expression must have been something to see, because Emmett wrenched himself between them before there was time to blink. He held his hands up to Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not tonight, Edward. We\u0027ve got other things to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward turned away from them, and he was the burning man again. His eyes met mine for one moment, and then I dropped back to all fours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran back into the dark forest, running to join Seth, running away from what was behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorse. Yes, she was worse. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-4-breaking-dawn-twilight-4/page-12.html","bookId":2026,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:26 PM"}
