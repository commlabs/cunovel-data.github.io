Assigned to cleaning-up chores, he had probably been underfoot with his mates, making trouble and stealing food from the women\u0027s lunches. From her place at the window, she couldn\u0027t see any sign of him or of his dog. She hadn\u0027t seen them all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited there with Thomas until long past dark, until the tenders had taken their food trays away. At last the entire building was still and the clamor from the village had subsided as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thomas,\" Kira suggested, \"take your little piece of wood. The special one. I have my scrap with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, but why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know exactly. I feel that we should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas got the small carved piece from its high shelf, and put it into his pocket. In his other pocket was the wooden key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether they went down the dimly lit corridor to the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead of her, Thomas whispered, \"Shhhh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Kira whispered back. \"The stick makes a noise. But I can\u0027t walk without it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, wait.\" They stopped beside one of the wall torches. Thomas ripped a length of cloth from the hem of his loose shirt. Deftly he tied it around the base of Kira\u0027s walking stick. The cloth muted the noise of the wooden stick on the tiled floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pair made their way quickly down the flight of stairs and to the door of the room where Jo slept. They paused there and listened. But there were no sounds. Kira\u0027s hand, in her pocket, felt no warning from her scrap of cloth. She nodded to Thomas and silently he inserted the big key and turned it to open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira held her breath because she feared that a tender might be sharing the room to guard the tyke at night. But the room, illuminated only by pale moonlight through the window, held only one small bed and one small fast-asleep girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stay by the door to watch,\" Thomas murmured. \"She knows you — or your voice, at least. You wake her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira went to the bed and sat on its edge, propping her stick beside her. Gently she touched the small shoulder. \"Jo,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little head, long hair tangled, turned restlessly. After a moment, the tyke opened her eyes with a startled, frightened look. \"No, don\u0027t!\" she cried out, pushing Kira\u0027s hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhhh,\" Kira whispered. \"It\u0027s me. Remember, we talked through the door? Don\u0027t be afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want me mum,\" the tyke wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was very small. Much smaller than Matt. Hardly more than a toddler. Kira remembered the power of the singing voice that she had heard, and marveled that it had come from this tiny, frightened waif of a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira picked her up, cradled her, and rocked her back and forth. \"Shhhh,\" she said. \"Shhhh. It\u0027s all right. I\u0027m your friend. And see over there? His name is Thomas. He\u0027s your friend too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually the tyke was soothed. Her eyes opened wide. Her thumb slid into her mouth and she spoke around it. \"I be listening to you at the hole,\" she said, remembering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the keyhole. We whispered to each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know me mum? Can you bring her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira shook her head. \"No, I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t. But I\u0027ll be here. I live just upstairs. And Thomas does, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas came nearer and knelt by the bed. The tyke stared at him suspiciously, and clutched Kira.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas pointed to the ceiling. \"I live right above you,\" he said in a gentle voice, \"and I can hear you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hear me singings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Yes. Your singing is very beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tyke scowled. \"They always be making me learn new ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New songs?\" Kira asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJo nodded unhappily. \"Over and over. They be making me remember everythings. Me old songs, they just be there natural. But now they be stuffing new things into me and this poor head hurts horrid.\" The tyke rubbed her tangled hair and sighed, a strangely adult sound that made Kira smile sympathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas was looking around the room, which held many of the same pieces of furniture as the rooms above. A bed. A tall wooden chest of drawers. A table and two chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jo,\" he said suddenly, \"are you a good climber?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned and removed her thumb from her mouth. \"I be climbing trees sometimes in the Fen. But me mum, she hits me when I do because she say I be breaking me legs and then they take me to the Field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas nodded solemnly. \"Yes, that\u0027s probably true, and your mother didn\u0027t want you to get hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once draggers take you to the Field, you don\u0027t never come back. Beasts take you.\" The thumb popped back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But look, Jo. If you could climb up there —\" Thomas pointed to the top of the chest of drawers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wide eyes followed his pointing finger, and the tyke nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you stood very tall up there, and if you had some tool, you could hit the ceiling and I would hear you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tyke grinned at the thought. \"You mustn\u0027t do it just for fun,\" Thomas added quickly. \"Only if you really needed us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might I be trying it?\" Jo asked eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira lifted her down to the floor. Like a limber animal the tyke scrambled from chair to tabletop, and from the tabletop she climbed to the top of the chest. Then she stood triumphantly. From below her woven nightdress emerged two bare thin legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need a tool,\" Thomas murmured, looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembering something from her own quarters, Kira went to the bathroom. As she had guessed, a thick hairbrush with a wooden handle lay on the shelf beside the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try this,\" she said, and handed it up to the tyke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling broadly, the little singer reached up and thumped the brush handle on the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas lifted her down and put her back into the bed. \"That\u0027s it, then,\" he said. \"If you need us, that\u0027s the signal, Jo. But never just for fun. Only if you need help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we\u0027ll come to see you too, even if you don\u0027t thump,\" Kira added. \"After the tenders are gone.\" She tucked the bed covers around the tyke. \"Here, Thomas. Put this back, would you?\" She handed him the hairbrush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must go now,\" she told Jo. \"But do you feel better, knowing that you have friends up there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tyke nodded. Her moist thumb slid into her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira smoothed the blanket. \"Good night, then.\" For a moment she sat there on the bed, feeling a vague memory of something else that should be done. Something from when she was a small tyke, like this, being put to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned down toward the little girl, intuitively. What was it that her mother had done when she was small? Kira put her lips on Jo\u0027s forehead. It was an unfamiliar gesture but felt right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl made a small contented sound with her own lips against Kira\u0027s face. \"A little kissie,\" she whispered. \"Like me mum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira and Thomas parted in the upstairs corridor and made their way separately back to their own rooms. It was late, and as always they were expected to work in the morning and needed sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Kira prepared for bed, she thought about the frightened, lonely tyke below. What songs were they forcing her to learn? Why was she here at all? Ordinarily an orphaned tyke would be turned over to another family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same question that she and Thomas had discussed the day before. And the answer seemed to be the conclusion they had reached: they were artists, the three of them. Makers of song, of wood, of threaded patterns. Because they were artists, they had some value that she could not comprehend. Because of that value, the three of them were here, well fed, well housed, and nurtured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brushed her hair and teeth and got into bed. The window was open to the breeze. Below, she could see the half-completed constructions that would soon be her dyeing-garden, firepit, and shed. Across the room, through the darkness, she could see the folded, covered shape on top of her worktable: the Singer\u0027s robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Kira knew that although her door was unlocked, she was not really free. Her life was limited to these things and this work. She was losing the joy she had once felt when the bright-colored threads took shape in her hands, when the patterns came to her and were her own. The robe did not belong to her, though she was learning its story through her work. She would almost be able to tell the history now that it had passed through her fingers, now that she had focused on it so closely for so many days. But it was not what her hands or heart yearned to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas, uncomplaining though he was, had mentioned the headaches that afflicted him after hours of work. So had the little singer below. They be stuffing new things into me, the tyke had whimpered. She wanted the freedom to sing her own songs as she always had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira did too. She wanted her hands to be free of the robe so that they could make patterns of their own again. Suddenly she wished that she could leave this place, despite its comforts, and return to the life she had known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe buried her face in the bedclothes and for the first time cried in despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thomas, I\u0027ve worked hard all morning, and you have too. Would you take a walk with me? There\u0027s something I want to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was midday. They had both eaten lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to go down and look at what the workmen are doing? I\u0027ll go with you.\" Thomas set aside the carving tool he had just picked up. Kira noticed again, with admiration, how intricate the work was on the large Singer\u0027s staff. Thomas had been smoothing the tiny rough spots from the worn, ancient carvings and reshaping the infinitesimally small edges and curves. It was very similar to the work that Kira herself had been assigned, the repair of the Singer\u0027s robe. And the entire top of the staff was undecorated; it was smooth, uncarved wood, in the same way that the expanse across the shoulders of the robe was untouched cloth. Kira\u0027s work was approaching that unadorned expanse. So was Thomas\u0027s, she realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will you carve there?\" she asked him, pointing to the undecorated part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. They said they\u0027d tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched as he carefully laid the staff across the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually,\" she told him, \"if you want to look at what the workmen are doing, I\u0027ll go there with you later. But that\u0027s not what I had in mind. Will you go with me first where I want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas nodded good-naturedly. \"Where\u0027s that?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Fen,\" Kira told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her quizzically. \"That filthy place? Why would you want to go there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been there. I want to see where Jo lived, Thomas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Matt does still,\" he reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Matt too. I wonder where he is, Thomas.\" Kira was uneasy. \"I haven\u0027t seen him in two days. Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThomas shook his head. \"Maybe he found another source of food,\" he suggested, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt could point out where Jo lived. Maybe I could even bring something back for her. Maybe she had toys. Did they let you bring things when you came here, Thomas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Just my bits of wood. They didn\u0027t want me distracted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKira sighed. \"She\u0027s so small. She should have a toy. Maybe you could carve her a doll? And I could stitch a little dress for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could, I guess,\" Thomas agreed. He handed Kira her walking stick. \"Let\u0027s go,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll probably find Matt along the way. Or he\u0027ll find us.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gathering-blue-the-giver-quartet-2/page-17.html","bookId":1702,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:33 AM"}
