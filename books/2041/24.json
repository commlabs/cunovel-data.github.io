{"id":109480,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\u003cp\u003eIT\u0027S WEIRD how you react in moments of immediate danger. Part of me was pure panic, complete with racing heart and rapid breathing. That hollow feeling, the one that felt like a hole had opened in my chest, returned. Another part of me was able to still inexplicably think along logical lines, mostly something like, Yup, that\u0027s the kind of knife that could slit a throat. The rest of me? Well, the rest of me was just confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed where I was and kept my voice low and even. \"Lee, what\u0027s going on? What is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Don\u0027t pretend. I know you know. You\u0027re too smart. I knew you\u0027d figure it out, but I just didn\u0027t expect you to do it so soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind spun. Once again, someone thought I was smarter than I was. I supposed I should be flattered by his faith in my intelligence, but the truth was, I didn\u0027t know what was going on yet. I didn\u0027t know if betraying that would help or hinder me, though. I decided to play cool for as long as I reasonably could here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s you in the picture,\" I said, careful not to make it a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t aged.\" I dared a quick look at the picture, just to ascertain that for myself. It still baffled me. Only Strigoi were ageless, staying immortal at the age they\u0027d turned. \"That\u0027s... that\u0027s impossible. You\u0027re Moroi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027ve aged,\" he said bitterly. \"Not a lot. Not enough that you can really spot it, but believe me, I can. It\u0027s not like how it used to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still clueless, still not sure of how we had reached a point where Lee - starry-eyed and lovesick for Jill - was suddenly threatening me with a knife. Nor did I understand how he looked exactly the same as he did in a five-year-old picture. There was only one terrible thing I was beginning to be certain of. \"You... killed Kelly Hayes.\" The fear in my chest intensified. I lifted my gaze from the blade to look into his eyes. \"But surely... surely not Melody... or Tamara...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"And Dina. But you wouldn\u0027t know her, would you? She was only human, and you don\u0027t keep track of human deaths. Only vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard not to look at the knife again. All I kept thinking about was how sharp it was and how close it was to me. One swipe, and I\u0027d end up just like those other girls, my life bleeding away before me. I groped desperately for something to say, wishing again I\u0027d learned the social skills that came so easily to others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tamara was your cousin,\" I managed. \"Why would you kill your own cousin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment of regret flashed across his features. \"I didn\u0027t want to - I mean, I did... but, well, I wasn\u0027t myself when I came back. I just knew I had to be awakened again. Tamara was there at the wrong place and the wrong time. I went for the first Moroi I could get... but it didn\u0027t work. That\u0027s when I tried the others. I thought for sure one of them would do it. Human, dhampir, Moroi... none of them worked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a terrible desperation in his voice, and despite my fear, some part of me wanted to help him... but I was hopelessly lost. \"Lee, I\u0027m sorry. I don\u0027t understand, why you\u0027d need to \u0027try others.\u0027 Please put the knife down, and let\u0027s talk. Maybe I can help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a sad smile. \"You can. I didn\u0027t want it to be you, though. I wanted it to be Keith. He certainly deserves to die more than you do. And Jill... well, Jill likes you. I wanted to respect that and spare you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still can,\" I said. \"She - she wouldn\u0027t want you to do this. She\u0027d be upset if she knew - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Lee was on me, pinning me to the chair with the knife at my throat. \"You don\u0027t know!\" he cried. \"She doesn\u0027t know. But she will, and she\u0027ll be glad. She\u0027ll thank me, and we\u0027ll be young and together forever. You\u0027re my chance. The others didn\u0027t work, but you...\" He trailed the knife\u0027s blade near my tattoo. \"You\u0027re special. Your blood is magic. I need an Alchemist, and you\u0027re my only chance now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What... chance... are you talking about?\" I gasped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My chance for immortality!\" he cried. \"God, Sydney. You can\u0027t even imagine it. What it\u0027s like to have that and then lose it. To have infinite strength and power... to not age, to know you\u0027ll live forever. And then, gone! Taken away from me. If I ever find that bastard spirit user who did this to me, I\u0027ll kill him. I\u0027ll kill him and I\u0027ll drink from him since after tonight, I\u0027ll be whole once more. I\u0027ll be reawakened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill ran down my spine. In light of everything, you would have thought I\u0027d already be at maximum terror level. Nope. Turns out there was still more to come. Because with those words, I began to put together a fragile theory of what he might be talking about. \"Awakened\" was a term used in the vampire world, under very special circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You used to be Strigoi,\" I whispered, not even sure if I believed it myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled back slightly, gray eyes wide and glittering feverishly. \"I used to be a god! And I will be again. I swear it. I\u0027m sorry, I really am. I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s you and not Keith. I\u0027m sorry you found out about Kelly. If you hadn\u0027t, I could have found another Alchemist in LA. But don\u0027t you see? I have no other options now...\" The knife was still at my throat. \"I need your blood. I can\u0027t go on like this... not as a mortal Moroi. I have to be changed back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a word,\" Lee hissed. \"They\u0027ll go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, the knock repeated, followed by: \"Sage, I know you\u0027re in there. I saw your car. I know you\u0027re pissed off, but just listen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDingdong, distraction calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrian!\" I screamed, jumping up from the chair. I made no attempt to disarm Lee. My only goal was safety. I pushed past him before he could react, heading for the door, but he was more prepared than I\u0027d expected. He leapt toward me and tackled me to the ground, the knife catching me in the arm as I fell. I yelped in pain as I felt the tip of the blade dig into my skin. I struggled against him, only succeeding in making the knife tear into me more. The door suddenly opened, and I was grateful that I\u0027d left it unlocked after letting Lee in. Adrian entered, coming to a standstill as he took in the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t come closer,\" warned Lee, pushing the knife against my throat again. I could feel warm blood oozing from my arm. \"Shut the door. Then... sit down and put your hands behind your head. I\u0027ll kill her if you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to do it anyway - ahh!\" My words were cut off as the knife pierced my skin, not enough to kill me yet but enough to cause pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay,\" said Adrian, holding up his hands. He looked more sober and serious than I\u0027d ever seen. When he was settled on the floor, hands behind his head as directed, he said gently, \"Lee, I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing, but you need to stop it now before it goes any further. You don\u0027t have a gun. You can\u0027t really hold us both here under the threat of a knife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s worked before,\" Lee said. Still keeping the knife on me, he reached into his coat pocket with his other hand and produced a pair of handcuffs. That was unexpected. He slid them over to Adrian. \"Put these on.\" When Adrian didn\u0027t react right away, Lee pushed on the knife until I yelped. \"Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian put the handcuffs on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d meant them for her, but you coming by might be a good thing,\" said Lee. \"I\u0027ll probably be hungry once I\u0027m reawakened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian arched an eyebrow. \"Reawakened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He used to be Strigoi,\" I managed to say. \"He\u0027s been killing girls - slitting their throats - to try to become one again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be quiet,\" snapped Lee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you cut their throats?\" asked Adrian. \"You have fangs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it didn\u0027t work! I did use my fangs. I drank from them... but it didn\u0027t work. I didn\u0027t reawaken again. So then I had to cover my trail. The guardians can tell, you know. Moroi and Strigoi bites? I needed the knife to subdue them anyway, so then I cut their necks to hide the trail... make them think it was a crazy Strigoi. Or a vampire hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see Adrian processing all this. I don\u0027t know if he believed it or not, but he had the potential to roll with crazy ideas regardless. \"If the others didn\u0027t work, then Sydney won\u0027t either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has to,\" said Lee fervently. He shifted so that I was rolled onto my back, still pinned by his greater body weight. \"Her blood\u0027s special. I know it is. And if it doesn\u0027t... I\u0027ll get help. I\u0027ll get help reawakening, and then I\u0027ll awaken Jill so we can always be together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian jumped to his feet, full of a surprising fury. \"Jill? Don\u0027t hurt her! Don\u0027t even touch her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down,\" barked Lee. Adrian obeyed. \"I wouldn\u0027t hurt her. I love her. That\u0027s why I\u0027m going to make sure she stays exactly the way she is. Forever. I\u0027ll awaken her after I\u0027m reawakened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to catch Adrian\u0027s eye, wondering if I could pass some silent message. If we both surged at Lee together - even with Adrian cuffed - then maybe we had a chance at subduing him. Lee was seconds away from tearing into my throat, I was certain, in the hopes that... what? That he could drink my blood and become Strigoi?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lee,\" I said in a small voice. Too much movement in my throat would result in a bite from the knife. \"It didn\u0027t work with the other girls. I don\u0027t think the fact that I\u0027m an Alchemist matters. Whatever that spirit user did to save you... you can\u0027t go back now. It doesn\u0027t matter whose blood you drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t save me!\" roared Lee. \"He ruined my life. I\u0027ve been trying to get it back for six years. I was almost ready for the last resort... until you and Keith came along. And I\u0027ve still got that last option left. I don\u0027t want it to come to that, though. For all our sakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t the last resort? Honestly, I didn\u0027t really see how any other alternative plans here could be much worse for me. Meanwhile, Adrian still wasn\u0027t looking in my direction, which frustrated me - until I realized what he was trying to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a mistake,\" he told Lee. \"Look at me, and tell me you really want to do this to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuffed or not, Adrian didn\u0027t have the speed and strength of a dhampir, someone who could leap over and disarm Lee before the knife could do its damage. Adrian also didn\u0027t have the power to wield a physical element, say, like fire, one that could be used as a concrete weapon. Adrian did, however, have the ability to compel. Compulsion was an innate ability all vampires had and one that spirit users in particular were adept at. Unfortunately, it worked best with eye contact, and Lee wasn\u0027t playing ball. His attention was all on me, blocking Adrian\u0027s efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made my decision a long time ago,\" said Lee. With his free hand, he dabbed his fingers in the bloody patch on my arm. He brought his fingertips to his lips, a look of grim resignation on his face. He licked the blood from his hand, which wasn\u0027t nearly as gross to me as it would\u0027ve been under other circumstances. With so much going on right now, it was honestly no more terrible than the rest and just rolled off of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of total shock and surprise crossed Lee\u0027s features... soon turning to disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he gasped. He repeated the motion, rubbing more blood on his fingers and licking it. \"There\u0027s something... there\u0027s something wrong...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned his mouth to my neck, and I whimpered, fearing the inevitable. But it wasn\u0027t his teeth I felt, only the lightest brushing of his lips and tongue at the wound he\u0027d created, like some sort of perverse kiss. He jerked back immediately, staring at me in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with you?\" he whispered. \"What\u0027s wrong with your blood?\" He made a third attempt to taste my blood but was unable to finish. He scowled. \"I can\u0027t do it. I can\u0027t stomach any of it. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Adrian nor I had an answer. Lee sagged in defeat for a moment, and I suddenly allowed myself to think he might just give up and call all this madness off. With a deep breath, he straightened up, new resolve in his eyes. I tensed, half-expecting him to say he was going to try to drink Adrian now, even though a Moroi - two, if you counted Melody - had apparently been on the menu of his past failures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, Lee pulled his cell phone out of his pocket, still keeping the knife at my throat and preventing me from attempting any sort of escape. He dialed a number and waited for an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dawn? It\u0027s Lee. Yes... yes, I know. Well, I have two for you, ready and waiting. A Moroi and an Alchemist. No - not the old man. Yes. Yes, still alive. It has to be tonight. They know about me. You can have them... but you know the deal. You know what I want... yes. Uh-huh. Okay.\" Lee rattled off our address and disconnected. A pleased smile crossed his face. \"We\u0027re lucky. They\u0027re east of LA, so it won\u0027t take them long to get here - especially since they don\u0027t care much about speed limits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are \u0027they\u0027?\" asked Adrian. \"I remember you calling some Dawn lady in LA. I thought she was one of your hot college friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re the makers of destiny,\" said Lee dreamily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How delightfully enigmatic and nonsensical,\" muttered Adrian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLee glared and then carefully studied Adrian. \"Take off your tie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized I\u0027d spent so much time with Adrian now that I was ready for some comment like, \"Oh, glad to know things aren\u0027t so formal anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, the situation was dire enough - and the knife at my throat serious enough - that Adrian didn\u0027t argue. He\u0027d handcuffed his wrists in front of him and, after some complex maneuvering with his hands, was finally able to undo the tie he\u0027d donned for Jill\u0027s show. He tossed it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful,\" Adrian said. \"It\u0027s silk.\" So, not completely devoid of snark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLee rolled me over to my stomach, finally freeing me of the knife but giving me no time to react. With remarkable skill, he soon had my hands tied behind my back with Adrian\u0027s tie. Doing so required some pulling and restraining of my arms, which hurt quite a bit after the stabbing. He backed off when finished, allowing me to gingerly sit up, but an experimental tug of the tie showed that I wasn\u0027t going to undo those knots anytime soon. Uneasily, I wondered how many girls he\u0027d tied up before in his sick attempt to become Strigoi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeird, awkward silence fell as we waited for Lee\u0027s \"makers of destiny\" to show up. The minutes ticked by, and I frantically tried to figure out what to do. How long did we have until the people he\u0027d called arrived? From what he\u0027d told me, I\u0027d guess at least an hour. Feeling bold, I finally attempted communication with Adrian, again hoping maybe we could covertly team up on Lee - even though our success rate had just become that much lower with both our sets of hands bound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you even get here?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrian\u0027s gaze was fixed on Lee, still hoping for direct eye contact, but he did spare a quick, wry glance at me. \"Same way I get around everywhere, Sage. The bus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t have a car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrian!\" Amazing. Even with our lives in danger, he could still infuriate me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and returned his focus to Lee, even though his words were obviously for me. \"To apologize. Because I was a total asshole to you at Jailbait\u0027s show. Not long after you left, I knew I had to come find you.\" He paused eloquently and glanced around. \"No good deed goes unpunished, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly felt at a loss. Lee turning psychopathic certainly wasn\u0027t my fault, but it troubled me that Adrian was now in this situation because he\u0027d come to apologize to me. \"It\u0027s okay. You weren\u0027t... um, that bad,\" I said lamely, hoping to make him feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small smile played over his lips. \"You\u0027re a terrible liar, Sage, but I\u0027m still touched you\u0027d attempt it for my sake. A for effort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, what happened back there seems kind of small, in light of the current situation,\" I muttered. \"It\u0027s easy to forgive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLee\u0027s frown had been growing as he listened to us. \"Do the others know you\u0027re here?\" he asked Adrian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Adrian. \"I said I was going back to Clarence\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know if he was lying or not. For a moment, I didn\u0027t think it would matter. The others had heard me say I was coming here, but none of them would have any reason to come seeking us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reason, except the bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught my breath and met Adrian\u0027s eyes. He looked away, perhaps for fear of betraying what I\u0027d just realized. It didn\u0027t matter if the gang had known where I was earlier. If Jill was connected to Adrian, she would know now. And she would know that we were in trouble. But that was assuming it was one of the times when she could see into his mind. They\u0027d both admitted it was inconsistent and that high emotion could bring it out. Well, if this didn\u0027t count as a highly emotional situation, I couldn\u0027t think what would. Even if she realized what was happening, there were a lot of if\u0027s involved. Jill would have to get here, and she couldn\u0027t do it alone. Calling the police would bring the fastest response, but she might hesitate if she knew this was vampire business. She\u0027d need Eddie. How long would it take to get him if they were back in their dorms?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know. I just knew that we had to stay alive because if we did, one way or another, Jill would get help here. Only, I no longer knew our odds of survival. Adrian and I were both confined, trapped with a guy who wasn\u0027t afraid to kill with a knife and who desperately wanted to become a Strigoi again. That was a bad combination, and it threatened to get worse...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s coming, Lee?\" I asked. \"Who did you call?\" When he didn\u0027t answer, I made the next logical leap. \"Strigoi. You have Strigoi coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only way,\" he said, tossing his knife from hand to hand. \"The only way left now. I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t be like this anymore. I can\u0027t be mortal anymore. Too much time has already passed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course. Moroi could become Strigoi in one of two ways. One was by drinking the blood of another person and killing them in the process. Lee had tried that, using every combination of victims he could get ahold of, and had failed. That left him with one last desperate option: conversion by another Strigoi. Usually, it happened by force, when a Strigoi killed someone and then fed their own blood back to the victim. That was what Lee wanted done to him now, trading our lives to the Strigoi who would convert him. And then he wanted to do it to Jill, out of some crazy misguided love...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s not worth it,\" I said, desperation and fear making me bold. \"It\u0027s not worth the cost of killing innocents and endangering your soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLee\u0027s gaze fell on me, and there was a look of such chilling indifference in it that I had a hard time connecting this person before me to the one I\u0027d smiled indulgently on as he courted Jill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it, Sydney? How would you know? You\u0027ve deprived yourself of enjoyment for most of your life. You\u0027re aloof from others. You\u0027ve never let yourself be selfish, and look where it\u0027s got you. Your \u0027morals\u0027 have left you with a short, strict life. Can you tell me now, just before you\u0027re about to die, that you don\u0027t wish you\u0027d maybe allowed yourself a little more fun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the immortal soul - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I care about that?\" he demanded. \"Why bother living some miserable regimented life in this world, in the hopes that maybe our souls go on in some heavenly realm, when I can take control now - ensure that I live forever in this world, with all of its pleasures, staying strong and young forever? That\u0027s real. That\u0027s something I can put my faith in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s wrong,\" I said. \"It\u0027s not worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t say that if you\u0027d experienced what I have. If you\u0027d been Strigoi, you never would\u0027ve wanted to lose that either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you lose it?\" asked Adrian. \"What spirit user saved you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLee snorted. \"You mean robbed me. I don\u0027t know. It all happened so fast. But as soon as I find him I\u0027ll - ahh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA yearbook is not the greatest of weapons, particularly one the size of Amberwood\u0027s, but in a pinch - and with surprise - it\u0027ll do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d noted earlier that I wasn\u0027t going to be able to undo the knots in the tie anytime soon. That was true. It had taken me this whole time, but I\u0027d done it. For whatever reason, knot-making was a useful skill in the Alchemist curriculum, one I\u0027d practiced growing up with my father. As soon as I was free of Adrian\u0027s tie, I reached for the first thing I could: Kelly\u0027s junior yearbook. I sprang up and slammed it into Lee\u0027s head. He cringed back at the impact, dropping the knife as he did, and I used the opportunity to sprint across the living room and grab Adrian\u0027s arm. He needed no help from me and was already trying to get to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t get far before Lee was right back on us. The knife had slid somewhere unseen, and he simply relied on his own strength. He caught hold of me and ripped me from Adrian, one hand on my wounded arm and one in my hair, causing me to stumble. Adrian came after us, doing his best to hit Lee, even with bound hands. We weren\u0027t the most efficient fighting force, but if we could just momentarily delay Lee, there was a chance we might make it out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLee was distracted by both of us, trying to fight and fend us off at the same time. Unbidden, Eddie\u0027s lesson came back to me, about how a well-placed punch could cause serious damage to someone stronger than you. Sizing up the situation in seconds, I decided I had an opening. I closed my hand the way Eddie had taught me in that quick lesson, positioning my body in a way that would direct the weight in an efficient way. I swung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yelled in pain as my fist made contact. If this was the \"safe\" way to punch, I couldn\u0027t imagine how much a sloppy one hurt. Fortunately, it seemed to cause just as much - if not more - pain to Lee. He fell backward, hitting the comfy chair in a way that made him lose his balance and collapse to the ground. I was stunned at what I had done, but Adrian was still in motion. He nudged me to the door, taking advantage of Lee\u0027s temporary disorientation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Sage. This is it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hurried to the door, ready to make our escape while Lee shouted profanities at us. I reached for the knob, but the door opened before I could touch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd two Strigoi entered the room. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-24.html","bookId":2041,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:38:07 PM"}
