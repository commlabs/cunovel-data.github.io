It\u0027s my birthday.\" I stuck my tongue out at him. The boys fell onto the blanket, wet and sandy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom,\" Steven complained. \"She pulled out a hunk of my hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steven, you have a whole head full. I wouldn\u0027t worry about it.\" My mother lit the candles on the cake she\u0027d baked that morning. It was a lopsided Duncan Hines yellow cake with chocolate frosting. She had messy handwriting, so \"Happy Birthday\" looked like \"Happy Bimday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blew out the candles before Steven could try to \"help\" me. I didn\u0027t want him stealing my wish. I wished for Conrad, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open your presents, Smelly,\" Steven said sullenly. I already knew what he\u0027d gotten me. A stick of deodorant. He\u0027d wrapped it in Kleenex; I could see right through the tissue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored him and reached for a small flat box wrapped in seashell paper. It was from Susannah, so I knew it would be good. I tore off the wrapping paper, and inside there was a silver charm bracelet, from the store Susannah loved, Rheingold\u0027s, where they sold fancy china and crystal candy dishes. On the bracelet there were five charms: a conch shell, a bathing suit, a sand castle, a pair of sunglasses, and a horseshoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For how lucky we are to have you in our lives,\" Susannah said, touching the horseshoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted it up, and the charms glinted and sparkled in the sunlight. \"I love it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother was silent. I knew what she was thinking. She was thinking that Susannah had overdone it, that she\u0027d spent too much money. I felt guilty for loving the bracelet so much. My mother had bought me sheet music and CDs. We didn\u0027t have as much money as they did, and in that moment I finally understood what that meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter thirty - eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love it,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran upstairs to my room and went straight for the music box on my dresser, where I kept my charm bracelet. I grabbed the bracelet and ran back downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" I said, putting the key charm on and fastening it onto my wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a key, because you\u0027ll be driving soon. Get it?\" Jeremiah said, leaning back in his chair and clasping his hands behind his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got it. I smiled to show him I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad leaned in for a closer look. \"Nice,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held it in the palm of my other hand. I couldn\u0027t stop looking at it. \"I love it,\" I said again. \"But it\u0027s from Rheingold\u0027s. It must have been really expensive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saved up all summer to buy it,\" he said solemnly. I stared at him. \"No, you didn\u0027t!\" He broke into a smile. \"Fooled ya. Gullible as ever, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePunching him on the arm, I said, \"I didn\u0027t believe you anyway, jerk.\" Even though I had, for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah rubbed his arm where I\u0027d punched it. \"It wasn\u0027t that expensive. Anyway, I\u0027m big-time now, remember? Don\u0027t worry about me. I\u0027m just glad you like it. Yolie said you would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged him fiercely. \"It\u0027s perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a wonderful gift, Jere,\" Susannah said. \"It\u0027s better than my old necklace, that\u0027s for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Yeah, right,\" he said, but I could tell he was pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother got up and started cutting the cake. She wasn\u0027t a very good cake cutter: The pieces were too big, and they fell apart on the sides. \"Who wants cake?\" she said, licking her finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not hungry,\" Conrad said abruptly. He stood up, looking at his watch. \"I\u0027ve gotta get dressed for work. Happy birthday, Belly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went upstairs, and nobody said anything for a minute. Then my mother said, loudly, \"This cake is delicious. Have some, Beck.\" She pushed a piece in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling faintly, Susannah said, \"I\u0027m not hungry either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know what they say about the cook not having taste for her own cooking. But you guys eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a big bite. \"Mmm. Yellow cake, my favorite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From scratch,\" my mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter thirty - nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad invited Nicole, Red Sox girl, over to the house. Our house. I couldn\u0027t believe Red Sox girl was at our house. It was bizarre to have a girl there other than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was midafternoon. I was out on the deck, sitting at the patio table, eating a Doritos sandwich when they drove up. She was wearing short shorts and a white T-shirt, and a pair of sunglasses on top of her head. The Red Sox hat was nowhere in sight. She looked chic. She looked like she belonged. Unlike me, in my old Cuz Beach shirt that doubled as a pajama dress. I thought he\u0027d at least bring her inside the house, but they hung out on the other side of the deck, lying on the lounge chairs. I couldn\u0027t hear what they were saying, but I could hear her giggling like crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter about five minutes I couldn\u0027t take it anymore. I got on the phone and called Cam. He said he\u0027d be over in half an hour, but it was more like fifteen minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked back into the house when Cam and I were arguing over which movie to watch. \"What are you guys gonna watch?\" Conrad asked, sitting on the couch opposite us. Red Sox girl sat next to him. She was practically in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t look at him when I said, \"We\u0027re trying to decide.\" Emphasis on the \"we\u0027re.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we watch too?\" Conrad asked. \"You guys know Nicole, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, suddenly Conrad felt like being social when he\u0027d spent the whole summer locked up in his room?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" she said in a bored tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said, matching her tone as best I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Nicole,\" Cam said. I wanted to tell him not to be so friendly, but I knew he wouldn\u0027t have listened anyway. \"I want to watch Reservoir Dogs , but Belly wants to watch Titanic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously?\" the girl said, and Conrad laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belly loves Titanic,\" he said mockingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I loved it when I was, like, nine,\" I said. \"I want to watch right now so I can laugh at it, for your information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was as cool as a cucumber. I wasn\u0027t going to let him goad me in front of Cam again. And actually, I still loved Titanic. What wasn\u0027t to love about a doomed romance on a doomed ship? I knew for a fact that Conrad had liked it too, even though he\u0027d pretended not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I vote for Reservoir Dogs\" Nicole said, examining her fingernails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she even get a vote? What was she doing there anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two votes for Reservoir Dogs \" Cam said. \"What about you, Conrad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ll vote for Titanic\" he said blandly. \"Reservoir Dogs sucks even harder than Titanic. It\u0027s overrated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrowed my eyes at him. \"You know what? I think I\u0027ll change my vote to Reservoir Dogs. So it looks like you\u0027re outnumbered, Conrad,\" I said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-38.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
