He tried to pul back, to ease himself away from her, but her legs held him in a grip that wouldn\u0027t all ow retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare stop now,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027l die if you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So will I, Jamie,\" he admitted on a ragged breath. \"So will I.\" He might have managed a smile, but he couldn\u0027t be certain. His body was demanding release, yet he was determined to give her fulfil ment first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe captured her mouth in a searing kiss as he thrust deep, deeper stil . Her body accommodated him so completely, so tightly, so wonderful y. He wanted her fire to consume him, amazed she would so easily make him burn for more, more, always more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie felt as though he was taking her to the stars. She gave herself over to the wonder then, clinging to the man she loved to share the splendor only he could give her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he felt the first tremors of her release, he gave a final thrust and spil ed his hot seed inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know how long they stayed together. He thought he never wanted to leave her, though, and it wasn\u0027t until his heart and his breathing had calmed that he remembered he wanted to tel her he loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get better each time, wife,\" he whispered as he rol ed to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie rol ed with him, tucked the top of her head under his chin, smiling over the teasing lilt in his soft burr. \"You said practice would make me better,\" she reminded him. \"I had no idea we\u0027d practice so often,\" she admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could tel she was arrogantly pleased with herself. Alec smiled against the top of her head, then whispered in Gaelic, \"I know you don\u0027t understand what I\u0027m saying to you, Jamie, but I\u0027ve need to tel you in my own language. I love you, lass, with all my being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt her stiffen against him during his recitation, but when she tried to pul away from him, he held her secure. \"I love you because you\u0027re so gentle and loving, caring, too. Ye have a heart of gold, lass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe all but melted against him then. \"But most of all , Jamie, I love you because you\u0027re such a truthful woman. Aye,\" he added when she stiffened against him again, \"I could never love a woman who\u0027d try to deceive me, but I have complete faith in you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought she might have turned into stone. It took all Alec\u0027s determination not to laugh. \"Good night, Jamie,\" he whispered, in her language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you just say to me?\" Jamie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was trying to sound blase. \"I said good night,\" Alec drawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before that,\" Jamie whispered, a tremor in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Tis not important,\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed away from him so he\u0027d be able to see her frustration. \"Did you mean whatever it was you said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. Jamie almost lost her temper then and there, but she\u0027d already determined to give Alec quite a surprise tomorrow: she was going to kneel before Edgar and recite her pledge in Gaelic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t going to let Alec ruin her surprise. There was that, yes, but there was also the fact he\u0027d just told her he loved her because she was so truthful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was good and trapped by her own hand. And why did she suddenly sense that Alec knew it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the sparkle that came into his eyes, she decided. \"Why are you looking at me like that?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you look as though you\u0027re trying to solve all of England\u0027s considerable problems,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have thought of a smal problem that needs solving,\" Jamie admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tel me what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I will solve it tomorrow, Alec. It\u0027s my problem, after all . I will take care of it. Trust me on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I do trust you, wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" she asked, looking very pleased with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Honesty and trust are like the right and left hands. They\u0027re both important… Now what\u0027s the matter?\" he asked, trying not to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re frowning again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided he\u0027d baited her enough for one evening. \"It\u0027s late, Jamie,\" he said as he pul ed her back into his arms. \"You must be exhausted after your long day. You shouldn\u0027t be trying to solve your problems now. You should be—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleeping,\" she interjected with a sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he countered. \"You should be pleasing your husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just did please you, didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve stil to get it right, lass.\" He rol ed her onto her back. \"But you\u0027re most fortunate to have a patient husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have an insatiable husband, Kincaid. Do you know how many times we\u0027ve—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I to keep count of our lovemaking, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie only had enough time to wrap her arms around her husband before he captured her laughter with a long kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made slow, sweet love. And all the while, Jamie kept hearing his pledge of love. Tomorrow, she promised, tomorrow I will give him my pledge in Gaelic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fel asleep before he\u0027d rol ed away. Alec covered both of them with his plaid and was sound asleep moments later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe only awakened once during the short night, when the door was opened. He was reaching for his sword when Mary Kathleen came running toward the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran to Jamie\u0027s side of the bed first. \"Don\u0027t bother your mother,\" Alec whispered. \"Tel me what\u0027s the matter, Mary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he added to his order by motioning to her, Mary finally obeyed. Her expression was solemn, and when she\u0027d reached his side, he could see the fear in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary held out the bottom of her nightgown. \"I\u0027m wet,\" she whispered. Tears well ed in her eyes, then spil ed down her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec pul ed her gown over her head and tossed the garment on the floor. \"Now you\u0027re not wet,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie had awakened to Mary\u0027s voice. She pretended to be asleep, though, for she knew her husband disliked women who wept. No, she didn\u0027t want him to see how misty her eyes were. He wouldn\u0027t understand the overwhelming love she felt for him when he picked up his daughter and rocked her in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes when he stood up and carried the sleeping child to the door and handed her to one of the soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost called out that it should be the father putting his daughter back in her bed and not one of his soldiers, then remembered that her husband was stark naked, after all , and Edith would certainly die of embarrassment if she woke up and found him in her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat picture was so amusing she had to rol over on her stomach to stifle her giggles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec came back to bed, hauled her up against his side, and was snoring before she\u0027d even gotten herself properly settled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer soft sigh of contentment fil ed the air. She could barely wait for morning. Tomorrow was going to be a glorious day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the worst day of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, it started out well enough. Jamie and Edith had the great hall looking as grand as a palace in less than two hours\u0027 time. Fresh flowers decorated the tables, new rushes covered the floor, and the tal box-shaped chair King Edgar would sit upon was scrubbed spotless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin and Marcus did try Jamie\u0027s patience, however. Every time she turned around, one of the big men was blocking her path. \"Isn\u0027t there something you need to be doing?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers didn\u0027t take her subtle hint. \"It\u0027s our day away from our duties,\" Gavin explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t look as if she believed him. Neither did Marcus, for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why are you fol owing me around?\" Jamie persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers were saved from having to come up with a lie to that question when Mary Kathleen grabbed hold of Jamie\u0027s skirt. The little girl was dressed in a Kincaid gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garment had come from the blacksmith\u0027s family and fit Mary well . Jamie lifted her daughter into her arms, gave her a quick kiss, and whispered a few words of praise in Gaelic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I take Mary with me to Frances\u0027s cottage?\" Edith called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frances?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blacksmith\u0027s wife,\" Edith explained. \"She has several pairs of shoes we can try on Mary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be sure to tel Frances how much I appreciate her help,\" Jamie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith shook her head. \"She\u0027d be insulted. It\u0027s her duty to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie didn\u0027t know what to make of that statement. She handed Mary to Edith, a difficult task, that, since Mary wanted to stay right where she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith explained to her niece what their errand was and finally gained her cooperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027l tel Frances you\u0027re pleased with her,\" Edith called over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bumped into Marcus when she turned around. \"I cannot help but wonder why you\u0027re fol owing me around,\" she said. She let him see her exasperation. \"And why are those soldiers lounging above the stairs? Don\u0027t they have some duties to see to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus shook his head. \"It\u0027s their day off from other duties,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec walked into the hall in time to hear Marcus\u0027s outrageous explanation. He noticed his wife\u0027s incredulous expression, too. \"Jamie? The clan is coming up the last hil s. They\u0027l be here in a few minutes. Some of Harold\u0027s clan is with them. I want you—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re receiving guests now?\" she cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are,\" Alec stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t realize his wife could move so quickly. Alec reached out to grab her when she tried to fly past him. He pul ed her into his arms and forced her to look up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked terribly worried. Alec couldn\u0027t resist. He leaned down and kissed her wrinkled brow. This spontane ous show of affection was stil new to him, but he found he liked it well enough. He kissed her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like to see you frown,\" he whispered. \"Are you worrying again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I need to change my gown,\" she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Whether your English garb be clean or not, it stil won\u0027t matter. They\u0027re bound to hate it as much as I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t give him an answer to that remark. He could tel , though, that she was more amused than irritated. Her reaction puzzled him. He kissed her again, a long, wet kiss on her sweet mouth, and when she wrapped her arms around his waist, his tongue moved inside and began to stroke the roof of her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked thoroughly bemused with him when he finally ended the kiss. He whispered in Gaelic that he loved her, pul ed her hands away from him, and walked down the three steps into the hall .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motioned Gavin and Marcus over to the table. Jamie, he noticed, was slumped against the arch, staring at him. \"Didn\u0027t you want to change your clothes?\" he called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened away from the wall and hurried up the steps. Alec could hear her mutterings all the way across the hall . He smiled in reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man could make her forget her duties with such ease, Jamie thought. When he kissed her, all she could think about was kissing him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to force herself to put Alec out of her mind. There was his surprise to be seen to, after all , and she wouldn\u0027t let him ruin it by robbing her of her determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened the covers on their bed, then changed into a cream-colored ankle-length chemise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose two chores took her just a few minutes, but the wrapping of the plaid was another matter altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe piece of material was approximately twelve feet long after she\u0027d cut a third away. It was narrow, which should have made it easier for her to pleat, but no matter how she tried, she couldn\u0027t get it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn desperation, she opened the door and ordered one of the soldiers to fetch Father Murdock for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest arrived a short while later. She opened the door to his timid knock, then all but pul ed him into the bedroom and slammed the door shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had heard the priest wheeze his way up the stairs. He did raise an eyebrow when he was given entrance to the bedroom. He wondered what in God\u0027s name she\u0027d need Murdock for, then put the matter out of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil , he kept watching the door. When it was finally opened and Murdock came outside, Alec saw the wide smile on the priest\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father Murdock? What were you doing in my chamber?\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest didn\u0027t answer until he\u0027d reached Alec\u0027s side. \"I was assisting your wife,\" he said then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assisting her in what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot tel you,\" Father Murdock stated. He held his smile, even in the face of Alec\u0027s dark expression, then added, \"She\u0027s wanting to give you a little surprise, Alec. Let her have her way. You don\u0027t want to be hurting her feelings by knowing ahead of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you also worry about her feelings,\" Alec answered dryly. \" \u0027Tis an affliction we all seem to share.\" He glanced over at Marcus and then turned to include Gavin in his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bedroom door opened then, drawing his full attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec wasn\u0027t aware he\u0027d stood up. He stared at the vision making her way around the smiling soldiers, feeling such incredible pride he could barely breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing his plaid. And he was so pleased, he couldn\u0027t even speak. It was high time, he kept tel ing himself, high time indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She couldn\u0027t make the pleats. The lass had even folded the garment on the floor and tried to stretch herself out atop it Aye, she\u0027d tried ways I\u0027d never heard of until she confessed them to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so you assisted her,\" Gavin interjected with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She praised me for my quick hands,\" the priest whispered as he, too, watched Jamie come down the stairs. \"My, she\u0027s a bonny lass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie knew she had the men\u0027s full attention. She kept her shoulders straight and her hands at her sides so she wouldn\u0027t accidental y pul one of the pleats away from her belt. When she reached the steps leading down into the hall , she gave her husband a formal curtsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to kiss her again. He might even tel her how proud he was to have her for his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alec motioned to her, Jamie gently lifted the hem of her gown and walked over to him. He reached for her then, but she shook her head and backed up a space. \"Don\u0027t touch me, Alec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t raise your voice either,\" Jamie returned, frowning. \"You can tel me how pleased you are standing right where you are. I\u0027l not have my pleats disturbed before the king arrives, and that\u0027s that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t look at all happy with her now. \"You are pleased with me, aren\u0027t you, husband?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-39.html","bookId":1852,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:43 PM"}
