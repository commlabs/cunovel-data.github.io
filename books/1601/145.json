She had heard that gasp of surprise, sensed the panic in the way the final woman—the strongest of the three had fled. Perhaps she hadn\u0027t anticipated facing such powerful resistance so quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarene kicked at an arm that had been Falion’s. \"Better to have taken them alive for questioning. I am certain we could have learned the identity of that third woman. Did anyone recognize her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMembers of the group shook their heads. \"She was not anyone on the list of Black Ajah who escaped\", Sarene said, taking the arm of her Warder. She has a distinctive face so bulbous, and lacking any qualities of charm. I am certain I would remember her\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was powerful, Aviendha said. Very powerful\". Aviendha would have guessed her as one of the Forsaken. But that certainly hadn’t been Moghedien, and it didn’t match the description of Graendal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We’ll split into three circles\", Aviendha said. \"Bera will lead one of them, Amys and I the others. Yes, we can make circles larger than thirteen now, but it seems a waste. I don’t need that much power to kill. One of our groups will attack the Trollocs below. The other two will avoid channeling, and hide nearby watching. That way, we can goad the enemy channeler into assuming were still in one large circle, and the other two can strike at her from the sides when she comes to attack\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmys smiled. She recognized this as a basic Maiden raiding tactic. She didn’t seem particularly put out to be following Aviendha’s orders, now that annoyance at Rand\u0027s presumption had faded. In fact, if anything, she and the other four Wise Ones looked proud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Aviendha\u0027s team obeyed, she sensed more channeling on the battlefield. Cadsuane and those who followed her liked to consider themselves outside Rand’s orders. They fought while another group of Aes Sedai and Asha’man held open gateways to usher through the Domani and Tairen armies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo many people channeling all about. It was going to grow difficult to pinpoint an attack by one of the Forsaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to set up Traveling grounds\", Aviendha said. \"And keep strict control over who is going to channel and where. That way, we’ll be able to tell in an instant when we sense channeling if something is wrong.’’ She raised her hand to her head. \"This is going to be very difficult to organize\". Nearby, Amys smile widened. You are in command now, Aviendha, that smile seemed to say. And leadership’s headaches are yours to endure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand al’Thor, the Dragon Reborn, turned away from Aviendha and left her and Ituralde to their battle. He had a different one to join.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, the time had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe approached the base of the mountain of Shayol Ghul. Above, a black hole burrowed into the mountain face, the only way to reach the Pit of Doom. Moiraine joined him, pulling close her rippling shawl, its blue fringe catching in the wind. \"Remember. This is not the Bore, this is not the Dark Ones prison. This is merely the place where his touch is strongest upon the world. He has control here\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He touches the entire world now, to one extent or another\", Rand said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so his touch here will be stronger\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand nodded, setting his hand upon the dagger he wore at his belt. \"No channeling until we strike at the Dark One directly. If possible, I would avoid a fight like the one we had at the cleansing. What comes will require all of my strength\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNynaeve nodded. She wore her angreal and ter’angreal jewelry over a gown of yellow, one far more beautiful than she would ever have allowed herself during their days in the Two Rivers. She looked strange to him without her braid, her hair now barely to her shoulders. She seemed somehow older. That shouldn’t be. The braid was a symbol of age and maturity in the Two Rivers. Why should Nynaeve look older without it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThom stepped up beside Rand, squinting up at the hole in the rock. \"I suspect I’m not going in with you\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoiraine looked at him, pursing her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone will need to guard the entry into the cave, my wife\", Thom said. \"That ledge up there right beside the opening has an excellent view of the battlefield. I can watch the battle below, maybe compose a good ballad or two\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand smiled at the spark of humor in Thom’s eyes. They stood at the edge of time itself, and still Thom Merrilin found a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove them, dark clouds spun, the peak of Shayol Ghul their axis. Darkness assaulted the sun until it was nearly gone, entirely covered, in total oblivion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand’s forces stopped, staring in terror at the sky, and even the Trollocs paused, growling and hooting. But as the sun slowly emerged from its captivity, the fierce battle resumed in the valley below. It announced his intentions, but the dagger would shield him from the Dark One’s eyes. The Light willing, the Shadow’s leaders would focus on the battle and assume Rand would wait for its outcome before striking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now?\" Nynaeve asked, looking up the narrow, stony pathway to the cavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand nodded and led the way forward. A wind rose, whipping at the four as they climbed the pathway. He had chosen his clothing deliberately. His red coat, embroidered with long-thorned briars on the sleeves and golden herons on the collar, was a twin to one of those Moiraine had arranged for him to receive in Fal Dara. The white shirt, laced across the front, was of Two Rivers make. Callandor on his back, the sword of Laman at his hip. It had been a long time since he’d chosen to wear that, but it felt appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe winds buffeted him, threatening to throw him from the heights. He pushed forward anyway, climbing the steep hill, gritting his teeth against the pain in his side. Time seemed to have less meaning here, and he felt as if he’d been walking for days when he reached the flat area before the cavern. He turned, resting one hand against the rock of the open maw, and looked out over the valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis forces in the valley seemed so fragile, so insignificant. Would they be able to hold it long enough?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rand . . \". Nynaeve said, taking his arm. \"Perhaps you should rest\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down, following her eyes to his side. His wound, the old wound, had broken open again. He felt blood inside his boot. It had run down his side, down his leg, and when he moved his foot, he left a blood \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-145.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
