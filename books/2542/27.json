The food was getting cold; but was it food she needed, or rest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved to his own bed and sat with a groan. Crossing his left leg over his right, he touched the burn gingerly. He couldn\u0027t use his injured thumb. The cut should have been sutured. God knew how infected it was getting. He was afraid to remove the bandage and look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t see how he was going to work on the machine tonight. The least exertion brought on pain in his leg and lower back; just walking downstairs and up had been a strain. Grimacing, he eased off his left shoe. His feet were swelling too. He had to end it by tomorrow. He wasn\u0027t sure he could last beyond then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe realization drained his waning confidence even further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoises had awakened him - the sound of something thumping on the rug. Slowly he had surfaced from a leaden sleep, thinking that he heard a door shut somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d opened his eyes, Edith was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor several groggy moments he had thought she was in the bathroom. Then, on the periphery of vision, he\u0027d caught sight of something on the floor, and sat up, staring at the manuscript pages scattered across the rug. His gaze had shifted to the area beside the cabinet. Photographs were lying strewn about; a book had fallen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlarm had started rising in him then. Grabbing his cane, he\u0027d stood, his attention caught by the brandy decanter on the table, the silver cup. Crossing to the cabinet, he\u0027d looked down at the photographs, tensing as he saw what they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edith?\" He\u0027d turned toward the bathroom. \"Edith, are you in there?\" He\u0027d limped to the bathroom door and knocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edith?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027d been no reply. He\u0027d waited several moments before turning the knob; the door was unlocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d turned in dismay, hobbling to the door as quickly as he could, trying not to panic; but everything about the situation was ominous: his manuscript thrown to the floor, those photographs, the brandy decanter back on the table, and on top of all that, Edith\u0027s absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d hurried into the corridor and moved to Florence Tanner\u0027s room. Knocking, he\u0027d waited for several seconds, then knocked again. When there\u0027d been no reply, he\u0027d opened the door, to see Miss Tanner heavily asleep on her bed. He\u0027d backed out, shut the door, and moved to Fischer\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027d been no one there, and he\u0027d begun to panic then. He\u0027d moved across the corridor and looked into the entry hall below, thinking he heard voices. Frowning, he\u0027d limped to the stairs and started to descend as quickly as he could, teeth set against the pain in his leg. He\u0027d told her not to do this! What was the matter with her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d heard her voice as he crossed the entry hall, her tone unnatural as she said, \"It\u0027s delicious!\" With renewed alarm, he\u0027d hastened his steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he\u0027d reached the archway and was frozen there, staring into the great hall with a stunned expression, watching Edith, sweater open, bra unhooked, advancing on Fischer, breasts in her hands, ordering him to -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrett closed his eyes and pressed a hand across them. He\u0027d never heard such language from her in their married life, never seen a hint of such behavior, not even to himself, much less to any other man. That she was probably repressed, he\u0027d always known; their sex life had been necessarily constrained. But this -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped his hand and looked at her again. The pain was returning, the distrust, the anger, the desire for retaliation of some kind. He struggled against it. He wanted to believe that the house had done it all to her, but he could not expunge the nagging doubt that somewhere deep within her lay the real cause of what had happened. Which, of course, explained his sudden animosity toward Fischer\u0027s words, he recognized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and crossed to her. They had to talk; he couldn\u0027t stand this doubting any longer. Reaching down, he touched her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe awakened with a gasp, eyes flung open, legs retracting suddenly. Barrett tried to smile but couldn\u0027t. \"I\u0027ve brought your supper,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Supper.\" She spoke the word as though she\u0027d never heard it in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded once. \"Why don\u0027t you wash up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith looked around the room. Was she wondering where he\u0027d put the photographs? he thought. He withdrew as she sat up, looking down at herself. He\u0027d refastened her bra and closed her sweater with what buttons remained. Her right hand fluttered up the front of her sweater; then she stood and crossed to the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrett limped to the octagonal table, picked up the boxed manuscript, and placed it on the library table against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith great effort he pulled the chair beside her bed over to the octagonal table and sat down. He eyed the lamb chops and vegetables on his plate and sighed. He should never have brought her to this house. It had been a dreadful mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned as the bathroom door opened. Edith, her face washed and hair combed, walked over to the table and sat. She did not pick up her fork, but sat hunched over, gaze deflected, looking like a chastened girl. Barrett cleared his throat. \"The food is cold,\" he said, \"but. . . well, you need something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw her dig her teeth into her lower lip as it began to tremble. After several moments she replied, \"You don\u0027t have to be polite to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrett felt a sudden need to shout at her, fought it off. \"You shouldn\u0027t have had any more of that brandy,\" he said. \"I examined it before, and unless I\u0027m mistaken, it contains more than fifty percent absinthe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up questioningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An aphrodisiac.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gazed at him in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for the rest,\" he heard himself say, \"there is a powerful influence in this house. I think it\u0027s begun to affect you.\" Why am I saying this? he wondered. Why am I absolving her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, the look. Barrett felt a tremor in his stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all?\" she finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve . . . solved the problem?\" There was an undertone of resentful mortification in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrett tensed. \"I\u0027m trying to be rational.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you rather I ranted? Called you names?\" He pulled himself erect. \"I\u0027m trying, for the moment, to blame it on outside forces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I haven\u0027t provided sufficient . . . physical love,\" he said with difficulty. \"There is the polio damage, but I suppose that\u0027s not a full excuse. Maybe it\u0027s my mother\u0027s influence, maybe my total absorption in my work, my inability to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I\u0027m blaming it on that,\" he said determinedly. \"On myself and on the house.\" There was a sheen of perspiration on his brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took out his handkerchief and wiped it off. \"Kindly permit me to do so,\" he said. \"If there are other factors involved . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe\u0027ll work them out later. After we\u0027ve left this house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited. Edith managed a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have told me what happened last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About your almost walking into the tarn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked as though she were about to speak; but as he said no more, she changed her mind. \"I didn\u0027t want to worry you,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\" He stood with a groan. \"I think I\u0027ll rest my leg a bit before I go downstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to work tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to finish by tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked beside him to the bed and watched as he lay down, lifting his right leg with effort. He saw her trying not to show reaction to the swollen state of his ankles. \"I\u0027ll be all right,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood beside the bed, looking at him worriedly. Finally she said, \"Do you want me to leave, Lionel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quiet for a while before he answered. \"Not if you\u0027ll stay with me all the time from now on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" She seemed to hold back, then, on impulse, sat beside him. \"I know you can\u0027t forgive me now,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t expect it - no, please don\u0027t speak. I know what I\u0027ve done. I\u0027d give twenty years of my life to undo it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head dropped forward. \"I don\u0027t know why I drank like that, except that I was nervous - frightened. I don\u0027t know why I went downstairs. I was conscious of what I was doing, yet, at the same time - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, tears brimming in her eyes. \"I\u0027m not asking for forgiveness. Just try not to hate me too much. I need you, Lionel. I love you. And I don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening to me.\" She could hardly speak now. \"I just don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear.\" Despite the pain, Barrett sat up and put his arms around her, pressing his cheek to hers. \"It\u0027s all right, all right. It will all pass after we\u0027ve left this house.\" He turned his face to kiss her hair. \"I love you, too. But then, you\u0027ve always known that, haven\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith clung to him, sobbing. It\u0027s going to be all right, he told himself. It had been the house. Everything would be resolved after they left. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hell-house/page-27.html","bookId":2542,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:29 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:29 AM"}
