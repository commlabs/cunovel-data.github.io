He couldn\u0027t remember opening them, could barely remember a time when they weren\u0027t open. Slowly he was able to resolve the image, could see that he was looking up from underneath at a molten drift of ice cubes. Something hard and intrusive was pushing air into his lungs in a rhythmic pumping that was not so much painful - no, he didn\u0027t feel any pain at all - as it was incredibly uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reared up so fast that spots swam before his eyes and with cold-numbed fingers tore at the mask taped across his face, tore it away and then pulled, pulled at an impossibly long length of tubing that came out of his chest, from somewhere deep down with a tugging sensation then a tearing but still there was no pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around at the bathroom tiles, at the tub full of ice and yellowish water. At the tubes attached to his left arm. He tore those away too, leaving a deep gouge in his arm when the shunt there tore open his rubbery wet skin. No blood seeped from the wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. No, of course not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary began a careful self-check of his faculties. The spots that danced in front of his eyes to the one-note concerto of tinnitus weren\u0027t going away. There was a buzzing at the back of his head he knew wasn\u0027t really there but made him want to answer a telephone. Not a sign of brain damage, that impulse, just simple Pavlovian response, of course. You heard a ringing tone in that particular frequency and you rushed to answer it, the way you\u0027d been doing all your life. There weren\u0027t any telephones anymore, of course. He would never hear a ringing telephone again. He would have to unlearn the behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis legs felt a bit weak. Nothing to panic about. His brain... had survived, had come through almost unscathed. It had worked! Before he could celebrate though he had to assuage his vanity. He stumped over to the sink, held onto the porcelain with both hands. Looked up and into the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA trifle cyanotic, maybe. Blueness in his jaw, at his temples. Very pale. His eyes were shot with read where capillaries had burst open... perhaps that would heal, in time. If he could heal anymore. A vein under his left cheek lay dead and swollen so blue it was almost black. Peering, prodding, stretching the skin of his face with his fingers he found other clots and occlusions, web-like traceries of dead veins. Like the veins in a piece of marble, he thought, or a piece of Stilton. Without the veins a piece of marble is just granite. Without the blue veins a piece of Stilton is just plain cheese. The dead veins gave his face a certain character, maybe, a certain gravitas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was better than he\u0027d hoped for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed against his wrist with two fingers, found no pulse. He closed his eyes and listened and realized for the first time that he wasn\u0027t breathing. Primordial urges swelled up in his reptilian cortex, inbred terrors of drowning and suffocation and his chest spasmed, flexed, tried to suck in air but couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanicking - knowing it was panic, unable to stop he knocked over the stolen dialysis machine and heard it smash on the floor as he pushed his way out of the enclosed bathroom, pushed his way out toward light and air. His legs twisted beneath him, threatening to topple him at any second, his arms stretched out, the muscles straining, stretching taut as steel cables beneath his cold skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stumbled forward until his legs gave way, until he smashed down onto the white shag rug. His body heaved and shuddered trying to catch a breath, any puff of air at all. Just instinct, he screamed in his mind, it\u0027s just reflex and it\u0027ll stop, it\u0027ll stop soon. His cheek rubbed back and forth across the shag and he felt the heat of friction as his body moved spasmodically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually his system quieted, his body gave in. His lungs stopped moving and he lay still, energy gone. Kind of hungry. He looked up, looked at the bluest sky beyond his windows. The white fleecy clouds, passing by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all going to work out. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/monster-island-zombies-1/page-2.html","bookId":2464,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:37:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:37:27 PM"}
