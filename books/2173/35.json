violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Lessons of Choice, The BuSab Manual\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe senior attendant of the Courtarena, a squat and dignified Gowachin of the Assumptive Phylum, confronted McKie at the arena door with a confession:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have delayed informing you that some of your witnesses have been excluded by Prosecution challenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attendant, whose name was Darak, gave a Gowachin shrug, waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie glanced beyond the attendant at the truncated oval of the arena entrance which framed a lower section of the audience seats.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The seats were filled.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He had expected some such challenge for this first morning session of the trial, saw Darak\u0027s words as a vital revelation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were accepting his gambit.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Darak had signaled a risky line of attack by those who guided Ceylang\u0027s performance.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They expected McKie to protest.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He glanced back at Aritch, who stood quietly submissive three steps behind his Legum.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aritch gave every appearance of having resigned himself to the arena\u0027s conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The forms must be obeyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath that appearance lay the hoary traditions of Gowachin Law - The guilty are innocent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Governments always do evil.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Legalists put their own interests first.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Defense and prosecution are brother and sister.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Suspect everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch\u0027s Legum controlled the initial posture and McKie had chosen defense.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It hadn\u0027t surprised him to be told that Ceylang would prosecute.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie had countered by insisting that Broey sit on a judicial panel which would be limited to three members.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This had caused a delay during which Bildoon had called McKie, probing for any betrayal.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Bildoon\u0027s approach had been so obvious that McKie had at first suspected a feint within a feint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"McKie, the Gowachin fear that you have a Caleban at your command.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That\u0027s a force which they . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The more they fear the better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie had stared back at the screen-framed face of Bildoon, observing the signs of strain.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Jedrik was right:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the non-Dosadi were very easy to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m told you left this Dosadi in spite of a Caleban contract which prohibited . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let them worry.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Good for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie watched Bildoon intently without betraying a single emotion.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No doubt there were others monitoring this exchange.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Let them begin to see what they faced.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Puppet Bildoon was not about to uncover what those shadowy forces wanted.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They had Bildoon here on Tandaloor, though, and this told McKie an essential fact.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The PanSpechi chief of BuSab was being offered as bait.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This was precisely the response McKie sought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBildoon had ended the call without achieving his purpose.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie had nibbled only enough to insure that Bildoon would be offered again as bait.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And the puppet masters still feared that McKie had a Caleban at his beck and call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt the puppet masters had tried to question their God Wall Caleban.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie hid a smile, thinking how that conversation must have gone.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Caleban had only to quote the letter of the contract, and if the questioners became accusatory the Caleban would respond with anger, ending the exchange.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And the Caleban\u0027s words would be so filled with terms subject to ambiguous translation that the puppet masters would never be certain of what they heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he stared at the patiently waiting Darak, McKie saw that they had a problem, those shadowy figures behind Aritch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Laupuk had removed Mrreg from their councils and his advice would have been valuable now.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie had deduced that the correct reference was \"The Mrreg\" and that Aritch headed the list of possible successors.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aritch might be Dosadi-trained but he was not Dosadi-born.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was a lesson in this that the entire ConSentiency would soon learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Broey as a judge in this case remained an unchangeable fact.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey was Dosadi-born.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Caleban contract had kept Broey on his poison planet, but it had not limited him to a Gowachin body.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey knew what it was to be both Human and Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey knew about the Pcharkys and their use by those who\u0027d held Dosadi in bondage.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And Broey was now Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The forces opposing McKie dared not name another Gowachin judge.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They must choose from the other species.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They had an interesting quandary.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And without a Caleban assistant, there were no more Pcharkys to be had on Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The most valuable coin the puppet masters had to offer was lost to them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They\u0027d be desperate.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Some of the older ones would be very desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps sounded around the turn of the corridor behind Aritch.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie glanced back, saw Ceylang come into view with her attendants.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie counted no less than twenty leading Legums around her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were out in force.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Not only Gowachin pride and integrity, but their sacred view of Law stood at issue.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And the desperate ones stood behind them, goading.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie could almost see those shadowy figures in the shape of this entourage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeylang, he saw, wore the black robes and white-striped hood of Legum Prosecutor, but she\u0027d thrown back the hood to free her mandibles.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie detected tension in her movements.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She gave no sign of recognition, but McKie saw her through Dosadi eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frighten her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And she\u0027s right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to address the waiting attendant and speaking loudly to make sure that the approaching group heard, McKie said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every law must be tested.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I accept that you have given me formal announcement of a limit on my defense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarak, expecting outraged protest and a demand for a list of the excluded witnesses, showed obvious confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Formal announcement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeylang and entourage came to a stop behind Aritch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie went on in the same loud voice:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We stand here within the sphere of the Courtarena.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;All matters concerning a dispute in the arena are formal in this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attendant glanced at Ceylang, seeking help.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This response threatened him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Darak, hoping someday to be a High Magister, should now be recognizing his inadequacies.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He would never make it in the politics of the Gowachin Phyla, especially not in the coming Dosadi age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie explained as though to a neophyte:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Information to be verified by my witnesses is known to me in its entirety.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I will present the evidence myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeylang, having stooped to hear a low-voiced comment from one of her Gowachin advisors, showed surprise at this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She raised one of her ropey tendrils, called, \"I protest.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Defense Legum cannot give . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you protest?\" McKie interrupted.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"We stand here before no judicial panel empowered to rule on any protest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I make formal protest!\" Ceylang insisted, ignoring an advisor on her right who was tugging at her sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie permitted himself a cold smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Then we must call Darak into the arena as witness, he being the only party present who is outside our dispute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe edges of Aritch\u0027s jaws came down in a Gowachin grimace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the end, I warned them not to go with the Wreave,\" he said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"They cannot say they came here unwarned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late, Ceylang saw what had happened.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie would be able to question Darak on the challenges to the witnesses.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Some of those challenges were certain to be overturned.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;At the very least, McKie would know who the Prosecution feared.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He would know it in time to act upon it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There would be no delays valuable to Prosecution.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Tension, fear, and pride had made Ceylang act precipitately.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aritch had been right to warn them, but they counted on McKie\u0027s fear of the interlocked Wreave triads.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Let them count.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Let them blunt their awareness on that and on a useless concern over the excluded witnesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie motioned Darak through the doorway into the arena, heard him utter an oath.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The reason became apparent as McKie pressed through in the crowded surge of the Prosecutor\u0027s party.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The instruments of Truth-by-Pain had been arrayed on their ancient rack below the judges.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Seldom brought out of their wrappings even for display to visiting dignitaries these days, the instruments had not been employed in the arena within the memory of a living witness.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie had expected this display.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was obvious that Darak and Ceylang had not.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was interesting to note the members of Ceylang\u0027s entourage who were watching for McKie\u0027s response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave them a grin of satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie turned his attention to the judicial panel.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They had given him Broey.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The ConSentiency, acting through BuSab, held the right of one appointment.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Their choice delighted McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Bait, indeed!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Bildoon occupied the seat on Broey\u0027s right.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The PanSpechi chief of bureau sat there all bland and reserved in his unfamiliar Gowachin robes of water green.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Bildoon\u0027s faceted eyes glittered in the harsh arena lighting.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The third judge had to be the Gowachin choice and undoubtedly maneuvered (as Bildoon had been) by the puppet masters.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was a Human and McKie, recognizing him, missed a step, recovered his balance with a visible effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat were they doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third judge was named Mordes Parando, a noted challenger of BuSab actions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He wanted BuSab eliminated - either outright or by removing some of the bureau\u0027s key powers.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He came from the planet Lirat, which provided McKie with no surprises.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Lirat was a natural cover for the shadowy forces.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was a place of enormous wealth and great private estates guarded by their own security forces.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Parando was a man of somewhat superficial manners which might conceal a genuine sophisticate, knowledgeable and erudite, or a completely ruthless autocrat of Broey\u0027s stamp.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He was certainly Dosadi-trained.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And his features bore the look of the Dosadi Rim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one more fact about Parando which no one outside Lirat was supposed to know.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie had come upon it quite by chance while investigating a Palenki who\u0027d been an estate guard on Lirat.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The turtlelike Palenki were notoriously dull, employed chiefly as muscle.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This one had been uncommonly observant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parando makes advice on Gowachin Law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had been responsive to a question about Parando\u0027s relationship with the estate guard being investigated.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie, not seeing a connection between question and answer, had not pursued the matter, but had tucked this datum away for future investigation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He had been mildly interested at the time because of the rumored existence of a legalist enclave on Lirat and such enclaves had been known to test the limits of legality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people behind Aritch would expect McKie to recognize Parando.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Would they expect Parando to be recognized as a legalist?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were certain to know the danger of putting Parando on a Gowachin bench.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Professional legalists were absolutely prohibited from Gowachin judicial service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let the people judge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would they need a legalist here?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Or were they expecting McKie to recognize the Rim origins of Parando\u0027s body?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Were they warning McKie not to raise that issue here?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Body exchange and the implications of immortality represented a box of snakes no one wanted to open.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And the possibility of one species spying on another. . .\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was fragmentation of the ConSentiency latent in this case.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;More ways than one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I challenge Parando, his replacement may be more dangerous.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If I expose him as a legalist after the trial starts . . .\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Could they expect me to do that?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Let us explore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing he was watched by countless eyes, McKie swept his gaze around the arena.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Above the soft green absorbent oval where he stood were rank on rank of benches, every seat occupied.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Muted morning light from the domed translucent ceiling illuminated rows of Humans, Gowachin, Palenki, Sobarips . . .\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie identified a cluster of ferret Wreaves just above the arena, limber thin with a sinuous flexing in every movement.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They would bear watching.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But every species and faction in the ConSentiency would be represented here.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Those who could not come in person would watch these proceedings via the glittering transmitter eyes which looked down from the ceiling\u0027s edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, McKie looked to the right at the witness pen set into the wall beneath the ranked benches.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He identified every witness he\u0027d called, even the challenged ones.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The forms were being obeyed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;While the ConSentient Covenant required certain modifications here, this arena was still dominated by Gowachin Law.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;To accent that, the blue metal box from the Running Phylum occupied the honor place on the bench in front of the judicial panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho will taste the knife here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtocol demanded that Prosecutor and Defense approach to a point beneath the judges, abase themselves, and call out acceptance of the arena\u0027s conditions.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Prosecutor\u0027s party, however, was in disarray.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Two of Ceylang\u0027s advisors were whispering excited advice to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe members of the Judicial panel conferred, glancing at the scene below them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They could not act formally until the obeisance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie passed a glance across the panel, absorbed Broey\u0027s posture.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Dosadi Gowachin\u0027s enlightened greed was like an anchor point.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was like Gowachin Law, changeable only on the surface.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And Broey was but the tip of the Dosadi advisory group which Jedrik had approved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding his arms extended to the sides, McKie marched forward, abased himself face down on the floor, stood and called out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I accept this arena as my friend.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The conditions here are my conditions but Prosecution has defiled the sacred traditions of this place.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Does the court give me leave to slay her outright?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an exclamation behind him, the sound of running, the sudden flopping of a body onto the arena\u0027s matted floor.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ceylang could not address the court before this obeisance and she knew it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She and the others now also knew something else just as important - that McKie was ready to slay her despite the threat of Wreave vendetta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a breathless voice, Ceylang called out her acceptance of the arena\u0027s conditions, then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I protest this trick by Defense Legum!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie saw the stirring of Gowachin in the audience.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A trick?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Didn\u0027t Ceylang know yet how the Gowachin dearly loved legal tricks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe members of the judicial panel had been thoroughly briefed on the surface demands of the Gowachin forms, though it was doubtful that Bildoon understood sufficiently what went on beneath those forms.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The PanSpechi confirmed this now by leaning forward to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does the senior attendant of this court enter ahead of the Legums?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie detected a fleeting smile on Broey\u0027s face, glanced back to see Darak standing apart from the prosecution throng, alone and trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie took one step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will the court direct Darak to the witness pen?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He is here because of a formal demand by the Prosecutor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the senior attendant of your court,\" Ceylang argued.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"He guards the door to . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prosecution made formal protest to a matter which occurred in the presence of this attendant,\" McKie said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"As an attendant, Darak stands outside the conflicting interests.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He is the only reliable witness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroey stirred, looked at Ceylang, and McKie realized how strange the Wreave must appear to a Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This did not deter Broey, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you protest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a direct question from the bench.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ceylang was required to answer.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She looked to Bildoon for help but he remained silent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Parando also refused to help her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She glanced at Darak.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The terrified attendant could not take his attention from the instruments of pain.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Perhaps he knew something specific about their presence in the arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeylang tried to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Defense

Dosadi emigres all across the ConSentiency.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Media representatives had been excluded from Dosadi and this court on the Gowachin argument that they were \"prey to uninformed

here.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;To emphasise it, he ran a hand from the front of his neck down his chest, the unique Rim Raider\u0027s salute from Dosadi signifying \"Death before surrender.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Subtle hints in the movement gave McKie another datum:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Parando was a Gowachin in a Human body.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They\u0027d dared put two Gowachin on that panel!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Dosadi insight, McKie saw why they did this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were prepared to produce the Caleban contract

wanted.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They had but to demand that he prove it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Without the other person . . .\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What had their God Wall Caleban told

exceptions:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Grinik (that flawed thread which might have led to The Mrreg) and Stiggy.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie was not certain why they wanted to exclude the Dosadi weapons genius who\u0027d transformed a BuSab wallet\u0027s contents into instruments of victory.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Was it that Stiggy had broken an unbreakable code?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That made sense only if Prosecution intended to play down the inherent Dosadi superiority.Still uncertain, McKie prepared to retire and seek a way to avoid Parando\u0027s gambit, but Ceylang addressed the

expected.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Prosecution did not really want Jedrik as a witness, not in a Gowachin Courtarena where the roles were never quite what they appeared to non-Gowachin.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This was a plain message to McKie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to find her and kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Bildoon and Parando

her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But Prosecution and all the judges had to concur.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They obviously would not do this - not yet.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;A harsh lock on his emotions, McKie gave the jumpdoor instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, Jedrik stepped onto the arena floor, faced the judges.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She\u0027d been into the wardrobe at his bower

were forced to explain, however, because of those other judges to whom every nuance here was vital.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She heard them out in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An alleged

granted.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey announced the decision, smiling down at Jedrik.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was a measure of McKie\u0027s Dosadi conditioning that he could not find it in himself to blame Broey for wanting personal victory over the person who had beaten him on Dosadi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in his quarters, Jedrik put a hand on McKie\u0027s chest, spoke with eyes

aides were Dosadi-born.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They could be depended upon to be loyal to their origins, to their conditioning, to themselves individually.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;For the task assigned to them, they were the best available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie brought it to a close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t leave the immediate area of the arena until the trial\u0027s
