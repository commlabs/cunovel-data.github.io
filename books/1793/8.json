Takes a while to get past it, and experts advise people not to make serious relationship commitments during that time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense.\" Edith snorted. \"What do the so-called experts know when it comes to love and marriage? Besides, it\u0027s been a year and a half now, and I\u0027m sure Jeremy doesn\u0027t need another six months to recover. He just needs the right woman to help him forget. I think Octavia is doing him a world of good. She\u0027s pulling him out of his shell. He\u0027s been a little down since the divorce, you know. I was worried about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder any other circumstances, Nick thought, he would have avoided the topic of Jeremy\u0027s divorce the same way he would have gone out of his way to sidestep a cobra in his path. But the fact that Edith thought that Octavia looked like a good candidate to take the place of Jeremy\u0027s ex was an irritating goad that he could not ignore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised to hear you say that,\" he began coolly. \"Personally I wouldn\u0027t have thought they\u0027d have muchâ€”\" He was interrupted by the blare of a horn. He glanced toward the street and saw a familiar battered pickup truck rumbling past. There was no mistaking the driver. Arizona Snow was garbed in her customary camouflage-patterned fatigues. A military-style beret slanted across her gray hair in a jaunty fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised a hand in greeting. Carson waved madly. Arizona waved back, but she did not pause. A woman on a mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the great thing about being a professional conspiracy theorist, he thought. You always had a mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pickup continued down the block and pulled into the parking lot in front of the Incandescent Body bakery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith sighed. \"Expect you heard the news about old Tom Thurgarton\u0027s will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rafe said something about Thurgarton having left all his worldly possessions to Virgil Nash, Arizona, and the New Age crowd running the bakery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Edith shook her head. \"Of all the ridiculous notions. Just like Thurgarton to do something so bizarre. He was such an odd man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick nodded. \"Yeah, he was always a little weird, wasn\u0027t he? A real recluse. He lived here in town all the time I was growing up but I doubt if I saw him more than half a dozen times a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They say that Thurgarton\u0027s phobia about leaving his house got worse as time went on. Everyone was so accustomed to not seeing him that no one even knew he was dead until Jake down at the post office finally noticed that he hadn\u0027t picked up his mail in over two months. When Sean Valentine went out to see what was going on, he found Thurgarton\u0027s body in the kitchen. Heart attack, they say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonder if he left anything valuable to Virgil and A.Z. and the Heralds,\" Nick mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it.\" Edith sniffed as they came to a halt in front of the door of Seaton\u0027s Antiques. \"The way Chief Valentine tells it, that old cabin was crammed with over forty years\u0027 worth of junk. A real firetrap, he said. Old newspapers and magazines stacked to the ceiling. Boxes full of unopened mail. Cartons of things he\u0027d ordered from catalogs that had never been unpacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going to be interesting to see what kind of conspiracy theory A.Z. will weave out of this,\" Nick said with a smile. \"She\u0027s nothing if not inventive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid A.Z. is one brick shy of a load, and hanging out with the crowd from the bakery isn\u0027t improving the situation.\" Edith turned the key in the lock and stepped into her shop. \"Goodbye, you two. Good luck with your pictures, Carson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye, Mrs. Seaton.\" Carson was struggling to be polite, but he was already edging off toward the neighboring shop door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you later,\" Nick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Carson continued on to the front door of Bright Visions. Instead of rushing inside, Carson paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you could stay out here on the sidewalk while I show my pictures to Miss Brightwell,\" he suggested hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarson heaved a sigh, resigned. \"Okay, but promise me again that you won\u0027t say anything to make her mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already said that I\u0027d do my best not to annoy her.\" Nick glanced through the window into the gallery showroom. The Open sign showed through the glass, but he could not see Octavia. She was probably in her cluttered back room, he decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrapped his hand around the knob and twisted. The now-familiar sense of anticipation sleeted through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door swung inward, revealing a universe of intense color and light. The artwork that hung on the walls ran the gamut from landscapes to the abstract, but the pictures were grouped in some inexplicably magical fashion that somehow managed to make the whole greater than the sum of its parts. A sense of connection and coherence pervaded the scene. The viewer was drawn from one to another in a subtle progression that took him deeper into the little cosmos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an art to displaying paintings to their best advantage, Nick thought. Octavia knew what she was doing. No wonder she prospered. It was hard not to buy a picture when you were in this gallery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarson hurried inside, clutching his drawings in both hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Brightwell?\" he called. \"Where are you? I\u0027ve got my pictures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctavia came to stand in the open doorway behind the counter. The sweeping hemline of a long, full skirt in the palest possible shade of ice blue swirled around her shapely calves. She wore a matching silk blouse. A tiny blue belt studded with small chunks of clear crystal encircled her trim waist. Her fiery hair was held back off her face by a pale aqua scarf that had been folded to form a narrow headband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople in the art world were supposed to wear black, Nick thought. Until he\u0027d met Octavia, he had always assumed it was a rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, he felt his insides clench at the sight of her. He ought to be getting used to this sensation, he thought. But the appearance of the Fairy Queen never failed to steal his breath for a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she met his gaze across the showroom, Nick could almost see the familiar, concealing veil slip into place. But when she looked at Carson, she was all smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning,\" she said, speaking more to the boy than the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Miss Brightwell.\" Carson blossomed in the warmth of her smile. \"I brought my pictures to show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may have noticed that we\u0027re here a little early,\" Nick said dryly. \"And we came without coffee and muffins. Carson was in a hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get you some coffee and a muffin right after you see my pictures,\" Carson assured her, looking a little worried because of the oversight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-8.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
