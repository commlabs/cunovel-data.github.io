{"id":81890,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicha\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called my dad from the road and got his address. He tried to talk to me a little bit, but I hung up on him. Confronting him for bailing is not something I\u0027m going to do over the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lives about two hours away, which pisses me off. Two hours away and he hasn\u0027t stopped by once. When I pull up to his house, my hands nearly choke the life out of the steering wheel. He lives in a two-story white-brick mansion. The neighborhood is nice with gigantic houses and people walking their dogs along the sidewalk. There\u0027s no drug dealings going on, no fights, no junky cars parked in the front yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit in my car staring at the red door with a big \"Welcome\" sign hanging on it. There are flowers around the front of the yard and the grass is green and cut. Is this why he left us? Because he wanted a fancier life. Why the fuck couldn\u0027t he do that with us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone beeps in my pocket and I turn it off. It\u0027s Ella and I can\u0027t talk to her right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door opens and a man in his forties steps out onto the porch. His hair is the same color of blonde as mine, but thinner. He\u0027s wearing a black suit and looks like an arrogant prick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoops up the newspaper from the ground and squints at my car as he trots off the porch. I count to five in my head, force my hands away from the steering wheel, and get out of the car. He recognizes me immediately and his face drains of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Micha?\" He tucks the newspaper under his arm. \"Is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take another deep breath and walk across the front lawn. \"I don\u0027t even know why I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you come inside so we can talk?\" he suggests. I follow him into the house that\u0027s even nicer on the inside; hardwood floors, a massive chandelier, and freshly painted walls with family pictures on them. \"You have a family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tosses the newspaper onto a table and motions for me to have a seat in the living room. \"Yeah, a daughter that\u0027s twelve and a son that\u0027s eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling awkward, I sit down in a chair that\u0027s decorated with frilly pillows. He seats himself across from me, seeming like he has no idea what to do or say next. \"So how have you been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Super.\" There\u0027s a large portrait on the wall taken in a church of him and his wife on their wedding day and I stare at it, doing the math. \"How long have you been remarried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fidgets uncomfortably as he leans back in the chair and stations his foot onto his knee. \"Micha, look I\u0027d rather not get into this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do? Like run out on us and marry the first person you came across?\" Anger burns in my voice. He looks away toward the window and I get it. \"You were seeing her while you were still with mom, weren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe makes eye contact with me again, with eyes exactly like mine. \"Look Micha, there were things going on between your mother and I that you don\u0027t understand... I wasn\u0027t happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were things going on between you and me, too,\" I snap. \"So what\u0027s your excuse for that one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubs a hand across his face and lets out an exhausted sigh. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clench my hands into fists, fighting the urge to jump off the couch and strangle him. \"You\u0027re sorry? Great answer, asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snatches a manila folder out of the drawer of the end table and slams it down on the coffee table between us. \"Your grandfather left you some money in his will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes flash from the folder to my father. \"Is that why you brought me here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens the folder and takes a small stack of papers out. \"I thought maybe you could use it to go to college or something. That would be nice, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking my head, I get to my feet. \"I\u0027m not going to college and you\u0027d understand that if you knew me past the age of six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slides the papers across the table and sets a pen next to them. \"Please just take the money, Micha. I want to know that you\u0027re taken care of otherwise it\u0027ll haunt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause. \"Are you planning on ever seeing me again?\" His silence gives me the only answer I need. \"I don\u0027t want your God damn money.\" I throw the papers at him and storm for the front door. \"Give it to one of your real kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t call after me when I stomp out the door and he doesn\u0027t chase me down. I march straight for my car, getting more furious with each step, and I slam my fist into the driver\u0027s side window. It doesn\u0027t break, but a couple of my knuckles pop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck!\" I shout, clutching my hand and the old lady across the street, who\u0027s working in her garden, scurries inside her mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jump in my car and speed off down the road with no idea where the hell I\u0027m going. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-1/page-18.html","bookId":1861,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:09 PM"}
