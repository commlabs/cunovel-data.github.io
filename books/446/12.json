{"id":42853,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"The work went on, for Cadnan as well as for the masters. Days passed and he began to improve slightly: he received no further discipline, and he was beginning to settle into a routine. Only thoughts of Dara disturbed him—those, and the presence of Marvor, who was still apparently waiting to make good his incomprehensible threat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marvor had said he was going to leave, but he still appeared every evening in the same room. Cadnan had hardly dared to question him, for fear of being drawn into the plan, whatever it was: he could only wait and watch and wish for someone to talk to. But, of course, there was no one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then, one day during the first part of his working shift, a master came into the room, the very master who had gone with Cadnan through his training. \"You\u0027re Cadnan?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cadnan said: \"I am Cadnan.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The master beckoned through the open door of Cadnan\u0027s working-room, and two more masters appeared, strange ones, leading between them an elder. The elder, Cadnan saw at once, had lived through many matings: the green skin of his arms was turning to silver, and his eye was no longer bright, but dulling fast with age. He looked at the working-room and at the young Albert with blank caution.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This one is called Gornom,\" the master said. \"He\u0027ll be with you when you work. He\u0027s going to help you work—you can teach him all he has to know. Just make sure you don\u0027t let him handle the buttons until we give you the word. All right?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cadnan understood. \"All right,\" he said, and the three masters left the room without more words. The door shut behind them and Gornom visibly relaxed. Yet there was still wariness behind the old eye. \"I work in the field,\" he said after a second. \"I am good worker in the field.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cadnan knew from gossip about the field: that was the place where the metal lay. Alberts worked there, digging it up and bringing it to the buildings where Cadnan and many like him took over the job. He nodded slowly, bending his body from the waist instead of from the neck like the masters, or Marvor. \"If you are in the field,\" he said, \"why do you come here? This is not a place for diggers.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am brought here,\" Gornom said. \"I am an elder many times. What the masters say, I do. Now they say I come here, and I come.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cadnan looked doubtful. \"You are to work with me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So the masters say.\" That was unanswerable, and Cadnan accepted it. He flicked a glance at the TV screen which showed him the smelting process, and leaped for the buttons. After a few minutes of action he was finished: there was a slight breathing-space.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am to tell you what to do,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gornom looked grave. \"I see what it is you do,\" he said. \"It is a lesson. When you act for the masters, the great machines obey you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is true,\" Cadnan said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is the lesson,\" Gornom said slowly, as if it were truly important. \"We are shown the machines so that we may learn to be like the machines. When the master tells us what to do, we are to do it. There is nothing else.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cadnan thought about that. It made sense: it made a structure he could understand, and it made the world a less confusing place. \"You have said a truth,\" he judged at last.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is one of many truths,\" Gornom said. And that was an invitation, Cadnan recognized. He hesitated no more than a second.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where may I learn the others?\" But Gornom didn\u0027t answer, and Cadnan\u0027s breathing-space was over. He had to be back at the board, pushing buttons, watching carefully. Gornom stood behind him, peering over his shoulder with a cloudy eye. Neither said a word until the new spell of work was over. Then Cadnan repeated his question.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is not for all,\" Gornom said distantly. \"One must be chosen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have come to me,\" Cadnan said. \"You have been sent to me. Is this what you call chosen?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was the right answer, perhaps the only right answer. Gornom pretended to consider the matter for a minute, but his mind was already made up. \"We are above you, on the floor over yours,\" he said. \"When our work is finished I will take you there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cadnan imagined a parade of new truths, a store of knowledge that would lay all his questions to rest and leave him, as after a meal, entirely satisfied. He went back to work and contemplated the first of the truths: he was to be like the machine. He promised himself he would try to imitate the machine, doing only what the masters ordered. And for the rest of that day, indeed, life seemed to make perfect calming sense.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But, after all, Gornom was only an elder and not a master. He could be wrong.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The doubt appeared at the end of the day, but by then Gornom had the younger Albert in tow. They took the elevator up one flight and went to Gornom\u0027s room: the novelty of all of this excited Cadnan so that he nearly forgot his new doubts. They shrank perceptibly without disappearing altogether.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gornom opened the door of the new room. Inside, Cadnan saw six elders, sitting in a circle on the floor. The circle, incomplete, was open toward the door, and all six big eyes were staring at the newcomers. The floor was nearly bare: the leaves had been brushed into mounds that lay in the corners.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Without a word, Gornom sat in the circle and motioned Cadnan to a place beside him. Moving slowly and uncertainly, Cadnan came forward and sat down. There was a second of absolute silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One of the other elders said: \"You bring a new one to us?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I bring a new one,\" Gornom said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The other elder, leaning forward from the waist, peered at Cadnan. His eye was larger than normal, and glittering cold. Cadnan, awestruck, neither spoke nor moved, and the elder regarded him for a time and then said abruptly: \"Not all are called to the truth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He has been called,\" Gornom said. \"He has been chosen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How is he chosen?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gornom explained. When he had finished, a silence thick as velvet descended upon the room. Then, very suddenly, all the elders spoke at once.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"May the masters live forever.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cadnan, by this time, was nearly paralyzed with fright. He sat very still. The elders continued, in a slow, leaden chorus:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"May the masters live forever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"May the words live forever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"May the lessons live forever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"May the truths live forever.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the velvet silence came down again, but the words rang through it faintly until Gornom broke the spell with speech.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The young one has come to learn. He has come to know the truths.\" He looked around at the others and then went on: \"His name is Cadnan. He wishes to have your names. Let him have your names.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The elder who had spoken first identified himself as Lonak. The others gave their names in order: Dalor, Puna, Grudoc, Burlog, Montun. Cadnan stared with fascinated eyes at Puna, who was older than anyone he had ever seen. His skin was nearly all white, and in the dim room it seemed to have a faint shine. His voice was very high and thin, like a wind sighing in tall tree-branches. Cadnan shivered, but didn\u0027t take his eye from Puna until, as if at a signal, all the elders rose. Awkwardly, then, Cadnan rose with them, again confused and still frightened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He saw Gornom raise his hands over his head and chant: \"Tall are the masters.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the others repeated the words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wise are the masters.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cadnan, this time, repeated the phrase with the elders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good are the masters.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the antiphon had been delivered Gornom waited a full second and then fell prostrate to the floor. The others followed his example, except for Cadnan, who, afraid to let himself fall on bare metal, crouched down slowly instead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Weak are the slaves,\" Gornom whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The answer was a whisper, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Small are the slaves.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The others whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They are like small ones all the days of their lives, and only the masters are elders.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The masters are elders.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As the machine obeys,\" Gornom said, \"so the slave obeys. As the tree obeys, so the slave obeys. As the metal obeys, so the slave obeys. As the ground obeys, so the slave obeys.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So the slave obeys.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then there was silence again, not as profound as before. Through it, Cadnan could hear the others whispering, but he couldn\u0027t quite catch their words. He was later told what praying was, though he never had a chance to practice it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then everyone returned to the original circle, and squatted. In what was almost a normal tone Gornom said: \"Here is our new one. He must be told.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Puna himself rose. \"I will tell him.\" And Cadnan, frightened by the very look of the elder, could do nothing but follow him as he beckoned and went to a corner near a mound of leaves. The others, scattered, were eating. Cadnan picked up a leaf, but Puna took it gently out of his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We do not eat until it is over,\" he said quietly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cadnan accepted this without words, and Puna told him the legend. During the entire tale, Cadnan, stock-still, didn\u0027t even think of interrupting. At first his attention wandered to the leaves, but as Puna\u0027s voice went on he listened more and more closely, and even his fright began to leave him under the legend\u0027s fascination.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Long ago, the masters come to the world, sent by the Great Elder. We are no more than children. We do not work, we do nothing except eat and sleep and live out our lives in the world. The Great Elder makes us the gift of talking and the gift of trees, and he makes the rules of the trees.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then he does nothing more for us. First we must become more than children, more than small ones.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"For this he sends the masters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The masters are good because they show us work and give us machines that have power. Our power is over the masters because of the machines. But we may not use such power. They are elder to us: they are wiser than we are. Only when we become so wise we use power against them, and in that day master and slave are one. In that day the Great Elder returns to his small ones.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In this time there is the work, and the work makes us always more like the masters. We live in the buildings like masters. We work with machines like masters. We do what the masters say. Soon we are all the same.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No one can tell when we are like masters in all things. We know of it when the Great Elder returns to us. All must watch and wait for that day. In this time, we only remember and tell ourselves the truths over and over. There are many truths and some I can not speak. Here are the others:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The masters are our elders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The machines are under obedience to us while we obey the masters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The Great Elder wishes our obedience to the masters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If we disobey the masters the machines and the trees will not obey us, and there will be no more work and no small ones. For this is the order of the world: some obeying and some to be obeyed. It is visible and plain. When the chain is broken all the chain breaks.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Puna paused, and then repeated the last sentence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When the chain is broken all the chain breaks.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is true,\" Cadnan said excitedly. \"It is true. Yet there is more truth—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is,\" Puna said soberly. \"We meet again in five days\u0027 time. I can count five days, and so the others will know, and you will know. At this next meeting you will be told more truths.\" His smile was thin and distant. \"Now eat.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cadnan reached numbly for a leaf and, without thinking, began to nibble. The world had been set in order: he had no more questions now. Instead, he felt empty spaces, waiting to be filled with the great knowledge of Puna and of Gornom and all the others, at the next meeting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And at other meetings, after that....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He put that thought away: it was too much and too large. The one certain thing was that in five days\u0027 time (whenever that was) he would know more. In five days they would all meet again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He hoped five days was not too long.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As matters turned out, of course, he need not have worried. The meeting he was waiting for never happened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And, after that, there were no more meetings at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PUBLIC OPINION THREE\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Being excerpts from memo directives sent between executives of Associated Metallic Products, Ltd., a corporation having its main offices within Dome Two, Luna City, Luna, and associated offices on all three inhabited planets, the memo directives being dated between May fourteenth and May twenty-first, in the Year of the Confederation two hundred and ten.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e TO: John Harrison\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e FROM: Fredk.

The original motive for this action would seem to be a rising tide of public unrest, sparked apparently by chance disclosure of our procurement procedures. That the public unrest may very soon reach the point at which Confederation notice, and hence Confederation action, may be taken is the best judgment both of our outside operatives and of our statistical department.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In order to deal with this unprecedented emergency, it would be advisable to have your thoughts on the matter.

In a risky matter like this one, support can make all the difference between....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e TO: James Oliver Gogarty\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e FROM: John Harrison\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e RE: My memo May 19\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e J. O., I mean it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now lay off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e TO: Williston Reed\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e FROM: John Harrison\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e RE: Current memo series\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As you know, I\u0027m keeping you up to date whenever I have a minute between appointments: a publicity chief ought to know everything, inside as well as public-issue material, if only so he can be conscious of what to hide. I\u0027ve tried to work with you as well as I can, and if there are delays in reporting, you\u0027ll understand that pressure of other duties....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ... The story behind all of this is simple enough. The takeover Gogarty and Ramsbotham have been trying to pull is interfering with practical business. Frankly, AMP\u0027S competitors are happy enough to jump in and stir the pot: I think they\u0027ve been buying up Senators here and there (for which there is, God knows, enough precedent; the entire Senate hasn\u0027t been bought since the Dedrick mutiny forty years back but you don\u0027t need the entire Senate if you have a few key men, and I\u0027ve always thought Dedrick\u0027s lawyers were wasteful), and beyond what the competition\u0027s been active in, there are always the fanatics. Freedom for all—you know the sort of thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now the big danger is that if R. and G. succeed in keeping things messed up the rest of the metals boys will step in, push the government into the right moves, and kill Fruyling\u0027s World deader than Dedrick himself. Which (according to the statistical breakdown) won\u0027t put us into the bankruptcy courts, but will slide us from a first-or-second spot to a ninth-or-tenth one. The big question is whether you\u0027d rather be a small frog in a big puddle or the reverse. Me, I\u0027d rather be a big frog in a big puddle than any other combination I can think of, and in spite of everything I think I\u0027m going to go on being just that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fruyling\u0027s World has been around for a long time, but the current AMP fight gives the competition the opportunity they need, and they\u0027re pushing it. If we can weather the storm....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, I\u0027m being gloomy. Of course we can weather the storm. I\u0027ll swing Gogarty back, and that will leave Ramsbotham nowhere to go....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e TO: John Harrison\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e FROM: Fredk.

Support of the suggestion put forward by Mr. Gogarty at the last Board meeting was not, believe me, given without grave consideration.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now that the matter has been decided, I hope we can all pull together like team-mates, and \"let the dead past bury its dead\".

Mr. Harrison stated that he disagreed with the particular stand taken by Mr. Ramsbotham in this matter, but sympathized with his strong feelings of duty toward the shareholders of the concern.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Confederation response was reported to be \"immediate and strong\" by sources high in the government, but as yet no final word has been received regarding what action, if any, is contemplated....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e TO: Fredk.
