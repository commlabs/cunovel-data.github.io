The entrance to the secret plane had been destroyed, and even the rank 2 Magus who had come to provide support had died in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat made this news even more shocking was that in this battle, even the dark Magi who had attacked had not garnered any benefits. Not only had the leader, Cabourn, died, even the elites of the dark Magi had been completely annihilated too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the battle, Leylin’s name was spread far and wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs someone who had killed off two rank 2 Magi and even destroying the entrance to the secret plane, Leylin was now on the wanted list of both the light and dark Magi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny rank 2 Magi held immense power in the south coast, and were highly regarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rank 2 Magi going solo and not bound by any restriction, and who also possessed the terrifying ability to control a battle! Leylin’s existence was now one feared by many highly-ranked Magi!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nickname as the “Demonic Poison King” began to spread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn a region called the Land of Eternal Light.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA castle-like building that was upside-down was somehow standing upright. The defensive runes on the surface of the building constantly flickered. This was where the Botelli Family, who were rumoured to hold divination abilities, resided. Though their power had declined in the past few hundred years, they still retained some of the power from when they were at their peak. Beside the gate to the castle were two strange stone guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of the gate were two statues with large swords plunged into the ground. These two statues were over ten metres tall and two to three metres wide. Whether it was their appearance or weapons, they gave off an intimidating aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the castle, in a basement filled with white chilly air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was filled with translucent blocks of ice. At the centre of the cold room was a transparent ice coffin. With a pair of hands placed on her lower abdomen, a girl of noble blood and an elegant temperament was quietly lying within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Jenna was still in a coma, the curse on her body was already beginning to spread. Black lumps of flesh and veins constantly spread. On Jenna’s face, black gas would not dissipate, and it looked something like little snakes constantly spiralling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith these snakes attached to her, Jenna’s eyelids kept moving and she looked to be in immense pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been almost a month since Leylin had set up the curse, and it was already on the verge of completely exploding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a cure, Jenna would likely end up like Manla, who had turned into a set of dried up bones!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Boom!* The door to the ice room was pulled open, and the old woman who had met with Leylin walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jenna, the guide of our generation! Based on the will of the mighty Mother of Peace, you shall continue to exist in this world!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman mumbled, and then placed a blood-red key on the freezer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Weng weng!* Red rays were emitted from the key and began to seep into the ice coffin. The red light covered Jenna’s body in an instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the illumination of the red light, the black gas on Jenna’s face began to vanish. The terrifying might of the curse waned at a rate that could be seen by the naked eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The talisman to undo the curse provided by Leylin is effective, as expected!” The old woman looked at the freezer that was emitting red light, and her expression brightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter having traded to Leylin the incomplete high-grade meditation technique that was inherited generation to generation in exchange for the talisman, she was able to rush back before the curse completely exploded!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leylin Farlier, you sinner! You shall be punished and judged by the Mother of Peace!” The old woman made a few hand signs and prayed in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Drip! Drip!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDroplets of blood-red liquid formed from the key and penetrated through the layer of ice, and dripped onto Jenna’s pale, snow-white neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Tss tss!* White gas rose from the area on Jenna’s neck that was covered by the blood-red liquid as it began to recover at a visible rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Weng!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna, who had been unconscious all this time, suddenly opened her eyes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Boom! Boom! Boom!* The ice coffin shattered into pieces, and strange undulations traveled throughout the ice room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman was extremely familiar with this energy fluctuation. This was a phenomenon that happened when their guide was making a prophecy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s going to start now?” A bewildered look appeared on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see countless deaths! Demon king! A demon king with toxic abilities is approaching…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna’s eyes suddenly rolled back to show whiteness, and a low and gasping voice was heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Toxic? Demon king? Could it be…” The old woman was startled and suddenly recalled the latest news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Weng Weng!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood-red key from before suddenly hovered in the air, producing glaring rays of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A tracking imprint? This is bad!” The old woman’s eyes widened!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, outside the upside-down castle, Leylin in black robes appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this the rumoured upside-down castle? It really is quite strange!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin lifted his hood and sized up the building in front of him, sighing in admiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter killing two rank 2 Magi, he knew that he would be chased by both light and dark Magi factions. Hence, he had changed his clothes and escaped out of the secret plane via another exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough there were strict testing methods at each entrance, these were all tests that picked out the aura of precious materials gathered from the Eternal River Plains’ secret plane, preventing them from being smuggled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Leylin’s abilities as a rank 2 Warlock, it was naturally effortless for him to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the sensing of any items, Leylin had placed them in the spatial leather pouch. With the isolation from spatial runes, even the most refined detection spell formations would not discover any traces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin raised his right hand, and on his wrist, a red key-shaped imprint was pulsating with light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin grinned as he looked at the tracking imprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place where Jenna’s family was located was hard to find. It could be said that even Hyder needed the old woman’s directions in order to enter. There was no real map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the trade with this old woman, Jenna’s family’s grandmother did not have good intentions and wanted Leylin to take this incomplete high-grade meditation technique and be taken over by it. Leylin, similarly, was not kind and added a tracking imprint into the talisman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the help of the imprint, he was finally able to locate the nest of Jenna’s family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Though the high-grade meditation technique, Sacred Flame, is incomplete, it is still unique! Its nature is extremely troublesome, and only one person in the world is able to train in it at a time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s lips curved as bloodlust overcame in. He did not have a good impression of this egocentric family. Since he’d found where they were, it was natural that he would want to get things over and done with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Halt!” The two statue guards at the gate came to life and their muscles rippled as they yelled in a low tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two magical beings? Together, their power is almost equivalent to a rank 1 Magus!” Leylin’s eyes flashed, already pinpointing information about these guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This level of defense for a Magus family is not half bad!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin waved his arm and two large black fireballs flew out, meeting the large statue guards that had whipped out their weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang! Boom!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fireballs smashed into the large stone swords, and like water engulfed the bodies of the guards. The two guards immediately turned into two huge, black torches that burned furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the attack of Leylin’s Latent Fireball, the two statue guards that had been around for thousands of years instantly turned into a pile of black powder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enemy attack!” “Who is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless urgent voices sounded in the castle, and then the mournful, piercing sound of a copper bell. The runes on the surface of the castle began to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the defense of such an ancient family, even a peak rank 1 Magus would not be able to penetrate through if it was completely activated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hah…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin let out a long sigh, and streaks of silver spiritual force extended from his body. His body then mysteriously hovered in mid-air, forming a huge silver face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Toxic Bile!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the lips of the large silver face, a cold incantation was exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe poison from the terrifying ancient creature, the Giant Kemoyin Serpent, soundlessly penetrated throughout the insides of the castle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe runes outside were entirely useless towards poison attacks. Every single person inside, whether it was an acolyte, servant or even official Magi collapsed to the ground, their bodies beginning to rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only the castle but in a range of half a km away, all the plants were beginning to dry up and rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence! The eerie silence of death! It shrouded the area, with the castle at the centre of it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this large area, no being was lucky enough to survive and sunk into the eternity of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!* The old grey gate that was still full of patterns had an ancient aura that silently toppled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the corrosion of the poison, not only the defensive formation, but even the building itself was affected by the destructive force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the granite that seemed to be extremely solid, there were hundreds of thousands of little holes that were the result of the corrosion. The entire building swayed and looked on the verge of falling. Leylin felt as if at a light push, the entire castle would fall with a huge rumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the corridor that was filled with a putrid smell, rotting corpses were everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin followed the tracking imprint and advanced further, finally reaching the ice room that was far into the castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe entered the ice room filled with chilly white gas and saw the two corpses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman had died extremely painfully, holding test tubes that held all types of antidotes. Of course, there did not seem to be any use in it and her flesh was still rotting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an official Magus, her resistance was obviously more powerful than a regular person. Even when dead, her body was still more difficult to destroy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-267\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-269\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-268","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
