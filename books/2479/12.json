In his lap @a continued her low growling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re \u0027bout the damnedest sight I ever laid eyes on. You mind tellin\u0027 me what you\u0027re in costume for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Officer,\" Flint said. He was terrified Pelvis was going to start blabbering about being a bounty hunter, or about the fact that Lambert was somewhere close by. \"I was the one driven\u0027, not him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Murtaugh?\" Randy leaned his head nearer, and Flint had the startling thought that he\u0027d seen the policeman\u0027s face before, when its thin-lipped mouth was twisted into a cruel girin and the garish midway lights threw shadows into the deep-set eye sockets. \"When I want you to speak, I\u0027ll ask you a question. Hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis was the face of a thousand others who had come to the it-eak show to leer and laugh, to fondle their girlfriends in front of the stage and spit tobacco on Flint\u0027s polished shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint felt a hard nut of dispst in his throat. Clint lurched under his shirt, but luckily Flint had a firm grip and the policeman didn\u0027t see. \"There\u0027s no reason to be rude,\" Flint said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandy laughed, which was probably the worst thing he could\u0027ve done. It was a humorless, harsh laugh, and it made Flint want to smash it back through the man\u0027s teeth. \"You want to see rude, you keep on pushin\u0027 me. You come flyin\u0027 up on my rear end and almost wreck my car, I\u0027m not about to kiss you for it. Now you\u0027re real, real close to a night in jail, so you\u0027d best just sit there and keep your mouth shut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint stared sullenly at him, and the policeman gjared back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a clean tag,\" Walt said, returning from the cruiser\u0027s radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I\u0027m just about to get the story from Cecil,\" Randy told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@pp \"Well, sir . . .\" Pelvis cleared his throat.

Next time you might be goin\u0027 to a cemetery instead of a convention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint summoned up his wits and took the licenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" he forced himself to say. \"It won\u0027t happen again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn straight it won\u0027t. You follow us, we\u0027ll take you to the Holiday Inn.

Don\u0027t you worry, I\u0027ll be real careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move it,\" Randy said. \"We\u0027ve got other places to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePelvis put Mama into the backseat and came around to the drivers side. With an effort that bordered on the superhuman, Flint got out and, holding Clint\u0027s arm firmly against his chest, eased into the passenger seat. In another moment they were following the police cruiser out of the maze of residential streets, and Pelvis smiled and said, \"I never drove me a Cadillac before. You know, Elvis loved Cadillacs. Gave \u0027em away every chance he got. He seen some people lookin\u0027 at a Cadillac in a showroom one time, he pulled out a big wad of cash and bought it for\u0027em right there on the spot. Yessir.\" He nodded vigorously. \"I believe I could get to like drivin\u0027 a Cadillac.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so?\" Flint had broken out in a cold sweat, and he couldn\u0027t help but stare at Eisley\u0027s fleshy hands guiding the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better enjoy it, then, because ten seconds after those hick cops drive off will be the last time you sit behind MY steerin\u0027wheel! Do you have a cement block for a brain? I told you to keep your mouth shut and leave the talkin\u0027 to me! Now we\u0027ve gotta go back to that damn Holiday Inn when we could\u0027ve been on Lambert\u0027s ass! I could\u0027ve talked our way out of trouble if you hadn\u0027t opened your big mouth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus Christ! All that crap about an Elvis convention in New Orleans! We\u0027re lucky they didn\u0027t call the men with the butterfly nets right then and there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I went to that convention last year,\" Pelvis said. \"At the Hyatt Hotel, just like I said. \u0027Bout two hundred Elvises showed up, and we had us a high old time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a nightmare.\" Flint pressed his fingers against his forehead to see if he was running a fever. Reality, it seemed, had become entangled with delirium. I\u0027llm at home in my bed, and this is the chili peppers I ate on my pizza.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePelvis wheezed out a laugh. \"Nice to know you still got your sense of humor, seem\u0027as how we lost Lambert and all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t lost him. Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But ... he\u0027s gone. How\u0027re we gonna find him again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re ridin\u0027 with a professional Eisley!\" Flint said pointedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First thing you learn in this business is to keep your eyes and ears open. I got close enough to hear Lambert and his ex-wife talkin\u0027. She was tellin\u0027him about a cabin in a fishin\u0027 camp south of Houma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVermilion, she said the camp was called. I heard her tell him where it is. She said to break a windowpane, and that there\u0027d be food in the pantry. SO that might be where he\u0027s headed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swanee!\" Pelvis gushed. \"Mr. Smoates said you was gonna be a good partner!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get that partners shit out of your head!\" Flint snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not partners! I\u0027m saddled with you for this one skin hunt, and that\u0027s all! You\u0027ve already screwed up big-time when I told you to keep that mutt quiet back in the park; That damn harkin\u0027 aim op on me, and that\u0027s how ost shot me out of my shoes! Made me so nervous I let him get the dr he got away!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was meanin\u0027to ask you about that,\" Pelvis said. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat damn woman-\" Flint paused. No, he thought; being knocked on your ass by a woman was not a thing Smoates needed to hear about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She distracted me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then Lambert charged in before I could use the Mace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s a Vietnam vet, he put me down with some kind ofjudo throw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky he didn\u0027t take your gun and shoot you,\" Pelvis said. \"Him being\u0027 such a crazy killer, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Flint nodded. \"Lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich led him to a question: why hadn\u0027t Lambert used the gun on him when he was lying helpless on the ground?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe because he hadn\u0027t wanted to commit another murder in front of his ex-wife and son, Flint decided. Whatever the reason, Flint could indeed count himself fortunate to still be alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Holiday Inn-the same motel where Flint and Pelvis had sat in the parking lot watching the door to Susan Lambert\u0027s room-the two Alexandria policemen gave them a further warning about getting the broken heat re Flint took the Cadillac\u0027s wheel and b paired, and as soon as the police cruiser had driven away, anished Pelvis and Mama to the rear seat. In another five minutes Flint was back on Interstate 49, heading south again. He, kept his speed below sixty-five. There was no point courting trouble from the highway patrol, and if Lambert was going to the fishing camp cabin, he\u0027d still be there by the time Flint found the place. If the troopers didn\u0027t stop Lambert first, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/* \u003c![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]\u003e */\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehadn\u0027t headed off in another direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was a gamble worth taking, just as Flint had gambled on following Lambert\u0027s ex-wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way ahead was dark. Houma was down in swamp and Cajun territory. Flint had never heard of Vermilion before, but he\u0027d find it when they got down there. It wasn\u0027t an area Flint would\u0027ve ventured into without a good reason, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLine of Fire and best left h Those swamp dwellers were a roug breed, an alone.

Pelvis was stretched out and snoring, with Mama\u0027s head cradled on his shoulder. The bulldog added to the noise by growling in her sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thought came to Flint unbidden: At least he\u0027s got something\u0027 that gives a\u0027 damn about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was more than he could say for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, there was always Clint. Good al\u0027blind and mute Clint, who had ruined his life as surely as if he had been born a leper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waY ahead was dark. Flint was determined to find Lambert now; this was a matter of honor. He wasn\u0027t afraid of anything on this earth, least of all a crazy killer too stupid to shoot a man who was down and defenseless. This was a gone to be played out to the last card, winner take all. He was going to drag that skin back to Smoates and show that bastard what being a professional was all about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint thought of the mansion in his dream, the white stone mansion with four chimneys and a huge stained-glass winre dow in front. His home, he believed. The place whe his mother and father lived. The rich, refined people who had seen a mass of twitching flesh growing from their baby\u0027s chest and, horrified, had given the baby up to the four winds of adoption. His home. It had to be, because he dreamed of it so often. He would find it yet, and he would find that man and woman and show them he was their son, born of refinement into a cold and dirty world. Maybe it lay to the south- maybe it lay somewhere at the end of this road, and if he\u0027d gone south long before this he would\u0027ve found it like a hidden treasure, an answer, a shining lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now the way ahead was dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraveling by Night Forty-six miles south of Alexandria, as the sultry nightwind swept in through the station wagon, Dan felt sleep pulling at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was on Highway 167, which paralleled 1-49 and twisted through cane-field country. It was all but deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan had seen no trooper cars since leaving Basile Park, and there\u0027d been no headlights behind him for the last twenty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHouma was still a good seventy miles away, and Vermilion maybe twelve or fifteen miles beyond that. He had to find another roadmap; his last one had been left in his pickup truck. But the fishing camp cabin would be worth the extra miles. He could hide there for a couple of days, get some decent rest, and decide where to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyelids were heavy, the drone of the tires hypnotic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d tried the radio, but it was lifeless. The pain in his skull was building again, and maybe this was the only thing keeping him awake. He needed a cup of coffee, but on this road the few cafes he passed looked to have been closed up since nightfall. After three more miles he came to a crossroads that had a sign pointing east to 1-49.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat there, weighing the risk of trying to find a truckstop on the interstate. It won out over the chance of nodding off at the wheel and running into a ditch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interstate was a dangerous place, because the troopers prowled there. At this time of the morning, though nearing three o\u0027clock-the truck drivers in their big, sn ing ngs were masters of the four-lane. Dan passed a sign that said Lafayette-\"the heart of Acadiana\"-was thirty miles ahead. Five miles later he saw green neon that announced CAJUN COUNTRY TRUCK STOP 24 HOURS and he took the next exit. The truck stop was a gray cinder-block building, not much to look at, but he could see a waitress at work through the restaurant\u0027s plate-glass window. A tractor-trailer truck was parked at the diesel pumps, its tank being filled by an attendant. In front of the restaurant was a red Camaro with a Texas vanity plate that proclaimed its owner to be AN Al s\u0027rud. Dan drove around back and parked next to two other cars, an old brown Bonneville and a dark blue Mazda, both with Louisiana plates, that probably belonged to the employees. He felt light-headed with weariness as he trudged into the restaurant, which had a long counter and stools and a row of red vinyl booths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How you be doin\u0027?\" the waitress asked from behind the counter in -thick Cajun dialect. \"Goon set yourself anywhere.\" She was a heavyset blond woman, maybe in her mid-forties, and she wore a red-checked apron over a white uniform. She returned to her conversation with a gray-haired gent in overalls who sat at the counter nursing a cup of coffee and a glazed doughnut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan chose a booth beside the window so he had full view of the parking lot. Sitting three booths in front of him were a young man and woman. Her back was to Dan, her wavy shoulder-length hair the color of summer wheat. The young man, who Dan figured was twenty-seven or twenty-eight, wore his dark brown hair pulled back into a ponytail, and he had a sallow, long-jawed face and deepset ebony eyes that fixed Dan with a hard stare over his companion\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan nodded toward him, and the young man blinked sullenly and looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress came with a menu. Her name tag read DONNA Lu- \"Just a cup of coffee,\" Dan told her. \"As strong as you can make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"HonI can make it jump out the cup and two-step,\" she promised, and she left him to go back through a swinging door to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan took off his baseball cap and ran a hand over his forehead to collect the sheen that had gathered there, Fans were turning at the ceiling, their cool breezes welcome on his skin. He leaned against the backrest and closed his eyes. But he couldn\u0027t keep them shut because the death of Emory Blanchard was still repeating itself in the haunted house of his mind. He rubbed his stiff shoulder and then reached back to massage his neck. He\u0027d escaped two tight squeezes since midnight, but if a state trooper car pulled up right then, he didn\u0027t know if he would have the energy to get up from his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I think? I think the whole thing\u0027s a pile of shit!\" It was the young man in the booth, talking to the woman. His voice dripped venom. \"I thought you said I was gonna make some money out of this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I\u0027d pay you.\" Her voice was smoky and careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it down, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it ain\u0027t all right! I don\u0027t know why the hell I said I\u0027d do this! It\u0027s a bunch of lies is what it is!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not lies. Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll get your money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man looked as if he were about to spit something back at her, but his piercing gaze suddenly shifted, locking onto Dan. \"Hey!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027re you starin\u0027 at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just waitin\u0027 for a cup of coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well look somewhere else while you do it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine with me.\" Dan averted his eyes, but not before he\u0027d noted that the young man wore a black T-shirt imprinted with yellow skulls and the legend @ai i . The woman got him to quiet down a little, but he was still mouthing off about money. He kept cutting his eyes at Dan. Lookin\u0027 for trouble, Dan thought. Pissed off about something and ready to pick a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress brought his coffee. Donna Lee had been right; this java had legs. \"Keep the pot warm, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan suggested as he sipped the high octane. She answered, \"Goon do it,\" and walked behind the cash register to take the gray-haired man\u0027s money. \"See you next run-through,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe told him, and Dan watched him walk out to his tractor-trailer rig at the diesel pumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Made a fool of me is what you did-I\" the young man started up again. \"Come all this way to find a fuckin\u0027 fairy tale!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joey, come on. Calm down, all right? \"You think I\u0027m supposed to be happy? Drive all this way, and then you gimme this big load of shit and ask me to calm down?\" His voice was getting louder and harsher, and suddenly he reached out across the table and seized his companion\u0027s wrist. \"You played me for a fuckin\u0027 fool, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ease up there, friend!\" Donna Lee cautioned from behind the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ain\u0027t talkin\u0027 to you!\" Joey snapped. \"So just shut up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, listen here!\" She strode toward their booth on her chunky legs, her cheeks reddening. You can get your sassy tail gone, I won\u0027t cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" the Young woman said, and Dan saw her pug-nosed profile as she glanced to the left at Donna Lee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\u0027We\u0027re just talkin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"TaM kinda rough, don\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gimme the damn check, how @ut it?\" Joey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pleased to.\" Donna Lee pulled the checkpad and a pencil from a pocket of her apron and totaled up their order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Han, you need any help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She\u0027d worked her wrist free and was rubbing where his fingers had been. \"Thanks anyhow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan happened to catch Joey\u0027s glare again for a split second, and the young man said, \"God damn!\" and stood up from the booth. His cowboy boots clacked on the linoleum, approaching Dan. \"Joey, don\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe young woman called, but then Joey was sliding into the seat across from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan drank down the rest of his coffee, paying him no attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, he was steeling himself for the encounter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I told you to quit starin\u0027 at me,\" Joey said with quiet menace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan lifted his gaze to meet Joey\u0027s. The young man\u0027s eyes were red-rimmed, his gaunt face strained by whatever inner demons were torturing him. A little tarnished silver skeleton hung from the lobe of his left ear. Dan had met his kind before: a walking hair-trigger, always a hot flash away from explosion. Dan said calmly, \"I don\u0027t want any trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I think you\u0027re askin\u0027 for a whole truckload of it, old man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan was in no shape to be fighting, but damned if he\u0027d take this kind of disrespect. If he was going down, he was going down swinging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to be left alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave you alone. After I take you out in the parkin\u0027 lot and beat the shit outta-\" Joey didn\u0027t finish his threat, because Dan\u0027s right hand shot out, grasped the silver skeleton, and tore it from his earlobe. As Joey shouted with pain, Dan caught a left handful of T-shirt and jerked the young man\u0027s chest hard against the table\u0027s edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan leaned forward, their faces almost touching. \"You need some manners knocked into you, boy. Now, I\u0027d suggest that you stand up and walk out of here, get in your car, and go wherever you\u0027re goin\u0027. If you don\u0027t want to do that, I\u0027d be glad to separate you from your teeth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA drop of blood was welling from Joey\u0027s ripped earlobe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sneered and started to fire another taunt into Dan\u0027s face, which might have cost the young punk at least a broken nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhack! Something had just slammed onto the tabletop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan turned his head and looked at a baseball bat that had eight or nine wicked nails stuck through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pay attention,\" Donna Lee said. She was speaking to Joey, who had abruptly become an excellent listener. \"You goon stand up, pay your check, leave me two dollars tip, and haul ass out, my sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMister, let him loose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan did. Joey stood up, his nervous gaze on the brainbuster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonna Lee stepped back and then followed him to the cash register.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get you \u0027mother cup in a minute\" she told Dan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. He gets like that sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the Young woman, standing next to his booth. Dan looked up at her, said, \"No harm d-\" and then he stopped because of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe left side of it, the side he\u0027d seen in profile, was very pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the bridge of her pug nose was a scatter of freckles. Her mouth had the, lush lips lonely men kissed in their dreams, and her blond hair was thick and beautiful Her eyes were soft blue, the blue of a cool mountain @.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the,right side of her face was another story, and not a kind one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was covered by a\u0027huge purplish-red birthmark that began up in her hair and continued all the way down onto her throat. The mark had ragged edges like the coast on a map Of some strange and unexplored territory. Because the left side of her f achingly perfect righ side ace was so , the t was that much harder to look at. \"Done,\" Dan finished, his gaze following the maroon inlets and coves. Then he met her eyes, and he recognized in them the same kind of deep, soul-anchored pain he\u0027d seen in his own mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant of an inner glimpse passed. She glanced at empty coffee cup. \"You\u0027d better get something, to eat, mister,\" she said in that voice Mo velvet and smoke. \"You don\u0027t look so hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been a rough day.\" Dan noted that she wore no makeup and her clothes were simple: a violet floral-patterned shortsleeve blouse and a pair of lived-in blue jeans. She carried a small chestnut-colored purse, its strap around her left shoulder. She was a slim girl, not a whole lot of meat on her bones, and she had that wiry, hardscrabble Texar, look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emaybe she stood five-two, if that.. Dan tried to envision her without the birthmark; lacking it, she might resemble the kind of fresh-faced girl-next-door in magazine ads. With it, though, she was traveling by night in the company of Joey the punt \"Arden!\" His money had been slapped down beside the cash register. \"You comin\u0027 or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\" She started to walk away, but Dan said, \"Hey, you think he wants this?\" and he offered her the silver skeleton. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gone-south/page-12.html","bookId":2479,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:53:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:53:27 PM"}
