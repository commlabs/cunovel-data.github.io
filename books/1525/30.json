The monk interrupted, “A gold knife and a hidden tunnel into the mountain?” The man’s voice had grown strangely dark and deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Philip said tentatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe friar was silent a moment, then returned to his normal even demeanor. “Thank the Lord for their salvation. At least your friends found a safe shelter. The Lord always opens a way for those of good heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope to have the rescue shaft completed in two days or so. But if the Indians I sent can fetch more help—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Otera suddenly stood. “Fear not. The Lord will watch over all those here. In his eyes, we are all his beloved sheep. No harm will come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip quickly pushed from his own chair, meaning to accompany the friar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man waved him back down. “Rest, Philip, you’ve earned it. You’ve done the Lord’s work here protecting your friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinking back into his chair, Philip sighed as Friar Otera bowed his way from the tent. “Thank you,” he called as the monk departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone in his tent, Philip closed his eyes for a moment. He believed he could sleep. The burden was no longer his own, and the onus for his questionable actions had been absolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip stared at the closed flap of his tent. He remembered the smoldering power he had sensed in the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Otera must be a truly religious man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell away from the tents, at the edge of the forest, Friar Otera met with one of his fellow monks. Otera forced his fingers to stop trembling. Could it be true? After so long?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monk fished through his shoulder pack and passed Otera the radio. Stepping a few paces away under the forest’s eaves, Otera dialed the proper channel and called to his superior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reverted to Spanish. “Contact has been made. Over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short burst of static, then a quick response. “And your assessment?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Favorable. The site appears golden. I repeat golden.” Friar Otera gave a terse summary of what he had learned from the pasty-faced student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven across the airwaves, Friar Otera heard the mutter of shock and the whispered words in Spanish, “El Sangre del Diablo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Otera shuddered with the mere mention of that name. “And your orders?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Befriend the student. Earn his trust. Then light a flame under these workers. Dig a way to that tunnel.” A long pause, then his final order. “Once contact is made, clean the site… thoroughly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time that day, Friar Otera smiled. He fingered the dagger in its wrist sheath. The haughty student here reminded him of those youths who had once spat upon Otera’s poor upbringing, his mixed blood. It would be a pleasure to see this americano beg for his life. But more important, if what he suspected was true, there were even larger victories at stake. He had waited for so long, borne too many indignities from these Spanish missionaries who thought themselves his superior. No, if he was right, he would show them their mistake, their blindness. He would no longer be shunned and glanced over. Otera raised the radio to his hard lips, playing the good soldier. “Confirm contact and clean the site. I understand. Over and out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtera stepped back from the forest and returned the radio to the monk who stood guard. “And?” the fellow asked, packing away the radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Otera straightened his pectoral crucifix. “We have a green light.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other monk’s eyes grew aghast. “Then it’s true!” The man made the sign of the cross. “May the Lord protect us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Otera trudged back toward the camp. The words from the radio still echoed in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEl Sangre del Diablo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatan’s Blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie fumbled with the second flashlight, her fingers trembling. She thumbed the switch, and light flared out into the black caverns, blinding her for a second. The pale faces of her fellow students and the young Indian boy stared back along the trail. In that minute of darkness, more of the tarantula scouts had scurried onto the gold trail. To the side, more spiders approached, their albino limbs like pale-legged starfish against the black rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam glanced back toward the toxic bat cavern. “I… I don’t know. The place will be swarming with tarantulas in a few minutes, but we can’t trudge through waist-deep guano in the next cavern without dying from the fumes. There’s got to be another way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie strode off the Incan footpath toward the nearby underground stream. It gurgled in its narrow channel, casting up a fine cool mist. “We swim,” she said matter-of-factly, pointing her light at the rapidly flowing water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swim?” Norman asked, his voice cracking. “Are you mad? That water’s from snowmelt. We’ll die of hypothermia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie swung around. “The current is swift but relatively smooth through this section of the caverns. We jump in and let the water shoot us through the bat cave and away from the spiders.” She waved a hand across the river’s fine mist. “This may even insulate us a bit from the worst of the toxic fumes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam approached her side and glanced at her with appreciative eyes. “Maggie’s right. It might work. But we need to stick together for this one. Once past the bats, we’ll need to haul our asses out of this stream ASAP. If the current doesn’t kill us, the cold may.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenal sidled to the edge of the river’s carved stone bank. The waters flowed about a meter below the lip. “I go first,” he said, looking back. “Make sure it be safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Denal,” Maggie said and reached for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped beyond her reach. “I be strong swimmer. If I make it to the far side, I yell.” He glanced at the other faces. “Then you all come. If no call, then no come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam moved toward the boy. “I’ll do it, Denal,” Sam said, patting the side pocket of his vest. “I have my Wood’s lamp to light the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenal pulled the lamp from his own pocket and flicked on the purplish light. “I no ask. I go.” The boy then turned and jumped over the lip’s edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Denal!” Sam yelled, rushing to the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie stopped Sam from leaping in after him. She followed the boy’s path in the current. He bobbed in the water as it thrust him back and forth in the narrow channel, but he managed to keep the lamp thrust above the water, its purplish glow a beacon in the dark cave. Then the river carried him past a curve in the wall and down a tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn kid picked my pocket,” Sam muttered, a mixture of respect and worry in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll make it,” Maggie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiting quickly grew intolerable. None dared speak lest they miss Denal’s call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Ralph hung back at the foot path, keeping an eye on the spiders. “Here comes the main army,” he warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie swung around. It was as if a foaming white surf crested just at the edge of their light’s reach. “C’mon, Denal, don’t let us down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if the boy had heard her, a sharp distant cry echoed from farther in the caves. Denal had made it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank God,” Sam sighed. “Let’s get out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman quickly finished packing his gear into a waterproof case while Ralph climbed over to join them, eyes still on the tarantulas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam unslung the Winchester and nodded for Ralph to do the same with his rifle. “Try to keep your gun above water. The rifles could probably survive a short dip, but I’d rather keep them dry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph finally turned and eyed the water with a sick expression. “To hell with the rifle, I just hope I can keep my own head above water.” He raised his face to the other three. “I can’t swim.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Sam exclaimed. “Why didn’t you tell us that before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph shrugged. “Because Maggie was right. The river’s the only way out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman shoved up next to them. “I’ll stick with Ralph. I did a stint in water rescue in the army.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph frowned at him, disbelieving. “You were in the army?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three years at FortOrd, until I was discharged during a witch-hunt at my base.” Norman’s face took on a bitter cast. “So much for don’t ask, don’t tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph shook his head. “I’ll take my chances on my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photographer’s face grew fierce. He snapped at Ralph, “Like hell you will, you brain-addled jock. Quit this macho posturing and accept some help. It’s not like I’m gonna try to cop a feel. You’re not even my type!” Norman shoved his camera case at Ralph, his voice serious. “It’s insulated with foam. It’s meant to float after a raft capsizes. Keep the damn thing clutched to your chest, and I’ll do the rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph took the case reluctantly. “What about this?” He held up Gil’s rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam reached for it. “I’ll manage both.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for the gun, but Maggie snatched it first. “Two guns will weigh you down, Sam. The flashlight is waterproof and doesn’t weigh nary a bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam hesitated, then nodded. “At the first sign of trouble, toss the rifle away. We need the light more than we need a second gun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded at his advice. “Let’s go. The spiders aren’t gonna like their meal escaping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam waved for Norman and Ralph to go first, just in case of trouble. Sam and Maggie would follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman slid down to a small spit of rock just above the waterline, arms cartwheeling for balance. “Now,” he called up to Ralph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large football player bit his lower lip, clutched the camera case to his chest, and jumped in before his fear of the water drove him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie kept her light focused on them. Norman dived in smoothly, his lithe form coming up beside the floundering black man. “Lie on your back!” Norman yelled as the current dragged the two away. “Hug the case tight to your chest!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph fumbled around a bit more, coughing water and kicking frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t fight it!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/excavation/page-30.html","bookId":1525,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM"}
