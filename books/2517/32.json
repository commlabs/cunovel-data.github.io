I’d bet my whole real self on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour whole real self, he says with disdain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m done with misdirection, Moses. I swear it. I got nothing. Nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou just want taken out of here. You would say anything. You would thieve my aid with your deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Moses, no. It ain’t that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen what? Then give me to understand why you would of purchased his life, his freedom. The life of a transgressor. A reprobate who for two decades has been only my obligation to keep and defend – and that only cause I’m his blooden kin. A transgressor. The world seeks to correct him and it’s only my duty to exempt him from his rightly course – succeed or fail as I might. And succeed I have, over and over. Except I will fail. One day. A man, he can’t hold on for ever – his fingers loosen. And who are you to intervene on this transgressor’s behalf?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn’t for him, Mose. Don’t you see how it wasn’t for him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen what? For the cheapness of the price? The ease of credit granted you by your sorry lot in life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, not that either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he says nothing, because he can tell what she will say next. There is a look in the eyes that precedes some words – as though the foundation for language is laid with look. You roll it out with the eye and then you utter it with the tongue. He is already recoiling from it. The calamity of a lie so big it devastates decency itself. For in lies such as these there is the unbearable possibility of truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gazes up at him. So small. Her pale skin. Her chopped red hair. Her eyes gone wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was for you, Moses, she says. For you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpossible, says Moses Todd. You got to know what it is – to hear such a thing and crave for it so to be true but also know at the same time that it ain’t. The more wished for some words are, the more unlikely they are to carry truth when finally uttered. Language is criminal that way. As though your wishin for something is the very thing that makes it impossible. We should none of us ever wish on anything – shootin stars or dandelions or eyelashes or pennies in wells. I say no more wishing. That’s my covenant and my directive. Life comes. It comes willy-nilly. It’s best to open your eyes to it and cease the buildin of lofty castles in your head – or you could blind yourself with earnest prayers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEleven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Christening \" Fletcher’s End \" The Destruction of the Gasworks \" An Identification by Boots \" A Death \" The Compass of the Self \" Nature \" A Dream of Dolphins \" A Search \" A Vision\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt ain’t true, he says and shakes his head in absolute refusal. My brother’s still here. I can feel it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the Vestal spins on her heels and unleashes her full fury, like a poison capsule broke into a cup of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddamn you, Moses, she says. Why don’t you just for once in your life shut up about your piss-ant brother. You want to die here, then die here. What’s happening out in the world ain’t nothing compared to the civil war you got in you, Mose. Jesus, you’d follow those little codes of yours straight into your grave. You don’t always have to take the bait, you know. Sometimes you can just let it go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks to the door, still talking as her back is to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ain’t dying here, Moses. I’m dying all right – but it ain’t gonna be here. And if it is, I want it to come from the back as I’m boltin to get the hell out. See you in heaven, Mose – I hope it’s designed to your specifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is nearly out the door before Moses Todd calls to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHold up, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops, but she does not turn to face him. Her back is to him, and she grips the handle of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour name, he says. What is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it ain’t Amata. And I know it ain’t that other name Fletcher calls you. So what is it? Your true name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to know my name?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says the words to the door in a voice so small he can barely hear. He wonders how long it has been since she has last said her own name – how long since she has been simply herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, he says. Your name. I’d like to – I’d feel privileged to know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is quiet for a moment – a brief interim in which even the sounds of the battle outside seem suspended – as though the whole world takes a breath and waits on the exhale. Everyone is heartbeats in their ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she says something, but it is so low and mumbled into the door that he can’t hear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? he says. I couldn’t—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMattie, she says, turning towards him and showing him her painted, sparkled face one last time. Her eyes are wet and shot through with pinpoints of brightness – as if all her fears, so many of them, bleed out like trapped light. My name’s Mattie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens his mouth to speak, but there are no words. He would like to take the name and affix it to his cudgel as another blade to rip and tear at the world – and then he could feel the whole true talon sharpness of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing he can say is her name, a repetition that is just as questioning as it is confirming:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMattie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you believe me? she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it true? he replies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoodbye, Moses, she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe goes through the door, leaving it open wide. The light reflected from the snow outside makes a portal through which it looks as though angels might spill. She said she would see him in heaven, and it was a joke. But this is something he knows deeper than all things: there are doors to heaven everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside there is no sign of the Vestal. He scans, momentarily, the tree line at the hill, but there is no trace of her. It is as if she has stepped out into the light and been spirited up – a recalled angel in gaudy ribbons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something is happening on the grounds of the gasworks. The uniformed men, the soldiers, seem to be retreating. They take stances behind dense stands of machinery, fire off a few shots and then fall back to other locations. They are receding from the valley with slow deliberation. It is not that they are overwhelmed – their movements are strategic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplosives, the Vestal said. They would bring hell down, she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses looks at the line of low buildings. There is no time. He will not be able to search them all for his brother. Something grips him, and he wonders, stilled as a philosopher in contemplation of a lakeside, if he is willing to die here for the sake of Abraham. It is a quiet, unpanicked thought, and he wishes he had more time to discover the answer, because the answer is of some vague but definite interest to him. The answer, he feels, might tell him a great deal about himself and his place in the world. His little codes, as the Vestal called them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there is no time for such thoughts and speculations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rushes forward, unsure how he will proceed. And that’s when he sees Fletcher. The man in the sombrero emerges from one of the wide buildings, poking his head around the corner as if looking for an opportune moment to run. A rodent, twitchy and slick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses grips the bladed cudgel tight in his hand and walks slowly to the place where Fletcher peeks around the corner. The man in the sombrero isn’t aware of Moses’ presence until the very last moment. Then he leaps back against the corrugated wall of the building and knocks his sombrero askew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou, he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere’s my brother, says Moses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour brother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher looks confused for a moment. Then he narrows his eyes at Moses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it now – some kinda negotiation? You gonna spare my life if I fess up and tell you where he’s hid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I ain’t. You brought too much abomination into the world. More than your share. You threw things off balance. I’m gonna kill you no matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why should I tell you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCause it’d be one good thing you done just prior to the final reckoning of your account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher’s hand reaches up to his scabrous face and begins to pick instinctively at the little nodules of hardened skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re a fuckin relic, he says in his snivelling way to Moses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher is not looking at him when he says this. Instead, he looks down at the icy mud on the ground – as though he would like to dig himself into the very earth with his little rat nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she purchase him? Moses asks now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher looks at him, his eyes narrowing again in the scabbed flesh of his face\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she? Moses says again. The Vestal, did she purchase his release on her body?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that what she said? She told you that, eh? And now you don’t know whether to believe her or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she or did she not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher doesn’t answer. Instead a smile creeps across his greasy face like slow poison. Then the smile turns into a chuckle, and the chuckle into a full-blown laugh. He laughs and laughs, Fletcher does, doubling over and slapping his thighs – as though it weren’t the end of the world at this very moment. Or as though it were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a goddamn shame, Fletcher says, coughing between fits of laughter, when the business of men and God is brought low by womanly wiles. Ain’t it? Ain’t it a goddamn shame?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher laughs and laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar as I been able to tell, he goes on, a cunt is a cunt is a cunt. But you’re a romantic, ain’t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little man begins to do a short, hopping dance, laughing and clapping his hands, teetering as if he is on all the terrible dizzying precipices of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomantic, romantic, romantic! he cries, laughing and dancing. Romantic, romantic, ro—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses raises the pistol and, in the very same gesture, as though a liquid movement with no real beginning and no end, fires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bullet goes wide, whistles by Fletcher’s ear. Fletcher, frozen in expectation, waits to see if he’s dead yet. Then, a moment later, he reaches up and feels the wholeness of his intact face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou missed, he says simply to Moses. Looks like you ain’t such a good—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoses fires again, and this time the bullet flies true and hits Fletcher in the forehead with a tiny wet crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFletcher collapses in a heap on the ground, the sombrero falling and rolling a few feet before it drops like a tired top into the muck. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/exit-kingdom-reapers-2/page-32.html","bookId":2517,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:22:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:22:34 PM"}
