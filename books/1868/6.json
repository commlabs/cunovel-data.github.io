{"id":82464,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eAfter my brief re-employment at Armstrong Travel, I arrived home, and geared up for my continuing mission. Wearing my Olivia Outcast backpack, I hopped on my mountain bike and headed for Loveland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the good side of the tracks sat Loveland, a quiet, middle- class community filled with vintage and modern homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped at the corner of Shenandoah Avenue. I put on my sunglasses and Emily the Strange hoodie, so I wouldn\u0027t be recognized, though no one else in town dressed like I did. I pulled out my list of three Dullsvillian vacationers. For seven days and six nights, three Matten families--all related--were traveling to Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like a gothic Goldilocks as I crept up the first driveway. The senior Matten Victorian-style house was gigantic. Their three-car garage could easily fit a few cars and a few sleeping vampires. I pressed the silver button and waited for the white door to open. It remained still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few houses down, the Mattens\u0027 eldest son\u0027s home appeared to be way too small. The one-car detached garage could barely fit a car, much less a coffin. I pressed the door opener anyway, but the door didn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetermined to find my nocturnal bounty, I made my way across the street, to the third Matten house. The Tudor-style home had a backyard garage hidden by a few trees. Their two-car garage seemed just right. Only it wasn\u0027t. The door didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustrated, I checked my list again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I headed for Oakley Village, I felt like I needed a few blood-filled amulets to recharge my pounding heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakley Village was a prosperous community of ultra-upscale homes. A who\u0027s who of successful Dullsvillians. I discovered on Ruby\u0027s computer that the Witherspoons, a retired couple who had just sold Witherspoon Lumber, were booked on a trip to Europe. They had departed three days ago and were scheduled to return in thirty days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rode up Tyler Street and turned into number 1455. The Witherspoons lived in a beautiful yellow-shuttered Victorian-style home with an attached three-car garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly snuck up their driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked out my surroundings to make sure there weren\u0027t any nosy neighbors eyeballing me. When I saw I was in the clear, I aimed the opener at the door. I took a deep breath and pressed the silver button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door didn\u0027t move. I pressed it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened. This couldn\u0027t be! I tapped it over and over. Still, the door remained fixed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran to the front of the house and pressed my face against the carport\u0027s yellow-shuttered window. The garage was empty of cars and coffins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stormed down the driveway to retrieve my bike and checked my Hello Batty watch. I had only a few more hours left of sunlight until this hunter would become the hunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held the door opener in my hand. Which garage did it belong to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustrated, I decided to return home, wait until sunset for Alexander to awake, then confess I hadn\u0027t made any Underworldly discoveries. I coasted down the winding road, heading for a shortcut through the Oakley Woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began riding over the bumpy terrain, but then I saw something odd. Sticking out from behind a large pile of wood chips was a vintage hearse!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my bike up alongside the ghastly car. The circa 1970s Cadillac midnight mobile was beautiful; it had a sleek, long black hood with a silver bat ornament, white-walled tires, a black carriage adorned with a chrome S-shaped insignia, and black curtains. On the left rear quarter panel was a decal of a white skull and crossbones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hopped off my bike and peered into the driver\u0027s seat, where I could see restored shiny black vinyl upholstered seats and a tiny white skeleton hanging from the rearview mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to peer in the back window, but the curtains were drawn. The license plate\u0027s county sticker was from Hipsterville--the town a few hundred miles away from Dullsville where the Coffin Club was and where I first encountered the nefarious Jagger. The license plate read: I BITE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" a familiar voice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly jumped out of my boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around to find Billy Boy and Henry standing right in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you it was for real,\" Henry proudly proclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. It is freaky,\" Billy Boy remarked. \"But why is it parked in the woods?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I discovered it yesterday on my way home from math club,\" Henry replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a body inside?\" Billy Boy asked, nervously trying to peer into the back window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I think we could arrange that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy backed away from the macabre mobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen anyone driving it?\" I inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still haven\u0027t told me why you are out here,\" Billy Boy charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fingered the garage door opener in my hand. And then it hit me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one person I knew in Dullsville who could help me whittle down my search--one person who could figure out how to use a garage door opener to unlock his locker or even unbolt his bedroom door. And his five-foot-two-inch nerd body was standing right in front of me. \"I found this,\" I said, showing Henry. \"I\u0027m sure the person who lost it would like to get their car out--or back in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to know which door it is so you can break in,\" Billy Boy alleged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be breaking in if I had the opener, now would I?\" I snarled. \"Besides, I\u0027m not a thief. It\u0027s my civic duty to return it to its rightful owner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see it,\" Henry said like a jeweler inspecting a precious stone. \"This is an Aladdin. I\u0027d say one out of ten homes use this manufacturer. It\u0027s the same kind we use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" I asked curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And this one looks familiar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve seen it? Can you tell me which homes might use them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was missing one the other day,\" he said, wrinkling his face in thought. \"Hey--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry lived in a five-bedroom Colonial-style house just up the road. I\u0027d visited his house once before, when Becky and I were in need of accessories for our Kissing Coffins outfits. Henry supplied us with fangs, blood pellets, and scars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined bloodthirsty vampire twins anxiously waiting in coffins in his family\u0027s garage as he innocently played with fake blood and fangs above them in his bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This couldn\u0027t be it,\" I said protectively, and immediately grabbed back the opener.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I swore--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are your parents home?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they went to San Diego for a medical convention.\" My heart stopped pulsing. \"Did they plan their trips through Armstrong Travel?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They booked their tickets online,\" he answered, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then who is home with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our housekeeper, Nina,\" he continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want Raven to be your babysitter?\" Billy Boy teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen my thoughts turned serious. Behind that mechanical shield of wood might lie two sleeping teen vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll walk you to your house,\" I said. \"You can never be too careful these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed the two nerds up the steep road to Henry\u0027s house. When we reached his driveway I saw the three-car garage attached to his home. And then, a few yards back, sat another two-car detached garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne garage wasn\u0027t good enough? I thought as we approached Henry\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell Mom you are doing your homework inside Henry\u0027s,\" I said. \"You should stay indoors today trading your Pokemon cards or whatever it is you do. It\u0027s supposed to rain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you she\u0027s weird,\" Billy Boy whispered as the two went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for a moment, walked my bike halfway down the driveway, then quietly doubled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested my bike against the side of his brick house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Henry was staying with Nina, I assumed the attached garage, with the comings and goings of a preteen and a hardworking housekeeper, was too exposed for a hiding vampire. But I peered into it anyway. I saw a vintage Rolls and shelves of tools. Now that Henry and Billy Boy were safely inside the house finding square roots, I ran to the detached garage. I took a deep breath and aimed the door opener.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed the silver button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened. The door didn\u0027t budge. The opener didn\u0027t click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door remained still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not for that,\" Henry said as he and Billy Boy came out of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I open it this way,\" Henry said, and stepped on a WELCOME HOME mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garage door began to open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Cover your eyes!\" I cried, and put my hand out in front of them as if my lanky arm could block them from seeing two coffins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garage door slowly opened like a creaky coffin lid. My heart stopped beating. I could barely open my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I saw them. Not one but two silver BMWs, both emblazoned with red Dullsville Middle School \"I\u0027m the proud parent of an honor student\" bumper stickers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went inside the garage and looked around, underneath, and inside the back of the luxury vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is wrong with you?\" Billy asked. \"You\u0027re not used to cars without skulls and crossbones?\" \"Well, if this doesn\u0027t open the garage,\" I argued, now fatigued and angry, \"what does it do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe followed Henry into his gigantic backyard, which was the size of a football field, complete with a mosaic-tiled patio, an Olympic-size pool, and a million-dollar flower garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe aimed the opener toward the house and pressed the button. Suddenly floodlights, scattered around his property, illuminated the already sunlit backyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nina gets freaked out when she house-sits,\" Henry stated. \"She claims she sees shadows and things moving in the backyard. I keep the lights on when my parents are out of town. But since I lost it, it\u0027s been pitch-black back here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t understand. What did this have to do with Jagger? Why was he returning for it? Or was he making sure it was still there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked past Henry\u0027s pool and garden and into his backyard to see what he needed to illuminate. The huge field was wasted on a boy who was more interested in throwing around scientific theories than footballs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I saw it. In the far corner of the yard-- at least sixty yards from where we stood--was an A-framed treehouse. \"That is perfect!\" I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to spend a lot of time out here until my dad built me a lab in the basement--now I\u0027m down there more,\" Henry said. \"He just bought me a telescope to entice me outdoors and into the treehouse again, but it\u0027s still in the box in my room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s been forever since we\u0027ve been up here,\" Billy Boy added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" I asked, pointing to a rope with a rusty pulley dangling from one of the massive branches. \"It\u0027s a principle similar to one used in canal houses in Europe,\" Henry said behind me. \"I had it installed to lift up furniture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr coffins? I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to take a look?\" he asked proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still had the protection of the sun\u0027s rays and the unyielding curiosity of a cat, but if I rode to the Mansion and waited for Alexander to wake up, then Jagger and Luna would be rising, too. The moon was ticking. My heart was pounding. First I had to make sure Henry and Billy Boy were far away from the treehouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about putting together that telescope your dad bought you?\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry\u0027s face lit up as if I\u0027d just invited him to see a private screening of Lord of the Rings. \"I didn\u0027t know you were into astronomy,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy looked at me skeptically. \"She probably just wants to look in your neighbor\u0027s windows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we\u0027ll need maps of the constellations,\" I added. \"And don\u0027t forget charts and any diagrams you might have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are quite a few constellations you can see in the daylight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be able to see more clearly when the sun sets. So take your time. Don\u0027t come out here until you have everything ready. I\u0027ll wait here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the two nerd-mates reached the back patio, I started to climb the thick wooden ladder that led up the tree, the boards creaking underneath my combat boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped onto the uneven treehouse deck. The wooden door slowly creaked open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Jagger and Luna were hiding here, then I realized why Jagger left the door opener at the factory. If Henry continued to use it to illuminate the treehouse, Jagger and Luna risked being discovered and scorched by the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I opened the wooden door, I expected to find the coffins I had been searching for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I saw a run-down 3-D version of Dexter\u0027s Laboratory. On a folding lab table sat dusty beakers, petri dishes, and a microscope. The periodic table and a photosynthesis chart were taped to the slanting walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe treehouse interior was divided by a black curtain. I slowly pulled it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I found took my breath away. Hidden in the shadows of the sloping wooden wall was a black coffin adorned with gothic band stickers, encircled in dirt. And resting next to it was a pale pink coffin!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d dreamed about a moment like this all my vampire-obsessed life, never to believe it would actually come to fruition. This was my chance to witness up close and personal a modern-day Nosferatu in his natural habitat. And with Luna, the moment was even more meaningful, because she, once human, was now a vampiress. I was looking firsthand into a world that I\u0027d always envisioned being part of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crept toward the pink casket, hoping for a peek at what it was like inside. It was as fashionable as it was spooky. The once mortal Luna was now living in the Underworld next to her twin brother. I wondered if she regretted her decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tiptoed over to Jagger\u0027s coffin. I gently touched the wooden top with the tip of my fingers. I held my breath and pressed my ear to the lid. I could hear the faint breathing of someone who was in a heavy stage of sleep. And then I heard him stir. \"Raven!\" yelled Billy Boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raced out of the room and promptly closed the curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly Boy, with rolled-up maps under one arm, was fiddling with the microscope. \"If you think this place is cool, you should see his basement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen enough petri dishes to last me a lifetime. Let\u0027s go.\" I pulled my brother by the sleeve of his striped Izod T-shirt and led him to the treehouse door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though I had daylight protecting me, I glanced back, expecting Luna and Jagger to somehow be following me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the bottom of the creaky ladder to find Henry carrying the telescope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s take this over to our place,\" I said, grabbing the telescope. \"This treehouse isn\u0027t up to code.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But my dad just--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of your dad, I think you should stay at our house for the week,\" I said to Henry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother and his nerd-mate\u0027s eyes perked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously. You shouldn\u0027t be in this huge house without your parents. And I\u0027m sure Nina could use a vacation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll be awesome. Your parents won\u0027t mind?\" Henry asked politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pack your briefcase, and not another word,\" I ordered as we headed for his house. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampireville-vampire-kisses-3/page-6.html","bookId":1868,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:07 PM"}
