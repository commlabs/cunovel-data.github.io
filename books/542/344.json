That stone is no more exempt than others from the leprosy of time, of dampness, of the lichens and from the defilement of the birds. The water turns it green, the air blackens it. It is not near any path, and people are not fond of walking in that direction, because the grass is high and their feet are immediately wet. When there is a little sunshine, the lizards come thither. All around there is a quivering of weeds. In the spring, linnets warble in the trees.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis stone is perfectly plain. In cutting it the only thought was the requirements of the tomb, and no other care was taken than to make the stone long enough and narrow enough to cover a man.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo name is to be read there.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnly, many years ago, a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines, which have become gradually illegible beneath the rain and the dust, and which are, to-day, probably effaced: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIl dort. Quoique le sort fut pour lui bien etrange, Il vivait. Il mourut quand il n\u0027eut plus son ange. La chose simplement d\u0027elle-meme arriva, Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s\u0027en va.[70]\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e[70] He sleeps. Although his fate was very strange, he lived. He died when he had no longer his angel. The thing came to pass simply, of itself, as the night comes when day is gone. \u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e这块石板是光秃秃的，凿石的人只想到这是筑墓石所需，除了使它够长够宽能盖住一个人之外，就没有考虑过其他方面。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e上面没有名字。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e但是多年前，有只手用铅笔在上面写了四句诗，在雨露和尘土的洗刷下已慢慢地看不清楚了，而今天大概已经消失了：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e他安息了。尽管命运多舛，\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e他仍偷生。失去了他的天使他就丧生；\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e事情是自然而然地发生，\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4481.html","bookId":542,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 6:46:58 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 6:46:58 AM"}
