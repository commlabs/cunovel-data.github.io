Chauvet, when he had heard Burnley’s and Lefarge’s reports. ‘I sent a man up to that pump manufactory and he found out enough to substantiate entirely Boirac’s statement of the hours at which he arrived there and left on the night of the accident. There is also a despatch from Scotland Yard. On receipt of Mr. Burnley’s wire immediate inquiries were made about the cask sent by Havre and Southampton. It appears it arrived all right at Waterloo on the morning after it was despatched from here. It was booked through, as you know, to an address near Tottenham Court Road, and the railway people would in the ordinary course have delivered it by one of their lorries. But just as it was being removed from the van of the train, a man stepped forward and claimed it, saying he was the consignee, that he wished to take it to another address, and that he had a cart and man there for the purpose. He was a man of about medium height, with dark hair and beard, and the clerk thought he was a foreigner, probably French. He gave his name as Léon Felix and produced several envelopes addressed to himself at the Tottenham Court Road address as identification. He signed for, and was handed over the cask, and took it away. His movements after that were completely lost sight of, and no further traces of him have been discovered. A photo of Felix was shown to the Waterloo people, but while the clerk said it was like the man, neither he nor any of the others would swear to it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Inquiries have also been made about Felix. It turns out he is an artist or designer in Messrs. Greer and Hood’s, the advertisement and poster people of Fleet Street. He is not married, but keeps an elderly servant-housekeeper. This woman was on a fortnight’s holiday from the 25th of March to the 8th of this month.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘So much for London,’ continued M. Chauvet. ‘Now, let us see what we have still to do. First, that lady’s maid at Dijon must be interviewed. I think, Lefarge, you might do that. To-morrow is Sunday. Suppose you go to-morrow. You can sleep at Dijon, and get back as early as possible on Monday. Then, Mr. Burnley, that matter of the statue sent to M. Boirac must be gone into. Perhaps you would be good enough to make inquiries at Dupierre’s on Monday morning, and please keep in touch with me by phone. I will look into some other points, and we shall meet here at the same time that evening.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The detective took the Metro at Chatelet, Burnley going west to his hotel in the rue Castiglione, and Lefarge east to the Gare de Lyons.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On Monday morning Burnley called to see M. Thomas at the showroom in the Boulevard des Capucines.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I’m back again, M. Thomas,’ he said, as they greeted one another. He explained what had been learned about the casks at the Gare St. Lazare, continuing, ‘So you see, two must have been sent out. Now, can you give me any information about the sending out of the second cask?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Absolutely none, monsieur,’ returned Thomas, who was evidently amazed at this new development, ‘I am quite positive we only sent one.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I suppose it’s impossible that Felix’s order could have been dealt with twice in error, once by you here, and once by the head office in the rue Provence?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I should say quite, because they do not stock the good work there, it is all stored and dealt with here. But if you like I’ll phone the head office now, and make quite sure.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In a few minutes there was a reply from M. Thévenet. No cask of any kind had been sent out from the rue Provence establishment on or about the date mentioned, and none at any time to Felix.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Well, M. Thomas, it’s certain, is it not? that one of your casks was sent by Rouen and long sea about the 1st instant. Do you think you could let me have a list of all the casks of that size that were out of your yard on that date? It must have been one of them.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Yes, I suppose it must. I think I can give you that information, but it will take some time to get out.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I’m sorry for giving you the trouble, but I see no other way. We shall have to follow up each of these casks until we find the right one.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n M. Thomas promised to put the work in hands without delay, and Burnley continued:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘There is another point. Could you tell me something about your dealings with M. Raoul Boirac, of the Avenue de l’Alma, and particularly of any recent sales you made him?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘M. Boirac? Certainly. He is a very good customer of ours and a really well-informed amateur. For the last six years, since I was appointed manager here, we must have sold him thirty or forty thousand francs worth of stuff. Every month or two he would drop in, take a look round, and select some really good piece. We always advised him of anything new we came across and as often as not he became a purchaser. Of recent sales,’ M. Thomas consulted some papers, ‘the last thing we sold him was, curiously enough, the companion piece of that ordered by Felix. It was a marble group of three female figures, two standing and one seated. It was ordered on the 25th of March, and sent out on the 27th.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Was it sent in a cask?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘It was. We always use the same packing.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘And has the cask been returned?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n M. Thomas rang for a clerk and asked for some other papers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Yes,’ he said, when he had looked over them, ‘the cask sent to M. Boirac on the 27th of last month was returned here on the 1st instant.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘One other point, M. Thomas. How can one distinguish between the two groups, that sent to M. Felix, and that to M. Boirac?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Very easily. Both consist of three female figures, but in M. Felix’s two were seated and one standing, while in M. Boirac’s two were standing and one seated.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Thank you very much. That’s all I want.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Not at all. Where shall I send that list of casks?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘To the S?reté, if you please,’ and with a further exchange of compliments the two men parted.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Burnley was both mystified and somewhat disappointed by the information M. Thomas had given him. He had been really impressed by Lefarge’s discovery that a cask containing sawdust had recently been opened in M. Boirac’s study, though he had not admitted it at the time. His friend’s strongly expressed opinion that either Felix or Boirac, or both, had at that time packed the body in the cask had seemed more and more likely, the longer he had thought it over. There were, however, difficulties in the theory. First, as he had pointed out to Lefarge, there was the personality of Fran?ois. He felt he would stake his reputation on Fran?ois’ innocence, and without the butler’s co-operation he did not see how the murder could have been carried through. Then, what possible motive could either of the men named have had for desiring the death of the lady? These and other difficulties he had foreseen, but he had not considered them insuperable. Possibly, in spite of them, they were on the right track. But now all hopes of that were dashed. The explanation of M. Boirac of the presence of the cask was complete, and it had been confirmed by Fran?ois. This perhaps was not conclusive, but M. Thomas had confirmed it also, and Burnley felt the evidence of its truth was overwhelming. The body could not therefore have been packed in the cask, because it had been returned direct from M. Boirac’s to the showrooms. Reluctantly he felt Lefarge’s theory must be abandoned, and, what was much worse, he had no other to substitute.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Another point struck him. If he could find out the hour at which Felix had reached his hotel on the fatal evening, and his condition on arrival, it might confirm or disprove some of the statements they had heard. Therefore, having phoned to the S?reté and finding he was not required there, he turned his steps again to the Hotel Continental and asked for the manager.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I’m afraid I am back to give more trouble, monsieur,’ he said, as they met, ‘but one point has arisen upon which we want some information.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I shall be pleased to assist you as far as I can.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘We want to know at what hour M. Felix returned to the hotel on the night of Saturday fortnight, the 27th March, and his condition on arrival. Can you get us that?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I’ll make inquiries. Excuse me a moment.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The manager was gone a considerable time. When he returned after more than half an hour he shook his head.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I can’t find out,’ he said. ‘I’ve asked every one I can think of, but no one knows. One of the hall porters was on duty that evening up till midnight, and he is positive he did not come in before that hour. This is a very reliable man and I think you may take what he says as accurate. The man who relieved him is off duty at present, as is also the night lift boy, and the chamber-maid on late duty in M. Felix’s corridor, but I will interview them later and let you know the result. I presume that will be time enough?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Certainly,’ and with thanks Burnley withdrew.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He lunched alone, greatly regretting M. Lefarge’s absence, and then called up the S?reté again. M. Chauvet wanted to speak to him, he was told, and soon he was switched through to the great man’s private room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘There has been another wire from London,’ said the distant voice, ‘and it seems a cask was sent by passenger train from Charing Cross to Paris via Dover and Calais on Thursday week, the 1st of April, consigned to M. Jaques de Belleville, from Raymond Lema?tre. I think you had better go to the Gare du Nord and find out something about it.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘How many more casks are we going to find?’ thought the puzzled Burnley, as he drove in the direction of the station. As the taxi slipped through the crowded streets he again took stock of his position, and had to admit himself completely at sea. The information they gained—and there was certainly plenty coming in—did not work into a connected whole, but each fresh piece of evidence seemed, if not actually to conflict with some other, at least to add to the tangle to be straightened out. When in England he had thought Felix innocent. Now he was beginning to doubt this conclusion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had not Lefarge’s card to show to the clerk in the parcels office, but fortunately the latter remembered him as having been with the French detective on their previous call.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Yes,’ he said, when Burnley had explained, in his somewhat halting French, what he wanted, ‘I can tell you about that cask.’ He turned up some papers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Here we are,’ he said. ‘The cask came off the Calais boat train at 5.45 p.m. on Thursday week, the 1st instant. It was consigned from Charing Cross to M. Jaques de Belleville, to be kept here until called for. He claimed it personally almost immediately after, and removed it on a cart he had brought.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Can you describe M. de Belleville?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘He was of medium height and dark, with a black beard. I did not take special notice of him.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Burnley produced a photograph of Felix he had received from London.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Is that the man?’ he asked, handing it over.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The clerk scrutinised it carefully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I could hardly say,’ he replied hesitatingly, ‘it’s certainly like my recollection of him, but I am not sure. Remember I only saw him once, and that about ten days ago.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Of course, you could hardly be expected to remember. Can you tell me another thing? What time did he take the cask away?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I can tell you that because I book off duty at 5.15, and I waited five minutes after that to finish the business. He left at 5.20 exactly.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I suppose there was nothing that attracted your attention about the cask, nothing to differentiate it from other casks?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘As a matter of fact,’ returned the clerk, ‘there were two things. First, it was exceedingly well and strongly made and bound with thicker iron hoops than any I had previously seen, and secondly, it was very heavy. It took two men to get it from here to the cart that M. de Belleville had brought.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘You didn’t notice any lettering on it, other than the labels?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I did,’ he answered, ‘there was “Return to” in French, English, and German, and the name of a Paris firm.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Do you recollect the name?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The young man paused in thought.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘No, monsieur,’ he replied, after a few seconds, ‘I regret to say I have quite forgotten it.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I suppose you wouldn’t recognise it if you heard it? It was not, for example, Messrs. Dupierre, the monumental sculptors, of Grenelle?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The clerk hesitated again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Possibly it was, monsieur, but I fear I could not say definitely.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Well, I am greatly obliged for what you have told me, any way. Just one other question. What was in the cask?’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘It was invoiced Statuary, but of course I did not see it opened, and don’t know if the description was correct.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Burnley thanked the young man and turned out of the great station. Certainly it sounded as if this was a similar cask to that he had taken to Scotland Yard, if it was not the same one. Of course, he had to remember that even if it were one of Messrs. Dupierre’s, which was not proven, there were a large number of these casks in circulation, and it did not follow that this one was connected with his quest. But the whole circumstances gave him to think, and he felt that his bewilderment was not lessened by the new development. As he walked slowly down the rue de Lafayette towards his hotel, he racked his brains in the endeavour to piece together into a connected whole the various facts he had learnt. He strolled on into the Tuileries and, choosing a quiet spot under a tree, sat down to think the matter out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And first, as to these mysterious journeyings of casks. He went over the three in his mind. First, there was the cask sent out by Messrs. Dupierre on the Tuesday evening after the dinner-party, which travelled via Havre and Southampton, and which was received at Waterloo on the following morning by a black-bearded man, believed to have been Felix. That cask was addressed to Felix and it contained a statue. Then there was the second cask, sent out from Paris two days later—on the Thursday evening—which went via Rouen and long sea, and which was undoubtedly received at St. Katherine’s Docks by Felix. This number two cask contained the body of Madame Annette Boirac. And finally, there was what he might call number three cask, which was sent from London to Paris on that same Thursday, and which was claimed on arrival at the Gare du Nord by a M. Jaques de Belleville. This cask, like both the others, was labelled ‘Statuary,’ but whether that was really its contents was not known.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Inspector lit one of his strong cigars and puffed thoughtfully, as he turned these journeys over in his mind. He could not but think there was some connection between them, though at first he could not trace it. Then it occurred to him that if they were considered, not in the order of their discovery, but chronologically, some light might be gained. He went over them anew. The first journey was still that from Paris to London via Havre and Southampton, leaving Paris on Tuesday night and arriving at Waterloo on Wednesday morning. The second was now that leaving London on Thursday morning and reaching Paris that afternoon, via Dover and Calais, and the third that from Paris to London via Rouen, leaving on that same Thursday evening, and arriving at St. Katherine’s Docks on the following Monday. That is, from Paris to London, back from London to Paris, and back again from Paris to London. This seemed to show an element of design. And then a possible connection flashed across his mind. Instead of three casks might there not have been only one? Did the same cask not travel in each case?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The more Burnley thought over this, the more likely it seemed. This would explain M. Thomas’s statement that only one cask had been sent out. It would make clear how the cask containing the body had been obtained. It would account for the astonishing coincidence that three casks of this unusual kind had made three such journeys almost at the same time.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yes, it seemed probable. But if so, at some point in that triple journey the cask must have been opened, the statue removed, and the body substituted. The evidence was overwhelming that the cask had contained a statue when it left the Boulevard des Capucines yard, and that it had not been tampered with till it reached the van of the 7.47 p.m. from the Gare St. Lazare to Havre. Further, it had contained the body on arrival at St. Katherine’s Docks, and here again there was evidence that it could not have been opened in the hold of the Bullfinch. Therefore, at some point along the route, Gare St. Lazare, Havre, Southampton, Waterloo, Charing Cross, Dover, Calais, Gare du Nord, rue Cardinet goods station, Rouen, the change must have been made. Burnley made a mental note that every part of that journey must be the subject of the closest inquiry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He went a step further. At the end of each of the three journeys it was met by a middle-sized, black-bearded, French-looking man. In the case of the third journey that man was Felix. In the two earlier, his identity was not definitely known, but he was like Felix. Suppose it was Felix in each case, would not this also tend to prove there was only one cask, and that Felix was sending it backwards and forwards with some design of his own? The Inspector felt sure that he was right so far.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But if Felix had acted in this way, it followed that either he was the murderer and wished to get the body to his house to dispose of it there, or else he was an innocent man upon whom the real criminal wished to plant the corpse. This latter idea had been growing in the Inspector’s mind for some time. It seemed to hinge very much on the question, Did Felix know what was in the cask when he met it at St. Katherine’s Docks? Burnley recalled the scene at Scotland Yard when it was opened. Either Felix was an incomparable actor, or else he did not know. Burnley doubted even whether any acting could have been so realistic. He remembered also that Felix’s illness from the shock was genuine. No, he rather believed Felix knew nothing of the corpse and, if so, he must be innocent. The point was one Burnley felt he could not settle alone. They must have medical evidence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But if Felix was innocent, who was likely to be guilty? Who else could have had any motive to kill this lady? What could that motive have been, in any case? He could not tell. No evidence had yet come to light to suggest the motive.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His thoughts turned from the motive to the manner of the crime. Strangulation was an unusual method. It was, moreover, a horrible method, ghastly to witness and comparatively slow in accomplishment. Burnley could not imagine any one, no matter how brutal, deliberately adopting it and carrying it out in cold blood. No, this was a crime of passion. Some of the elemental forces of love and hate were involved. Jealousy, most probably. He considered it in his careful, methodical way. Yes, jealousy certainly seemed the most likely motive.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then another point struck him. Surely strangulation would only be adopted, even in the heat of passion, if no other method was available. If a man about to commit a murder had a weapon in his hand, he would use it. Therefore, thought Burnley, in this case the murderer could have had no weapon. And if he had no weapon, what followed from that? Why, that the crime was unpremeditated. If the affair had been planned, a weapon would have been provided.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It seemed, therefore, probably that the crime was not deliberate and cold-blooded. Some one, when alone with Madame, had been suddenly and unexpectedly roused to a pitch of furious, overmastering passion. And here again, what more likely to cause this passion than acute jealousy?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Inspector lit another cigar, as he continued his train of thought. If the motive was what he suspected, who would be a likely person to feel jealousy in reference to Madame? A former lover, he thought. So far they knew of none, and Burnley took a mental note that inquiries must be made to ascertain if such existed. Failing a former lover, the husband immediately came into his mind, and here he seemed on firmer ground. If Madame had had an understanding with Felix, and Boirac had come to know of it, there was the motive at once. Jealousy was what one would naturally expect Boirac to feel under such circumstances. There was no doubt that, so far as the facts had as yet come to light, Boirac’s guilt was a possibility they must not overlook.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Inspector then turned his thoughts to a general review of the whole case. He was a great believer in getting things on paper. Taking out his notebook, he proceeded to make a list of the facts so far as they were known, in the order of their occurrence, irrespective of when they were discovered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n First of all was the dinner party at M. Boirac’s, which took place on Saturday evening, the 27th of March. At this Felix was present, and, when Boirac was called away to his works, he remained behind, alone with Madame Boirac, after the other guests had left. He was alone with her from 11.00 p.m. till at least 11.30, on the evidence of Fran?ois. About one in the morning, Fran?ois heard the front door close, and, coming down, found that both Felix and Madame had disappeared. Madame had changed her shoes and taken a coat and hat. On Boirac’s return, a few minutes later, he found a note from his wife stating that she had eloped with Felix. Felix was believed to have gone to London next day, this having been stated by the manager of the Hotel Continental, as well as by Felix to his friend Martin outside the house when Constable Walker was listening in the lane. On that Sunday or the Monday following, a letter, apparently written by Felix, was posted in London. It contained an order on Messrs. Dupierre to send a certain group of statuary to that city. This letter was received by the firm on Tuesday. On the same day, Tuesday, the statue was packed in a cask and despatched to London via Havre and Southampton. It reached Waterloo on the following morning, and was removed from there by a man who claimed to be Felix, and probably was. The next morning, Thursday, a similar cask was despatched from Charing Cross to the Gare du Nord in Paris, being met by a man giving his name as Jaques de Belleville, but who was probably Felix. The same evening, some fifty minutes later, a similar cask was delivered at the goods station of the State Railway in the rue Cardinet, for despatch to London via Rouen and long sea. Next day, Friday, Felix stated he received a typewritten letter purporting to be from Le Gautier, telling about the lottery and the bet, stating the cask was being sent by long sea, and asking him to get it to his house. On the following morning, Saturday, he had a card from the same source, saying the cask had left, and on Monday, the 5th of April, he got the cask from the Bullfinch at St. Katherine’s Docks, and took it home.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Burnley’s list then read as follows:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Saturday, March 27.—Dinner at M.
