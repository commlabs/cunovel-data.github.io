I started to write to you yesterday afternoon,\n\u003cbr\u003e but as far as I got was the heading, `Dear Daddy-Long-Legs\u0027, and then\n\u003cbr\u003e I remembered I\u0027d promised to pick some blackberries for supper,\n\u003cbr\u003e so I went off and left the sheet lying on the table, and when I\n\u003cbr\u003e came back today, what do you think I found sitting in the middle\n\u003cbr\u003e of the page? A real true Daddy-Long-Legs!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I picked him up very gently by one leg, and dropped him out\n\u003cbr\u003e of the window. I wouldn\u0027t hurt one of them for the world. \n\u003cbr\u003e They always remind me of you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We hitched up the spring wagon this morning and drove to the Centre\n\u003cbr\u003e to church. It\u0027s a sweet little white frame church with a spire\n\u003cbr\u003e and three Doric columns in front (or maybe Ionic--I always get\n\u003cbr\u003e them mixed).\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A nice sleepy sermon with everybody drowsily waving palm-leaf fans,\n\u003cbr\u003e and the only sound, aside from the minister, the buzzing of locusts\n\u003cbr\u003e in the trees outside. I didn\u0027t wake up till I found myself on\n\u003cbr\u003e my feet singing the hymn, and then I was awfully sorry I hadn\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e listened to the sermon; I should like to know more of the psychology\n\u003cbr\u003e of a man who would pick out such a hymn. This was it:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Come, leave your sports and earthly toys\n\u003cbr\u003e And join me in celestial joys.\n\u003cbr\u003e Or else, dear friend, a long farewell.\n\u003cbr\u003e I leave you now to sink to hell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I find that it isn\u0027t safe to discuss religion with the Semples. \n\u003cbr\u003e Their God (whom they have inherited intact from their remote\n\u003cbr\u003e Puritan ancestors) is a narrow, irrational, unjust, mean, revengeful,\n\u003cbr\u003e bigoted Person. Thank heaven I don\u0027t inherit God from anybody! \n\u003cbr\u003e I am free to make mine up as I wish Him. He\u0027s kind and sympathetic\n\u003cbr\u003e and imaginative and forgiving and understanding--and He has a sense\n\u003cbr\u003e of humour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I like the Semples immensely; their practice is so superior to\n\u003cbr\u003e their theory. They are better than their own God. I told them so--\n\u003cbr\u003e and they are horribly troubled. They think I am blasphemous--\n\u003cbr\u003e and I think they are! We\u0027ve dropped theology from our conversation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is Sunday afternoon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Amasai (hired man) in a purple tie and some bright yellow buckskin gloves,\n\u003cbr\u003e very red and shaved, has just driven off with Carrie (hired girl)\n\u003cbr\u003e in a big hat trimmed with red roses and a blue muslin dress and her\n\u003cbr\u003e hair curled as tight as it will curl. Amasai spent all the morning\n\u003cbr\u003e washing the buggy; and Carrie stayed home from church ostensibly\n\u003cbr\u003e to cook the dinner, but really to iron the muslin dress.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In two minutes more when this letter is finished I am going to settle\n\u003cbr\u003e down to a book which I found in the attic. It\u0027s entitled, On the Trail,\n\u003cbr\u003e and sprawled across the front page in a funny little-boy hand:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jervis Pendleton\n\u003cbr\u003e if this book should ever roam,\n\u003cbr\u003e Box its ears and send it home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He spent the summer here once after he had been ill, when he\n\u003cbr\u003e was about eleven years old; and he left On the Trail behind. \n\u003cbr\u003e It looks well read--the marks of his grimy little hands are frequent! \n\u003cbr\u003e Also in a corner of the attic there is a water wheel and a windmill\n\u003cbr\u003e and some bows and arrows. Mrs. Semple talks so constantly about him\n\u003cbr\u003e that I begin to believe he really lives--not a grown man with a silk hat\n\u003cbr\u003e and walking stick, but a nice, dirty, tousle-headed boy who clatters\n\u003cbr\u003e up the stairs with an awful racket, and leaves the screen doors open,\n\u003cbr\u003e and is always asking for cookies. (And getting them, too, if I\n\u003cbr\u003e know Mrs. Semple!) He seems to have been an adventurous little soul--\n\u003cbr\u003e and brave and truthful. I\u0027m sorry to think he is a Pendleton;\n\u003cbr\u003e he was meant for something better.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027re going to begin threshing oats tomorrow; a steam engine\n\u003cbr\u003e is coming and three extra men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It grieves me to tell you that Buttercup (the spotted cow with\n\u003cbr\u003e one horn, Mother of Lesbia) has done a disgraceful thing. She got\n\u003cbr\u003e into the orchard Friday evening and ate apples under the trees,\n\u003cbr\u003e and ate and ate until they went to her head. For two days she\n\u003cbr\u003e has been perfectly dead drunk! That is the truth I am telling. \n\u003cbr\u003e Did you ever hear anything so scandalous?\n\u003cbr\u003e Sir,\n\u003cbr\u003e I remain,\n\u003cbr\u003e Your affectionate orphan,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy Abbott\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. Indians in the first chapter and highwaymen in the second. \n\u003cbr\u003e I hold my breath. What can the third contain? `Red Hawk leapt\n\u003cbr\u003e twenty feet in the air and bit the dust.\u0027 That is the subject of\n\u003cbr\u003e the frontispiece.
