Do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eddie took it to the hospital.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands, she noticed, shook as he flipped through the pages of his notebook. He was nervous and couldn’t quite look her in the eyes. She thought that was odd but then decided he was embarrassed because of the mix-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already went over there, hoping I’d find you, and one of the nurses was kind enough to look at the weekly log. She said there was an accident late that afternoon and that you were in surgery when Eddie made the delivery, but that doesn’t make any sense, since you signed for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes, I remember the accident. I was on the surgical floor, up to my elbows in charts I had to finish before I could leave. I did get a call from ER telling me there was a package for me. I don’t remember getting it, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe it will jog your memory if I tell you that you signed for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did?” She certainly didn’t remember doing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustration crept into his voice when he said, “Yes, Doctor, you did. We always keep a copy of the receipt in our offices and mail the original back to the sender, and I’m telling you,” he added, his anxiety not quite masking his anger, “your signature is as clear as can be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won’t do you any good to get angry,” she said. “And if you could read my handwriting, then I definitely didn’t sign for it. No one can read my writing. I do think I know what must have happened,” she added. “The staff secretary down in ER signed my name. That’s pretty much standard procedure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe racked her brain, trying to remember the sequence. Exhausted from being up most of the night before, she had made up her mind not to leave on vacation until every one of her charts had been dictated. “I did go down to get the package.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where?” he asked urgently with a hasty look over his shoulder at the football team. “Did you go to admitting or to the emergency room?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ER,” she answered. “And that’s when the paramedics arrived.” She shrugged then. “I went right back up to surgery and did two cases back-to-back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you never opened the package, did you?” He was smiling and sounded relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I didn’t open it,” she said. “I certainly would have remembered doing that, especially if there were papers from a law firm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can understand how anxious the attorneys are to get those papers. They were going to another law firm. It’s all confidential stuff. I could drive over to the hospital right this minute and get the package from that secretary, couldn’t I? What’s her name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elena Miller, but she won’t give it to you unless I tell her it’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could you call her now? Eddie already picked up the package meant for you and is on his way here now. I sure would like to get this finished today. I’ve got my phone with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved closer so he could hand her the phone. Michelle could smell his aftershave. He’d used a heavy hand, but it didn’t mask the odor of sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was acting like a nervous twit. No wonder he was sweating. He kept looking over his shoulder at the field, as though he expected one of the boys to hurl a football at him. She dialed the hospital, asked for Elena, and was put on hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He has them mesmerized, doesn’t he?” she remarked as she waited for the secretary to pick up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The coach. He has those players hanging on his every word. I noticed you were watching them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh . . . yes, yes, he does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena Miller picked up a phone in the emergency room, and in her usual harried voice snapped, “Miller here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Elena. It’s Dr. Renard. Am I interrupting you in the middle of something important?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m always in the middle of something important, Doctor, and you forgot to finish your charts. You left two,” she said. “And you left your mail untouched. Your ‘in’ box is brimming over, Doctor. Now, aren’t you glad you called? What can I do for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did finish my charts,” she argued. “Every last one of them, so if Murphy thinks he’s going to put me on report, you tell him I’ll have his hide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax, Doctor. Murphy’s on vacation too. What can I do for you?” she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichelle explained about the mix-up with the packages. “Do you remember signing for a package that was delivered around five o’clock Monday?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right this minute, I can’t even remember what I ate for supper last night. I do remember Monday was one of those hellacious days in the ER. We had a rush of accidents, and then there was that real bad one out on the highway. There were at least twenty mothers and fathers jamming the halls while the doctors worked on their kids. I certainly don’t remember signing for anything, but it doesn’t matter if I remember or not. If I signed for it, then I put a yellow sticky on your locker telling you I had a package for you. I would have put it inside your locker, but you still haven’t given me your combination.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry about that,” she said. “I keep forgetting. Do you have any idea where the package is now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll look around. It’s either in my desk or on top of your locker. What do you want me to do when I locate it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give it to the man from Speedy Messenger Service. He’ll be there soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, all right. I’ll be here until six tonight, but not a minute later. Tonight’s bridge night at the church, and I have to be there by six-thirty to help set up. It’s my turn to be hostess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure he’ll get there before then. Thanks, Elena.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she pushed the “end” button and handed the phone back to Frank, she noticed Theo was walking across the field toward them. Frank seemed to be watching Theo too. He kept his eye on him when he asked Michelle, “What did she tell you? Does she have the package?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax. Eddie’s going to keep his job. Elena will be at the hospital until six, and she’ll be happy to make the exchange.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t say thank you. In fact, his exit was quite abrupt. Pulling the brim of his ball cap down low on his brow, he ran down the steps. His head was turned away from the field. As he was disappearing into the tunnel, she shouted, “You’re welcome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t hear her. Desperate to get away before anyone else got a good look at his face, he ran as fast as he could through the locker rooms and outside, across the parking lot. He was panting from the effort. He fell against the car door, doubled over, and tried to catch his breath while he grabbed at the door handle. He heard a sound behind him and whirled around in a half crouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened. “What the hell are you doing, sneaking up on me like that? Are you following me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think you’re doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m doing what needs to be done,” he argued. “No one else was getting anywhere. The doctor won’t ever see me again. Besides, the risk was worth it. I know where the package is. I’m on my way to pick it up right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were told not to interact with the subject. That point was made perfectly clear to you. Now the doctor knows what you look like. You’ve made a stupid mistake, and the others aren’t going to like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo was quiet on the ride back to Michelle’s house. They were both hot and sticky and wanted to shower before he took her to dinner at The Swan. He had offered to take her somewhere else a little more fancy, but she had promised her father that she would help tend bar if he needed her. Wednesday was a busy night for her father’s bar, and because the fishing competition was coming up on Saturday, it would surely be crowded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Couldn’t your brother help your dad?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“John Paul hasn’t surfaced in the last week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does your brother disappear a lot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When my father needs him, he’s there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But how does he know your father needs him? Does he call him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “John Paul doesn’t have a phone, and he wouldn’t answer it if he did. He usually shows up on Friday morning to see what Daddy needs him to do. John Paul’s never worked the bar during the weeknights.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if your dad got into trouble? What if he got sick or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“John Paul would know something was wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ESP?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He just would know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your brother sounds strange.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He isn’t strange,” she said defensively. “He’s just different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about your other brother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remy? What about him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is he different?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By your standards, no, he isn’t different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither one of them said another word for several minutes. Michelle broke the silence when she noticed he was frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you thinking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The kid who kept tripping out on the field today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was wearing his brother’s shoes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re trying to figure out what you can do about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The team needs new equipment,” he remarked. “Conrad’s going to talk to the coach over in St. Claire about letting our team use their weight room. None of them should go out on that field until they’re conditioned for it. You know what I mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They need to build up their muscles and their stamina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly. Otherwise they could get hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You called them ‘our team.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you did. I heard it as clear as a bell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe changed the subject. “What did that messenger want? I saw you talking to him on my way to the watercooler.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was a mix-up at the hospital. I sent him to the ER staff secretary. She’ll straighten it all out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, then changed the subject once again. “How much money do you think the cash prize will amount to for the fishing tournament?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know how many will enter this year, but if I were to guess, I’d say two men in a boat, fifty dollars each . . . and last year they had over seventy entries . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, if we say eighty people sign up this year, that’s four thousand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a lot of money around here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Four thousand dollars could buy a lot of shoes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds like you’ve got a plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, well, the key to the plan is to win.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “No kidding. What about my dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about him?” he asked as he pulled into her drive and parked the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two thousand dollars will belong to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll donate it. Your dad’s a softy.” He followed her to the front door. “But like I said, the key to the grand plan is to win the tournament.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s killing you that you can’t just go out and buy the team what they need, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d hit the nail on the head. “Yes,” he admitted. “But I know I can’t do that. Their parents would get their backs up. I’d be stomping on their pride. Right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you would. You’ll go broke if you keep buying little boys expensive fences and shoes and football pads for the team and heaven knows what else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No kid should have to worry about an alligator in his backyard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned at the door, put her hands on his shoulders, and kissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that for?” he asked when she sauntered away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked back, gave him a quick smile, and said, “Why did I kiss you? That’s an easy one. I kissed you because I think you’re sweet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reacted as though she’d just insulted him. “There is nothing sweet about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? You were worried about embarrassing that boy wearing his brother’s shoes, weren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never said I was worried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “No, but you were, weren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but —”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re . . . sweet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I make a lot of money, Michelle, and it sure as certain isn’t because I’m sweet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was slowly advancing, and with each step he took toward her, she took a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t care how much money you make. You’ve got everybody fooled back in Boston, don’t you? They probably think you’re a killer prosecutor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am a killer prosecutor and proud of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were concerned about John Patrick, and that’s why you purchased the fence. You know what that makes you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t say it,” he warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sweet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “No. I know why you really kissed me, babe. Be honest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her around the waist as she was backing into the library. She was laughing as he pulled her up against him. His chest was like a brick wall. A warm brick wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned down until his mouth hovered just an inch or two above hers. “Want me to tell you why you kissed me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m waiting in breathless anticipation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s simple. You want me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe expected a protest, but wasn’t the least disappointed when she said, “When you’re right, you’re right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that?” She leaned back so she could look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re dying to get your hands on me.” He pulled her closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrapped her arms around his waist and hooked her thumbs in his waistband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did get my hands on you. You really need to work on that ego. I’ve noticed you don’t have any self-confidence around women. It’s sad really . . . but . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what?” he asked, rubbing his jaw against the side of her face as he waited for the zinger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re still sweet,” she whispered into his ear, then took his earlobe between her teeth and tugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned. “I’ll show you sweet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilting her head back, his mouth came down on top of hers, and he kissed her with a passionate hunger. The kiss was wet, hot, wild, and thoroughly arousing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mercy-buchanan-renard-2/page-25.html","bookId":1834,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:46 PM"}
