Maybe just his ring finger and his left foot, and the rest of him can stay a bachelor?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla suddenly seemed to have an intense desire to inspect her feet. She looked down, avoiding my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Um… if you put it that way… no. I don\u0027t think I do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And what about the rest of him?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a minute movement. Among immovable pillars of salt, it might have passed for a headshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Say it,’ I encouraged her. ‘Do you want to marry Wilkins?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘N… n…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Go on! You can do it! Do you want to marry him?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Bravo!’ I rubbed my hands, grinning from ear to ear. ‘Excellent!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Excellent?’ Ella looked up at me, desperation in her face ‘What’s excellent about it? Aunt Brank wants me to marry him!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I mean it’s excellent you have admitted it to yourself. You normally don\u0027t do that. It’s the first step to problem-solving.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Err… and the next one is?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved my hand dismissively. ‘We\u0027ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Just at the moment you look like you need something to restore your nerves.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To be absolutely honest… I think that’s true.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well then, my dear little sister…’ I put an arm around her and steered her from behind the potted plant. I already felt better. It had always been that way for me. When I was busy solving Ella’s problems, my own suddenly didn’t seem as important any more. ‘I have just the thing for you. It’s called solid chocolate. Let’s see how you like it, shall we?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla accompanied me willingly. We were about half the way towards the refreshment tables when somebody roughly grabbed me by the arm and whirled me around. When I saw who it was, I gasped in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There you are, strange lady!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Patsy!’ I exclaimed, and then was swept up in a vice-like hug, ten times more forceful than my aunt’s had been. With complete disregard for our hoop skirts, which should have kept us at a respectful distance, Patsy crushed me to her, and from the region of my legs, I heard whalebones[38] groan and crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Patsy,’ I gasped again, pushing her back and looking at her solid figure, her broad, gruff, oh-so-reliable face. For the moment all dark thoughts about Mr Ambrose were forgotten. ‘Is it really you? What are you doing here? How did you manage to get invited? I thought old Lady Metcalf can’t stand you and your modern ways!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatsy grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, she can’t, actually, but she is an old friend of my mother’s and has to pretend to like me. More to the point, what are you doing here?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well you know how my aunt is, she always drags me to balls…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not here at the ball, silly! I mean what are you doing here in London, here in England even? I thought you had emigrated to Timbuktu or something! I haven’t seen you in ages! And don\u0027t tell me you’ve been driving around the park presenting yourself to the eyes of eligible bachelors. I know that’s what you’ve told your aunt, because I came by your house to visit when you were out. But I and the other girls have been in the park often enough and haven’t seen hide nor hair of you! What are you up to?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell’s Whiskers, what to tell her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t tell her that I was working for a living, could I? Not that Patsy would have anything against it. On the contrary. I was certain she would wholeheartedly approve. But if I told her about my work, I would also have to tell her about Mr Ambrose. And for some reason I didn’t want to do that. I didn’t want to do that at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth, not knowing what I was going to say. Maybe a clever explanation would have come to me at the last moment. Yet before I could say anything, the decision was taken out of my hand by a very simple, very common event:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside me, Ella blushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aha!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatsy pounced on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You know something, don\u0027t you? Out with it, Ella! Go on!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElla’s eyes flickered from side to side like those of a frightened deer. I sighed. Ella was no liar, and under the unconquerable force that was Patsy Cusack, only one result could ensue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Lilly, um… Lilly is…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes…?’ Patsy encouraged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Lilly is seeing somebody. But don\u0027t tell anybody. It’s supposed to be a secret.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, a secret,’ I confirmed throwing a dirty look at her. ‘That’s why I asked you to keep it secret, by which I meant not tell it to anybody.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith those adorable blue damsel-in-distress eyes of hers she threw me an apologetic glance. ‘I’m… I’m sorry Lilly, I just can’t… can’t lie about…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy anger was snuffed out like a candle flame under a wet towel. Nobody could stay angry at Ella. Not even the chief of avenging angels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right,’ I grumbled with a shrug. It was to be expected. And it wasn’t like it had been the truth in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning my attention away from my little sister, I scrutinised Patsy. She hadn’t yet said a word in response to Ella’s disclosure. Her mouth stood slightly open, her lips were moving without producing any sound, and her eyes were unfocused. She looked like she had tried solving a complex mathematical equation and had ended up with 1009 \u003d 0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Seeing somebody?’ she echoed. ‘As in… a member of the opposite sex? A man?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, a hippopotamus,’ I snapped. ‘Yes, a man! What did you think?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Frankly, I would have thought a hippopotamus would have been more likely!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers flexed. ‘Do you want me to clobber you with my fan?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No need to get violent. I’m just shocked.’ She shook her head, dazed. ‘A man. Fancy that. Lilly Linton going over to the enemy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReflexively, my chin shot out. ‘I’m not “going over to the enemy”!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Really? Hasn’t your sweetheart asked you to shed your extremist political views about voting, working women yet? It\u0027ll happen, just you wait. And next you’ll get all silly and soppy and start knitting and sewing and saying that a lady’s proper place is inside the home.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-99.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM"}
