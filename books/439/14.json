SI \"STRAGGLED\"","content":"AND THE OTHER BOYS MADE IT MIGHTY LOVELY FOR HIM.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ONE day while Buell was chasing Bragg, two or three weeks after leaving Louisville, the army was pushing forward at a gait that made the cavalry ahead trot half the time to keep out of the way of the infantry. The extraordinary speed that day was due to the fact that there were no rebels in sight. Half a dozen ragged troopers with shotguns, a mile away, would have caused the whole army to halt, form line-of-battle, and stay thera the rest of the day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The tanned veterans didn\u0027t mind the marching. They stretched their legs and went swinging along with a happy-go-lucky air, always ready for anything that might turn up. But it was rough on the new troops, just from home. It taxed their locomotive powers to the utmost limit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The boys of the 200th Ind. started out bravely. Their fresh, clean faces, new uniforms, and shiny accouterments contrasted strongly with those of the weather-beaten soldiers of \u002761. You could tell a \"tenderfoot\" as far as you could see him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They trudged along in fair shape for an hour or two. Before starting in the morning strict orders had been read to the regiment forbidding straggling, for any reason, under the most terrifying pains and penalties.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Them fellers that\u0027s been in the service longer \u0027n we have think they\u0027re smart,\" said Si Klegg, as he and Shorty plodded on, both already a little blown. \"Well show \u0027em that we can hoof it jest as fast as they can, and jest as fur in a day!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Seems to me we\u0027re git\u0027n over the ground party lively to-day,\" replied Shorty, who was in a grumbling mood. \"Wonder if the Gin\u0027ral thinks we\u0027re bosses! I\u0027m a little short o\u0027 wind, and these pesky gunboats are scrapin\u0027 the bark off\u0027n my feet; but I\u0027ll keep up or bust.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Though e spirit of these young patriots was willing, the flesh was weak. It wasn\u0027t long till Si began to limp. Now and then a groan escaped his lips as a fresh blister \"broke.\" But Si clinched his teeth, humped his back to ease his shoulders from the weight of his knapsack, screwed up his courage, and tramped on over the stony pike. He thought the breathing spells were very short and a long way apart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si\u0027s knapsack had experienced the universal shrinkage, as told in a previous chapter of our hero\u0027s martial career. He still had, however, a good many things that he thought he couldn\u0027t spare, but which he found later he could very well get along without.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By noon the 200th began to show signs of going to pieces. The column stretched out longer and longer, like a piece of India-rubber. The ranks looked thin and ragged. Lame and foot-sore, with wo-begone faces, their bodies aching in every bone and tendon, and overcome with a weariness that no one can realize unless he has \"been there,\" the men dropped out one by one and threw themselves into the fence-corners to rest. The officers stormed and drew their swords in vain. Nature—that is, the nature of a new soldier—could endure no more. The ambulances were filled to their utmost, but these would not hold a twentieth part of the crippled and suffering men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How\u0027re ye gittin\u0027 on, Shorty?\" said Si, as he and his comrade still struggled along.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fair to middlin\u0027,\" replied Shorty. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to try and pull through!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I thought I could,\" said Si, \"but I\u0027m \u0027bout played out! I am, fer a fact! I guess ef I rest a bit I\u0027ll be able to ketch up after a while.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si didn\u0027t know till he found out by experience how hard it was to \"ketch up\" when a soldier once got behind on the march. Si was too fat for a good roadster, but it didn\u0027t take a great while to work off his surplus flesh. Shorty was tall and slim, mostly bone—one of the sort that always stood the marching best, crept up to the Orderly and told him that he would have to stop and puff a while and give his blisters a rest. He\u0027d pull up with Co. Q in an hour or so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Better not, Si\" said the Orderly; \"ye know it\u0027s agin orders, and the rear-guard \u0027ll punch ye with their bay\u0027net\u0027s if they catch ye stragglin\u0027.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Si concluded that if he must die for his country it would be sweeter to do so by having a bayonet inserted in his vitals, and then it would be all over with at once, than to walk himself to death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So he gradually fell back till he reached the tail of the company. Watching his opportunity, he left the ranks, crept into a clump of bushes, and lay down, feeling as if he had been run through a grist-mill. Soon the rear-guard of the 200th came along, with fixed bayonets, driving before them like a flock of frightened sheep a motley crowd of limping, groaning men, gathered up by the roadside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si lay very still, hoping to escaoe discovery; but the keen eye of the officer detected the blue heap among the bushes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bring that man out!\" said he sternly to one of the guards.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Poor Si scarcely dare to breathe. He hoped the man would think he was dead, and therefore no longer of any account. But the soldier began to prod him with his bayonet, ordering him to get up and move on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027don\u0027t Stab Me.\u0027 123\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look-a-here, pard,\" said Si, \"don\u0027t stab me with that thing! I jest can\u0027t git along any furder till I blow a little. You please lemme be, an\u0027 I\u0027ll do as much for you. P\u0027rhaps some time you\u0027ll get played out and I\u0027ll be on the rear-guard. The Cap\u0027n \u0027ll tell me ter fotch ye \u0027long, an\u0027 I\u0027ll jest let ye rest, so I will!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This view of the case struck the guard with some force. Moved with compassion, he turned away, leaving Si to enjoy his rest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hydropathic Treatment 125\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si threw aside his traps, took off his shoes and stockings, and bathed his feet with water from his canteen. He ate a couple of hardtack, and in the course of half an hour began to feel more like Si Klegg. He geared himself up, shouldered his gun, and started to \"ketch up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All this time the stream of troops—regiments, brigades and divisions—had flowed on. Of course, soldiers who were with their colors had the right of way, and the stragglers were obliged to stumble along as best they could, over the logs and through the bushes at the sides of the roads or skirt along the edges of the fields and woods adjoining. It was this fact added to their exhausted and crippled condition, that made it almost impossible for stragglers to overtake their regiments until they halted for the night. Even then it was often midnight before the last of the wayfarers, weary and worn, dragged their aching limbs into camp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si started forward briskly, but soon found it was no easy matter to gain the mile or so that the 200th Ind. was now ahead of him. It was about all he could do to keep up with the fast-moving column and avoid failing still further to the rear. Presently the bugles sounded a halt for one of the hourly rests.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now,\" said Si to himself, \"I\u0027ll have a good chance to git along tor\u0027d the front. The soljers \u0027ll all lie down in the fence corners an\u0027 leave the road clear. I\u0027ll jest git up an\u0027 dust!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sound of the bugles had scarcely died away when the pike was deserted, and on either side, as far as the eye could reach, the prostrate men that covered the ground mingled in a long fringe of blue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si got up into the road and started along the lane between these lines of recumbent soldiers. His gait was a little shaky, for the blisters on his feet began to give evidence of renewed activity. He trudged pluckily along, limping some in spite of himself, but on the whole making very good headway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pretty soon he struck a veteran regiment from Illinois, the members of which were sitting and lying around in all the picturesque and indescribable postures which the old soldiers found gave them the greatest comfort during a \"rest.\" Then they commenced—that is, it was great sport for the Sucker boys, though Si did not readily appreciate the humorous features of the scene.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What rigiment is this?\" asked Si, timidly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Same old rijiment!\" was the answer from half a dozen at once. A single glance told the swarthy veterans that the fresh-looking youth who asked this conundrum belonged to one of the new regiments, and they immediately opened their batteries upon him:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Left—left-\u003dleft!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hayfoot—strawfoot! Hayfoot—strawfoot!\" keeping time with Si\u0027s somewhat irregular steps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hello, there, you! Change step and you\u0027ll march easier!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look at that \u0027ere poor feller; the only man left alive of his regiment! Great Cesar, how they must have suffered! Say, what rijiment did you b\u0027long to?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Paymaster\u0027s comin\u0027, boys, here\u0027s a chap with a pay-roll round his neck!\" Si had put on that morning the last of the paper collars he had brought from home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027d better shed that knapsack, or it\u0027ll be the death of ye!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I say, there, how\u0027s all the folks to home?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How d\u0027ye like it as far as you\u0027ve got, any way?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Git some commissary and pour into them gunboats!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Second relief\u0027s come, boys; we can all go home now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Grab a root!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hep—hep—hep!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How\u0027d ye leave Mary Ann?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si had never been under such a fire before. He stood it as long as he could, and \u0027then he stopped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Halt!\" shouted a chorus of voices. \"Shoulder—Arms!\" \"Order—Arms!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By this time Si\u0027s wrath was at the boiling point. Casting around him a look of defiance, he exclaimed:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You cowardly blaggards; I can jest lick any two of ye, an\u0027 I\u0027ll dare ye to come on. If the 200th Ind. was here we\u0027d clean out the hull pack of ye quicker\u0027n ye can say scat!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is where Si made a mistake. He ought to have kept right on and said nothing. But Si had to find out all these things by experience, as the rest of the boys did.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si Defies a Regiment 129\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the members took a hand in the game. They just got right up and yelled, discharging at Si a volley of expletives and pointed remarks that drove him to desperation. Instinctively he brought up his gun.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Load in nine times—Load!\" shouted a dozen of the Illinois tramps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If Si\u0027s gun had been loaded he would have shot somebody, regardless of consequences. Thinking of his bayonet, he jerked it quickly from its scabbard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fix—Bay\u0027net!\" yelled the ragged veterans.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he did, though it was more from the promptings of his own hostile feelings than in obedience to the orders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Charge—Bay\u0027net!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si had completely lost control of himself in his overpowering rage. With blood in his eye, he came to, a charge, glancing fiercely from one side of the road to the other, uncertain where to begin the assault.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Instantly there was a loud clicking all along the line. The Illinois soldiers, almost to a man, fixed their bayonets. Half of them sprang to their feet, and all aimed their shining points at the poor young Hoosier patriot, filling the air with shouts of derision.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was plain, even to Si in his inflamed state of mind, that the odds against him were too heavy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Unfix—Bay\u0027net!\" came from half the regiment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si concluded he had better get out of a bad scrape the best way he could. So he took off his bayonet and put it back in its place. He shouted words of defiance to his tormentors, but they could not be heard in the din.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Shoulder—Arms!\" \"Right—Face!\" \"Right shoulder shift—Arms!\" \"Forward—March!\" These commands came in quick succession from the ranks amidst roars of laughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si obeyed the orders and started off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Left—left—left!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hayfoot—strawfoot!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Forgetting his blisters. Si took the double-quick while the mob swung their caps and howled with delight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si didn\u0027t \"ketch up\" with the 200 Ind. until after it had gone into camp. Shorty had a quart of hot coffee waiting for him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Shorty,\" said Si as they sat by the fire,—\"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to drop dead in my tracks before I\u0027ll fall out again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, what\u0027s the matter?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, nothin\u0027; only you jest try it,\" said Si.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Had it not been for the \"fun\" the soldiers had in the army to brighten their otherwise dark and cheerless lives, they would all have died. Si was a true type of those who had to suffer for the good of others until they learned wisdom in the school of experience.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63201.html","bookId":439,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 8:15:27 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 8:15:27 AM"}
