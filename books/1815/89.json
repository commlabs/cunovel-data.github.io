She looked at the empty lounger where my mom had been. “Where’s Monica?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She went to cool off in the water.” I looked for her but didn’t see her. She was hard to miss in her lavender bikini, so I figured she’d wandered off somewhere. “She’ll be back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d been with us the whole time, partying alongside us every step of the way. It wasn’t her style to drink too much and stay up too late, but she seemed to be having fun. She was certainly causing a stir. Men of all ages flocked around her. There was a kittenish sensuality about my mother that was irresistible. I wished I had that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at him go,” Shawna said, drawing my attention to where Cary played in the surf. “He’s a total chick magnet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beach was packed, so much so that it was hard to see the sand. Dozens of shoulders and heads bobbed amid the ocean waves, but it was easy to see the cluster around Cary. He was flashing his grin, soaking up the attention like a cat in the sun. With his hair slicked back, the beauty of his gorgeous face was on display, despite the aviator shades he wore to block out the bright sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching me watching him, he waved. I blew him a kiss, just to stir things up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and Cary never got together?” Shawna asked. “Did you ever want to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. Cary was stunning now, healthy and leanly muscular, a prime example of the perfect male. But when I’d met him, he had been gaunt and hollow-eyed, always shrouded in hoodies even in the warmth of San Diego summers. He’d kept his arms covered to hide the evidence of his cutting and wore the hood over his closely cropped head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn group therapy sessions, he’d always sat outside the circle and against a wall, his chair kicked back to balance on the rear legs. He commented rarely, but when he did, his humor was dark and laced with sarcasm, his insight almost always cynical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had approached him once, unable to ignore the deep inner pain that radiated from him. Don’t waste my time easing into it, he’d said smoothly, his beautiful green eyes devoid of any light at all. You want to ride my dick, just say so. I never say no to a fuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that was true. Dr. Travis had a lot of messed-up patients, many of whom used sex as a salve or form of self-punishment. Cary was available to be used by all of them, and many walked through that open-door invitation frequently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, thanks, I’d shot back, disgust triggered by his sexual aggression. You’re too skinny for me. Eat a fucking cheeseburger, dickhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI regretted trying to be nice to him after that. He’d stalked me mercilessly, constantly putting me off with crass sexual come-ons. I’d been prickly at first. When that didn’t work, I’d killed him with kindness. Eventually, he’d realized I really wasn’t going to sleep with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, he started putting on weight. He let his hair start growing out. He stopped being the resident fuck, although he was simply more selective. I had noticed how gorgeous he was, but there was no attraction there. He was too much like me and my self-preservation instincts had been on high alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were friends,” I told her. “Then he became like a brother to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I adore him,” Megumi said, smoothing suntan lotion over her legs. “He told me that things are rough with him and Trey right now. I’m sorry to hear that. They’re so great together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, my gaze going back to my dearest friend. Cary was lifting a woman up by the waist to toss her into the waves. She came up sputtering and laughing, clearly smitten. “It’s lame to say that it’ll work out if it’s meant to, but that’s what I’m going with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still needed to call Trey. And Gideon’s mom, Elizabeth. I wanted to touch base with Ireland, too. And Chris. Since I’d probably be wiped out from jet lag and too much alcohol, I made a mental note to fit in all those calls while I recovered at the penthouse. I had to touch base with my dad, too, since I’d put off our scheduled Saturday call due to the time difference between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to go home.” Megumi stretched out with a sigh, her drink in her hands. “These two days went by too fast. I can’t believe we’re leaving in a few hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could easily stay another week, if I weren’t missing Gideon so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head tilted at the sound of my mom’s voice. She’d come up behind me and stood behind my lounger wrapped in her cover-up. “Is it time to go already?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-89.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
