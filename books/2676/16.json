We have .054 to go under present conditions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett said, \"I\u0027ll give us 350 pounds internal as a starter.\" He opened a valve, increased the anhydrase pump setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two minutes to bottom,\" said Ramsey. \"It\u0027s a long thin seamount, ridge running parallel with our course.

He shook off Sparrow\u0027s hand, staggered, caught his balance, turned, and stared deliberately at Ramsey. \"I know all about you, Mr. Long John Ramsey. You look down your long nose at me!

Then Bonnett said, \"Long John? How\u0027d you get a nickname like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey studied his instrument before turning toward Bonnett. That damned nickname! It could mean only that Garcia knew about his past -- his real past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett said, \"I asked --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I heard you.

Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For scrounging extra equipment. Moonlight requisition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett smiled. \"I don\u0027t see why that\u0027d put Joe on his ear. Unless he\u0027s jealous of someone better at it than he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Ramsey was thinking: Garcia will tell the skipper. Sure as hell he will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it extra hot in here?\" asked Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey looked at the beads of perspiration on Bonnett\u0027s face, glanced at his vampire gauge. Blood temperature normal. He looked at the dial of the thermosystem monitor on his board, said, \"Seventy-one degrees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My skin feels itchy,\" said Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey resisted the impulse to scratch at his own forearm, said, \"I\u0027ve been noticing the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett glanced at the exposed wiring of the atmosphere controls, checked a dial setting. \"Anhydrase generation is double the normal.

They think sometimes the governor gets a little bit off -- out of timing kind of -- and the organism gets caught in a feed-back situation: oscillates to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That they don\u0027t know.

His jaw set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re trying to get me to reassure you, no dice,\" said Ramsey. \"All I know is we\u0027re still alive, even if we are a bit uncom --Signal!\" He slapped the switch on the ranging computer read the dial. \"Five hundred yards.

He glanced at the thermocouple dial. \"It\u0027s been over us periodically. Gone now. I think this seamount acts like a barrier to the Arctic Current. Probably sets up complex whorl patterns.\" He looked back to the ranging dials. \"The EPs are holding course.
