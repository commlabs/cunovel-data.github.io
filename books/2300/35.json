She stood there for a few minutes, listening to the rain and the thunder, watching as lightning streaked across the lowering sky. She had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealways loved storms and loved the rain, as long as she didn\u0027t have to drive in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter closing the doors, she left her bedroom, glad that she didn\u0027t have to go to work. In the hallway, she paused outside her parents\u0027 room. Remembering her mother\u0027s words the night before, she wondered where her father had gone to rest where he wouldn\u0027t be disturbed. Was it somewhere in the house? Had her mother gone to join him there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for the door, her hand closing around the knob; then, with a shake of her head, she went downstairs. She had never violated her parents\u0027 privacy; she wouldn\u0027t start now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found Di Giorgio in the kitchen, the Sunday paper spread out on the table. He looked up when Cara entered the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning, Miss DeLongpre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Frank. Have you been awake all night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I caught a few winks on the sofa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I was just going to make some breakfast. Would you like...\" Her voice trailed off when she happened to glance at the morning headline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIRE DESTROYS ABANDONED BUILDING\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBODY OF UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN FOUND INSIDE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFOUL PLAY SUSPECTED\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning over Frank\u0027s shoulder, she quickly read the story, which stated that the fire department suspected arson and the police department suspected murder. At present, the police had no leads and no suspects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara stared at Frank, her mother\u0027s words echoing in her mind: Someone should burn that horrible place down, Brenna had said. And Frank had replied, Maybe someone will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did it, didn\u0027t you?\" Cara said. \"You burned down the lab.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDi Giorgio looked up at her, his face impassive. \"Who, me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDi Giorgio tapped on the newspaper. \"No leads,\" he said with a sly grin. \"No suspects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara shook her head. She should be appalled by what he had done but all she felt was relief that she would never see that lab again, coupled with a faint sense of sadness for Anton. His mother had died a horrible death, her body burned beyond recognition in the fire. Of course, Cara thought, there was no one to blame for Serafina\u0027s death except Serafina. For a moment, the horror of all that had happened flashed through her mind: the mind-numbing fear of being strapped to a metal table, her concern for her father, the sharp prick of the needle as Serafina drew her blood, the icy terror that had chilled her to the marrow of her bones when Anthony Loken\u0027s body rose from the coffin...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook off the memories. What was done was done, and she was glad the building was gone. She hoped the city would level whatever was left of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Frank, would you like something to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"French toast and bacon okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything you want to fix is fine with me.\" He reached for the coffee cup on the table. \"You got any plans for today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\" Opening the refrigerator, Cara took out a carton of eggs and the bacon and placed them on the counter, then she pulled a frying pan from the cupboard. \"Although I might go out later and see if Vince is home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be driving you anywhere you want to go today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of habit, she started to insist she didn\u0027t need a babysitter, but the words died unspoken. After last night, she was lucky to have Frank around. In fact, she wasn\u0027t sure she ever wanted to go anywhere alone again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter breakfast, she went upstairs to shower and dress, and then Di Giorgio drove her over to Vince\u0027s garage, but the place was locked up tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisappointed, she asked Frank to take her back to her parents\u0027 house. After walking her to the door and seeing her safely inside, he told her he was going to his place for a quick shower and a change of clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be running off without me,\" he warned. \"Your folks will have my hide if anything happens to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Cara said, \"I\u0027m not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton woke with a start. Disoriented for a moment, he glanced at his surroundings, relieved to find that he was at home. Apparently, he had fallen asleep on the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting up, he ran a hand through his hair. He\u0027d had the most horrible nightmare. He shuddered at the memory. His father had been terrorizing the city and his mother\u0027s burned body had been at his father\u0027s side. It had been like every horrible zombie movie he had ever seen. The two of them had had him backed into a corner, their skeletal hands reaching for his throat, when he woke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising, he went into the bathroom to splash cold water on his face. Leaving the bathroom, he paused outside his mother\u0027s bedroom. She had never let him into her room, insisting she liked her privacy. Well, she wasn\u0027t there to stop him now. It took only a moment to force the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping inside, he hit the light switch, then glanced around, wondering what she\u0027d had to hide. He saw nothing out of the ordinary: a double bed with a flowered comforter, a pair of nightstands, a lamp with a fancy shade, a six-drawer dresser littered with yellowed newspaper clippings. He wondered how many times she had read the story about his father\u0027s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving farther into the room, he went to her closet and opened the door. Her dresses took up one side; the other was filled with men\u0027s clothing-all new, with the price tags still in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing into his mother\u0027s bathroom, he opened the medicine cabinet, where he found an assortment of men\u0027s toiletries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegret burned deep in his soul. His mother had been certain her incantation would work. And it would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave, he thought, his anger rising, except for DeLongpre\u0027s daughter. But for her, his father and mother might be here with him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton clenched his hands at his sides as he remembered how it had been, growing up without a father, listening to other guys talk about playing football with their dads and going camping and hunting and fishing. Their fathers had taught them how to drive and mow the yard and bait a hook. Their dads were there to cheer them on at little League games. Other boys had fathers they could talk to about things that a guy couldn\u0027t discuss with his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton sighed. He had never had a father, and now his mother was gone, too, and it was all that tramp Cara DeLongpre\u0027s fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing back into his mother\u0027s bedroom, he stood there a moment and then, not certain why, he went to his mother\u0027s dresser and opened the drawers one by one. The right side was filled with his mother\u0027s underthings. The left side held neatly folded T-shirts, shorts, and handkerchiefs intended for his father. It occurred to Anton that it all belonged to him now: the house, the cars, and the contents of the house. He picked up one of the T-shirts, then rummaged through the others, noting that there were a variety of colors-red, navy, green, and black. Under the last shirt he found a wand wrapped in a sheet of tissue paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t his mother\u0027s, and it wasn\u0027t his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, Anton picked it up and felt a faint vibration of latent power flow from the wood up his arm. He ran his fingertips over the satin finish, knowing it must have belonged to his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking the wand with him, he left his mother\u0027s room. Now that Cara\u0027s parents knew who he was, it was unlikely that he would ever be able to get close to her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning thoughtfully, Anton ran his thumb over the wand. If he could find a way to control the creature, he might be able to avenge his mother\u0027s death before sending the creature back where it belonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing down to the basement, he began rummaging through his mother\u0027s spell books, searching for an incantation that would enable him to control the creature inhabiting his father\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince woke late in the afternoon to find Cat sitting on his chest. \"What do you want?\" he muttered irritably. \"Go on, get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat yawned, displaying sharp white teeth, then, tail sticking straight up in the air, he padded to the edge of the mattress where he sat down and began washing his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shake of his head, Vince sat up. He had kept watch outside the DeLongpre\u0027s house last night until the rising of the sun had forced him to seek shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, his first waking thought was for Cara. Drawing on his preternatural power, he concentrated on her and after a moment, as if there was a tangible link between them, he knew she was at home and that she was thinking of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince smiled, pleased that he had apparently mastered a new vampire skill. If it wasn\u0027t just a fluke, it meant that he would always be able to find her. Thinking of what Brenna had said to him the night before, he decided maybe that wasn\u0027t such a good thing after all. If he was going to sever his ties with Cara, it would be better if the break was clean and permanent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn! How was he going to tell her the truth after all this time? Would she hate him for waiting so long,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eor simply for being what he was? And yet, why should she hate him? She loved her parents. He tried to tell himself there was no difference, but, of course, there was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a man who had resigned himself to spending the rest of his existence alone, he had fallen hard and fast. Damn and double damn. He never should have come back here. Nothing had changed. He couldn\u0027t just walk out on her without a word this time, not when he had promised her that he would see her today, even though that would probably be easier on both of them. He would see her tonight, he thought, and then he would never see her again. He shook his head, thinking he had promised himself the same thing only a short time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore softly, remembering how Cara had looked with that baby in her arms, the light in her eyes when she had talked about having a big family. Leaving her again would be like ripping the heart from his chest, but he loved her too much to ask her to give up a normal life and the family she longed for and deserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara stood in front of the bathroom mirror, brushing her hair. She had spent the day cleaning house, not that there was much to clean. Her parents were very tidy people. Still, dusting, vacuuming, mopping the floors, and washing her few dishes had kept her busy. Changing the sheets on her bed had made her think of Vince. It seemed like years since they had last made love. She had clutched her pillow to her chest, closed her eyes, and imagined that he was there with her, that his hands were caressing her, that his mouth was hungrily kissing her, that he was lowering her to the mattress, his body covering hers...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the midst of her daydream, he had called to say hello. Hearing his voice had put a smile on her face, a glow in her heart, and a flush of embarrassment on her cheeks. Thank goodness he couldn\u0027t read her mind! She smiled at the memory as she pulled the brush through her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My, my, what put that smile on your face?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara turned to see her mother standing in the doorway. \"Mom! You startled me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, dear. You\u0027re not planning to go out, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara nodded. \"Vince called a little while ago. He\u0027s picking me up in twenty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think that\u0027s a good idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just going over to Vince\u0027s for a few hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t the two of you stay here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara turned back to the mirror, a faint blush warming her cheeks. How could she tell her mother she wanted to be alone with Vince, that she wanted to curl up in his arms and stay there forever?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no words were necessary. \"I see,\" Brenna said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you heard from Dad?\" Cara asked, hoping to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but he\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just do. Cara, please don\u0027t go out tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, I\u0027ll be fine. Frank will...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frank was there when Anton kidnapped you, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you saying you think I\u0027m in danger with Vince?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not. Do I need to remind you that that creature is still out there, and so is Anton? Both of them are dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara bit down on the inside corner of her lower lip. Her mother was right, of course. As much as she wanted to be alone with Vince, going out suddenly seemed foolish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stay in my room if you and Vince want some time alone,\" Brenna offered, thinking it might be wise for her to be nearby. If Vince chose tonight to tell Cara the truth, her daughter might need consoling later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara blew out a sigh. \"All right, we\u0027ll stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelieved, Brenna gave her daughter a hug. \"Call me if you need me,\" she said, and left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara stared after her mother. What an odd thing to say, she thought, and then forgot all about it when she heard the doorbell ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurrying down the stairs, Cara looked through the peephole before opening the door, felt her heart somersault inside her breast when she saw Vince standing on the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she said breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi yourself. Are you ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t go. I promised my mom I\u0027d stay in tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? Why\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him as if he wasn\u0027t too bright. \"Hello? That creature is still out there, you know, and Mom seems to think Anton might be a threat, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince followed Cara into the living room, admiring the sway of her hips and the way the lamplight shone in the wealth of her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s probably right.\" He suspected the real reason Brenna wanted Cara to stay home was to keep the two of them from \"going any further.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara sat on the sofa, then looked up at him expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat beside her, drawn by her warmth, the glow in her eyes, the seductive smile playing over her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she have any idea how beautiful she was, or how hard it was for him to resist her? Even now, it was all he could do to keep from dragging her into his arms, brushing her hair away from her neck, and tasting the sweetness pulsing through her veins. She attracted him on so many levels-her beauty, her intelligence, her ready smile. With her, he felt whole, complete. Loved. He closed his eyes. How could he leave her? Even if he lived as long as Mara, he knew he would never again find anyone like Cara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vince? Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes to find her staring at him, her brow furrowed with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, darlin\u0027. How could anything be wrong when I\u0027m here with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe batted her eyelashes at him. \"Why, sir,\" she said in a mock Southern accent, \"you do say the sweetest things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, miss, are the most enchanting female I\u0027ve ever known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice moved over her like a velvet caress. \"Vince...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here, darlin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scooted closer, her eyelids fluttering down as his mouth found hers. In moments, she was lying on her side on the sofa, his body aligned with hers, their legs entwined. He kissed her as if he could never get enough, as if he needed her as much as the air he breathed, as if his very survival depended on her. It was a heady sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands caressed her with tender urgency and she drew him closer, reveling in the feel of his body pressed against hers. Heat unfurled deep within her, spreading outward, warming her, arousing her until the rest of the world fell away and there was only this man, this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe murmured his name, begging him to carry her upstairs, to make love to her all through the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, darlin\u0027,\" he replied, his voice ragged, \"I\u0027d like nothing better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s stopping you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not alone,\" he reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s go to your place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you promised your mother you\u0027d stay here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did, but...\" She pressed her face against his chest. \"I want you so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was tempting, but he wasn\u0027t about to put her life at risk. He wasn\u0027t afraid of Anton. He could destroy the weasel with a look, but he wasn\u0027t so sure about the creature inhabiting Anthony Loken\u0027s body. Vince blew out a sigh. Against mortals, he was nearly invincible. Against a creature raised from the dead... he didn\u0027t know, and he didn\u0027t intend to find out, not if it put Cara\u0027s life at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up at him, her lips swollen from his kisses, her breathing uneven. He could smell himself on her, smell her need, her desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Vince?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn! How could he refuse her when he wanted her as much as she wanted him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, he was tempted to pull her into his arms and carry her to his place, creature or no creature. After all, though she didn\u0027t know it, this was to be their last night together. Coward that he was, this time he was going to kiss her good-bye and walk out of her life forever. For a moment, his yearning warred with his good sense. In the end, his good sense won out. Leaving Cara again was going to be the hardest thing he had ever done, but she had no place in his world. He couldn\u0027t be certain that he would always be in control of his hunger or his lust, and if anything happened to her because of him, because of what he was...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering an oath, Vince sat up, his body aching with need. Keeping a tight rein on his desire, he took Cara into his arms again. With his fingertips, he stroked the soft curve of her cheek, the wealth of her hair, the sweet temptation of her lower lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know that I love you, don\u0027t you?\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than I\u0027ve ever loved anyone, or anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Vince... I love you, too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" He rained kisses on her cheeks, the tip of her nose, her forehead, the tempting swath of warm skin beneath her ear. The hunger rose within him, whispering for him to take her now, take it all, even as his desire urged him to bury himself in her sweetness one last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vince, let\u0027s go upstairs...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, love, he thought, if only I dared. But as much as he wanted her, needed her, he couldn\u0027t take her here, under her father\u0027s roof. He couldn\u0027t make love to her knowing he intended to leave her once again with no explanation, only this time it would be for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her and caressed her until her eyelids grew heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to bed, darlin\u0027,\" he said, lifting her to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to go,\" she murmured drowsily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I don\u0027t want to go,\" he said, \"but it\u0027s late and you\u0027re half asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not,\" she protested, smothering a yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince laughed softly. \"Go to bed, darlin\u0027, and dream of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sleepy sigh, she lifted her face for one more kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, my love,\" he whispered, though it wasn\u0027t good night, but good-bye. He held her close, knowing it was for the last time, and then he let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked out of the house, a great emptiness in his chest where his heart had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding behind the wheel of the Mustang, he backed out of the driveway, then headed for a deserted stretch of highway. Putting the pedal to the metal, he pushed the car as fast as it would go. He was doing the right thing and he knew it, but dammit, why did it have to be so hard and hurt so damn much? She was the best thing that had ever happened to him. He slammed his fist against the steering wheel. He had lost his humanity; he shouldn\u0027t have to lose the only woman he had ever loved, or would ever love, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he wasn\u0027t leaving town just yet. He would hang around until the creature was no longer a threat to Cara\u0027s safety, but he wouldn\u0027t see or speak to Cara again. It was for her own good, he told himself, and for his, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t have to like it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-35.html","bookId":2300,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM"}
