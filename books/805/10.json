{"id":8930,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX","content":"It was with many a sigh and much inward misgiving that the Reverend Marmaduke Peters ascended his pulpit steps in the little church of Durford and prepared to deliver his discourse to his flock on the morning of Sunday, September 15, in the year of grace, 1685.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Reverend Marmaduke was stout and placid in person, kind-hearted and nervously sensitive to a degree; and having as his aim in life the threefold longing to satisfy his superiors, to breed the best poultry in the country-side, and to live at peace with all men, he wondered what cruel humour of fate had placed him in such a hot-bed of rebellion as was the little village of Durford.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A while ago, with sorrow and amazement, he beheld his flock straying wilfully towards the abhorred wilderness of rebellion, but his doubts then lest possibly the rebellion might prove successful, forbade the cautious soul to use what influence he might have had in holding their allegiance firm to the king.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now, however, when the rebellion had failed, and the rebels had been scattered, the same caution forbade him to display openly the deep sympathy which his kind heart could not but feel for the sufferers, many of whom were personally dear to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Truly his was a delicate position, and the ingenuity with which hitherto he had maintained a neutral position, and in both his Sabbath discourses and his week-day intercourse with his flock had succeeded in ignoring the very existence of the rebellion, displayed an amount of thoughtfulness and steady perseverance which would have done justice to a nobler effort.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the most far-sighted prophet may be o\u0027erthrown by circumstances.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e During the few weeks in which Captain Protheroe and his men had occupied the village a severe and inexplicable malady had kept the worthy minister prisoner in his house, and had prevented any untoward collision between himself and these representatives of the Royal cause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With the withdrawal of the soldiery on the previous Wednesday, however, he had once again recovered full health and strength, and had resumed his duties.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the week was not out when, to his dismay, six troopers under the command of Corporal Crutch returned, and he received a polite but firm intimation from the corporal that as he himself proposed to attend the service on the morrow, a discourse upon the sinfulness of rebellion would be regarded by the authorities as a satisfactory proof of the preacher\u0027s loyalty and submission. The intimation was accompanied by a clear hint that the Reverend Marmaduke\u0027s loyalty was regarded in certain quarters as of a questionable quality.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Reverend Marmaduke was dumbfounded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In vain did he represent to the corporal that sermons could not be prepared on the instant, that a discourse worthy of such a theme would require days of careful thought and study; in vain did he endeavour by every device in his power to escape the ordeal thus set unexpectedly before him, but escape was impossible; for the worthy corporal, finding himself in a position of unquestioned authority, was once more minded to enjoy it to the full. He could not enter the pulpit himself, but he was resolved to cause such a discourse to be delivered as should bitterly condemn all rebels, and surround with a halo of glory his loyal, law-preserving self. A few judiciously suggested threats concerning the suspected disloyalty of the minister were sufficient; the worthy doctor recognised his helplessness and he submitted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not, however, until he ascended his pulpit on the morning of the Sabbath had he fully realised the enormity of the task he had undertaken.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Beneath him stretched row after row of benches, well filled with the parishioners who loved and trusted him, and the majority of whom had sent their best-beloved to aid the rebellion which he was to condemn. To his left sat Corporal Crutch, attended by two troopers, sitting as judges upon the loyalty and fervour of his discourse. While immediately below the pulpit sat \"the quality,\" as represented by Lady Cicely and Mistress Barbara Winslow, and when his glance fell upon the face of the latter, he knew that the ordeal before him was desperate indeed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had chosen for his text the words of the psalmist, \"Kings with their armies shall flee before Him,\" hoping that the allegorical allusion to Monmouth as a king might soothe the feelings of those who believed in their hero\u0027s title. The delivery of these words, applicable as they were to recent events, instantly aroused the attention of his hearers. The worthy preacher groaned inwardly; would they but sleep or allow their attention to wander, as was ordinarily the custom, all might yet be well; this unwonted interest was but another cruel jest of Fate. Barbara, after a sharp glance in the direction of the corporal, whose presence she had noted with surprise and anxiety, settled herself to follow the discourse with a defiant light in her dark eyes, and even Lady Cicely looked up with unusual interest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Reverend Marmaduke mopped his brow, sipped his glass of water, and sighed deeply. Then summoning all his resolution to the task, he plunged into his subject and wandered for some time among the ramifications of the history of the Israelites, until an impatient movement from Corporal Crutch warned him that it was inadvisable longer to delay the application of his text to current topics.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thereupon he fixed his glance resolutely upon the countenance of the corporal and burst forth into an eloquent reference to the triumph of the supporters of the Lord\u0027s Anointed, as represented by the king\u0027s troops in the late battle, and the downfall of his enemies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently he became uncomfortably aware that Lady Cicely Winslow was weeping silently into her kerchief, while many of his parishioners at the back of the building were giving vent more noisily to their grief. The faces of the men were dark with anger, and below him the figure of Mistress Barbara grew more and more erect, her head thrown back, her lips pressed tightly together, and her eyes flashing upon him glances of indignation and scorn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The preacher hastily diverted the flow of his discourse into a cautious condemnation of rebellion in general, but was again driven forward by the threatening glances of the corporal to particularise and condemn more thoroughly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now, however, he was interrupted by a sharp fit of coughing from Barbara, loud and aggressive, which ceased when he paused, and when he continued broke out with new vehemence. For full three minutes the struggle continued, till Cicely\u0027s whispered entreaties induced Barbara to allow the unfortunate preacher to proceed in peace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alas! his nerves were now unstrung, his thoughts hopelessly astray. Desperately he grasped at a last straw and sought to compromise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Truly, he protested, rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and rebels are ever to be abhorred. (This to soothe the corporal.) But had not many rebelled in ignorance, led astray by misrepresentations, by wolves in sheep\u0027s clothing, and for such there was not condemnation, but pity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This appeared to the worthy doctor an excellent position to adopt, and for the remainder of his discourse this position he maintained, endeavouring by appreciative references to the noble supporters of justice on the one hand, and by an attitude of tender consolation towards the rebels on the other, to satisfy both sections of his congregation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But to Mistress Barbara Winslow such a compromise appeared nothing short of direct insult. Condemnation as a rebel she could endure, but pity as an ignorant fool incapable of judging her own path, she felt was more than any maid should be called upon to accept in silence, and but for Cicely\u0027s restraining hand and entreating whispers she would have left the church. In deference to her cousin\u0027s feelings she remained, but her indignation was so apparent that the unfortunate pastor could not continue, and bringing his discourse to an abrupt and bewildered conclusion he withdrew from the pulpit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Barbara rose to leave the church she was a confirmed rebel. Hitherto she had taken but small interest in the great rising, except in so far as it concerned her brother, and had certainly been no ardent supporter of Monmouth, but the worthy doctor\u0027s discourse had aroused in her a keen feeling of anger and opposition.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now \u0027tis with a woman as with a stream; endeavour to resist or to direct her course with argument or reason, and the current of her actions will but flow the stronger in the ever-narrowing channel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara\u0027s first impulse was to waylay the Reverend Marmaduke in the churchyard, and there, outside the sacred edifice, pour forth upon his offending head the vials of her wrath. But discretion and a lengthened indulgence in the seclusion afforded by the vestry secured the peace-loving occupant from an encounter not wholly unanticipated. In ignorance of the exact nature of the events which had passed in the churchyard during the interval, but satisfied at last that his congregation had dispersed, he made his way to the safe haven of the rectory.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Disappointed of her intention, Barbara looked round in search of some other victim, but there appeared only the corporal, and she would not demean herself to bandy words with him. Throwing a disdainful glance in his direction, she swept haughtily down the grass-grown path to the lych-gate. Here she was perforce delayed. Her cousin had paused to speak a few words of hope and sympathy to an old woman whose only son lay in Taunton gaol, awaiting his fate, and as she waited Barbara glanced carelessly around her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the green near the church she noted a couple of mounted dragoons in charge of four spare troop-horses saddled and bridled, and a third in charge of a rough-looking cart. She noted these preparations for departure with satisfaction, and wondered what had been the reason for such a short and sudden visit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the crowd in the churchyard parted, and the corporal, followed by his two attendant troopers, came down the path to the gate, she was soon to be enlightened, however.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The corporal advanced and laying his hand on her shoulder, cried in a voice wherein pompous dignity and elation strove for the mastery:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mistress Barbara Winslow, I attaint you as a rebel, and arrest you in the name of his Majesty.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Too much astonished to speak, Barbara was conscious, however, of a murmur of anger and surprise from the crowd of villagers and of Cicely\u0027s voice enquiring sharply:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is the matter? What means this?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is no call to answer questions,\" replied the corporal pompously. \"But an ye must know, it means that this woman is attainted as a rebel, and I hold a warrant for her arrest, with orders to conduct her instantly to Taunton gaol to await trial.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But it is impossible! she is no rebel.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She is known to have sheltered rebels, many have been hanged for less,\" answered the corporal, with a sinister glance of triumph at his prisoner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yet surely it cannot be as ye say?\" cried Cicely helplessly. \"Taunton gaol! Why she is a woman, ye cannot. Nay, she is but a child. Oh! \u0027tis monstrous, monstrous.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No words, no words,\" cried the corporal fussily. \"You will learn, madame, that in such affairs of state, least said is soonest mended. Now, mistress,\" he continued roughly, turning to Barbara, \"we\u0027d best be moving.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But a growl of anger broke from the still lingering crowd, and Peter Drew, the blacksmith, sprang upon the low wall of the churchyard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, lads!\" he cried; \"they red-c?ats be vor ta?kin oor young Miztrez to Taunton gaol. Zhall her be ta?ken, lads? Zhall her go? Hey lads, we be vaive to one. Zhall her go, lads?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter was no orator, but eloquence was not needed. Love for Barbara, that old feudal love for their lord; resentment for the many acts of ill-treatment sustained at the hands of the troopers during their occupation of the village; and lastly, the spirit of revolt against injustice and opposition which lurks secretly in every heart, all combined to rouse his hearers to fury, and it needed no words of the smith to fan the flame.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They greeted Peter\u0027s harangue with a wild shout of triumph, and closed in round the corporal and his men with gestures which threatened every moment to develop into a fierce attack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara\u0027s face flushed and her eyes glittered with triumph. Wild projects flashed through her brain. To overpower the half-dozen troopers, then to fortify the Manor House, and hold it against all comers; to rally round her the many secret supporters of the late rebellion, to recall the exiles from Holland, and to succeed in establishing justice and the Protestant Religion, or die fighting for the Cause. Had not other women done as much! These men, she knew, would cheerfully fight to the death for her; the country was still full of malcontents; one failure could not be regarded as the death of the Cause. Hope was high, all things seemed possible. Who shall say what mad dreams passed through her thoughts during those few moments while she stood there, the centre of that enthusiastic mob?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But it was not to be. From out the crowd there pressed forward an old woman, who flung herself trembling at Barbara\u0027s feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Eh; Miztress Barbara, dearie,\" she cried, seizing her hand, \"don\u0027t-ee, don\u0027t-ee, then. A\u0027ll swing for it, for zure a wull if a faight. And zee there,\" pointing with her trembling hand at a tall stalwart fellow, prominent amongst the throng, \"thiccy\u0027s arl I\u0027ve left now. Three others have been ta?ken. If they ta?k un I maun die, for zure I maun. Don\u0027t-ee, now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Vor sha?me, mother,\" cried the lad referred to. \"Would ee have un ta?k the young Miztress to Taunton? Vor sha?me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the dreams had passed. Barbara\u0027s eyes were opened and she recognised the hopelessness of any resistance. She could not, she must not sacrifice these lives.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gently disengaging herself from the clinging hands of the old crone, she sprang on to the wall at Peter\u0027s side and caught his uplifted arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, no, friends!\" she urged; \"it won\u0027t do. We could not hope for more than a short-lived victory. She is right, there would be vengeance and ye would all swing for it. This fellow saith he hath the Royal Warrant for my arrest, an that be so I must e\u0027en go with him. Be assured they cannot harm me; I have done no wrong. Besides,\" she added proudly, \"I would not have them think me afeared to go. Peter, be silent. Nay, I thank you indeed, but there must be no resistance. Go home quietly. You women, look to your men folk. No harm shall come to you for my sake, and none must think I fear to go.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus she stood upon the wall, a bright figure in her dainty muslin gown, smiling down upon them, until with reluctance, and many incoherent mutterings, the crowd, somewhat reassured by her words, slowly dispersed. Then turning she addressed the corporal:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So that is ended. Now, an you will permit me first to return to the Manor House to collect some necessaries, I am ready to go with you to Taunton.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am rejoiced, mistress,\" he assured her pompously, \"that you have decided to submit peaceably to my orders.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aye, corporal,\" answered Barbara, with a smile at his perturbed countenance. \"I do not doubt but you are indeed rejoiced. But come, I must to the Manor House, to prepare for the journey. I presume you will allow me so much grace?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The escort will accompany you thither.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I had thought my submission had been proof enough of my good faith, but as you will,\" answered Barbara carelessly, passing through the gate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Barbara, I must with you to Taunton, indeed I must,\" pleaded Cicely, as she hastened after her cousin. \"\u0027Tis monstrous that you should go alone with these men.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thou, Cicely? Impossible! What could\u0027st thou do there? Where could\u0027st thou lodge? Not i\u0027 the gaol indeed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There be many kindly folk in the town who would house me, and they will perchance advise too what \u0027twere best to do for thee. There is good Mistress Lane, the wool-merchant\u0027s wife, I will seek her out. But go with you I must indeed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In truth, Cicely,\" answered Barbara with a quick sigh, \"I would fain have thee near, if \u0027twere only to teach myself the folly of my fears by laughing at thine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With a tyranny born of his newly acquired importance, Corporal Crutch refused to allow his prisoner more than a few minutes\u0027 preparation before her journey to Taunton, but having resigned herself to fate Barbara had no mind to delay, and in less than half an hour after their return to the house the two enforced travellers were ready for departure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara\u0027s resolution was by no means strengthened at sight of the ramshackle cart provided to convey her to Taunton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To what low estate our fortunes have fallen!\" she muttered with a wry face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rebels cannot expect to be treated like honest folk,\" remarked the Corporal complacently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Set a watch on thy tongue, Master Corporal,\" retorted she angrily. \"I am no rebel till I be proved such, therefore I warn thee \u0027twere best be more careful of thy words,\" and turning abruptly from the startled man she took her seat in the cart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For the first few miles of their journey each of the girls devoted all her efforts to the difficult task of cheering the other. Upon leaving the village and their friends behind them, some sense of the utter helplessness of her position filled Barbara\u0027s mind, and she was but a sorry comforter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But hers was not a nature to sigh long, and soon the fresh air, the bright sunshine, and the interest and amusement she found in watching her escort, had their effect. The result of this reaction from her former depression was a mood of high spirits and brighter hopes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In truth, Cicely,\" she broke out suddenly with a laugh, \"we are both fools. At worst \u0027tis but a matter of a night or two in gaol, where I doubt not I shall meet much good company; an interview with Lord Jeffreys (I would fain see him, they say he is a right handsome man, for all he has such a tongue); then perchance a fine, and so home. Why \u0027tis not worth a sigh. \u0027Tis but an adventure, and thou knowest I love such.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aye, Barbara, you speak truly,\" answered her companion, with a desperate attempt at cheerfulness. \"They would not dare to harm a woman. I make no doubt these tales of my Lord Jeffreys\u0027 punishment and—and of Lady Alice Lisle, are gross exaggerations.\" This last she added with a tentative air—Cicely longed for corroboration of that statement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At mention of Lady Lisle Barbara\u0027s face fell slightly, but she resolutely dismissed her fears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is not a doubt of it, sweet. Yet even an it were not so, they could prove nought against me. They have no testimony to show that we housed or aided either Rupert or Sir Peter.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is so,\" assented Cicely joyously. \"And in justice none could punish us for what is unproven.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh! Cicely, look at yon red-headed trooper, didst ever behold so scarlet a poll?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aye. And mark how he sits his horse. I wager he will be over its head ere he sees Taunton. Note his face when the creature pricks his ears; \u0027tis a very picture of terror.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Didst note the corporal as we passed trough the village?\" laughed Barbara. \"The poor fool feared an ambuscade at every corner, and well-nigh fell from his horse with fright when old Mother Gilkin\u0027s pot fell down as we reached her cottage. I hate the fellow, yet I cannot but laugh at his antics.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus for a while the two chattered bravely as they clattered and bumped along the rough country roads to Taunton. But as night drew on the sky became overcast with clouds, and a cold wind and drizzling rain added to the discomfort of the journey. Their conversation became more and more desultory, and finally ceased altogether.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Only once again did Barbara break the silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Cis,\" she asked with some slight hesitation, \"thinkest thou that Captain Protheroe knows aught of my arrest?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Knows aught!\" cried Cicely in astonishment. \"Why, Barbara, child, who else hath accused thee?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nay, nay; I will not believe that of him,\" answered Barbara stoutly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Believe what thou wilt, I tell thee it is the truth. Thinkest thou he would tamely endure to be duped as thou hast duped him, without some revenge? Oh! I tell thee as I have ever done, the fellow is to be mistrusted, and to take such revenge on thee were but his nature.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In truth, Cicely, you do not know him,\" pleaded Barbara. \"He is not—I would trust him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, Barbara! Hath the man bewitched thee that thou art so ready in his defence?\" cried Cicely, looking at her curiously. \"What hath he done to win such trust? Or dost thou deem, perchance, that thou hast bewitched him, and so bound him to thy cause? I\u0027 faith, coz, I warn thee, trust not too much to the power of thine eyes; all men be not so easily ensnared.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Barbara answered not, only sighed lightly and stared thoughtfully into the gathering darkness, her eyes wide with wonder and with doubt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The distance from Durford to Taunton is scarce twelve miles, and \u0027twas little past noon when they set out on their journey, but the progress of the cart was slow, owing to the bad roads.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A horse, too, cast a shoe, and they must needs stop at the next village to seek a smith. The escort halted more than once for refreshment, and in fine it was night before they reached their destination.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Perhaps the darkness was not without its compensation. At the cross roads were scenes ill-suited to a woman\u0027s eyes, traces of that wholesale butchery which for many weeks had devastated the fairest county of the West. Gaunt figures swinging in their chains from the sign-posts, tokens of the merciless punishment meted out to those even suspected of rebellion, had been no cheering welcome to such travellers as they.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they entered Taunton the streets were almost deserted, and the dwelling houses closed and in darkness, but the windows of the White Hart Inn, the headquarters of the royal troops, blazed with light, and the shouts of laughter and snatches of song from within indicated that the soldiery were holding revelry, heedless alike of the hallowedness of the Sabbath, of the misery of the townsfolk, and of the despair of hundreds of prisoners who lay awaiting their doom in the crowded gaols of the town.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the cavalcade passed before the Inn an officer lounged into the light of the doorway, and stared carelessly at the passing company. Barbara with a gasp of astonishment half rose to her feet, but Cicely\u0027s hand restrained her, and reluctantly she sank down beside her cousin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cart passed, leaving Captain Protheroe to continue his inspection of the night all unconscious of whom the vehicle conveyed.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1875/54234.html","bookId":805,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:50:35 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:50:35 AM"}
