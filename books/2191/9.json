Bill had said he was going to feed somewhere before we went, and as upset as the idea made me, I had to agree it made sense. He was right about how I\u0027d feel after my little informal vitamin supplement the night before, too. I felt super. I felt very strong, very alert, very quick-witted, and oddly enough, I also felt very pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would I wear for my own little interview with a vampire? I didn\u0027t want to look like I was trying to be sexy, but I didn\u0027t want to make a fool of myself by wearing a shapeless gunnysack, either. Blue jeans seemed to be the answer, as they so often are. I put on white sandals and a pale blue scoop-neck tee. I hadn\u0027t worn it since I\u0027d started seeing Bill because it exposed his fang marks. But Bill\u0027s \"ownership\" of me, I figured, could not be too strongly reinforced tonight. Remembering the cop last time checking my neck, I tucked a scarf in my purse. I thought again and added a silver necklace. I brushed my hair, which seemed at least three shades lighter, and let it ripple down my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when I was really having to struggle with picturing Bill with somebody else, he knocked. I opened the door and we stood looking at each other for a minute. His lips had more color than normal, so he\u0027d done it. I bit my own lips to keep from saying anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did change,\" he said first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think anyone else\u0027ll be able to tell?\" I hoped not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" He held out his hand, and we walked to his car. He opened my door, and I brushed by him to climb in. I stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asked, after a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I said, trying to keep my voice even, and I sat in the passenger\u0027s seat and stared straight ahead of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told myself I might as well be mad at the cow who had given him his hamburger. But somehow the simile just didn\u0027t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You smell different,\" I said after we\u0027d been on the highway for a few minutes. We drove for a few minutes in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you know how I will feel if Eric touches you,\" he told me. \"But I think I\u0027ll feel worse because Eric will enjoy touching you, and I didn\u0027t much enjoy my feeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured that wasn\u0027t totally, strictly, true: I know I always enjoy eating even if I\u0027m not served my favorite food. But I appreciated the sentiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t talk much. We were both worried about what was ahead of us. All too soon, we were parking at Fangtasia again, but this time in the back. As Bill held open the car door, I had to fight an impulse to cling to the seat and refuse to get out. Once I made myself emerge, I had another struggle involving my intense desire to hide behind Bill. I gave a kind of gasp, took his arm, and we walked to the door like we were going to a party we were anticipating with pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill looked down at me with approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fought an urge to scowl at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knocked on the metal door with FANGTASIA stencilled on it. We were in a service and delivery alley that ran behind all the stores in the little strip mall. There were several other cars parked back there, Eric\u0027s sporty red convertible among them. All the vehicles were high-priced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou won\u0027t find a vampire in a Ford Fiesta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill knocked, three quick, two spaced apart. The Secret Vampire Knock, I guess. Maybe I\u0027d get to learn the Secret Handshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beautiful blond vampire opened the door, the female who\u0027d been at the table with Eric when I\u0027d been to the bar before. She stood back without speaking to let us enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Bill had been human, he would have protested at how tightly I was holding his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female was in front of us more quickly than my eyes could follow, and I started. Bill wasn\u0027t surprised at all, naturally. She led us through a storeroom disconcertingly similar to Merlotte\u0027s and into a little corridor. We went through the door on our right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric was in the small room, his presence dominating it. Bill didn\u0027t exactly kneel to kiss his ring, but he did nod kind of deep. There was another vampire in the room, the bartender, Long Shadow; he was in fine form tonight, in a skinny-strap tee and weight-lifting pants, all in deep green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill, Sookie,\" Eric greeted us. \"Bill, you and Sookie know Long Shadow. Sookie, you remember Pam.\" Pam was the blond female. \"And this is Bruce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce was a human, the most frightened human I\u0027d ever seen. I had considerable sympathy with that. Middle-aged and paunchy, Bruce had thinning dark hair that curved in stiff waves across his scalp. He was jowly and smallmouthed. He was wearing a nice suit, beige, with a white shirt and a brown-and-navy patterned tie. He was sweating heavily. He was in a straight chair across the desk from Eric. Naturally, Eric was in the power chair. Pam and Long Shadow were standing against the wall across from Eric, by the door. Bill took his place beside them, but as I moved to join him, Eric spoke again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sookie, listen to Bruce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood staring at Bruce for a second, waiting for him to speak, until I understood what Eric meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What exactly am I listening for?\" I asked, knowing my voice was sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone has embezzled about sixty thousand dollars from us,\" Eric explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy, somebody had a death wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And rather than put all our human employees to death or torture, we thought perhaps you would look into their minds and tell us who it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said \"death or torture\" as calmly as I said, \"Bud or Old Milwaukee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what will you do?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric seemed surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever it is will give our money back,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis big blue eyes narrowed as he stared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, if we can produce proof of the crime, we\u0027ll turn the culprit over to the police,\" he said smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiar, liar, pants on fire. \"I\u0027ll make a deal, Eric,\" I said, not bothering to smile. Winsome did not count with Eric, and he was far from any desire to jump my bones. At the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, indulgently. \"What would that be, Sookie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you really do turn the guilty person over to the police, I\u0027ll do this for you again, whenever you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric cocked an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know I\u0027d probably have to anyway. But isn\u0027t it better if I come willing, if we have good faith with each other?\" I broke into a sweat. I could not believe I was bargaining with a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric actually seemed to be thinking that over. And suddenly, I was in his thoughts. He was thinking he could make me do what he wanted, anywhere, anytime, just by threatening Bill or some human I loved. But he wanted to mainstream, to keep as legal as he could, to keep his relations with humans aboveboard, or at least as aboveboard as vampireÂ¨Chuman dealings could be. He didn\u0027t want to kill anyone if he didn\u0027t have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like suddenly being plunged into a pit of snakes, cold snakes, lethal snakes. It was only a flash, a slice of his mind, sort of, but it left me facing a whole new reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" I said quickly, before he could see I\u0027d been inside his head, \"how sure are you that the thief is a human?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePam and Long Shadow both moved suddenly, but Eric flooded the room with his presence, commanding them to be still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s an interesting idea,\" he said. \"Pam and Long Shadow are my partners in this bar, and if none of the humans is guilty, I guess we\u0027ll have to look at them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a thought,\" I said meekly, and Eric looked at me with the glacial blue eyes of a being who hardly remembers what humanity was like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Start now, with this man,\" he commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt by Bruce\u0027s chair, trying to decide how to proceed. I\u0027d never tried to formalize something that was pretty chancy. Touching would help; direct contact clarified the transmission, so to speak. I took Bruce\u0027s hand, found that too personal (and too sweaty) and pushed back his coat cuff. I took hold of his wrist. I looked into his small eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t take the money, who took it, what crazy fool would put us in danger like this, what will Lillian do if they kill me, and Bobby and Heather, why did I work for vampires anyway, it\u0027s sheer greed, and I\u0027m paying for it, God I\u0027ll never work for these things again how can this crazy woman find out who took the fucking money why doesn\u0027t she let go of me what is she is she a vampire, too, or some kind of demon her eyes are so strange I should have found out earlier that the money was missing and found out who took it before I even said anything to Eric ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you take the money?\" I breathed, though I was sure I already knew the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Bruce groaned, sweat running down his face, and his thoughts, his reaction to the question, confirmed what I\u0027d heard already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know who did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood, turned to Eric, shook my head. \"Not this guy,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePam escorted poor Bruce out, brought the next interrogee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy subject was a barmaid, dressed in trailing black with lots of cleavage on display, her ragged strawberry blond hair straggling down her back. Of course, working at Fangtasia would be a dream job for a fang-banger, and this gal had the scars to prove she enjoyed her perks. She was confident enough to grin at Eric, foolish enough to take the wooden chair with some confidence, even crossing her legs like Sharon Stone - she hoped. She was surprised to see a strange vampire and a new woman in the room, and not pleased by my presence, though Bill made her lick her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, sweetie,\" she said to Eric, and I decided she must have no imagination at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ginger, answer this woman\u0027s questions,\" Eric said. His voice was like a stone wall, flat and implacable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinger seemed to understand for the first time that this was a time to be serious. She crossed her ankles this time, sat with her hands on the tops of her thighs, and assumed a stern face. \"Yes, master,\" she said, and I thought I was going to barf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved an imperious hand at me, as if to say, \"Begin, fellow vampire server.\" I reached down for her wrist, and she flung my hand away. \"Don\u0027t touch me,\" she said, almost hissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was such an extreme reaction that the vampires tensed up, and I could feel that crackling the air in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pam, hold Ginger still,\" Eric commanded, and Pam appeared silently behind Ginger\u0027s chair, leaning over and putting her hands on Ginger\u0027s upper arms. You could tell Ginger struggled some because her head moved around, but Pam held her upper body in a grip that kept the girl\u0027s body absolutely immobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers circled her wrist. \"Did you take the money?\" I asked, staring into Ginger\u0027s flat brown eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed, then, long and loud. She began to curse me. I listened to the chaos in the girl\u0027s tiny brain. It was like trying to walk over a bombed site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knows who did,\" I said to Eric. Ginger fell silent then, though she was sobbing. \"She can\u0027t say the name,\" I told the blond vampire. \"He has bitten her.\" I touched the scars on Ginger\u0027s neck as if that needed more illustration. \"It\u0027s some kind of compulsion,\" I reported, after I\u0027d tried again. \"She can\u0027t even picture him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hypnosis,\" Pam commented. Her proximity to the frightened girl had made Pam\u0027s fangs run out. \"A strong vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring in her closest friend,\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinger was shaking like a leaf by then with thoughts she was compelled not to think pressing her from their locked closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should she stay, or go?\" Pam asked me directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She should go. It\u0027ll only scare someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so into this, so into openly using my strange ability, that I didn\u0027t look at Bill. I felt that somehow if I looked at him, it would weaken me. I knew where he was, that he and Long Shadow had not moved since the questioning had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePam hauled the trembling Ginger away. I don\u0027t know what she did with the barmaid, but she came returned with another waitress in the same kind of clothes. This woman\u0027s name was Belinda, and she was older and wiser. Belinda had brown hair, glasses, and the sexiest pouting mouth I\u0027d ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belinda, what vampire has Ginger been seeing?\" Eric asked smoothly once Belinda was seated, and I was touching her. The waitress had enough sense to accept the process quietly, enough intelligence to realize she had to be honest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone that would have her,\" Belinda said bluntly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw an image in Belinda\u0027s mind, but she had to think the name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one from here?\" I asked suddenly, and then I had the name. My eyes sought his corner before I could open my mouth, and then he was on me, Long Shadow, vaulting over the chair holding Belinda to land on top of me as I crouched in front of her. I was bowled over backward into Eric\u0027s desk, and only my upflung arms saved me from his teeth sinking into my throat and ripping it out. He bit my forearm savagely, and I screamed; at least I tried to, but with so little air left from the impact it was more like an alarmed choking noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was only conscious of the heavy figure on top of me and the pain of my arm, my own fear. I hadn\u0027t been frightened that the Rats were going to kill me until almost too late, but I understood that to keep his name from leaving my lips, Long Shadow was ready to kill me instantly, and when I heard the awful noise and felt his body press even harder on me I didn\u0027t have any idea what it meant. I\u0027d been able to see his eyes over the top of my arm. They were wide, brown, crazed, icy. Suddenly they dulled and seemed to almost flatten. Blood gushed out of Long Shadow\u0027s mouth, bathing my arm. It flowed into my open mouth, and I gagged. His teeth relaxed, and his face fell in on itself. It began to wrinkle. His eyes turned into gelatinous pools. Handfuls of his thick black hair fell on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was shocked beyond moving. Hands gripped my shoulders and began pulling me out from under the decaying corpse. I pushed with my feet to scrabble back faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t an odor, but there was gunk, black and streaky, and the absolute horror and disgust of watching Long Shadow deconstruct with incredible speed. There was a stake sticking out of his back. Eric stood watching, as we all were, but he had a mallet in his hand. Bill was behind me, having pulled me out from under Long Shadow. Pam was standing by the door, her hand gripping Belinda\u0027s arm. The waitress looked as rocky as I must have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the gunk began to vanish in smoke. We all stood frozen until the last wisp was gone. The carpet had a kind of scorched mark on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to get you an area rug,\" I said, completely out of the blue. Honest to God, I couldn\u0027t stand the silence any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mouth is bloody,\" Eric said. All the vampires had fully extended fangs. They\u0027d gotten pretty excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He bled onto me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did any go down your throat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably. What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That remains to be seen,\" Pam said. Her voice was dark and husky. She was eyeing Belinda in a way that would have made me distinctly nervous, but Belinda seemed to be preening, incredibly. \"Usually,\" Pam went on, her eyes on Belinda\u0027s pouty lips, \"we drink from humans, not the other way around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric was looking at me with interest, the same kind of interest that Pam had in Belinda. \"How do things look to you now, Sookie?\" he asked in such a smooth voice you\u0027d never think he\u0027d just executed an old friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did things look to me now? Brighter. Sounds were clearer, and I could hear better. I wanted to turn and look at Bill, but I was scared to take my eyes off Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I guess Bill and me\u0027ll go now,\" I said, as if no other process was possible. \"I did that for you, Eric, and now we get to go. No retaliation for Ginger and Belinda and Bruce, okay? We agreed.\" I started toward the door with an assurance I was far from feeling. \"I\u0027ll just bet you need to go see how the bar is doing, huh? Who\u0027s mixing the drinks, tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We got a substitute,\" Eric said absently, his eyes never leaving my neck. \"You smell different, Sookie,\" he murmured, taking a step closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, remember now, Eric, we had a deal,\" I reminded him, my smile broad and tense, my voice snapping with good cheer. \"Bill and I are going home now, aren\u0027t we?\" I risked a glance behind me at Bill. My heart sank. His eyes were open wide, unblinking, his lips drawn back in a silent snarl to expose his extended fangs. His pupils were dilated enormously. He was staring at Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pam, get out of the way,\" I said, quietly but sharply. Once Pam was distracted from her own blood lust, she evaluated the situation in one glance. She swung open the office door and propelled Belinda through it, stood beside it to usher us out. \"Call Ginger,\" I suggested, and the sense of what I was saying penetrated Pam\u0027s fog of desire. \"Ginger,\" she called hoarsely, and the blond girl stumbled from a door down the hall. \"Eric wants you,\" Pam told her. Ginger\u0027s face lit up like she had a date with David Duchovny, and she was in the room and rubbing against Eric almost as fast as a vampire could have. As if he\u0027d woken from a spell, Eric looked down at Ginger when she ran her hands up his chest. As he bent to kiss her, Eric looked at me over her head. \"I\u0027ll see you again,\" he said, and I pulled Bill out the door as quick as a wink. Bill didn\u0027t want to go. It was like trying to tow a log. But once we were out in the hall he seemed to be a little more aware of the need to get out of there, and we hurried from Fangtasia and got into Bill\u0027s car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at myself. I was bloodstained and wrinkled, and I smelled funny. Yuck. I looked over at Bill to share my disgust with him, but he was looking at me in an unmistakable way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said forcefully. \"You start this car and get out of here before anything else happens, Bill Compton. I tell you flat, I\u0027m not in the mood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scooted across the seat toward me, his arms scooping me up before I could say anything else. Then his mouth was on mine, and after a second his tongue began licking the blood from my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was really scared. I was also really angry. I grabbed his ears and pulled his head away from mine using every ounce of strength I possessed, which happened to be more than I thought I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were still like caves with ghosts dwelling in their depths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill!\" I shrieked. I shook him. \"Snap out of it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, his personality seeped back into his eyes. He drew a shuddering sigh. He kissed me lightly on the lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, can we go home now?\" I asked, ashamed that my voice was so quavery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" he said, sounding none too steady himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that like sharks scenting blood?\" I asked, after a fifteen-minute silent drive that almost had us out of Shreveport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good analogy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t need to apologize. He\u0027d been doing what nature dictated, as least as natural as vampires got. He didn\u0027t bother to. I would kind of liked to have heard an apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, am I in trouble?\" I asked finally. It was two in the morning, and I found the question didn\u0027t bother me as much as it should have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric will hold you to your word,\" Bill said. \"As to whether he will leave you alone personally, I don\u0027t know. I wish...\" but his voice trailed off. It was the first time I\u0027d heard Bill wish for anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sixty thousand dollars isn\u0027t a lot of money to a vampire, surely,\" I observed. \"You all seem to have plenty of money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires rob their victims, of course,\" Bill said matter-of-factly. \"Early on, we take the money from the corpse. Later, when we\u0027re more experienced, we can exert enough control to persuade a human to give us money willingly, then forget it\u0027s been done. Some of us hire money managers, some of us go into real estate, some of us live on the interest from our investments. Eric and Pam went in together on the bar. Eric put up most of the money, Pam the rest. They had known Long Shadow for a hundred years, and they hired him to be bartender. He betrayed them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would he steal from them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must have had some venture he needed the capital for,\" Bill said absently. \"And he was in a mainstreaming position. He couldn\u0027t just go out and kill a bank manager after hypnotizing him and persuading the man to give him the money. So he took it from Eric.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t Eric have loaned it to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Long Shadow hadn\u0027t been too proud to ask, yes,\" Bill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had another long silence. Finally I said, \"I always think of vampires as smarter than humans, but they\u0027re not, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not always,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached the outskirts of Bon Temps, I asked Bill to drop me off at home. He looked sideways at me, but didn\u0027t say anything. Maybe vampires were smarter than humans, after all. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-until-dark-sookie-stackhouse-1/page-9.html","bookId":2191,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:17 PM"}
