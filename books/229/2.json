The class met on Tuesdays. It began after breakfast. The subject was The Meaning of Life. It was taught from experience.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo grades were given, but there were oral exams each week. You were expected to respond to questions, and you were expected to pose questions of your own. You were also required to perform physical tasks now and then, such as lifting the professor\u0027s head to a comfortable spot on the pillow or placing his glasses on the bridge of his nose. Kissing him good-bye earned you extra credit.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo books were required, yet many topics were covered, including love, work, community, family, aging, forgiveness, and, finally, death. The last lecture was brief, only a few words.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA funeral was held in lieu of graduation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlthough no final exam was given, you were expected to produce one long paper on what was learned. That paper is presented here.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe last class of my old professor\u0027s life had only one student.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI was the student.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is the late spring of 1979, a hot, sticky Saturday afternoon. Hundreds of us sit together, side by side, in rows of wooden folding chairs on the main campus lawn. We wear blue nylon robes. We listen impatiently to long speeches. When the ceremony is over, we throw our caps in the air, and we are officially graduated from college, the senior class of Brandeis University in the city of Waltham, Massachusetts. For many of us, the curtain has just come down on childhood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, I find Morrie Schwartz, my favorite professor, and introduce him to my parents. He is a small man who takes small steps, as if a strong wind could, at any time, whisk him up into the clouds. In his graduation day robe, he looks like a cross between a biblical prophet and a Christmas elf He has sparkling blue green eyes, thinning silver hair that spills onto his forehead, big ears, a triangular nose, and tufts of graying eyebrows. Although his teeth are crooked and his lower ones are slanted back-as if someone had once punched them in-when he smiles it\u0027s as if you\u0027d just told him the first joke on earth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe tells my parents how I took every class he taught. He tells them, \"You have a special boy here. \" Embarrassed, I look at my feet. Before we leave, I hand my professor a present, a tan briefcase with his initials on the front. I bought this the day before at a shopping mall. I didn\u0027t want to forget him. Maybe I didn\u0027t want him to forget me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Mitch, you are one of the good ones,\" he says, admiring the briefcase. Then he hugs me. I feel his thin arms around my back. I am taller than he is, and when he holds me, I feel awkward, older, as if I were the parent and he were the child. He asks if I will stay in touch, and without hesitation I say, \"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen he steps back, I see that he is crying.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/260/2453.html","bookId":229,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:23:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:23:50 AM"}
