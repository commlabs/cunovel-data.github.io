{"id":38341,"no":9,"title":"IX A LAND SHARK","content":"Reddy Sykes had drifted into Pellawa during the early weeks of summer. Though at first an anomaly in the little town, the citizens grew used to his presence. It was hard to define Sykes\u0027 business. He was not a lawyer, though he had a distinctly legal turn of mind. He had acquired the title of Commissioner. He began work in the village with a command of considerable capital. His most lucrative line was real estate. He bought and sold farms and manipulated the transfer of large acreage blocks. A few city shingles decorated his window but the great urban boom of the West was as yet on the verge and the subdivisional mania had not got properly under way. The ability of the new arrival in his selected field was so surprising and apparent that his presence in Pellawa was a poser to the shrewd minds of the plains. He could have made things hum in a bigger world.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Personally, Sykes was a character that invited scrutiny. He was comparatively young, still in the early thirties, possessing a full-blooded interest in life. His face was unusually hard for so young a man and wore an habitual calculating expression. He was a man of scheme and intrigue. His motion as he moved about was very like that of Reynard as he slunk through the night en route to Mr. Farmer\u0027s chicken coop. He lived by his wits, searching the trail closely for tracks of his prey. His nose was always in the wind. He was alert for the lucky cast of the die that should tumble fortune into his lap. Inventive and resourceful, his mind stored a great fund of premises. He could adopt and discard twenty viewpoints in as many minutes. The stolid, common-place farmers fought shy of Sykes, shunning his speciousness, afraid of a snare. They felt the unrelenting, unscrupulous thing in the man, though unable to detect it in his handsome face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Notwithstanding the diffidence of the farmers to enter into free commerce with the real estate agent he had become an accepted cog in the social wheel. He had made one powerful friend—Rob McClure. The two drew together like steel and magnet. The attraction fused into an implicit partnership from the very start. There was a reason for this, a matter on which Rob McClure was utterly in the dark. Only one person in the settlement had even surmised it. Reddy Sykes was dominated by the mightiest of human motives in his facile address at fostering a strong friendship with McClure. Ned Pullar alone understood that he was at once lured by the passion of love and urged by the fell ardour of hate. The object of his regard was Mary McClure. The object of his rancour, Ned himself. He had effected his purpose with McClure by an ingratiating cunning assisted by an unusual mutual attraction. His relations with Mary and Ned ran back into the cross currents of their university life. Of that again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sykes\u0027 friendship with McClure opened to him the McClure home. He availed himself of the hospitality in a wise and restrained use of the privilege. His reception had been cordial. The two women were only too glad to promote goodwill with a friend of Rob\u0027s. Helen McClure was always pleased to welcome the gentlemanly guest. Mary in her secret mind was very considerably perturbed, remembering certain advances made by Sykes in the past. She had turned him down on occasion and once had deservedly and effectually snubbed him. She was agreeably surprised, however, at his casual gallantries. He was courteous and companionable, but did not in the faintest degree press his attentions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sykes had been moving about his office studying closely certain realty maps of local townships. His search over, he sat down at his desk and picking up a letter read it carefully. This was the third perusal. He was pondering some undoubtedly alluring proposition. In his mouth he held an unlit cigar, rolling it around in unconscious habit, occasionally chewing off the end and throwing it away. Looking through the window out upon the street he saw something that brought sudden resolution into his eyes. Andy Bissett was dashing by with his team of blacks. He pulled up in front of a store and hurriedly tied his horses to a post. He was about to enter the store when Sykes hailed him. Andy walked over and entered the office.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How\u0027s the Valley Outfit?\" inquired Sykes pleasantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Laid up with a broken shaft,\" was the reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve been looking out for you to-day, Bissett,\" said Sykes affably, plunging into business. \"I want you to read this.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He handed over the letter he had just been reading.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This,\" said he, \"is a communication from a farmer in Northern Alberta who is anxious to get hold of a farm in this settlement. He owns a section and is willing to swap it for an improved half in the Pellawa district. The full description of the land is there. It is a big snap.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Andy read the letter rapidly then handed it back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have nothing I would care to exchange for that,\" said he quietly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How about the quarters you are renting to the Poles?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Andy shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not in the market.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Some of your friends might consider the proposition.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said Andy decidedly, \"I could not recommend the deal to any of my friends. Personally I do not like it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sykes looked up sharply with the Reynard-like movement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is an A-1 chance, a windfall for somebody.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It may be,\" agreed Andy dubiously. \"It seems to me unusual. Aside from that, however, it is not the snap it appears.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sykes\u0027 voice sounded a shade metallic as he said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How do you make it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Andy noted the change in tone but continued pleasantly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In the first place this land about Pellawa is simply wonderful. That other may be good. Then again there is a pretty fast movement up in this Valley land. We are expecting it to skyrocket. Things are promising hereabouts. I think it will be well to stick.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Still,\" objected Sykes, \"the difference in acreage is great. It covers all rise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That may be. Who can tell? That point would have to be settled by a personal visit to the Alberta farm.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sykes shifted his cigar impatiently, biting it viciously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How about Pullar?\" he queried carelessly. \"He might swap the homestead. He is young yet—just the age to pitch into a section of virgin land. Pullar\u0027s the man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You mean Ned?\" said Andy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ned would not consider the matter for a minute.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That land is his father\u0027s. Ned is manager and real head, but the land is still deeded to his father. Although the old man has desired to make all or any part over to the boy, Ned would not agree.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sykes seemed to muse on the matter a moment. Andy did not notice the cunning light flash into the other\u0027s eyes. His companion\u0027s quick mind had gathered something of great interest to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The fact is,\" said Andy deliberately, \"I would not recommend this to any friend of mine, as I have said.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly a resentful light burned in Sykes\u0027 eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you mean to say you will knock this deal?\" said he.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure,\" said Andy smiling. \"I\u0027ll knock it into a cocked hat if anybody appeals to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Say!\" said Sykes, the lash of sarcasm entering into his tone. \"You rubes carry some side, eh? A few of you little farmers think you can chin-up to Reddy Sykes. Bah!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned on his heel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With a cheerful \"Good-day!\" Andy took his departure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Looking at the figure crossing the street Sykes smiled sardonically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Much obliged, Bissett!\" was his muttered soliloquy. \"You were easy. Ha! It looks pretty good! Pretty good to me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Late that night McClure appeared in the office.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Anybody with you?\" inquired Sykes, looking up as he entered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No. I am alone,\" was the response. \"Took a skip in to get a line on business. Anything new?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For answer Sykes thrust the letter into his hand. McClure recognized the source instantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He has located another spot, I see.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sykes nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Looking up from the letter McClure ruminated for a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s good money in these transfers if we can get them going. That\u0027s where good fishing comes in.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tried Bissett to-day,\" observed Sykes ruefully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was no go?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Keep away from Bissett,\" was McClure\u0027s low counsel. \"There are easier prospects. If not we\u0027ll have to chuck it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Chuck nothing!\" was Sykes\u0027 incisive ejaculation. \"This community\u0027s full of suckers. There are droves of easy rubes hereabouts fairly howling, \u0027Come touch me up.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a moment McClure rubbed his chin reflectively. Sykes eyed him closely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know what you are hunting down,\" said he, looking McClure full in the eye. \"You\u0027re on just one trail these days. You are tracking the boss of the Valley Outfit.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McClure looked up surprised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I see I\u0027ve hit it,\" resumed Sykes with a laugh. \"Bissett put me next a little fact that has a whole barrelful of possibilities. He informs me that Pullar\u0027s three-quarter sections are all in the old man\u0027s name.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McClure shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t believe it. Ned\u0027s too good a head to stand for that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s a fact, just the same,\" maintained Sykes. \"Bissett told me all about it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What if it is?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I guess you know old Ed. Pullar. Thirsty old guy at times.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McClure laughed wisely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s the point,\" said Sykes in a whisper. \"We have an even chance of getting him there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McClure said nothing, but Sykes, watching him from the foxy crevices of his half-shut eyes, knew that he had probed a mighty impulse in his companion. The gloating of anticipated revenge looked out of Rob McClure\u0027s great eyes. He was roused from his baleful reverie by the voice of Sykes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That prospect pleases you, Rob,\" said he in a significant tone that drew the swift glance of McClure. \"And I am with you to the limit provided——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He paused and looked peculiarly at the other. McClure was puzzled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Provided,\" resumed Sykes, \"you do the same with me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have me guessing, Reddy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You do not know what I am driving at?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McClure shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then I\u0027ll set you right. For some years I have known the daughter of Rob McClure. All these years I have regarded her as the one thing desirable. That is why I am out among the rubes. She has never been more gracious than since my arrival here. You stand by me there and I\u0027m with you. You can do a lot.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The two men looked long into each other\u0027s eyes. Then McClure\u0027s gaze became abstract and far away. He was seeing something other than Sykes\u0027 glittering eyes. He saw Mary as she burst in upon him the day of his interview with Ned. He felt the soft touch of her cheek. Suddenly he was recalled to the issue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well?\" was the crisp challenge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go right in and win,\" said he with a strange smile. \"Do it right and I\u0027m agreeable. So far as I know you have a clear field. You can count on me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You think the field is open?\" said Sykes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There isn\u0027t a doubt. I know all about my girl.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sykes smiled and let it go at that. There was some information he could impart to this cocksure father but it would be more serviceable later. He reflected for a moment on the effect of the disclosure that Ned Pullar was very much in the field. Then he smiled again, conscious of holding a rather high hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McClure could see no untoward possibility and was satisfied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So they made the compact.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1890/54548.html","bookId":792,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:28:29 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:28:29 AM"}
