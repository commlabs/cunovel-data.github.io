He snorted his disgust. ‘A slave of the Tiste Edur, tell me, do you not know your own blood? We will tear you free, ghost-something you should have done for yourself long ago.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am unbound,’ came the hissing reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then I suppose you are safe enough from us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your blood is impure.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClip smiled in the darkness. ‘Yes, I am a cauldron of failures. Nerek, Letherii-even D’rhasilhani.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And Tiste Andii.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then greet me, brother.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRasping laughter. ‘He has sensed you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Was I sneaking up on them, ghost?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They have halted and now await.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good, but can they guess what I will say to them? Can you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are impertinent. You lack respect. You are about to come face to face with Silchas Ruin, the White Crow-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Will he bring word of his lost brother? No? I thought not.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother hiss of laughter. ‘Oddly enough, I believe you will fit right in with the ones you are about to meet.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac squinted into the gloom. She was tired. They all were after long days traversing the pass, with no end in sight. Silchas Ruin’s announcement that someone was approaching brought them all to a halt beside the sandy fringe of a stream, where insects rose in clouds to descend upon them. The horses snorted, tails flicking and hides rippling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dismounted a moment after Silchas Ruin, and followed him across the stream. Behind her the others remained where they were. Kettle slept in the arms of Udinaas, and he seemed disinclined to move lest he wake her. Fear Sengar slipped down from his horse but made no further move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding beside the albino Tiste Andii, Seren could now hear a strange swishing and clacking sound, whispering down over the tumbled rocks beyond. A moment later a tall, lean form appeared, silhouetted against grey stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smudge of deeper darkness flowed out from his side to hover before Silchas Ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Kin,’ said the wraith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A descendant of my followers, Wither?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh no, Silchas Ruin.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreath slowly hissed from the Tiste Andii. ‘My brother’s. They were this close?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young warrior drew closer, his pace almost sauntering. The tone of his skin was dusky, not much different from that of a Tiste Edur. He was twirling a chain in his right hand, the rings on each end blurring in the gloom. ‘Silchas Ruin,’ he said, ‘I greet you on behalf of the Onyx Order of Andara. It has been a long time since we last met a Tiste Andii not of our colony.’ The broad mouth quirked slightly. ‘You do not look at all as I had expected.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your words verge on insult,’ Silchas Ruin said. ‘Is this how the Onyx Order would greet me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young warrior shrugged, the chain snapping taut for a beat, then spinning out once more. ‘There are K’risnan wards on the trail ahead of you-traps and snares. Nor will you find what you seek in Bluerose, not the city itself nor Jasp nor Outbound.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How is it you know what I seek?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He said you would come, sooner or later.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrows rose. ‘Why, your brother. He didn’t arrive in time to prevent your getting taken down, nor the slaughter of your followers-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Did he avenge me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A moment,’ Seren Pedac cut in. ‘What is your name?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA white smile. ‘Clip. To answer you, Silchas Ruin, he was not inclined to murder all the Tiste Edur. Scabandari Bloodeye had been destroyed by Elder Gods. A curse was laid upon the lands west of here, denying even death’s release. The Edur were scattered, assailed by ice, retreating seas and terrible storms. In the immediate aftermath of the Omtose Phellack curse, their survival was at risk, and Rake left them to it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I do not recall my brother being so… merciful.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If our histories of that time are accurate,’ Clip said, ‘then he was rather preoccupied. The sundering of Kurald Emurlahn. Rumours of Osserc in the vicinity, a mercurial dalliance with Lady Envy, arguments and a shaky alliance with Kilmandaros, and then, finally, Silanah, the Eleint who emerged at his side from Emurlahn at the closing of the gate.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It seems much of that time is common knowledge among your Order,’ Silchas Ruin observed, his tone flat. ‘He stayed with you for a lengthy period, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He stays nowhere for very long,’ Clip replied, clearly amused by something. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-79.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
