He really did not expect this fellow to have taken half a step into the Dou Zong class within these past two years. Although Han Feng currently only had half a foot into the class, anyone knew that as long as one had half a foot in then one was already not very far from fully attaining that class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis half a foot would also allow Han Feng to far exceed an ordinary peak Dou Huang expert. Adding the collaboration with his ‘Sea Heart Flame’, it was likely that his fighting strength would be truly able to stand shoulder to shoulder with a true elite Dou Zong!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the great increase in Xiao Yan’s current strength, he still possessed quite a great pressure when faced with such a powerful fighting strength. A strength that could stand shoulder to shoulder with a Dou Zong was something that no one could easily underestimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“During these past two years, you are the first person who has caused me to completely reveal my strength.” The Dou Qi wings on Han Feng’s back slowly disappeared as Han Feng’s feet stepped in the air and spoke faintly to Xiao Yan. Remaining in the empty air without any support. This was something that only an elite Dou Zong could perform. At such a level, the sky would be just like flat land. One’s agility and one’s reaction would be increased by a couple of levels when fighting with others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan narrowed his eyes and stared at Han Feng who was suspended in the sky. He slowly exhaled and said, “You are merely someone who has half a foot in the Dou Zong class. Is it worth it for you to act so proud and arrogant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the very least, it is sufficient to finish you off… stubborn-mouthed ‘junior’!” Han Feng flipped his hand, and a cluster of substance-like majestic Dou Qi writhed unceasingly in his hand. The energy ripples that faintly seeped out caused the space around him to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that so…” Xiao Yan smiled coldly. The dark-green flame in his hand suddenly rose and was shrouded as they attacked. With a pull of his hand, the dark-green flame was split apart, and transformed into two clusters of flame. One was green and the other was invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s left hand held the green flame, while his right hand held the invisible flame. He raised his head and watched Han Feng, whose expression had turned extremely ugly at this moment. He smiled and said, “Weren’t you very uncertain as to how my ‘Heavenly Flame’ had changed? Now, you might be able to guess the answer, no?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fallen Heart Flame!” Han Feng’s eyes stared intently at the cluster of invisible flame in Xiao Yan’s right hand. His teeth gnashing voice carried threads of cold wind as each word spilled out from his mouth. Only at this moment was the doubt in his heart completely settled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You… you have actually refined the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’?” The majestic Dou Qi that lingered on Han Feng’s body writhed intensely, much like the interior of his heart. A moment later, a furious and disbelieving voice was finally emitted from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Congratulations, you have guessed correctly…” Xiao Yan raised his brows and spoke mockingly toward Han Feng whose face was as dark and solemn as the sky before a storm. The dark solemn expression on Han Feng’s face began showing the trend of evolving into a much more ferocious state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How unexpected. It is really unexpected that did the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’ not kill you, but also allowed you to achieve a great deal! That jade-green flame of yours is actually the merger of the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’ and the ‘Fallen Heart Flame’. No wonder… No wonder it has the ability to divide my ‘Sea Heart Flame’!” Han Feng’s dark, solemn voice carried a powerful pressuring Dou Qi as it enveloped Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ‘Flame Mantra’ is really a good thing. Hee hee. You have once again allowed me to recognize its value. Therefore, I will use all means, fair or foul to obtain it!” Han Feng’s hands danced wildly as a craziness faintly appeared on his face. “However, so what if you possess two kinds of ‘Heavenly Flames’? Do you possess the ability to perfectly control their strength? My strength far surpasses yours. As long as I defeat you, the ‘Flame Mantra’, ‘Green Lotus Core Flame’, ‘Fallen Heart Flame’, all of them will be mine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lunatic… I’m afraid that you don’t have that ability.” An arc was lifted on the corner of Xiao Yan’s mouth. A ridiculing smile appeared within his eyes as he shook his head slightly. He slowly raised his right hand and aimed at Han Feng. The invisible flame immediately began to ripple…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe body of the crazy faced Han Feng not far away suddenly trembled as the ripple of the invisible flame became increasingly intense. The majestic Dou Qi on his body swiftly became chaotic. It finally slowly recovered after a couple of blinks. He held his chest, and his gaze looked at Xiao Yan in a dark and gloomy manner, “Summoning Heart Flame?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe special effect that gave one the greatest headache was something that Han Feng was also quite afraid of. No one dared to ignore that Heart Flame which no one could sense. After all, the interior of one’s body was ultimately the weakest and most important part of oneself. If one were to receive a slight injury within it, it was likely that it would result in the entire person’s condition taking a blow. Hence, Han Feng swiftly maneuvered a large amount of Dou Qi to suppress it the moment it appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan smiled as he witnessed the majestic Dou Qi on Han Feng’s body become dimmer and paler than before. It appeared that the naughty Heart Flame had caused Han Feng to spend quite a great amount of effort to suppress. In this way, Han Feng’s fighting ability would be reduced somewhat while he was splitting his attention on two things. This was extremely good news for Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to cause me harm by relying on this little Heart Flame?” Han Feng’s face was gloomy and cold as he watched Xiao Yan. The cluster of surging Dou Qi on his hand was also swiftly activated. The powerful energy ripple seeped out at an increasing pace. From the looks of it, this cluster of surging Dou Qi was an extremely strong attack which he brewed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan also sensed this increasingly wild, violently Dou Qi cluster. He immediately clenched his fist and a suction force surged out, sucking that Heavy Xuan Ruler, that was wrapped in dark-green flame suspended in mid-air, into his hand. He let out a deep breath, and the Dou Qi within his body was also being wildly extracted at this moment!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Dou Qi in Xiao Yan’s body unceasingly pouring into the Heavy Xuan Ruler, the dark-black ruler’s body gradually turned into a jade-green color. Moreover, the temperature on it was repeatedly rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pouring in of the Dou Qi continued until a certain moment before it finally came to a sudden stop. At this moment, the Heavy Xuan Ruler was already like an emerald ruler, appearing extremely beautiful. However, the energy that seeped out of this ruler trembled slightly, causing the surrounding air to become hazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan raised his head to observe Han Feng in the distance as he held the ruler’s hilt tightly with both hands. A moment later, a cluster of surging Dou Qi had already unleashed an eye-piercing intense glow that was just like a small scale sun that no one dared to look directly at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little bastard, go and die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHan Feng’s eyes stared intently at the cluster of sun-like Dou Qi in his hand. A moment later, he suddenly raised his head. His face was covered with a savage insanity. With a brutal cry, the cluster of majestic sun-like Dou Qi shot explosively toward Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Radiance Seal!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn eye-piercing light drew across the sky. The light faintly revealed a large palm that appeared to be a sun falling from the sky as it carried a frightening energy that caused one’s hairs to stand on end!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Flame Splitting Tsunami!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emerald-like Heavy Xuan Ruler was lifted high above Xiao Yan’s head. An instant later, both of his arms suddenly hacked down with great force. A hundred-foot-long emerald energy glow shot out explosively from the tip of the ruler. That stance was as though it wanted to split the ground. Its momentum was frightening!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two extremely frightening energies zoomed through the sky like lightning. Finally, they became like two meteorites as they collided violently together in front of a countless number of shocked gazes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment they came into contact, a frighteningly loud rolling-thunder energy ripple began to set off an energy wave that spread all over the sky, much like a stormy sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire area became silent at this moment. The roiling energy waves were earth-shattering. Even the sun that floated high in the sky was shadowed by this energy at this very moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe energy remained in a stalemate for nearly ten minutes before it gradually scattered. Countless numbers of people within the city were still completely silent. Each and every one of their faces contained some shock. If the explosion from those two attacks had occurred in the city, it was likely that this Feng City would have turned into flat land in an extremely short period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis kind of terrifying destructive force was something that one could rarely see even during a decisive battle between peak Dou Huangs!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe energy wave that spread through the sky slowly scattered. The two bodies in the sky were slowly revealed. Han Feng was at this moment a little better. Although his hair was messy and his breathing was somewhat hurried, he did not suffer much damage from the backlash of the energy. On the other hand, Xiao Yan’s face was pale-white. Even his breathing had become much weaker during this collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the gap between the two, it was obvious that Han Feng had the upper hand in this collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha ha, junior, it looks like your strength is not as tough as your mouth. Why? Your Dou Qi is exhausted just as we were starting? Looks like this senior has really overestimated you!” Han Feng was also startled when he saw Xiao Yan’s pale face. He could not help but laugh out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan glanced at Han Feng who was laughing out loud with a lifted head. The corner of his mouth was curled slightly as he spoke with a faint smile, “Isn’t it a little too early for you to be so happy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHan Feng revealed a cold laugh filled with disdain when he heard that Xiao Yan still had a tough mouth. He could clearly sense that the other party’s aura had become much weaker. Clearly, he had received quite serious injuries from the collision earlier. However, the smile on his face had not continued for long when it stiffened following Xiao Yan’s subsequent action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan slowly raised his hand in the distance. A deep-green glow gradually surfaced on his hand. An instant later, the green glow flew out, and a flawless emerald fire lotus the size of a palm immediately surfaced on Xiao Yan’s palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hu… creating this thing still exhausts so much Dou Qi.” Xiao Yan stared at the emerald-like fire lotus before raising his head and laughing at Han Feng, who had suddenly stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior, you will suffer the same loss twice. Looks like I have also overestimated you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, Han Feng’s expression had instantly turned extremely ugly!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-638\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-640\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-639","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM"}
