Yet Fleet HQ had a large atrium in their lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this was the Covenant equivalent—multiplied a hundredfold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn spied a band of translucent material set into a far wall, glistening. \"Is that the window to the repair bays, Cortana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then at least we know the way out. And the structure we need to enter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One o\u0027clock,\" she said. \"The one with the carved columns. It is the most direct route to the reactor chambers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn moved out of the hole and hugged the nearby wall. The shadows in the bright daylight would do a decent job of camou- flaging them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Blue Team. Get oriented. . . as much as you can. Our target is the columned building at one o\u0027clock. I make it to be a three-hundred-meter sprint across open ground. We\u0027ll make a break for it. Unless anyone has a better plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda emerged, looked around, and said, \"Permission to post on the rooftop and provide cover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it,\" John said. \"Let me know when you\u0027re in position and ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda retrieved a padded grappling hook and rope from her pack, twirled it, and tossed it up and over the adjacent roof. She tugged it once, it caught, and then she quickly ascended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remaining Spartans joined John in the shadows. He shouldered his battle rifle and thumbed the safety off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda\u0027s acknowledgment light winked once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn tensed and ran. It took him three strides to build to his top-speed sprint. His adrenaline spiked and it made his blood burn. He felt time slow, his perception running at an overclocked pace. He focused on speed—putting one foot in front of the other. His boots dug into cobblestones, crushed rock, and sent a fine spray of gravel behind him. He saw three obstacles in his path: a group of startled Grunts. He slammed the butt of his rifle into the nearest one, and crushed its skull. The dead Grunt spun end over end and landed in a heap. He heard squawks and shouts around him but didn\u0027t stop to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was on the stairs of the building, worn-smooth stone steps that he bounded up five at a time. John saw three friendly con- tacts behind him on his motion tracker ... and at the periphery of its range a solid mass of enemy contacts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re good so far,\" Linda reported. \"There are Elites, but they\u0027re unarmed. No, wait. A Hunter pair is advancing on your position. Stand by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quartet of shots split the air like thunderclaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Threat neutralized,\" Linda said. \"The rest of them are scattering. Banshees approaching. I\u0027m moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn cleared the stairs and skidded to a halt on the threshold of the temple. The interior was cold; external temperature read- ings were near freezing. Light filtered in through stained-glass windows in the ceiling—tinged lavender, cobalt, and turquoise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree rows of giant columns made of blue-black basalt ran the length of the thirty-meter-long rectangular structure, casting long shadows. It was a good place for an ambush. He set his back against one of the pillars and swept the entrance, covering his team as they entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cortana, update on station security?\" John said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are dozens of reports on the security channels. I\u0027ve got them covered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother Cortana voice broke in over the first: \"Also be ad- vised, Chief, that there are ceremonial guards in this temple—a race we have not encountered before. Roughly translated from Covenant dialects, they are called \u0027Brutes.\u0027 They shouldn\u0027t be a significant threat or they would have been used in previous mili- tary situations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn wasn\u0027t so sure of that. The name Brute didn\u0027t sound promising. He also wondered why there now seemed to be more than one Cortana in the station\u0027s system—but that could wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to keep moving now that they had revealed their posi- tion. He waved Blue Team forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn took point. He moved up to the next column in the mid- dle of the building. Fred and Will stepped over to the columns on either side behind John. Grace had their backs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a flicker on his motion sensor—just ahead. It vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn held up his hand. Blue Team froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis motion detector was clear ... but there had been some- thing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out a frag grenade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe transient contact was back—a shadow moved around the same pillar John used for cover. It moved faster than an Elite— as fast as John.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fired his rifle point blank into the shadowy silhouette. It didn\u0027t slow—it only howled with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill and Fred fired three-round bursts from their rifles into the creature. It flinched with each bullet impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree explosions detonated behind them. Grace\u0027s biosign alarm shrilled and flashed on John\u0027s heads-up display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ambush!\" Will cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature Cortana had called a \"Brute\" stepped from the shadows and faced John. It was taller than an Elite—wider and more muscular. Its mouth was lined with razor-sharp teeth, and its red eyes burned with hate. Its blue-gray skin was riddled with bullet holes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brute tackled John, knocking his weapon from his grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with his MJOLNIR armor, John was not as strong as the alien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt pounded on him with bare fists—broke through his shield- ing, grabbed his neck, and squeezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed flashes played across John\u0027s vision. He began to black out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1751 hours, September 13,2552 (revised date, Military Calendar)\\Aboard Covenant battle station Unyielding Hierophant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn struggled and tried to pry the hands from his throat. The tendons in the Brute\u0027s forearms were solid bands of steel—and the creature was so determined to rip John\u0027s head off that a full clip from a rifle into its chest hadn\u0027t even slowed it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, John felt another explosion thunder though the stone floor, followed by the staccato rattle of rifle fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue Team was busy with another threat. He was on his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn blinked. The darkness dimming the edge of his vision wouldn\u0027t clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn watched his shield bar flicker and sluggishly recharge. If it built up enough repulsive force, he might have a chance to wriggle out of the Brute\u0027s grasp. If he tried too quickly, though, the Brute wouldn\u0027t lose its grip and could pound his shield flat again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brute bellowed, and globules of spittle spattered onto the Chief\u0027s visor. It leaned closer, screwing its massive hands tighter around his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn\u0027s vision narrowed. His windpipe swelled, and he gagged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShields were at one quarter charge. It\u0027d have to be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn had been in similar death-grip holds before—endless hours of training on the wrestling mats with his teammates and martial arts specialists provided by Chief Mendez. There were ways to escape a larger, stronger opponent. And there were al- ways countermoves to those escapes. And countermoves to those counters. It was like a game of chess, except the pieces were arms ERIC NYLUNO 313 and legs, torque and your center of mass ... and most impor- tantly your mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his knees to his chest, and tucked his torso toward his pelvis at the same time. He twisted ninety degrees and shot out both legs and arms, and uncoiled his body. The maneuver was called \"shrimping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn\u0027s head slipped from the Brute\u0027s grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used the monster\u0027s split second of disorientation to scram- ble onto its back. John brought his elbow down on the base of the Brute\u0027s neck. He swept out its elbow, wrenched the joint around, and pushed it as far as it would go—far past the point any hu- man\u0027s or Elite\u0027s would have snapped. John scissored his legs wide and pushed against the floor, leveraging his body to keep the Brute pinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt growled and pushed itself and John up with its one free arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You. Don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn still clutched a frag grenade in his left hand. He flicked the arming pin—reached around and under, and thrust it into the Brute\u0027s belt—then withdrew, sweeping out its one arm holding them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brute dropped onto the floor and screamed with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grenade detonated. It lifted them both a meter, and they landed again ... this time accompanied by a wet, pulpy smack as the Brute\u0027s dead hulk slammed into the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief rolled off and sprang to his feet and looked for Blue Team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large pillars blocked his view, but he saw on his motion tracker that Fred was behind a pillar down and to John\u0027s left, and Will behind the pillar to the right. There was no tag indicating Grace\u0027s location. There were, however, blurry motion contacts beyond the wide arched entrance to the temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was one other thing—neither Will nor Fred checked John\u0027s status over the COM. That silence meant trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn fumbled for his fiber-optic probe, but it had been lost in the scuffle with the Brute. He eased around the basalt pillar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace lay face-first on the floor, five meters from the temple en- trance. A puddle of hydrostatic gel and blood spread across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn clicked the COM once, a status query.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant he did this, two Brutes wheeled from their cover on either side of the entrance archway. They held rifles with large-caliber muzzles and padded stocks, fixed with razor-edged blades. One of the Brutes saw John, aimed, and fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn darted back behind the basalt pillar; he saw the flash and thunder of a grenade launched from the weapon—heard two more rounds fired immediately after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first grenade impacted on the opposite side of the pillar and exploded. The overpressure rattled his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief turned and dived, hoping to get behind the next stone column before— —the second and third grenades impacted and detonated on the pillar he had stood behind a split second before. The solid stone crumbled into fist-sized chunks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe skidded and scrambled for cover as the upper part of that column collapsed, raining stones that shattered the floor... and would have crushed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for engaging these Brutes in a direct assault. John wasn\u0027t up for another round of wrestling, either. Not with the clock ticking. Not with every Covenant on this station about to tear them to pieces. Complicating all this was the enemy\u0027s appar- ent ability to locate them when they used the COM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat only left one tactical option: run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t going to leave Grace behind, though. Not until he knew for certain she was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe removed his backpack and took out one of his two Lotus antitank mines. The disk was a quarter meter across with spikes set along the rim to stabilize it when buried. He set the detona- tion selector to countdown mode, seven seconds. He then slid around the edge of the column.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw the mine with a flick of his wrist. It spun in a wide arc across the temple hall and embedded into the wall just over the entrance archway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo seconds until it blew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn clicked on his COM and said: \"Fire in the hole!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brutes again wheeled around from their cover and lev- eled their deadly grenade launchers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lotus mine detonated—it was a flash and an instant of fire. The temple opening and Brutes vanished, replaced by a cloud of dust and a cascade of stones that fell from the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne gray arm remained exposed under the rubble, still flexing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn moved up. The entrance was sealed. They were safe for a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knelt next to Grace. Her biosigns had flatlined. He tried to roll her upright—but there was no need. The detonations he had heard while wrestling the first Brute had been three of their high-velocity grenades... which had blown Grace\u0027s midsection apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred and Will emerged from their cover. John looked at mem and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn opened the tiny access panel on Grace\u0027s armor power pack and entered the fail-safe code. They still had a mission to finish, which meant they couldn\u0027t carry her out; it would slow them down too much. They wouldn\u0027t be leaving her for the Covenant either, though. Her armor\u0027s tiny fusion reactor would overload and burn everything within a ten-meter radius— Grace\u0027s funeral pyre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s move,\" John said. \"Cortana, which way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Proceed into the temple thirty meters. Turn right. There will be a sealed doorway, an access hatch for Engineers. I will open it and lock it behind you. Hurry. I\u0027m encountering increased resistance from the station\u0027s AIs. While I have their security COM channels blocked, word of intruders is speeding via private COMs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a curious echo to her voice. Maybe it was feedback from the Covenant triangulating on their signals. Or maybe there was some other effect at work. What had she warned him about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnforeseen complications using a copy of a copy of Cortana?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger that,\" he said and waved Fred and Will forward. He took one last look at Grace, then marched quickly and silently ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no more motion contacts in the temple. The Chief, however, saw Grunts and Jackals, Elites and Hunters in murals painted on the walls. In the shadows and stained-glass filtered light, those pictures seemed to move. They genuflected to some- thing farther ahead. The Chief wished he had more time to take a full video record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue Team moved thirty meters and turned to face a section of the wall. It parted. The passage could have fit two Engineers side by side, but John had to crouch and turn sideways to pass. Will and Fred followed; Cortana sealed the door behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued until the narrow passage turned ninety de- grees and dropped straight down. Will attached a rope and they rappelled down a hundred meters, landing on a platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn overlooked a cavern hewn from rough stone that arched up ninety meters and vanished into the shadows in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive hundred twelve fusion reactors that looked like flatted spiral seashells filled the space, stacked in rows and columns eight deep. Each was the size of a Pelican dropship and thrummed with power, casting off waves of wavering heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe open areas between the reactors were a tangle of plasma conduits and alive with swarms of thousands of buoyant Engi- neers as they tended the machinery. Faint wispy borealis com- prised of escaped plasma swirled, whipped into a luminous froth by the intense magnetic vortices within the chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a tremendous feat of engineering. It was as if the sta- tion\u0027s builders had hewn this from a seed asteroid and built the rest of the installation around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill pointed across the room to three Jackals who walked along a catwalk. Blue Team held position and didn\u0027t move. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-42.html","bookId":1635,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM"}
