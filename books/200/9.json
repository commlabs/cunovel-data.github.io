His learning is extensive, and yet he does not render his name famous by any particular thing.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master heard the observation, and said to his disciples, “What shall I practice? Shall I practice charioteering, or shall I practice archery? I will practice charioteering.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “The linen cap is that prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose the common practice.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere were four things from which the Master was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master was put in fear in K’wang.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “After the death of King Wan, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal! should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of K’wang do to me?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, “May we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his ability!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTsze-kung said, “Certainly Heaven has endowed him unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is various.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master heard of the conversation and said, “Does the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition was low, and I acquired my ability in many things, but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability. Lao said, “The Master said, ‘Having no official employment, I acquired many arts.’”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “Am I indeed possessed of knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth from one end to the other, and exhaust it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “The Fang bird does not come; the river sends forth no map:-it is all over with me!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Master saw a person in a mourning dress, or any one with the cap and upper and lower garments of full dress, or a blind person, on observing them approaching, though they were younger than himself, he would rise up, and if he had to pass by them, he would do so hastily.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYen Yuan, in admiration of the Master’s doctrines, sighed and said, “I looked up to them, and they seemed to become more high; I tried to penetrate them, and they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, and suddenly they seemed to be behind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“The Master, by orderly method, skillfully leads men on. He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the restraints of propriety.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“When I wish to give over the study of his doctrines, I cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the disciples to act as ministers to him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDuring a remission of his illness, he said, “Long has the conduct of Yu been deceitful! By pretending to have ministers when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I impose upon Heaven?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I die upon the road?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTsze-kung said, “There is a beautiful gem here. Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a good price and sell it?” The Master said, “Sell it! Sell it! But I would wait for one to offer the price.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master was wishing to go and live among the nine wild tribes of the east.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSome one said, “They are rude. How can you do such a thing?” The Master said, “If a superior man dwelt among them, what rudeness would there be?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “I returned from Wei to Lu, and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal songs and Praise songs all found their proper places.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “Abroad, to serve the high ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one’s father and elder brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one’s self; and not to be overcome of wine:-which one of these things do I attain to?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master standing by a stream, said, “It passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “The prosecution of learning may be compared to what may happen in raising a mound. If there want but one basket of earth to complete the work, and I stop, the stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful is thrown at a time, the advancing with it my own going forward.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “Never flagging when I set forth anything to him;-ah! that is Hui.” The Master said of Yen Yuan, “Alas! I saw his constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “There are cases in which the blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are cases where it flowers but fruit is not subsequently produced!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “A youth is to be regarded with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being regarded with respect.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “Can men refuse to assent to the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Have no friends not equal to yourself. When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “The commander of the forces of a large state may be carried off, but the will of even a common man cannot be taken from him.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “Dressed himself in a tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-ah! it is Yu who is equal to this!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-what can he do but what is good!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the ode, when the Master said, “Those things are by no means sufficient to constitute perfect excellence.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “When the year becomes cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last to lose their leaves.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “The wise are free from perplexities; the virtuous from anxiety; and the bold from fear.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “There are some with whom we may study in common, but we shall find them unable to go along with us to principles. Perhaps we may go on with them to principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events along with us.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Master said, “It is the want of thought about it. How is it distant?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/602/482.html","bookId":200,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 6:44:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 6:44:35 AM"}
