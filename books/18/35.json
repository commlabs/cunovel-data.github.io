I apologi — I mean I should have been more precise. But I don\u0027t know exactly what I meant.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sit back up. No need to lie down while we\u0027re talking.\" Jonas, who had already been stretched out on the bed when the question came to his mind, sat back up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I guess I do think about it occasionally,\" The Giver said. \"I think about my own release when I\u0027m in an awful lot of pain. I wish I could put in a request for it, sometimes. But I\u0027m not permitted to do that until the new Receiver is trained.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Me,\" Jonas said in a dejected voice. He was not looking forward to the end of the training, when he would become the new Receiver. It was clear to him what a terribly difficult and lonely life it was, despite the honor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can\u0027t request release either,\" Jonas pointed out. \"It was in my rules.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver laughed harshly. \"I know that. They hammered out those rules after the failure ten years ago.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jonas had heard again and again now, reference to the previous failure. But he still did not know what had happened ten years before. \"Giver,\" he said, \"tell me what happened. Please.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver shrugged. \"On the surface, it was quite simple. A Receiver-to-be was selected, the way you were. The selection went smoothly enough. The Ceremony was held, and the selection was made. The crowd cheered, as they did for you. The new Receiver was puzzled and a little frightened, as you were.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My parents told me it was a female.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jonas thought of his favorite female, Fiona, and shivered. He wouldn\u0027t want his gentle friend to suffer the way he had, taking on the memories. \"What was she like?\" he asked The Giver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver looked sad, thinking about it. \"She was a remarkable young woman. Very self-possessed and serene. Intelligent, eager to learn.\" He shook his head and drew a deep breath. \"You know, Jonas, when she came to me in this room, when she presented herself to begin her training — \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jonas interrupted him with a question. \"Can you tell me her name? My parents said that it wasn\u0027t to be spoken again in the community. But couldn\u0027t you say it just to me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver hesitated painfully, as if saying the name aloud might be excruciating. \"Her name was Rosemary,\" he told Jonas, finally.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rosemary. I like that name.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver went on. \"When she came to me for the first time, she sat there in the chair where you sat on your first day. She was eager and excited and a little scared. We talked. I tried to explain things as well as I could.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The way you did to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver chuckled ruefully. \"The explanations are difficult. The whole thing is so beyond one\u0027s experience. But I tried. And she listened carefully. Her eyes were very luminous, I remember.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked up suddenly. \"Jonas, I gave you a memory that I told you was my favorite. I still have a shred of it left. The room, with the family, and grandparents?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jonas nodded. Of course he remembered. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It had that wonderful feeling with it. You told me it was love.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You can understand, then, that that\u0027s what I felt for Rosemary,\" The Giver explained. \"I loved her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I feel it for you, too,\" he added.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What happened to her?\" Jonas asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Her training began. She received well, as you do. She was so enthusiastic. So delighted to experience new things. I remember her laughter...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His voice faltered and trailed off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What happened?\" Jonas asked again, after a moment. \"Please tell me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver closed his eyes. \"It broke my heart, Jonas, to transfer pain to her. But it was my job. It was what I had to do, the way I\u0027ve had to do it to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The room was silent. Jonas waited. Finally The Giver continued.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Five weeks. That was all. I gave her happy memories: a ride on a merry-go-round; a kitten to play with; a picnic. Sometimes I chose one just because I knew it would make her laugh, and I so treasured the sound of that laughter in this room that had always been so silent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But she was like you, Jonas. She wanted to experience everything. She knew that it was her responsibility. And so she asked me for more difficult memories.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jonas held his breath for a moment. \"You didn\u0027t give her war, did you? Not after just five weeks?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver shook his head and sighed. \"No. And I didn\u0027t give her physical pain. But I gave her loneliness. And I gave her loss. I transferred a memory of a child taken from its parents. That was the first one. She appeared stunned at its end.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jonas swallowed. Rosemary, and her laughter, had begun to seem real to him, and he pictured her looking up from the bed of memories, shocked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver continued. \"I backed off, gave her more little delights. But everything changed, once she knew about pain. I could see it in her eyes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She wasn\u0027t brave enough?\" Jonas suggested.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver didn\u0027t respond to the question. \"She insisted that I continue, that I not spare her. She said it was her duty. And I knew, of course, that she was correct.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I couldn\u0027t bring myself to inflict physical pain on her. But I gave her anguish of many kinds. Poverty, and hunger, and terror.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I had to, Jonas. It was my job. And she had been chosen.\" The Giver looked at him imploringly. Jonas stroked his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Finally one afternoon, we finished for the day. It had been a hard session. I tried to finish — as I do with you — by transferring something happy and cheerful. But the times of laughter were gone by then. She stood up very silently, frowning, as if she were making a decision. Then she came over to me and put her arms around me. She kissed my cheek.\" As Jonas watched, The Giver stroked his own cheek, recalling the touch of Rosemary\u0027s lips ten years before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She left here that day, left this room, and did not go back to her dwelling. I was notified by the Speaker that she had gone directly to the Chief Elder and asked to be released.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But it\u0027s against the rules! The Receiver-in-training can\u0027t apply for rel — \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s in your rules, Jonas. But it wasn\u0027t in hers. She asked for release, and they had to give it to her. I never saw her again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So that was the failure, Jonas thought. It was obvious that it saddened The Giver very deeply. But it didn\u0027t seem such a terrible thing, after all. And he, Jonas, would never have done it — never have requested release, no matter how difficult his training became. The Giver needed a successor, and he had been chosen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A thought occurred to Jonas. Rosemary had been released very early in her training. What if something happened to him, Jonas? He had a whole year\u0027s worth of memories now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Giver,\" he asked, \"I can\u0027t request release, I know that. But what if something happened: an accident? What if I fell into the river like the little Four, Caleb, did? Well, that doesn\u0027t make sense because I\u0027m a good swimmer. But what if I couldn\u0027t swim, and fell into the river and was lost? Then there wouldn\u0027t be a new Receiver, but you would already have given away an awful lot of important memories, so even though they would select a new Receiver, the memories would be gone except for the shreds that you have left of them? And then what if — \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He started to laugh, suddenly. \"I sound like my sister, Lily,\" he said, amused at himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver looked at him gravely. \"You just stay away from the river, my friend,\" he said. \"The community lost Rosemary after five weeks and it was a disaster for them. I don\u0027t know what the community would do if they lost you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why was it a disaster?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think I mentioned to you once,\" The Giver reminded him, \"that when she was gone, the memories came back to the people. If you were to be lost in the river, Jonas, your memories would not be lost with you. Memories are forever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rosemary had only those five weeks\u0027 worth, and most of them were good ones. But there were those few terrible memories, the ones that had overwhelmed her. For a while they overwhelmed the community. All those feelings! They\u0027d never experienced that before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was so devastated by my own grief at her loss, and my own feeling of failure, that I didn\u0027t even try to help them through it. I was angry, too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver was quiet for a moment, obviously thinking. \"You know,\" he said, finally, \"if they lost you, with all the training you\u0027ve had now, they\u0027d have all those memories again themselves.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jonas made a face. \"They\u0027d hate that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They certainly would. They wouldn\u0027t know how to deal with it at all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The only way I deal with it is by having you there to help me,\" Jonas pointed out with a sigh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver nodded. \"I suppose,\" he said slowly, \"that I could — \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You could what?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Giver was still deep in thought. After a moment, he said, \"If you floated off in the river, I suppose I could help the whole community the way I\u0027ve helped you. It\u0027s an interesting concept. I need to think about it some more. Maybe we\u0027ll talk about it again sometime. But not now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re a good swimmer, Jonas. But stay away from the river.\" He laughed a little, but the laughter was not lighthearted. His thoughts seemed to be elsewhere, and his eyes were very troubled.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/1208/36347.html","bookId":18,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:26:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:26:04 AM"}
