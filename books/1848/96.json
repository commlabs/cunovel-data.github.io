That proves it,\" her father shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny felt Lord Hastings take her arm, but she jerked it away. \"No, please, listen to me,\" she cried, her gaze riveted on the drumming pulse in Royce\u0027s cheek and the glittering violence in his eyes. \"Listen to me,\" she begged him. \"I did say that to my father. I\u0027d forgotten I said it because—\" her head jerked to her father, \"because you wouldn\u0027t hear of it. But I never, never agreed to any plan to wed him first, and then flee to a convent. Tell him,\" she cried. \"Tell him I never agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jennifer,\" her father said, looking at her with bitterness and contempt, \"You agreed when you begged me to let you go to Belkirk. I merely chose a safer, more distant abbey for you. There was never any doubt in my mind that you would have to first abide by our king\u0027s command that you wed the swine. You knew that, too. That is why I originally refused your request.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked from her father\u0027s accusing face to Royce\u0027s granite one, and she knew a feeling of panicked defeat that surpassed anything she\u0027d ever felt. Turning, she picked up her skirts and began walking slowly toward the dais as if in a nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her, Lord Hastings cleared his throat and said to her father and Royce, \" \u0027Twould seem this has been a case of grave misunderstandings between all the parties. If you will be so kind as to provide us with lodgings for the night in the gatehouse, Claymore, we\u0027ll depart in the morn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooted feet hit the stone floor as everyone filed out. Jenny was nearly at the top of the steps when shouts and a bellow from her father made her blood freeze: \"BASTARD! You\u0027ve killed him! I\u0027ll kill—\" The sound of Jenny\u0027s thundering heart drowned out everything as she turned and started running down the stairs. As she raced past the table, she saw men bending over something near the door, and Royce, her father, and Malcolm being held at sword point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the men huddled near the door slowly stood up and stepped back…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam was lying on the floor with a dagger hilt protruding from his chest, a pool of blood spreading out around him. Jenny\u0027s scream split the air as she raced to the prone figure. \"William!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrowing herself down beside him, moaning his name, she felt wildly for a pulse, but there was none, and her hands rushed over his arms and his face. \"William, oh, please—\" she cried brokenly, imploring him not to be dead. \"William, please don\u0027t! William—\" Jenny\u0027s eyes riveted on the dagger, on the figure of a wolf etched in its hilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arrest the bastard!\" her father shouted behind her, trying to lunge at Royce while being restrained by the king\u0027s man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Hastings said sharply, \"Your son\u0027s dagger is on the floor. He must have drawn it. There\u0027s no arrest to be made. Unhand Claymore,\" he snapped at his men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce came to stand beside her, \"Jenny—\" he began tautly, but she whirled on her heels like a dervish, and when she came up in a crouch, she held William\u0027s dagger in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You killed him!\" she hissed, her eyes alive with pain and tears and fury as she slowly straightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Royce did not underestimate her ability or her intent. With his eyes riveted to hers, he watched for the moment when she would strike. \"Drop the dagger,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised it higher, aimed at his heart, and cried, \"You killed my brother.\" The dagger flashed through the air, and Royce caught her wrist in a vice grip, twisting the dagger free and sending it spinning to the floor, but even then, he had all he could do to restrain her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWild with grief and pain, she launched herself at him, striking at his chest with her fists when he jerked her tightly against him. \"You devil!\" she screamed hysterically as they carried her brother out. \"Devil, devil, devil!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me!\" Royce ordered tautly, grabbing her wrists. The eyes she raised to his were sparkling with hatred and glazed with tears she could not shed. \"I told him to stay behind if he wanted to talk to you.\" Royce let go of her wrists as he finished harshly, \"When I started to turn back to take him upstairs, he was reaching for his dagger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s hand crashed into the side of his face as she slapped him with all her strength. \"Liar!\" she hissed, her chest heaving. \"You wanted vengeance because you believed I conspired with my father! I saw it on your face. You wanted vengeance and you killed the first person who got in your way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tell you, he drew his dagger!\" Royce bit out, but instead of calming her, that enraged her—and with good reason: \"I drew a dagger on you, too,\" she cried furiously, \"but you took it away as easily as a child\u0027s toy! William was half your size, but you didn\u0027t take his away, you murdered him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jennifer—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re an animal!\" she whispered, looking at him as if he was obscene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite-faced with guilt and remorse, Royce tried once more to convince her. \"I swear to you on my word, I—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your word!\" she hissed contemptuously. \"The last time you gave me your word \u0027twas that you\u0027d not harm my family!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer second slap crashed against his cheek with enough force to snap his head sideways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let her go, and when the door to her chamber slammed, Royce walked over to the fire. Propping his booted foot on a log, he hooked his thumbs into the back of his belt and stared down into the flames, while doubts about her brother\u0027s intent began to hammer at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had happened so quickly; William had been close behind him as Royce stood near the door watching his uninvited guests depart. From the corner of his eye, Royce had glimpsed a dagger sliding out of its sheath, and his reaction had been instinctive. Had there been time to think—or had William not been so damned close to his back—he would have reacted with less instinct and more caution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, however, in retrospect, he remembered perfectly well that he\u0027d sized the young man up before inviting him to remain to see Jenny, and that he\u0027d thought him nonaggressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting his hand, Royce pressed his thumb and forefinger against the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes, but he could not shut out the truth: either his original instincts about William not posing a threat had been wrong, or else he\u0027d just slain a young man who\u0027d been drawing his dagger merely as a precaution in case Royce was tricking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce\u0027s doubt erupted into almost unbearable guilt. He\u0027d been judging men and the danger they represented to him for thirteen years, and he\u0027d never been wrong. Tonight he\u0027d judged William harmless. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-96.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM"}
