I did not know —’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ She’d have no reason to tell you, would she?’ Kallor looked round. ‘She was virtually a prisoner here – they even sent her handmaids away. Arrived as a stranger, and as a stranger you were determined to keep her. Is it any wonder she fled this shit-bucket? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaradegar’s sword hissed free .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKallor looked over at the Weaponsmith, and grinned, and whatever Haradegar saw in the High King’s eyes stole his courage – oh, shame upon shame, Kadagar! Were these your first wounds? I think now that they were .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High King faced Krin once more. ‘I promised her, and so I am here. Krin Ne Fant, your grandmother Serap, of the Issgin line, is dead .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrin slowly settled back on the throne, but he now looked shrunken, withering in that bonewood cage. ‘What – what happened? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKallor grunted. ‘What happened? I just told you. She died. Is that not enough? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ No .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging, the High King said, ‘Poison. By her own hand. I found her at dawn on the first day of the Season of Flies, cold and still on the throne I made for her with my own hands. Krin Ne Fant, I am her murderer .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember the silence that followed. I remember how dry my mouth was, and how I could not look anywhere but at this terrible, grey man who stood as one without fear, yet spoke words inviting violence .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Fant was shaking his head. ‘If … you said “by her own hand ”—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile turned into a snarl. ‘Do you truly believe suicide belongs solely to the one taking his or her own life? All that rot about selfishness and self-hatred? The lies we tell ourselves to absolve us of all blame, of all the roles that we played in that wretched death?’ He raised one chain-clad hand, pointed a finger first at Krin and then with a sweeping gesture at all who stood in the throne room. ‘You all had your parts to play in her death. The doors you kept locked. The loyal servants and friends you took from her. Your ill-disguised whispers behind her back or when she stepped into a room. But I have not come to avow vengeance on her behalf. How can I? The freshest blood of guilt is the pool I now stand in. I could not love her enough. I can never love enough .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ I killed her. One drop of poison each day, for a thousand years .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ By her wishes, I return to Saranas. By her wishes, I bring you this.’ And then he drew from beneath his grey cloak a bedraggled rag doll. Flung it so that it slid to the foot of the dais .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in that time word had travelled out, and now standing inside the doors, twenty paces behind Kallor, stood your father’s mother. Serap’s daughter .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Kallor know she was there? Listening to his words? Would it have changed anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ She was making this for her daughter,’ Kallor said, ‘and took it with her when she fled. Unfinished. In fact, little more than knotted cloth and wool. And so it remained, for all the centuries I knew and loved her. I surmise,’ he added, ‘she found it again by accident. And decided it needed … finishing. On the dawn when I found her, it was settled into her lap like a newborn child .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, Krin’s mother made a wounded sound and sank to her knees. Her servants rushed close .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling once more, Kallor unstrapped his weapon harness and let it fall to the tiled floor. The clash rang hollow in the chamber. ‘My words are done. I am the killer of Serap, and I await your kiss of righteous vengeance.’ And then he crossed his arms and waited .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do I remember this now, Kadagar? Of course, for all the miserable tragedy of that moment, was it not what came next that truly filled my chest with ashes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrin, his hand lifted, fingers pressed against temple, not even looking up as he gestured with his other hand. And whispered. ‘Go, Kallor. Just … go .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how then I finally understood the High King’s smile. Not a thing of pleasure. No, this was the smile of a man who wanted to die .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did we do? We denied him .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember how he reached down to collect his sword, how he turned away, his back to the throne and the man seated upon it, and walked out. I saw him walk past the huddle of retainers and the woman kneeling in their midst, and he paused, looked down at her .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he said anything then, we did not hear it. If he uttered soft words, none within range ever spoke of them. And then he was walking onward, out and beyond their sight .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour years later you swore that you would never sire a child. That all the Liosan would be your children, come the day you ascended to the throne. And I might have laughed, too blind to the future awaiting us all these centuries later. I might have wounded you, as children often do . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-221.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
