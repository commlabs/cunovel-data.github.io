{"id":8395,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. UNEXPECTED HONORS.","content":"\u0026nbsp;The next morning at breakfast, Professor Riccabocca handed Philip a copy of the Wilkesville Daily Bulletin. Pointing to a paragraph on the editorial page, he said, in a tone of pride and satisfaction: \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Read that, Mr. de Gray.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It ran thus:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We congratulate the citizens of Wilkesville on the remarkable entertainment which they will have an opportunity of enjoying this evening at the Music Hall. Professor Lorenzo Riccabocca, whose fame as an elocutionist and dramatic reader has made his name a household word throughout Europe and America, will give some of his choice recitals and personations, assisted by Philip de Gray, the wonderful boy-musician, whose talent as a violin-player has been greeted with rapturous applause in all parts of the United States. It is universally acknowledged that no one of his age has ever equaled him. He, as well as Professor Riccabocca, will give but a limited series of entertainments in this country, having received flattering inducements to cross the Atlantic, and appear professionally in London, Paris, and the chief cities of the Continent. Fifty cents is the pitiful sum for which our citizens will have it put in their power to hear this wonderful combination of talent. This secures a reserved seat.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Philip read this notice with increasing amazement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What do you think of that, Mr. de Gray?” asked the professor gleefully. “Won\u0027t that make Wilkesville open its eyes, eh?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It has made me open my eyes, professor,” said Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ha, ha!” said the professor, appearing amused.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How soon are we to sail for Europe?” asked Philip, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When Queen Victoria sends our passage-money,” answered Riccabocca, laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I see that your name is a household word in Europe. Were you ever there?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Never.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then how can that be?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. de Gray, your performances have been greeted with applause in all parts of the United States. How do you explain that?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t pretend to explain it. I wasn\u0027t aware that my name had ever been heard of a hundred miles from here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It has not, but it will be. I have only been predicting a little. The paragraph isn\u0027t true now, but it will be some time, if we live and prosper.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But I don\u0027t like to be looked upon as a humbug, professor,” said Philip uneasily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You won\u0027t be. You are really a fine player, or I wouldn\u0027t consent to appear with you. The name of Riccabocca, Mr. de Gray, I may truthfully say, is well known. I have appeared in the leading cities of America. They were particularly enthusiastic in Chicago,” he added pensively. “I wish I could find a paragraph from one of their leading papers, comparing my rendering of the soliloquy in \u0027Hamlet\u0027 to Edwin Booth\u0027s, rather to the disadvantage of that tragedian.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I would like to read the notice,” said Philip, who had very strong doubts as to whether such a paragraph had ever appeared in print.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You shall see it. It will turn up somewhere. I laid it aside carefully, for I confess, Mr. de Gray, it gratified me much. I have only one thing to regret: I should myself have gone on the stage, and essayed leading tragic roles. It may not be too late now. What do you think?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can tell better after I have heard you, professor,” answered Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “True, you can. Mr. de Gray,” continued the professor, lowering his voice, “notice how much attention we are receiving from the guests at the tables. They have doubtless read the notice of our evening entertainment.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Philip looked round the room, which was of good size, and contained some thirty or more guests, and he saw that the professor was right.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He met several curious glances, some fair ladies expressing interest as well as curiosity, and his face flushed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Gratifying, isn\u0027t it?” said the professor, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I don\u0027t think it is,” answered our hero.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why not?” demanded Professor Riccabocca, appearing amazed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If all were true, it might be,” replied Philip. “As it is, I feel like a humbug.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Humbug pays in this world,” said the professor cheerfully. “By the way, there\u0027s another little paragraph to which I will call your attention.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Philip read this additional item:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We understand that Professor Riecabocca and Mr. Philip de Gray have received a cable despatch from the Prince of Wales, inviting them to instruct his sons in elocution and music, at a very liberal salary. They have this proposal under consideration, though they are naturally rather reluctant to give up the plaudits of the public, even for so honorable a position.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Professor Riccabocca,” said Philip, considerably annoyed by this audacious invention, “you ought to have consulted me before publishing such a falsehood as this.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Falsehood, Mr. de Gray? Really I\u0027m shocked! Gentlemen don\u0027t use such words, or make such charges.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You don\u0027t mean to say it\u0027s true that we have received any such telegram?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; of course not.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then why didn\u0027t I use the right word?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s an innocent little fiction, my young friend—a fiction that will do no one any harm, but will cause us to be regarded with extraordinary interest.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here the thought occurred to Philip that he, the future instructor of British royalty, had only just escaped from a poorhouse, and it seemed to him so droll that he burst out laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why do you laugh, Mr. de Gray?” asked the professor, a little suspiciously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I was thinking of something amusing,” said Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, well! We shall have cause to laugh when we play this evening to a crowded house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope so. But, professor, if we keep together, you mustn\u0027t print any more such paragraphs about me. Of course, I am not responsible for what you say about yourself.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, it will be all right!” said Riccabocca. “What are you going to do with yourself?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall practice a little in my room, for I want to play well to-night. When I get tired I shall take a walk.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very wise—very judicious. I don\u0027t need to do it, being, as I may say, a veteran reader. I wouldn\u0027t rehearse if I were to play this evening before the president and all the distinguished men of the nation.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t feel so confident of myself,” said Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, of course not. By the way, can you lend me fifty cents, Mr. de Gray?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Certainly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t want to break a ten.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Professor Riccabocca didn\u0027t mention that the only ten he had was a ten-cent piece.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Slipping Philip\u0027s half-dollar into his vest pocket, he said carelessly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We\u0027ll take this into the account when we divide the proceeds of the entertainment.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well,” said Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He went up to his room and played for an hour or more, rehearsing the different pieces he had selected for the evening, and then, feeling the need of a little fresh air, he took a walk.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In different parts of the town he saw posters, on which his name was printed in large letters.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It seems almost like a joke!” he said to himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just then he heard his name called, and, looking up, he recognized a young fellow, of sixteen or thereabouts, who had formerly lived in Norton. It seemed pleasant to see a familiar face.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, Morris Lovett,” he exclaimed “I didn\u0027t know you were here!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; I\u0027m clerk in a store. Are you the one that is going to give an entertainment tonight?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” answered Philip, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I didn\u0027t know you were such a great player,” said Morris, regarding our hero with new respect.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had read the morning paper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nor I,” said Philip, laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Are you going to Europe soon?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It isn\u0027t decided yet!” Philip answered, laughing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish I had your chance.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Come and hear me this evening, at any rate,” said Philip. “Call at the hotel, at six o\u0027clock, and I\u0027ll give you a ticket.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ll be sure to come,” said Morris, well pleased.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015/83351.html","bookId":276,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:30:49 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:30:49 AM"}
