His behavior certainly wasn’t dispelling her suspicions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sutton?” Mrs. Mercer called again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sugary smell of maple syrup and waffles wafted up to Sutton’s bedroom, and Emma’s stomach rumbled with hunger. “Coming!” she yelled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a groggy yawn, Emma climbed from the bed and pulled an Arizona Cardinals sweatshirt from the top drawer of Sutton’s white wooden dresser. She yanked the $34.99\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprice tag from the collar and slid it over her neck. The shirt was probably a present from Cardinals über-fan Garrett, who’d been Sutton’s boyfriend when she died—now her ex-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboyfriend after Emma turned down his naked and willing body at Sutton’s eighteenth birthday party. There were some things sisters weren’t meant to share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh, yeah—like each other’s lives. But I guess it was a little too late for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSutton’s iPhone buzzed, and Emma checked the screen. A small photo of Ethan Landry appeared in the upper right-hand corner, which made Emma’s heart do a flip. ARE YOU OKAY? he wrote. I HEARD THERE WERE COPS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAT YOUR HOUSE LAST NIGHT AFTER I LEFT. WHAT HAPPENED?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma shut her eyes and tapped her fingers on the keys. LONG STORY. THAYER BROKE IN. SUPER SCARY. MAYBE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHE’S A SUSPECT. MEET UP LATER AT THE USUAL PLACE?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAREN’T YOU GROUNDED? Ethan wrote back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma ran her tongue over her teeth. She’d forgotten that the Mercers had grounded her for stealing the purse from Clique last week. They’d only let her go to Homecoming because she’d done well in school—a first for Sutton, apparently. I’LL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET OUT, she typed back. SEE YOU AFTER DINNER.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn right she’d figure out a way. Other than my murderer, Ethan was the only person who knew who Emma really was, and the two of them had joined forces to try to identify Sutton’s killer. He’d definitely want to know about Thayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn’t the only reason Emma wanted to see Ethan. After the hubbub of last night, she’d almost forgotten that they’d reconciled … and kissed. She was dying to see him and take things to the next level. Ethan was the first real almost-boyfriend Emma had ever had—she’d always been too shy and moved around too much to make an impression on guys—and she wanted it to work out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hoping that it would work out, too. At least one of us should find love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma descended the stairs for breakfast, pausing for a moment to stare at the family photographs in the Mercers’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehallway. Black-framed photos showed Laurel and Sutton with their arms wrapped around each other at Disneyland, sporting matching neon pink–trimmed ski goggles on a ski trip, and making a sand castle on a beautiful whitesand beach. A more recent one showed Sutton and her dad in front of a British racing-green Volvo, Sutton holding up the key gleefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked so happy. Carefree. She had a life Emma had always wanted. It was a question that plagued her constantly: Why had Sutton gotten such a wonderful family and friends, while Emma had spent thirteen years in foster homes? Sutton had been adopted into the Mercer family when she was a baby, while Emma had remained with their birth mother, Becky, until she was five. What if their roles had been reversed, and Emma had gotten to live with the Mercers? Would she be dead now? Or would she have lived Sutton’s life differently, appreciated her privileges?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed at the photos, zeroing in on a recent snapshot of the four of us on the front porch. My mom, my dad, Laurel, and I looked like the picture-perfect family, all of us dressed in white tees and blue jeans, the Tucson sun brilliant in the background. I blended so well with them, my blue eyes almost the same as those of my adoptive mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated when Emma assumed that I’d been a huge, ungrateful brat my whole life. Okay, so maybe I hadn’t appreciated my parents as much as I should have. And maybe I’d hurt some people with Lying Game pranks. But did I really deserve to die because of it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the kitchen, Mrs. Mercer poured golden batter into a waffle iron. Drake sat patiently beneath her, waiting for the batter to ooze over the sides and drip onto the floor. When Emma appeared in the doorway, Mrs. Mercer glanced up with a pinched, worried expression. The lines around her eyes stood out prominently, and there was just a hint of gray at her temples. The Mercer parents were a little older than most parents she knew, possibly in their late forties or early fifties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you all right?” Mrs. Mercer asked, shutting the top to the waffle iron and dropping the whisk back into the batter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, fine,” Emma murmured, even though she would have felt a lot better if she knew where Thayer was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud thwack sounded across the room, and Emma turned to see Laurel sitting at the kitchen table bringing a long silver knife down hard over a ripe, juicy pineapple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSutton’s sister caught her eye and grinned mockingly, holding out a dripping slice. “Some vitamin C?” she asked coldly. The knife glinted menacingly in her other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it had been a week or so ago, Emma would have been afraid of that knife—Laurel had been in her top-ten suspect list. But Laurel’s name had been cleared; she’d been at Nisha Banerjee’s sleepover the whole night of Sutton’s murder. There was no way she could have done it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma looked at the pineapple and made a face. “No thanks. Pineapple makes me gag.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Mercer, who was standing by the espresso machine, turned around and gave her a surprised look. “I thought you loved pineapple, Sutton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fist inside Emma tightened. Emma hadn’t been able to eat pineapple ever since she was ten, when her then foster mother, Shaina, had won a lifetime supply of canned pineapple after submitting a pineapple upside-down cake recipe to a cooking magazine. Emma had been forced to eat the slippery yellow chunks at every meal for six months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it would be Sutton’s favorite fruit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the little details about Sutton, things she couldn’t possibly know, that always tripped her up. Sutton’s dad seemed hyper-aware of her gaffes, too—he was the only one who’d questioned Emma about a tiny scar when she’d first arrived in Tucson, one that her twin didn’t have. And he always seemed to weigh whatever he had to say to her carefully, as though he were holding back, hiding something. It was like he knew something about his daughter was off, but couldn’t quite put his finger on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was before I found out it was really high in bad-for-you carbs,” Emma said quickly, thinking on her feet. It sounded like something Sutton would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteam erupted from the espresso maker on the soapstone countertop before anyone could respond. Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercer poured milk into four porcelain mugs printed with pictures of Great Danes much like Drake and then turned to Emma. “The police found Thayer last night. Picked him up trying to hitchhike on the on-ramp to Route 10.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s been arrested for unlawful entry,” Mrs. Mercer added, adding a stack of waffles to a plate. “But that’s not all. Apparently, he had a knife on him—a concealed weapon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma flinched. One wrong move last night and Thayer might have slashed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quinlan says he resisted arrest,” Mr. Mercer went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It sounds like he’s really in trouble. They’re holding him at the precinct for questioning about some other things, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike where he’s been all this time and why he’d worried his family for so long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma kept her expression neutral, but relief coursed through her body. At least Thayer was in jail, not roaming Tucson. She was safe—for now. With Thayer behind bars, she had time to get to the bottom of his mysterious relationship with Sutton… and to figure out if she really needed to be afraid of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we visit him in jail?” Laurel asked as she stuffed the spiky stem of the pineapple into the garbage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Mercer looked horrified. “Absolutely not.” He pointed at both his daughters. “I don’t want either of you visiting him. I know he was your friend, Laurel, but think about all the fights he got into on the soccer field. And if half those rumors about alcohol and drugs are true, then he’s a walking pharmacy. And what was he doing carrying a knife? Trouble follows that kid wherever he goes. I don’t want you mixed up with someone like that.” Laurel opened her mouth to protest, but Mrs. Mercer quickly interrupted. “Set the table, will you, sweetie?” There was a wobbly quality to her voice, as if she were trying to smooth everything over and sweep the mess under the rug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Mercer set a heaping mound of Belgian waffles on the kitchen table and filled everyone’s glass with orange juice. Mr. Mercer strolled over from the coffee machine and sat down at his regular seat. He sliced a piece of waffle and popped it into his mouth. His eyes were on Emma the whole time. “So. Is there a reason Thayer snuck into your bedroom?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNerves darted through Emma’s insides. Because he might have killed your real daughter? Because he wanted to make sure I wasn’t going around telling people about it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You weren’t expecting him, were you?” Mr. Mercer continued, his voice sharpening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma lowered her eyes and grabbed for a bottle of Mrs. Butterworth’s. “If I was expecting him, I wouldn’t have screamed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did you last see him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Mercer sighed exaggeratedly. “Before that.” These were questions Emma couldn’t answer. She looked around at the table. All three Mercers were staring at her, waiting for her response. Mr. Mercer looked irritated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Mercer was nervous. And Laurel’s face was a murderous bright red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“June,” Emma blurted. It was the month that all the flyers in the police station and Facebook pages said Thayer went missing. “Just like everyone else.” Mr. Mercer sighed heavily, like he didn’t believe her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before he could say anything else, Mrs. Mercer cleared her throat. “Let’s not worry about Thayer Vega anymore,” she chirped. “He’s in jail—that’s what matters.” Mr. Mercer’s brow wrinkled. “But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s talk about happy things instead, like your birthday party,” Mrs. Mercer interrupted. She touched her husband’s arm. “It’s only a few weeks away. Almost all the plans are complete.” Even Emma knew about the plans for Mr. Mercer’s birthday party. Mrs. Mercer had been planning the festivities at the Loews Ventana Canyon resort for weeks. Her party to-do lists were scattered around the house on bright yellow Post-its.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Mercer’s face was still a stony grimace. “I told you I didn’t want a party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Mercer scoffed. “Everyone wants a party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandma’s coming, right?” Laurel asked after swallowing a slug of orange juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Mercer nodded. “And you girls know you’re welcome to invite your friends,” she said. “I’ve already sent invitations to the Chamberlains and Mr. and Mrs. Vega.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I just ordered the cake from Gianni’s, that gourmet baker who did the cake for Mr. Chamberlain’s party,” Mrs. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/two-truths-and-a-lie-the-lying-game-3/page-3.html","bookId":2395,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:29 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:29 AM"}
