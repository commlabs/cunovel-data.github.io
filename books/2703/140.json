{"id":73310,"no":140,"title":"Page 140","content":"\u003cp\u003eQuinn probably hadn’t even said library. It’d just looked like the word his lips were forming. And heck, even if he had said it, that probably hadn’t meant he wanted me to meet him there. But that’s where I was going anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora snapped her phone shut and sent me a bored glance. “Why would I need anything else from you?” She’d gone over doctors’ appointments with me, and that was pretty much the only thing left between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll see you then.” I waved a half-hearted goodbye and darted back in the direction I’d just come from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t get to the library fast enough. When I reached the front doors, I glanced behind me self-consciously just to make sure Cora hadn’t followed me for any reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart leapt into my throat when I swear I saw the red top she was wearing and blond hair, but then whoever it was walked behind a building. I blew out a breath, telling myself I was paranoid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I swept inside the front doors, I started grinning. Even the possibility of getting to see him had my blood pounding with excitement. I didn’t have to search; I went straight to our spot. But as I turned down the aisle of books that led there, I slowed to a stop. He wasn’t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shoulders slumped. But then a breath later, two arms slid around my waist, making me squeak in surprise. I was pulled back against a hard chest I’d recognize anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You came.” His voice was filled with wonder before he spun me around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile created a buzz that echoed through my entire body. I smiled back and touched his dimple; my lips hurt from stretching them so far. His own smile widened. And then he was pulling me up to his level and kissing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, Zoey. I can’t resist you in a pair of jeans or even shorts. But a skirt—” He shook his head even as his palms caught my bare thighs and smoothed their way up the outsides, right under my skirt. “You want to kill me, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed him a little more desperately, my body coming alive as his heated touch branded my flesh. I climbed him and he pinned me to a wall of books. Then his fingers were skimming under my panties and cupping my bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is so wrong,” I panted out even as I wound my legs around his waist and pressed my forehead to his shoulder when he slid his longest finger over me to find out how wet I already was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bit my neck, right below my ear. “I lose all sense of right and wrong when you’re in a skirt.” With a tortured groan, his finger pushed inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choked on a gasp, and lifted my face to look over his shoulder. “What if someone catches us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” His teeth nipped at my throat and his fingers pumped me faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quinn,” I tried to resist, but I was too busy moving with him. I didn’t want him to stop, so my warning came out sounding a little too much like a plea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish this was my cock,” he whispered into my ear as he added another finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was embarrassing how easily he could make me come, but a couple strokes later I was biting his shoulder and squirming against him as my release crashed through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh,” he whispered into my ear, and then chuckled at his library pun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think…I think I need to pass out now.” I curled my arms around him and hid my face in his chest, embarrassed. “I can’t believe we just did that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me neither, but it was really hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my face, and he sent me a shy yet mischievous smile, making his dimple dip like crazy. Unable to help myself, I kissed his cheek and then whispered into his ear. “I want to finish you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body rippled, letting me know just how much he liked that suggestion, but he shook his head. “I don’t have anything. It’d make a mess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a breath and then said, “Not if I swallowed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn’s body froze, his eyes widened, and his mouth dropped open. “Y-y-you…” Then he glanced around, “It’d be way more obvious what was going on if someone caught us doing that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea excited and scared the crap out of me at the same time. I kind of wanted him to turn me down, but I also kind of wanted him to go for the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think he suffered from the same dilemma. Indecision warred across his face. So I said, “If you don’t want me to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! I do,” he was quick to correct me. “I really, really do. I just—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then, I am,” I decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I did!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still in a daze three days later, unable to forget what Zoey and I had done in the library together. It was the dirtiest thing I’d ever done and yet, I grinned and my entire body heated every time I remembered it. Even as we sat through art class beside each other on Friday, she blushed every time I stole a glance at her. Then I’d start grinning, unable to stop. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-140.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
