Then she glanced over at me. “Okay, but Oren’s coming, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGam lifted his hands in surrender. “Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I ride with Ten and Caroline?” Brandt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ooh, me too. I want to go with them.” Colton skipped toward his sister to wrap his arms around her waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGamble shot me a look full of hatred, silently accusing me of stealing his entire family from him. I lifted my eyebrows, daring him to say something. He opened his mouth, but no words came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShakespeare hooked her arm through his. “Looks like you and I have an entire ride all to ourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he glanced at her and she smiled up at him, a warmth entered his gaze. I guess the two of them had made up from the biggest fight of their marriage. That was awesome, because I was forever grateful for that woman’s presence in his life. No one calmed his moody temper as much as Shakespeare did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess it’s settled then,” I announced, clapping my hands together. “Everyone, load up!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI definitely rode in the “fun” truck on the way to Rainly Park. We barely got a mile down the road when Oren smacked me lightly on the side of the arm with the back of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Padiddle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at him, completely confused. “Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe briefly glanced back. “What? Didn’t you ever play car games when you were little?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Brandt and Colton leaned forward curiously from the backseat as I said, “My family never went on long car rides.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSympathy crossed his features before he shrugged and grasped my hand, lacing our fingers together over the center console. Then he sent me a quick smile. “Well, my sister and I played endless hours of car games when we were growing up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to the side in my seat to face him. “So, how does padiddle go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “It’s easy. You see a car with only one headlight and slap someone else in the car while you call out, padiddle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, waiting for the point of the game. Finally, Colton scratched his head. “And that’s it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a chuckle, Oren shrugged again. “I didn’t say it was an enlightening, complicated, or educational game. But it’s a fun reason to slap your sister without getting into trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Except it’s daytime,” I said dryly. “And our chances of finding someone with only one daytime headlight is fairly low.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOren scratched his scruff a second before saying, “My friend’s family used to play the same game, but they would thump the roof of the car whenever they saw a yellow car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like slapping arms better,” Brandt said just as Colton suggested, “Let’s do red cars.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second later, three different hands attacked my poor short-sleeve-covered arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Padiddle,” they said in unison. “Red car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the fuck!” I lifted my hands in self-defense, shying away from them. “Why did you all go after me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOren wiggled his eyebrows. “Weakest link.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, what the hell ever.” Spotting a red truck, I swung out with both hands, catching Oren and Colton. Brandt was saved that time only because he was the farthest away. “Padiddle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so the war began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be the stupidest, silliest game I’d ever played, but I was giggling by the time we reached the park. My brothers were talking a million miles a minute as we alighted from Oren’s truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAspen and Noel paused midway between unloading blankets and baskets full of lunch. Noel scowled at us—probably for being so happy—and his glower fixated itself on Oren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring my crabby brother, Oren skipped toward Aspen. “Here, Shakespeare. Let me carry that for you.” As he swept the laden basket from her arms, Noel’s glower only darkened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter filling his own arms with two sleeping bags, Noel hurried after Oren, dogging his heels. “Hey, asshole. Don’t you dare try going through her to get to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOren didn’t bother to glance back. “Wouldn’t dream of it,” he said coolly. Then he stopped abruptly, picking our picnic spot for us as he set the basket down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoel huffed but dropped the sleeping bags. He faced off with Oren. “I don’t know what you’re playing at with this nice-guy act, but it’s not fooling me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOren gazed at him blankly for a moment. “Hmm,” he finally said. “Good to know.” Then he dropped to his knees and unrolled each sleeping bag for the entire family to sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy overly suspicious brother set his hands on his hips and watched without assisting. I knelt down to silently help him. Meanwhile, Brandt and Colton began to chase each other across the grass, playing their own game of tag-padiddle, with squirrels now. When Aspen came bustling up with one last Tupperware container, Noel was still moodily standing watch while Oren and I finished smoothing out the blankets. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-158.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
