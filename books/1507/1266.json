As Dao Realm pressure descended from above, natural laws retreated and dissipated, until the only thing present was the Dao Realm pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe members of the Meng Clan looked on with wide eyes. The nine cultivators in the great circle of the Ancient Realm clasped hands and bowed deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Patriarch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cultivators in the vortex did the same, excited expressions on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Patriarch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown below, all of the Meng Clan cultivators who had stepped out of the various houses and buildings, even the servants and cultivators with other surnames... all bowed deeply and joined their voices to cry out, “Greetings, Patriarch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Ru and the other girls’ faces fell; they might have complete trust in Meng Hao, but deep down inside, any Patriarch... represented the most supreme and paramount power of the clan, and they were existences that were so far above them that even if they gazed upwards they would never be able to catch a glimpse of one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire Meng Clan was completely shaken. Within that enormous statue were nine hidden chambers, four of which were empty. The other five were occupied by cultivators sitting cross-legged in meditation. The person who had just spoken was the figure in the eighth chamber, who now sat there with eyes open and a serious look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not the Patriarch from the ninth bloodline, the one that Meng Hao had previously encountered face to face. This was the Patriarch of the eighth bloodline!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering that the cultivators who had just been killed were members of his bloodline, he had no choice but to make an appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stopped in place and turned to look at the statue behind him, without even sparing a glance at the Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering pressure descending toward him. Then he began to speak, his voice cool. The words he uttered were the type that anyone would think were wildly egotistical and arrogant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I bet you don’t even have the balls to try and fight me!” His voice was calm, but echoed out in all directions, instantly arousing the ire of the other members of the Meng Clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What incredible gall!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you looking to die?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You overestimate yourself!” Numerous shouts of rage echoed out within the central continent. The cultivators of the Meng Clan had to admit that Meng Hao was powerful to a terrifying degree. But in their minds, if he tried to fight one of their Patriarchs, he would be defeated with a single blow!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the type of faith exercised in the clan Patriarchs by all clan members, both young and old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Meng Ru and the other two young women were extremely nervous as they stood there next to Meng Hao, and the panic was visible on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn sharp contrast to all that was the object of the clan members’ veneration, the Patriarch sitting there in the eighth chamber, whose expression changed drastically. At the same time that Meng Hao spoke, the Patriarch was able to detect fluctuations that only someone in the Dao Realm would be able to feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose fluctuations filled the Patriarch with a sense of intense terror, and he knew that even if he went all out with every scrap of power he could muster, it wouldn’t do any good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensation he got was that he was like a tiny firefly, and Meng Hao was a burning torch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Impossible... what... what cultivation base does he have!?” The old man’s eyes were wide; moments ago, he had been on the verge of stepping out in person, but now he was hesitating. In the end, he didn’t dare to emerge and in fact... couldn’t even think of words to say in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s expression was calm as he looked coolly at the statue for a moment before turning and heading off with Meng Ru and the other young women. The only reason he was backing down was because he didn\u0027t feel like making complete enemies of everyone in the Meng Clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the Meng Clan after all,” he thought. “Once Grandma Meng’s cultivation base is restored, she can decide what to do.” He wouldn’t exceed his authority in this matter. Even if his mother was a member of the Meng Clan, he himself was a Young Lord of the Fang Clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were certain things he could do if he wished, but he had to do them very carefully. Even if he had good intentions, if he went too far it could lead to misunderstandings, which he didn\u0027t want to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was why, after a bit of thought, Meng Hao decided to just back down. Behind him, the various cultivators of the Meng Clan followed after him and stared at him murderously, even mockingly. However, their expressions of outrage quickly began to die down, until in the end, not a sound could be heard. These Meng Clan cultivators’ faces flickered with bewilderment, and there were even some faces that went deathly pale with astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was because, unexpectedly, after Meng Hao spoke, their Patriarch... didn\u0027t respond at all. It even seemed like his aura had gotten much weaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if... Meng Hao had been completely correct about their Patriarch; he didn\u0027t dare to show his face and fight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat fact caused the minds of numerous members of the Meng Clan to reel in shock. As for the cultivators in the great circle of the Ancient Realm, waves of astonishment battered their minds. Earlier, they had suspected that Meng Hao was in the Dao Realm, but now, there didn’t seem to be any need for speculation. Apparently, this young man... really was in the Dao Realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He... he really is... in the Dao Realm!” Gasps could be heard from among the cultivators in the great circle of the Ancient Realm as they watched Meng Hao leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the Patriarch in the eight chamber of the statue gritted his teeth. At the same time, he could sense that the Patriarchs in the ninth and first chambers were also awake, and yet were doing nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, they want me to probe this guy’s abilities, huh...?” A gleam of determination could be seen in the eyes of the eighth Patriarch. No person could reach the Dao Realm if they lacked courage; if they did, how could they possibly have passed the Dao Realm Tribulation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With the clan spell formation, I can give it a shot!” he said, gritting his teeth. Suddenly, his cultivation base erupted with power, sending the fluctuations of a 1-Essence Dao Realm expert shooting out from within the statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other members of the Meng Clan saw golden light shining out, which became a golden ocean then that transformed into an enormous hand, stretching out toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColors flashed as the golden hand filled the sky, casting shadow over all the lands beneath!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling filled the air as boundless power bore down on Meng Hao. Even as the faces of Meng Ru and the other young women went pale, Meng Hao turned, and his eyes flashed with icy coldness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you do have some balls,” he said coolly. He did nothing to avoid the incoming golden hand, and in fact, leapt up toward it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he slammed into it bodily and with complete disregard. Massive rumbling could be heard as the golden hand tried to crush him; and yet, as soon as it touched him, it began to tremble, and then... collapsed into pieces!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the hand shattered, the golden ocean disintegrated. Apparently, a Dao Realm attack couldn’t stand up to a single move by Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the hand collapsed, the old man in the eighth chamber of the statute trembled and then coughed up a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying backward, out of control. A moment later, he appeared outside the statue, where he coughed up another massive mouthful of blood. Face pale white, he stared at Meng Hao in complete terror and astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dao... Dao Lord? Dao Sovereign?” Intense fear pounded within the heart of the Patriarch of the eighth bloodline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEqually shaken was the Patriarch of the ninth bloodline. He recognized Meng Hao from their earlier meeting, and to see him fighting at this level was completely and utterly shocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were shocked, but as for the rest of the members of the Meng Clan, they were utterly dumbfounded. Their jaws dropped as they saw their Patriarch coughing up blood, whereas Meng Hao was standing there with a completely calm face. All he had done was take a step forward!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat single step caused a Dao Realm expert to fall into retreat, and to be injured. The faith of the Meng Clan cultivators in their Patriarch was completely toppled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll faces were completely gray and ashen. Within the crowd was the young man Meng De, who had been watching all along, and had instantly recognized Meng Hao. His eyes were wide with shock as he watched everything play out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than the gasps, there was no sound at all. Meng Hao looked over indifferently at the wounded Patriarch of the eighth bloodline. However, it was at this point that the Patriarch’s eyes turned crimson. He suddenly threw his head back and howled, then slapped his forehead viciously with his right hand. A boom rang out, and the sky went dim. Suddenly, a massive pressure radiated out from the enormous statue. In the blink of an eye, it had filled the area, and although no one in the audience could see anything out of the ordinary, Meng Hao was able to clearly see the shield which had sprung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Defensive spell formation....” he thought. However, he didn’t back up. Instead, he stood in place, eyes flickering as the shield expanded out toward him and then clashed with him briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brief clash caused Meng Hao’s pupils to constrict slightly. He could sense a Heaven-destroying, Earth-extinguishing power in that shield, something that he couldn’t resist for very long with only his fleshly body power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This defensive spell formation could actually be even more powerful. It’s strong enough with one person controlling it, but with more people backing it, I would actually be in significant danger.” After sensing the power of the shield, Meng Hao decided not to fight it. Instead, he turned, flicking his sleeve as he took Meng Ru and the other young women away, vanishing off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meng Hao left, the Patriarch of the eighth bloodline watched him go, his expression unsightly. The fact that Meng Hao had been able to stand up to the attack of the spell formation was completely shocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can\u0027t believe... that he stood up to the ancestral spell formation and wasn’t even hurt.... Just what Realm is he in? He\u0027s not a Dao Lord. Could it be... could it be that he really is a Dao Sovereign? But that\u0027s impossible!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the statue, the Patriarchs in the first and ninth chambers had very serious expressions on their faces, especially the Patriarch from the first bloodline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The tenth bloodline...?” he murmured quietly, face grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 1262: Activating the Clan Defense Formation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1261\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1263\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1262","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
