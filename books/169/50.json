I\u0027ve been here too long and the succession of crises has reached the point where the consideration of the Three Laws paralyzes me. You are the logical successor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I am not the logical successor,\" said Seldon hotly. \"What do I know about running an Empire?

I am Demerzel no more, only Daneel. As to what you will do without me- Suppose you try to put into practice some of Joranum\u0027s ideas of equality and social justice? He may not have meant them-he may have used them only as ways of capturing allegiance-but they are not bad ideas in themselves. And find ways of having Raych help you in that. He clung to you against his own attraction to Joranum\u0027s ideas and he must feel torn and half a traitor. Show him he isn\u0027t. In addition, you can work all the harder on psychohistory, for the Emperor will be there with you, heart and soul.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"But what will you do, Daneel?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I have other things in the Galaxy to which I must attend.

Seldon had one more thing to tell Daneel-the most important thing of all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon hesitated in the softly lit hallway before entering. But the room was empty. The dark robe was draped over a chair. The First Minister\u0027s chambers echoed Hari\u0027s last words to the robot: \"Good-bye, my friend.\" Eto Demerzel was gone; R.
