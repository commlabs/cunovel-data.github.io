Sydney Trousers?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard laughed. Not many of the un-dead bothered with humour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Unlikely,\u0027 he replied. \u0027Mr Boot, perhaps.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Or a boot-maker.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I have impeccable cause to believe John Pizer out of consideration.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corpse had been carted off to the mortuary, where the medical and press vultures were hungrily awaiting. Kate Reed was at the Cafe de Paris, telephoning in her story, under strict instructions not to mention his name. Drawing attention to the Diogenes Club would be bad enough, but he was really concerned with Penelope. He could well imagine her comments if his part in the last minutes of Liz Stride were made public. This was a different part of the woods, a different part of the city, a different part of his life. Penelope did not live here; and would prefer not to know of its existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked the distance between Berner Street and Mitre Square. The vampire from Toynbee Hall tagged along, less bothered than Kate had been yesterday by the pale sun. In daylight, Genevieve Dieudonne was quite appealing. She dressed like a New Woman, tight jacket and simple dress, sensible flat-heeled boots, beret-like cap and waist-length cape. If Great Britain had an elected parliament in a year\u0027s time, she would want the vote; and, he suspected, she would not be voting for Lord Ruthven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey arrived at the site of the Eddowes murder. Mitre Square was an enclosed area by the Great Synagogue, accessible through two narrow passages. The entrances were roped off, the bloody patch guarded by a warm policeman. A few on-lookers loitered, intent on filling out a suspects file. An Orthodox Jew, ringlets dangling in front of his ears, beard down to his belly, was trying to get some of these undesirables to stop hanging about the doors of the Synagogue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard lifted the rope and let Genevieve pass. He showed his card to the policeman, who saluted. Genevieve looked around the dreary square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Ripper must be a sprinter,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard checked his half-hunter. \u0027We bested his time by five minutes, but we knew where we were going. He may not have taken the shortest route, especially if his intent was to avoid the main roads. He was presumably just looking for a girl.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And a private place.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s not terribly private here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were faces behind the windows in the court, looking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027In Whitechapel, people are practised at not seeing things.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve was prowling the tiny walled-in court, as if trying to get the feel of the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This is perfect, public but private. Ideal for the practice of alfresco harlotry.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re unlike other vampires,\u0027 he observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No,\u0027 she agreed. \u0027I should hope to be.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you what they call an elder?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tapped her heart. \u0027Sweet sixteeen in here, but I was born in 1416.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard was puzzled. \u0027Then you\u0027re not...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not of the Prince Consort\u0027s bloodline? Quite right. My father-in-darkness was Chandagnac, and his mother-in-darkness was Lady Melissa d\u0027Acques, and...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So all this\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0027 he waved his hand \u0027 -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;is nothing to do with you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Everything is to do with everyone, Mr Beauregard. Vlad Tepes is a sick monster and his get spread his sickness. That poor woman this morning is what you can expect of his bloodline.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You work as a physician?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \u0027I\u0027ve picked up many professions over the years. I\u0027ve been a whore, a soldier, a singer, a geographer, a criminal. Whatever has seemed best. Now, doctoring seems best. My father, my true father, was a doctor, and I his apprentice. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Sophia Jex-Blake aren\u0027t the first women ever to practise medicine, you know.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Things have changed greatly since the fifteenth century.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So I understand. I read something about it in The Lancet. I wouldn\u0027t consider leeches, except in special cases.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard found himself liking this ancient girl. Genevieve was unlike any of the women, warm or un-dead, he knew. Whether by choice or from necessity, women seemed to stand to one side, watching, passing comment, never acting. He thought of Florence Stoker, pretending to understand the clever people she entertained, turning petulant whenever anything was not done for her. And Penelope elevated an attitude of non-involvement to a sanctified cause, insisting that messy details be kept from her poor head. Even Kate Reed, new and new-born, contented herself with jotting down notes on life as an alternative to living it. Genevieve Dieudonne was not a spectator. She reminded him a little of Pamela. Pamela had always wanted, demanded, to be involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is this affair political?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard thought carefully before answering. He did not know how much he should tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve made enquiries about the Diogenes Club,\u0027 she explained. \u0027You\u0027re some species of government office, are you not?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I serve the Crown.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why your interest in this matter?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve stood over the splash where Catharine Eddowes had died. The policeman looked the other way. A vampire had been at him to judge from the red marks streaking up from his collar almost to his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Queen herself has expressed concern. If she decrees we try to catch a murderer, then...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Ripper might be an anarchist of some stripe,\u0027 she mused. \u0027Or a die-hard vampire hater.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The latter is certain.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why is everyone so sure the Ripper is warm?\u0027 Genevieve asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The victims were all vampires.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So are a lot of people. The victims were also all women, all prostitutes, all near-destitutes. There could be any number of connecting factors. The Ripper always goes for the throat; that\u0027s a nosferatu trick.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe policeman was getting fidgety. Genevieve disturbed him. Beauregard suspected she had that effect on not a few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe countered her theory. \u0027As far as we can tell from the autopsies, the dead women were not bitten, not bled. Besides, as vampires, their blood would not interest another vampire.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s not entirely true, Mr Beauregard. We become what we are by drinking the blood of another vampire. It is uncommon but we do tap each other. Sometimes it is a way of establishing dominance within a group, a petty tyrant demanding a tithe from his followers. Sometimes vampire blood can be a curative for those with debased bloodlines. And sometimes, of course, mutual bleeding can be simply a sexual act, like any other...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard blushed at her forthrightness. The policeman was scarlet-faced, rubbing his angry wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The bloodline of Vlad Tepes is polluted,\u0027 she continued. \u0027One would have to be addle-pated with disease to drink from such a well. But London is full of very sick vampires. The Ripper could as easily be of their number as be some warm grudge-holder.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He could also be after the women\u0027s blood because he himself wants to become un-dead. You\u0027ve the fountain of youth flowing in your veins. If our Ripper is warm but sick, he might be desperate enough to seek such measures.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There are easier ways of becoming a vampire. Of course, a lot of people distrust easy ways. Your suggestion has some merit. But why so many victims? One mother-in-darkness would suffice. And why murder? Any one of the women would have turned him for a shilling.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the square and began drifting back towards Commercial Street. The thoroughfare was at the centre of the case. Annie Chapman and Lulu Sch?n had been killed in streets off the road. The police station from which the investigation was being conducted was there, and the Cafe de Paris, and Toynbee Hall. Last night, at some point, the Ripper must have crossed Commercial Street, and perhaps even have strolled, bloody knife under his coat, along its extension south of Whitechapel High Street, the Commercial Road, following his own route to Limehouse and the docks. There was a persistent rumour that the murderer was a seaman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Maybe he\u0027s a simple madman,\u0027 he said. \u0027Possessed of no more purpose than an orang-utan with a straight razor.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Dr Seward claims madmen are not so simple. Their actions might appear random and senseless, but there is always some pattern. Come at it from a dozen different ways and you eventually begin to understand, to see the world as the madman does.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And then we can catch him?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Dr Seward would say \"cure him\".\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed a poster listing the names of the latest criminals to be publicly impaled. Tyburn was a forest of dying thieves, exquisites and seditionists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard considered. \u0027I\u0027m afraid there\u0027ll only be one cure for this madman.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the corner of Wentworth Street, they saw a gathering of policemen and officials in Goulston Street. Lestrade and Abberline were among them, clustered around a thin man with a sad moustache and a silk hat. It was Sir Charles Warren, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, dragged down to a despised quarter of his parish. The group were standing by the doorway of a block of recently-built Model Dwellings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard sauntered over, the vampire girl with him. Something important, he assumed, was under discussion. Lestrade moved aside to let them into the group. Beauregard was surprised to find Lord Godalming with the civilian dignitaries. The new-born wore a large hat to shade his face, and was puffing on a cigar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who is this man?\u0027 Sir Charles asked grumpily, indicating Beauregard and ignoring Genevieve as beneath his notice. \u0027You, fellow, go away. This is official business. Chop-chop, scurry off!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving made his reputation in the Kaffir War, Sir Charles was used to treating everyone without official rank as if they were a native.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodalming explained, \u0027Mr Beauregard represents the Diogenes Club.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commissioner, watery-eyed in the early morning sun, swallowed his irritation. Beauregard understood why the police resented his presence, but was not above taking a little pleasure in Sir Charles\u0027s discomfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Very well,\u0027 Sir Charles said. \u0027I am sure your discretion is to be trusted.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLestrade made a disgusted face behind the Commissioner. Sir Charles was losing the support of his own men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Halse,\u0027 Lestrade said, \u0027show us what you found.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA square of packing-case rested against the fascia by the doorway. Halse, a Detective Constable, lifted the make-shift guard. A bloated rat, body as big as a rugby ball, shot out and darted between the Commissioner\u0027s polished shoes, squeaking like rusty nails on a slate. The constable disclosed a chalk scrawl, grey-white against black bricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE VAMPYRES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARE NOT THE MEN THAT WILL BE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBLAMED FOR NOTHING\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So, obviously the vampires are to be blamed for something,\u0027 deduced the Commissioner, astutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalse held up a ragged piece of once-white cloth, spotted with blood. \u0027This was in the doorway, sir. It\u0027s part of an apron.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Eddowes woman is wearing the rest of it,\u0027 Abberline said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You are certain?\u0027 Sir Charles asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s not been checked. But I\u0027ve just come from Golden Lane Mortuary, and I saw the other piece. Same stains, same type of tear. They\u0027ll fit like puzzle pieces.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Charles rumbled wordlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Could the Ripper be one of us?\u0027 asked Godalming, echoing Genevieve\u0027s earlier musings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027One of you,\u0027 Beauregard muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Ripper is obviously trying to throw us off,\u0027 put in Abberline. \u0027That\u0027s an educated man trying to make us think he\u0027s an illiterate. Only one misspelling, and a double negative not even the thickest costermonger would actually use.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Like the Jack the Ripper letter?\u0027 asked Genevieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbberline thought. \u0027Personally, I reckon that was a smart circulation drummer at the Whitechapel Star playing silly buggers to drive up sales. This is a different hand, and this is the Ripper. It\u0027s too close to be a coincidence.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The graffito was not here yesterday?\u0027 Beauregard asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The beat man swears not.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstable Halse agreed with the inspector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wipe it off,\u0027 Sir Charles said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody did anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027ll be mob rule, a mass uprising, disorder in the streets. We\u0027re still few and the warm are many.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commissioner took his own handkerchief to the chalk, and rubbed it away. Nobody protested at the destruction of evidence, but Beauregard saw a look pass between the detectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There, job done,\u0027 Sir Charles said. \u0027Sometimes I think I have to do everything myself.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard saw a narrow-minded impulsiveness that might have passed for stouthearted valour at Rorke\u0027s Drift or Lucknow, and understood just how Sir Charles could make a decision that ended in Bloody Sunday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dignitaries drifted away, back to their cabs and clubs and comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Shall I see you and Penny at the Stokers\u0027?\u0027 Godalming asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027When this matter is at a conclusion.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Give my kindest regards to Penny.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll be sure to.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGodalming followed Sir Charles. And the East End coppers stayed behind to clean up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It should have been photographed,\u0027 Halse said. \u0027It was a clue. Dammit, a clue.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Easy, lad,\u0027 said Abberline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Right,\u0027 said Lestrade. \u0027I want the cells full by sundown. Haul in every tart, every ponce, every bruiser, every dipper. Threaten \u0027em with whatever you want. Someone knows something, and sooner or later, someone\u0027ll talk.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would please the Limehouse Ring not a bit. Furthermore, Lestrade was wrong. Beauregard had a high enough estimation of the criminal community to believe that if any felon in London had so much as a hint of the identity of the Ripper, it would have passed directly to him. He had received several telegrams, indicating which avenues of enquiry would prove fruitless. The shadow empire had ruled out several investigative threads the police still pursued. It was perhaps disquieting to consider that the group in Limehouse had a higher percentage of first-rate minds than that which had just gathered in Goulston Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Genevieve, he walked back towards Commercial Street. It was late afternoon already, and he had not slept in over a day and a half. Paper-boys were hawking special editions. With a signed letter from the killer and two fresh murders, the hysteria for news was at a peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What do you think of Warren?\u0027 Genevieve asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard considered it best not to confide his opinion, but she understood it exactly in an instant. She was one of those vampires, and he would have to be careful what he thought in her company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Me, too,\u0027 she said. \u0027Precisely the wrong man for the position. Ruthven should know that. Still, better him than a Carpathian maniac.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePuzzled, he put a suggestion to her. \u0027To hear you, one would think you prejudiced against vampires.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Mr Beauregard, I find myself surrounded by the Prince Consort\u0027s get. It\u0027s too late to complain, but Vlad Tepes hardly represents the best of my kind. No one dislikes a Jewish or Italian degenerate more than a Jew or an Italian.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard found himself alone with Genevieve as sun set. She took off her cap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There,\u0027 she said, shaking out her honey-coloured hair, \u0027that\u0027s better.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenevieve seemed to stretch like a cat in the sun. He could sense her increasing strength. Her eyes sparkled a little, and her smile became almost sly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027By the way, who is Penny?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeauregard wondered what Penelope was doing exactly now. He had not seen her since their argument of a few days ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Miss Penelope Churchward, my fiancee.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not read Genevieve\u0027s expression but fancied her eyes narrowed a shade.
