His frail body was trembling, energy continuously flowing out from his body. The thick divine scripture was held tightly in his embrace, the corner that was exposed continuously flowing with milky-white radiance. Each time the light flickered, the energy would always scatter like water ripples.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Land of Rest’s underground scene greatly exceeded Su’s expectations. He had previously thought that buried here was an organ similar to the Heart of Darkness, or that there would be a General, like how it was with Cirvanas back then, with creatures whose foundations were tied to these organs, never expecting to meet this type of woman. Strictly speaking, she couldn’t be considered a woman, as she only had the outer appearance of the human race. She was currently in a strange state between tangible matter and energy, yet he couldn’t sense her will. From the message left on the monument, she should be a life form with intelligence, only, it was unknown why she was currently in this type of state.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThese thoughts flowed through Su’s mind like lightning. He still had many doubts and suspicions, but now wasn’t the time to search for answers. After all, what he was looking for was right in front of him. Su supported his body, crawling towards the crystal coffin. As soon as he crawled a meter, Su’s face suddenly made contact with something. Several formless wisps of energy were quietly broken.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s heart trembled, he knew he had already triggered some type of mechanism. Following the energy wisps’ collapse, the entire hall, no, Land of Rest’s entire energy system trembled! This wasn’t because of Su’s invasion, but rather that some type of enormous will was currently awakening!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s expression fell. In the endless void, a pair of enormous ocean-blue eyes gradually opened, overlooking Su who was more insignificant than an ant.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA strong life aura gathered from the void, pouring into the body of the woman sleeping within the crystal coffin.

As soon as Su barely managed to support his body, preparing to face the incoming battle, the pair of ocean-blue eyes concentrated on his body. As a result, Su’s will suddenly exploded, expanding boundlessly, linking up with the enormous spiritual body that appeared from the endless void.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Why is it another spiritual world battle?” Su only had time for this thought before his entire consciousness was sucked into a different plane.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn this world ruled by darkness and nothingness, a streak of light suddenly lit up, a heaven reaching radiance. At the center of the radiance was a goddess-like woman. She was indescribably beautiful, and even more so possessed a world ruling imposingness and awe. Her blonde hair rose in the pillar of light, with every movement releasing large amounts of brilliance and flames. Meanwhile, her eyes didn’t have pupils, only possessing a dense golden radiance, not a hint of emotion visible, only endless coldness and prestige. Her body was condensed from flames and light without hands or feet, the several dozen streaks of dancing flames likely serving as her limbs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu stood in the void. He didn’t see his own body, nor did he sense his surrounding environment, as if he was just a formless consciousness floating in the darkness. However, the woman who approached was a real existence, the radiance she released passing through the endless distance. When this radiance landed on Su’s consciousness, it brought him a lacerating pain!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen the flame and heat releasing goddess approached from the void, it meant that the heavy curtains before the spiritual world’s scenes finally began to slowly open behind her.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen he was seizing the fishmen’s secrets, Su had previously inadvertently made contact with the Lord of the Frozen Sea Pridekla’s spiritual world, thus engaging in an unexpected intense battle. At that time, Pridekla’s spiritual world was symbolized by a roaring great wave that could cover the great earth, while what Su displayed was a grain of desolation, loneliness, cold, a celestial body without any auras of life, an enormous planet! That battle that had taken place on a spiritual facet was more daunting than dangerous for Su. After that experience, Su became aware of a completely new way of fighting, and he also began to understand the basic rules of this type of battle. The spiritual worlds’ collision looked at the persistence and firmness of one’s will, as well as the vastness of the spiritual world, while the latter was more of a decisive factor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen this woman’s world slowly unfolded, appearing before Su’s eyes, it was a boundless sea of stars!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEnormous despair seized Su’s mind.

The ground was made from deep red crude rock and sand, currently releasing dazzling radiance from a light source that came from who knew what direction. However, this was an extremely cold and arid world, the great earth covered in cracks, completely without any aura of life. Not even ultra life forms could survive long-term in this type of environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe earth extended in all directions, a horizon starting to appear at the limit of one’s \u0026nbsp;vision, the slight curve representing that this was an enormous celestial body similar to a star.
