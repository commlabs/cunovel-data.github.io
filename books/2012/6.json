Tiny sea creatures swarmed in the reddish bloom of light like moths. The fire emerged pulsing from a rent in the floor of the canyon, gases bubbling upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael halted before the figure, shrugging off the wrapped corpse that had been balanced on his shoulder. As it rocked down to the silts tiny scavengers rushed towards it, only to spin away without alighting. Faint clouds billowed as the wrapped body settled in the mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice of K’rul, Elder God of the Warrens, drifted out from within his hood. ‘If all existence is a dialogue, how is it there is still so much left unsaid?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael scratched the stubble on his jaw. ‘Me with mine, you with yours, him with his, and yet still we fail to convince the world of its inherent absurdity.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eK’rul shrugged. ‘Him with his. Yes. Odd that of all the gods, he alone discovered this mad, and maddening, secret. The dawn to come … shall we leave it to him?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well,’ Mael grunted, ‘first we need to survive the night. I have brought the one you sought.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see that. Thank you, old friend. Now tell me, what of the Old Witch?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael grimaced. ‘The same. She tries again, but the one she has chosen … well, let us say that Onos T’oolan possesses depths Olar Ethil cannot hope to comprehend, and she will, I fear, come to rue her choice.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A man rides before him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael nodded. ‘A man rides before him. It is … heartbreaking.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘“Against a broken heart, even absurdity falters.”’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘“Because words fall away.”’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingers fluttered in the glow. ‘“A dialogue of silence.”’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘“That deafens.”’ Mael looked off into the gloomy distance. ‘Blind Gallan and his damnable poems.’ Across the colourless floor armies of sightless crabs were on the march, drawn to the alien light and heat. He squinted at them. ‘Many died.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Errastas had his suspicions, and that is all the Errant needs. Terrible mischance, or deadly nudge. They were as she said they would be. Unwitnessed.’ K’rul lifted his head, the empty hood now gaping in Mael’s direction. ‘Has he won, then?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael’s wiry brows rose. ‘You do not know?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That close to Kaminsod’s heart, the warrens are a mass of wounds and violence.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael glanced down at the wrapped corpse. ‘Brys was there. Through his tears I saw.’ He was silent for a long moment, reliving someone else’s memories. He suddenly hugged himself, released a ragged breath. ‘ In the name of the Abyss, those Bonehunters were something to behold! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vague hints of a face seemed to find shape inside the hood’s darkness, a gleam of teeth. ‘Truly? Mael – truly?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmotion growled out in his words. ‘This is not done. Errastas has made a terrible mistake. Gods, they all have! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment, K’rul sighed, gaze returning to the fire. His pallid hands hovered above the pulsing glow of burning rock. ‘I shall not remain blind. Two children. Twins. Mael, it seems we shall defy the Adjunct Tavore Paran’s wish to be for ever unknown to us, unknown to everyone. What does it mean, this desire to be unwitnessed? I do not understand.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael shook his head. ‘There is such pain in her … no, I dare not get close. She stood before us, in the throne room, like a child with a terrible secret, guilt and shame beyond all measure.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps my guest here will have the answer.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is this why you wanted him? To salve mere curiosity? Is this to be a voyeur’s game, K’rul? Into a woman’s broken heart?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Partly,’ K’rul acknowledged. ‘But not out of cruelty, or the lure of the forbidden. Her heart must remain her own, immune to all assault.’ The god regarded the wrapped corpse. ‘No, this one’s flesh is dead, but his soul remains strong, trapped in its own nightmare of guilt. I would see it freed of that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Poised to act, when the moment comes. Poised to act. A life for a death, and it will have to do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMael sighed unevenly. ‘Then it falls on her shoulders. A lone woman. An army already mauled. With allies fevered with lust for the coming war. An enemy awaiting them all, unbowed, with inhuman confidence, so eager to spring the perfect trap.’ He lifted his hands to his face. ‘A mortal woman who refuses to speak.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yet they follow.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They follow.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-6.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
