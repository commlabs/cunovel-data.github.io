She floated for a while again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, wake up, she thought. That\u0027s the alarm. You have to go to school... or something. You have to go see Zach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was lying on the cold floor of her cousin\u0027s garage, chilled and stiff but bee-less. She looked at her hands and bare ankles. Not a mark. Julian hadn\u0027t let it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now she was stuck in a garage without a door. The light trap had only a curtain. All the other doors-the large one for cars and the regular one to the house-were simply missing, their spaces filled in with blank walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no idea what she was supposed to do next, and it was after three in the morning and she was tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked at the corner of the studio where Zach took pictures. Zach\u0027s camera stood on a tripod. The tungsten floodlamp was turned on. The backdrop was a sheet of seamless paper from a roll maybe six feet wide. Zach had done a lot of photos by painting paper like that black and throwing handfuls of white flour at it. The result had looked a little like the Milky Way-white splashes on infinite space. Very strange and futuristic; Zach loved that kind of stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis backdrop, though, had a door painted on it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knob protruded from the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way out, Jenny thought as she went over to it, but something inside her wasn\u0027t so sure. For some reason this black-and-white door made her chilled flesh creep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat choice have you got? her mind asked simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned the knob. The door swung out. She stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like being suspended among the stars. The door closed behind her, but Jenny scarcely noticed. The sky seemed very low, more like a ceiling. It was black with glowing white splotches. The ground was a velvety black dropcloth that went on forever in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was awful, this sense of infinity all around, pulling at her. It reminded her of a dream she\u0027d once had, where the ground stretched on endlessly, but the sky was close and solid overhead. Did Zach have the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esame kind of dreams? Was this Zach\u0027s real nightmare?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only landmarks in the limitless, featureless darkness were lamps-tungsten floodlamps like the ones Zach used. They formed little islands of brightness here and there, some white, some colored, fading out into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny pivoted, trying to get her bearings-and drew in her breath sharply. The door was still behind her. It hadn\u0027t disappeared. She could walk right out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if this was Zach\u0027s nightmare, he must be in here somewhere. She couldn\u0027t leave without looking for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment\u0027s hesitation she headed for the nearest floodlamp, a neon pink one. It took courage to step away from the security of the door, and once she did she kept her eyes fixed on the island of light ahead. The black velvet ground was perfectly smooth, without the slightest wrinkle. She could practically skate over it in her flats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she reached the floodlamp, she saw it had a pink filter just like the ones Zach used. He got them from the drama department when colored spotlights burned out. And the scene it illuminated was exactly like a print Zach had made-a cardboard silhouette of a neon-pink coyote in the grass. The print had been weird and high tech, like all Zach\u0027s photos, but Jenny had always liked it. Just now the coyote-shape standing alone with pink light blazing on it was unnerving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaiting for the photographer, Jenny thought. It gave the disquieting impression that it had been waiting there forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe headed toward the next floodlamp, a white one maybe forty feet away. It was hard to judge distance here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one was shining on a wall, a single wall standing alone, its windows broken out. Silver dots and swathes decorated the wall. Zach had gone into deserted houses in Zuma Beach and painted and photographed them. Vandalism, the police said, but Zach insisted it was art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked on both sides of the freestanding wall. It was unnerving, too. Everything was so quiet here... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she thought it, she heard a faint clanking noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light from the pink floodlamp dimmed for a moment-as if something had passed in front of it. Standing rigid, Jenny strained her eyes in the darkness. She couldn\u0027t see anything moving. She couldn\u0027t hear anything, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust your imagination, she told herself-but it was hard to make it sound convincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing back frequently, she walked to the next lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one had a neon orange filter. A few years ago Zach had photographed baking soda thrown in the air under colored lights. The problem was that here the baking soda stayed in the air, a glowing orange cloud suspended-by nothing. Jenny could see individual motes in it twinkle and drift slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, get me out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe backed away from it and set out for the next island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got closer her heart skipped and she began to run. There were two blue floodlamps close together. Zach was under one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny opened her mouth to shout to him, but stopped at the last minute. What if it wasn\u0027t Zach? She\u0027d been fooled once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe approached cautiously and looked down at the figure in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSame flannel shirt over same T-shirt. Same denims. Same hair in same ponytail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was holding a fist-size rock over a gray canvas painted with silver streaks. He put the rock down, looked at it, picked it back up. He put it down again in almost exactly the same place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to call it \u0027Rock on Water,\u0027\" he said. He looked up. \"Because rocks don\u0027t really float.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zach,\" said Jenny. She knelt down and put a hand on his shoulder. His gray eyes were abstracted and a little glazed, just like the other\u0027s had been. But something told Jenny this was really her cousin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stealthy noise in the endless dark made her look up fast. The white spotlight winked out, went back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zach, we\u0027ve got to go,\" she said and tightened her grip. \"I\u0027ll explain later-but there\u0027s something out there, and we have to get back to the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach just gave her one of his absent smiles, the kind that didn\u0027t reach his eyes. \"I know it\u0027s out there,\" he said. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s all part of my hallucination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your what? You mean your nightmare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever.\" He picked up the rock again, shifted it slightly, considered it. \"I\u0027ve known for a long time that this was going to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was genuinely astonished. \"You knew we were going to get kidnapped by the Shadow Man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew I was going to go crazy.\" Then, adjusting the rock fractionally, he said, \"Actually \u0027kidnapped by the Shadow Man\u0027 is a really interesting way of putting it. Really imaginative. I mean, what else is going insane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny could feel her mouth hanging open. Then she shut it with a snap and took her cousin by both shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zachary, you are not insane,\" she said. \"Is that what your problem is-why you were acting so strange before? Because you thought you\u0027d gone crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brain kidnapped by the Shadow Man,\" he told her. \"It was bound to happen sooner or later. It runs in the family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for God\u0027s sake, Zach!\" She had no idea what he was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orange floodlamp, the next one out, seemed to flicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Zach told Jenny. \"You\u0027re just part of my hallucination. It won\u0027t really hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What won\u0027t really hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach was gazing at the rock on his canvas. \"It\u0027s about dimensions. See? The canvas is two dimensional and the-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arrow shattered one of the blue floodlamps in a shower of sparks and glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, a bolt, Jenny thought, stunned. A bolt from a crossbow. She recognized it because Zach\u0027s father had made it to the National Crossbow Championship three years running. Bolts were even more lethal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethan arrows-and this one was metal and looked almost futuristic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach was brushing bits of glass off his canvas. \"Zach, get up!\" Jenny was frantic. Another bolt shattered the second blue floodlight. Jenny jumped away from the sparks. Zach hunched protectively over his rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zach, listen to me! This is not a hallucination, it\u0027s real, and you can die for real here, too! You can bring your rock if you want, but we\u0027ve got to leave this minute-this minute!\" Her voice rose hysterically at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt got through to him. She could barely see him by the glow of the white-splattered sky, but he got up-still holding the rock-and went where she was pulling him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrange floodlight, Jenny was thinking. Orange, and then white, and then pink. The door should be beyond that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orange lamp shattered as they got to it. \"Zach, who\u0027s after us? No, don\u0027t stop, come on!\" Panting, Jenny tugged at his elbow. He\u0027d turned around to look thoughtfully behind them. He didn\u0027t seem frightened. \"Me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the freestanding wall by the white floodlamp. Jenny felt somewhat safer behind it. She looked at her cousin. \"You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me. It\u0027s my hallucination and I\u0027m chasing myself. Hunting myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Zach,\" she said helplessly. Then: \"Zach, it\u0027s not a hallucination. The same thing is happening to all of us-we\u0027re all here. Dee and Mike and Tom and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey and me. And Summer was here, but her nightmare killed her because she couldn\u0027t cope. So you have to cope, because if you don\u0027t...\" Jenny\u0027s eyes were wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach blinked. \"We\u0027re all here? It\u0027s real?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s real. It really happened, the Game and the Shadow Man and everything. It\u0027s not in your head. It almost drove me crazy, too, but you can\u0027t let it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach blinked again, then looked through the empty window of the wall, out into the darkness. \"If it\u0027s real...\" he began slowly, and continued in a voice with more strength, \"If it\u0027s real, then who\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny inched over to take a cautious peek. A-person-was standing at the very edge of the light that went through the window. His crossbow was futuristic-looking-and so was he. Cyberpunk, Jenny thought. He was wearing black body armor that hugged his lean body sleekly, and he had one normal hand and one that was shining steel and cables. There was some kind of high-tech gun strapped to his thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore a helmet with a mirrored face mask that completely obscured his features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny leaned back against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, terrific,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured he was my dark side. The part of me that wants to destroy me,\" Zach said reasonably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bolt came through the window-Jenny felt the wind of it-and shattered the white floodlamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Zach ran without prompting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cyber-Hunter got to the pink floodlight before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t have, but he did anyway. He stood, backlit by the neon pink glow, a dark silhouette as they approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way! We have to get to the door!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny veered sharply, circling to get to the other side of the pink lamp. Zach followed her. But when she got to the place where the door should have been, it wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gone!\" Jenny turned to look back. The Cyber-Hunter was facing them now, facing the blazing pink glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what on earth are we supposed to do with him? Jenny thought. Kill him? Bash him with the rock? I don\u0027t think so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing she\u0027d learned-the nightmares were fair. There was always a chance, a way to get out, even when there didn\u0027t seem to be. She supposed Julian considered that only sporting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what could they do with the Cyber-Hunter? How could Zach face his fear?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zach,\" she said hesitantly, \"you haven\u0027t seen his face, right? You don\u0027t know if he looks like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I just figured. He\u0027s like the high-tech stuff in my photos-come to get me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd like some cyberpunk stuff I\u0027ve seen, Jenny thought grimly. She said, \"If you did look at him ... If you pulled off his helmet, say-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel Zach recoil in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny shut her eyes, feeling suddenly tired. \"Then that\u0027s what you have to do, I think. It\u0027s your nightmare, and you have to face him. I\u0027ll go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a risk. Whether the Hunter was Julian or just one of Julian\u0027s dream-creatures, like the dark elves or the small Visitors, he might very well look like Zach under the helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zach, I think you have to-or we won\u0027t ever find the way out of here. I think, even if he looks like you, you have to know he\u0027s not you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-if he is me ... if you\u0027re not really here and this is all my hallucination ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll probably disappear or something!\" Jenny said. \"And then at least you\u0027ll know you\u0027re crazy. All I know is that Summer wouldn\u0027t face her nightmare and she died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. Zach turned toward her, but it was too dark to be sure of his expression. \"Come on,\" he said and started for the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s heart rate kept accelerating as they got closer to it. The Cyber-Hunter could easily shoot them at any minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t. He stood as still as a figure in the Movieland Wax Museum. He was exactly Zach\u0027s height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach stopped when they were a few feet in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny could hear blood roaring in her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cyber-Hunter shifted the crossbow a little. Pink jewels of light slid up and down it, and over his black armor. Zach\u0027s face was reflected in the mirrored faceplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on, Zach,\" Jenny whispered. \"Take off the helmet. Tell him he\u0027s not you, whatever he looks like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t nearly as confident as she sounded. Was it Zach\u0027s face under the helmet? Julian\u0027s? Maybe it was some hideous android-some kind of killer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erobot. Maybe Zach would get shot before he could find out. Maybe ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cyber-Hunter stood waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sudden gesture Zach reached out and grabbed the front of the helmet, pulling the face mask away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo face, no head. Jenny, prepared for anything else, screamed involuntarily. The Cyber-Hunter\u0027s black body armor fell down empty, the crossbow clattering on top of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door appeared beside the pink floodlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach was staring down at the empty shell of armor. He nudged the dismembered robotic hand with his foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny gave a little gasp of relief. It had been so easy-but then she looked at her cousin. The real test was in his head. \"I\u0027m still here, Zach,\" she said. \"Right? Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to look at her, pink light haloing his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, slowly, he smiled. \"Right,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe awful dazed look had disappeared. He looked like Zach again. She could see the sanity return to his eyes. Relief flooded Jenny in painful waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach dropped the mirrored face mask on the pile of black armor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rock I\u0027ll keep. I still want to do that photo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stepped through the door to the mirrored hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach\u0027s slip of paper was on the ground. Jenny picked it up and frowned over it. She could vaguely make out what looked like a profile-a profile with a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeaky nose-but behind that was just a futuristic mishmash of colors, streaks and dabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The things in my head,\" Zach said. He took it from her and tore it up. Jenny watched the colored pieces float down like confetti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zach-what made you think insanity runs in the family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach just shrugged. The others had explained their nightmares, but it didn\u0027t surprise Jenny that Zach wouldn\u0027t. Zach protected his privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unseen clock struck four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate this place,\" Zach said, looking at his own gray-eyed reflection. \"It reminds me of the fun house at that amusement park we used to go to when we were kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027re the one who put it here,\" Jenny said. She\u0027d forgotten the fun house herself-but then she\u0027d forgotten a lot about her childhood, especially the years before she came to California. She didn\u0027t want to remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a little twist of premonition in her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe also felt the heat in her cheeks. Now that they were out of danger, now that Zach looked like himself again, she found that her attitude toward him had changed. It was Julian\u0027s fault. Jenny knew perfectly well that her cousin had never thought of her romantically-but she couldn\u0027t forget what had happened in the darkroom. Every time she looked at Zach, she remembered seeing those gray eyes black with passion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll forget eventually, she told herself. It\u0027ll wear off. Just as long as he never finds out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAloud she said, \"We\u0027ve got to find the others. Dee and Audrey and Mike are all wandering around here somewhere. I guess\"-she hesitated-\"I guess we should separate. But I\u0027m afraid we might not be able to find our way back to each other. I know it seems as if the hall only goes two ways, but you can\u0027t trust anything here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute.\" Zach pulled two crayons out of the pocket of his flannel shirt. \"I took them because I thought the colors might work in a photo. Take your pick, cadet blue or Indian red. We can mark a trail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny chose cadet blue and made a pale, waxy streak on the nearest mirror. \"Brilliant,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll go this way, you go that way. Whoever finds them can bring them back here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the two crayons meet,\" Zach said and began a line of his own. Still drawing, he walked away. The first zigzag of the hall took him out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo thank-you, no goodbye. Well, that should help her forget the darkroom scene. Zach was himself again, all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went her own way, leaving a crayon trail behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mirrored hallway seemed infinite-and completely deserted. It went on and on with no variations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil, to her astonishment, she came to the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a blank wall, gray as concrete. No mirror, no blue light, no red button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt scared her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ground in front of it was a white slip of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny approached the paper slowly. It scared her, too. Dee, Audrey, Mike, Summer, and Zach had had their nightmares. And Julian had said Tom was at the top of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody\u0027s nightmare left on this floor but hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked the paper up, turned it over. She recognized the formless doodle around the edges. The middle of the paper was exactly as she\u0027d left it-blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked up at the blank wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Need any help?\" Julian asked from behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paper crumpled in Jenny\u0027s clenched fist as she turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was leaning against a mirror, wearing the sleek black body armor. No helmet, though. Instead, there was a splash of purple in the shock of white hair falling over his forehead and a triangular blue design on his cheekbone. It looked almost like silk-screening. More cyberpunk, Jenny thought. High-tech body art. Zach would love it-or maybe not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked straight into the strange cat-tilted blue eyes. Things had changed since Julian had set the bees on her. She had a new confidence at her core. Whatever he did to her, even if he killed her, he couldn\u0027t break her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it was you shooting at us,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Personally, I think it was Zach\u0027s father. I think he has a little complex there. Rugged, old-fashioned dad; artistic, newfangled son, you know. On the other hand, I am a hunter.\" He pushed the lock of purple hair out of his eyes, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you just go away?\" Jenny said. \"I\u0027m trying to figure something out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad to help. I know a lot about you. I\u0027ve watched you for so many years now. Hour after hour, day after day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny froze. He\u0027d said similar things before, and she hadn\u0027t really listened. Or she hadn\u0027t taken it literally. But now, looking at him, she knew he meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the most terrible thing she\u0027d ever heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d watched her for hours on end? How many times in her life, when she\u0027d thought she was alone, had he been there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an appalling intimacy, and one Jenny didn\u0027t want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in love with you,\" he said simply. \"I think everything you do is marvelous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no need to be embarrassed. I don\u0027t think the same way you do. Whether your hair\u0027s brushed -whether your makeup is on-I don\u0027t care. Besides\"-he smiled at her-\"didn\u0027t you know that I was there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\" But she had, Jenny realized. Somewhere deep inside herself she\u0027d known she was being watched. She\u0027d just thought everybody had that feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose times in the night when she woke up, certain that a tall shape was standing over her in the darkness. Usually when it happened she couldn\u0027t move, could hardly breathe. Sometimes she would actually see the shape, the outline black against lighter blackness, and she stared until her eyes ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she kicked at it or turned on the light, it would disappear. But she\u0027d sit there breathing hard anyway, choking on her own fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer room always looked strange in that unnatural middle-of-the-night brightness. Subtly different than it did in the daytime. It was always a long time before she would be able to turn the light off again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd underneath, in her heart of hearts, she would feel it had been real. Not just a dream. Her eyes had been open when she\u0027d seen the thing above her, and it didn\u0027t matter if that was stupid and nobody could see in such darkness. She\u0027d seen it anyway. It had been there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny had thought everybody went through things like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate you,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d have thought you\u0027d want my help right now.\" He nodded at the blank wall. \"That\u0027s your nightmare, Jenny-but how are you going to get into it? And if you can\u0027t get into it, how are you going to get through it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants you panicked, Jenny told herself. He wants to scare you, to make you think you need his help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t need it. She refused to need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled suddenly. She could feel it was lopsided. She held up the cadet blue crayon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get in with this,\" she said and smoothed out her blank slip of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyelids drooped in amusement, and his voice was a caress. \"But how will you remember. You don\u0027t know what to draw. You\u0027ve spent all these years trying to forget____\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know enough,\" Jenny said. She wondered just how much Julian knew about her own private nightmare, the one she\u0027d spent so long running away from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had the chilling feeling that she was about to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what it starts with,\" she said. \"It starts with my grandfather\u0027s basement, when I was five years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the paper flat against a mirror and began to draw. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-hunter-the-forbidden-game-1/page-12.html","bookId":2100,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:47 PM"}
