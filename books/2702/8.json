There\u0027s no doubt he was taken off by the police. I got that from a bird who saw it done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where\u0027s he been taken to?\" asked Lucy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they were heading northwards when they were last seen and we all know what that means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we don\u0027t,\" said Susan. Mr Beaver shook his head in a very gloomy fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid it means they were taking him to her House,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what\u0027ll they do to him, Mr Beaver?\" gasped Lucy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Mr Beaver, \"you can\u0027t exactly say for sure. But there\u0027s not many taken in there that ever comes out again. Statues. All full of statues they say it is - in the courtyard and up the stairs and in the hall. People she\u0027s turned\" - (he paused and shuddered) \"turned into stone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Mr Beaver,\" said Lucy, \"can\u0027t we - I mean we must do something to save him. It\u0027s too dreadful and it\u0027s all on my account.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t doubt you\u0027d save him if you could, dearie,\" said Mrs Beaver, \"but you\u0027ve no chance of getting into that House against her will and ever coming out alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t we have some stratagem?\" said Peter. \"I mean couldn\u0027t we dress up as something, or pretend to be - oh, pedlars or anything - or watch till she was gone out - or - oh, hang it all, there must be some way. This Faun saved my sister at his own risk, Mr Beaver. We can\u0027t just leave him to be - to be - to have that done to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no good, Son of Adam,\" said Mr Beaver, \"no good your trying, of all people. But now that Aslan is on the move-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes! Tell us about Aslan!\" said several voices at once; for once again that strange feeling - like the first signs of spring, like good news, had come over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is Aslan?\" asked Susan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aslan?\" said Mr Beaver. \"Why, don\u0027t you know? He\u0027s the King. He\u0027s the Lord of the whole wood, but not often here, you understand. Never in my time or my father\u0027s time. But the word has reached us that he has come back. He is in Narnia at this moment. He\u0027ll settle the White Queen all right. It is he, not you, that will save Mr Tumnus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She won\u0027t turn him into stone too?\" said Edmund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord love you, Son of Adam, what a simple thing to say!\" answered Mr Beaver with a great laugh. \"Turn him into stone? If she can stand on her two feet and look him in the face it\u0027ll be the most she can do and more than I expect of her. No, no. He\u0027ll put all to rights as it says in an old rhyme in these parts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll understand when you see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But shall we see him?\" asked Susan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Daughter of Eve, that\u0027s what I brought you here for. I\u0027m to lead you where you shall meet him,\" said Mr Beaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is-is he a man?\" asked Lucy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aslan a man!\" said Mr Beaver sternly. \"Certainly not. I tell you he is the King of the wood and the son of the great Emperor-beyond-the-Sea. Don\u0027t you know who is the King of Beasts? Aslan is a lion - the Lion, the great Lion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh!\" said Susan, \"I\u0027d thought he was a man. Is he - quite safe? I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you will, dearie, and no mistake,\" said Mrs Beaver; \"if there\u0027s anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking, they\u0027re either braver than most or else just silly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he isn\u0027t safe?\" said Lucy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Safe?\" said Mr Beaver; \"don\u0027t you hear what Mrs Beaver tells you? Who said anything about safe? \u0027Course he isn\u0027t safe. But he\u0027s good. He\u0027s the King, I tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m longing to see him,\" said Peter, \"even if I do feel frightened when it comes to the point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, Son of Adam,\" said Mr Beaver, bringing his paw down on the table with a crash that made all the cups and saucers rattle. \"And so you shall. Word has been sent that you are to meet him, tomorrow if you can, at the Stone Table.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s that?\" said Lucy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll show you,\" said Mr Beaver. \"It\u0027s down the river, a good step from here. I\u0027ll take you to it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But meanwhile what about poor Mr Tumnus?\" said Lucy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan,\" said Mr Beaver, \"once he\u0027s with us, then we can begin doing things. Not that we don\u0027t need you too. For that\u0027s another of the old rhymes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Adam\u0027s flesh and Adam\u0027s bone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSits at Cair Paravel in throne,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evil time will be over and done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo things must be drawing near their end now he\u0027s come and you\u0027ve come. We\u0027ve heard of Aslan coming into these parts before - long ago, nobody can say when. But there\u0027s never been any of your race here before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I don\u0027t understand, Mr Beaver,\" said Peter, \"I mean isn\u0027t the Witch herself human?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d like us to believe it,\" said Mr Beaver, \"and it\u0027s on that that she bases her claim to be Queen. But she\u0027s no Daughter of Eve. She comes of your father Adam\u0027s\" - (here Mr Beaver bowed) \"your father Adam\u0027s first wife, her they called Lilith. And she was one of the Jinn. That\u0027s what she comes from on one side. And on the other she comes of the giants. No, no, there isn\u0027t a drop of real human blood in the Witch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why she\u0027s bad all through, Mr Beaver,\" said Mrs Beaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True enough, Mrs Beaver,\" replied he, \"there may be two views about humans (meaning no offence to the present company). But there\u0027s no two views about things that look like humans and aren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve known good Dwarfs,\" said Mrs Beaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So\u0027ve I, now you come to speak of it,\" said her husband, \"but precious few, and they were the ones least like men. But in general, take my advice, when you meet anything that\u0027s going to be human and isn\u0027t yet, or used to be human once and isn\u0027t now, or ought to be human and isn\u0027t, you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet. And that\u0027s why the Witch is always on the lookout for any humans in Narnia. She\u0027s been watching for you this many a year, and if she knew there were four of you she\u0027d be more dangerous still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that to do with it?\" asked Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of another prophecy,\" said Mr Beaver. \"Down at Cair Paravel - that\u0027s the castle on the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of the whole country if all was as it should be - down at Cair Paravel there are four thrones and it\u0027s a saying in Narnia time out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four thrones, then it will be the end not only of the White Witch\u0027s reign but of her life, and that is why we had to be so cautious as we came along, for if she knew about you four, your lives wouldn\u0027t be worth a shake of my whiskers!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the children had been attending so hard to what Mr Beaver was telling them that they had noticed nothing else for a long time. Then during the moment of silence that followed his last remark, Lucy suddenly said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say-where\u0027s Edmund?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a dreadful pause, and then everyone began asking \"Who saw him last? How long has he been missing? Is he outside? and then all rushed to the door and looked out. The snow was falling thickly and steadily, the green ice of the pool had vanished under a thick white blanket, and from where the little house stood in the centre of the dam you could hardly see either bank. Out they went, plunging well over their ankles into the soft new snow, and went round the house in every direction. \"Edmund! Edmund!\" they called till they were hoarse. But the silently falling snow seemed to muffle their voices and there was not even an echo in answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How perfectly dreadful!\" said Susan as they at last came back in despair. \"Oh, how I wish we\u0027d never come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What on earth are we to do, Mr Beaver?\" said Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do?\" said Mr Beaver, who was already putting on his snow-boots, \"do? We must be off at once. We haven\u0027t a moment to spare!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d better divide into four search parties,\" said Peter, \"and all go in different directions. Whoever finds him must come back here at once and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Search parties, Son of Adam?\" said Mr Beaver; \"what for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, to look for Edmund, of course!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no point in looking for him,\" said Mr Beaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" said Susan. \"He can\u0027t be far away yet. And we\u0027ve got to find him. What do you mean when you say there\u0027s no use looking for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reason there\u0027s no use looking,\" said Mr Beaver, \"is that we know already where he\u0027s gone!\" Everyone stared in amazement. \"Don\u0027t you understand?\" said Mr Beaver. \"He\u0027s gone to her, to the White Witch. He has betrayed us all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, surely-oh, really!\" said Susan, \"he can\u0027t have done that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t he?\" said Mr Beaver, looking very hard at the three children, and everything they wanted to say died on their lips, for each felt suddenly quite certain inside that this was exactly what Edmund had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But will he know the way?\" said Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he been in this country before?\" asked Mr Beaver. \"Has he ever been here alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Lucy, almost in a whisper. \"I\u0027m afraid he has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did he tell you what he\u0027d done or who he\u0027d met?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, no, he didn\u0027t,\" said Lucy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then mark my words,\" said Mr Beaver, \"he has already met the White Witch and joined her side, and been told where she lives. I didn\u0027t like to mention it before (he being your brother and all) but the moment I set eyes on that brother of yours I said to myself `Treacherous\u0027. He had the look of one who has been with the Witch and eaten her food. You can always tell them if you\u0027ve lived long in Narnia; something about their eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the same,\" said Peter in a rather choking sort of voice, \"we\u0027ll still have to go and look for him. He is our brother after all, even if he is rather a little beast. And he\u0027s only a kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to the Witch\u0027s House?\" said Mrs Beaver. \"Don\u0027t you see that the only chance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you mean?\" said Lucy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, all she wants is to get all four of you (she\u0027s thinking all the time of those four thrones at Cair Paravel). Once you were all four inside her House her job would be done - and there\u0027d be four new statues in her collection before you\u0027d had time to speak. But she\u0027ll keep him alive as long as he\u0027s the only one she\u0027s got, because she\u0027ll want to use him as a decoy; as bait to catch the rest of you with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, can no one help us?\" wailed Lucy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only Aslan,\" said Mr Beaver, \"we must go on and meet him. That\u0027s our only chance now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems to me, my dears,\" said Mrs Beaver, \"that it is very important to know just when he slipped away. How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard. For instance, had we started talking of Aslan before he left? If not, then we may do very well, for she won\u0027t know that Aslan has come to Narnia, or that we are meeting him, and will be quite off her guard as far as that is concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan - \" began Peter, but Lucy interrupted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes, he was,\" she said miserably; \"don\u0027t you remember, it was he who asked whether the Witch couldn\u0027t turn Aslan into stone too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he did, by Jove,\" said Peter; \"just the sort of thing he would say, too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worse and worse,\" said Mr Beaver, \"and the next thing is this. Was he still here when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course no one knew the answer to this question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, if he was,\" continued Mr Beaver, \"then she\u0027ll simply sledge down in that direction and get between us and the Stone Table and catch us on our way down. In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that isn\u0027t what she\u0027ll do first,\" said Mrs Beaver, \"not if I know her. The moment that Edmund tells her that we\u0027re all here she\u0027ll set out to catch us this very night, and if he\u0027s been gone about half an hour, she\u0027ll be here in about another twenty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, Mrs Beaver,\" said her husband, \"we must all get away from here. There\u0027s not a moment to lose.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe-the-chronicles-of-narnia-1/page-8.html","bookId":2702,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:03 AM"}
