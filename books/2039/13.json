{"id":109345,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\u003cp\u003eYsabel couldn\u0027t be coaxed out of her room, no matter how hard I tried. I even sent Shaya to do it, seeing as she tended to be a bit more personable than I was. No luck. Ysabel remained firmly entrenched and would only ramble over and over about how she was going to tell her lord about me and escape this accursed place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvening wore on, and I couldn\u0027t drag myself back to Tucson. My feelings were in turmoil. I\u0027d never expected to feel guilty about anything pertaining to Ysabel, but there it was. And as more time passed, I didn\u0027t just feel bad about inadvertently suffocating her. As soon as I\u0027d realized what I had done, I knew I had to cease practicing this kind of magic immediately. Storm King had used it to kill his enemies in horrible ways. Kiyo had warned that delving further and further into my powers would put me on a path I might not be able to turn away from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet...that was the problem. I knew I had to stop...but I didn\u0027t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, I didn\u0027t want to learn air magic to kill. But after touching that power...I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about it. I found my mind spinning, analyzing the air around me and how easy it would be to manipulate it. What had started as a seemingly small lesson from Ysabel was quickly moving into larger and larger implications as I grasped more of air\u0027s patterns and how it worked. It was like I didn\u0027t even need a teacher. My own nature and pull toward magic was running away and creating its own lessons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy conflicted ruminations were interrupted when a letter arrived via the Otherworld\u0027s equivalent of the Pony Express. It was from Leith. As I\u0027d suspected, he\u0027d devoured the engineering books. What I hadn\u0027t expected was that he\u0027d already developed a plan for how to implement some of the irrigation systems and was going to accompany some workers out to Westoria in the morning to get started-unless I had any objections, of course. If I didn\u0027t, then he would be honored if I would come out to meet them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also added in his letter that he had investigated the towns near the Yellow River crossroads. None of them had any reports of missing girls. It figured, I thought. I either had enough bad luck to be the only monarch with runaway girls-or I possibly had an enemy specifically targeting me. Considering the number of gentry who resented my rule, the latter wouldn\u0027t have surprised me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless, I decided I had to go out to see Leith tomorrow. Even if it was just an elaborate attempt to woo me, he was still going to an awful lot of trouble with this. Plus, I hoped that if I spent the night here, Ysabel might finally emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I stayed over, giving me the opportunity to meditate with the land. While I noticed no ostensible difference in the morning, there was a strange, intangible feel to it.... It seemed healthier. Like always, I couldn\u0027t exactly articulate why. Perhaps most disturbing of all, I found that staying over wasn\u0027t quite the agonizing ordeal it used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was preparing to head out to see Leith when a guard announced that a rider was approaching. I wondered if it was a messenger-or possibly Leith himself. Instead, it was someone quite unexpected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe castle servants fell all over themselves to welcome the Oak King, and he swept inside as though perfectly entitled to it. Which, I guessed, he was. Nonetheless, I had no time for his antics today and greeted him with hands on my hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not today, Dorian. I have things to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As do I,\" he said. He had that typically laconic tone to his voice, but there was an oddly serious-and impatient-look in his eyes. It was not an expression I\u0027d seen very often. \"I\u0027ve come to see my subject. I knew you wouldn\u0027t welcome her with open arms, but honestly, my dear, your attempts at murder shock even me-no small feat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy jaw nearly dropped to the floor, both because of his assumption and the fact that she\u0027d somehow gotten a message out to him. \"Wha-? Dorian, it\u0027s not true! It was an accident. I didn\u0027t realize what I was doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I see her?\" he asked, not acknowledging my plea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hardly deny him that, and he hurried off to her room without another word. She admitted him-no surprise there-and I found myself pacing the entire time they were together. It had been bad enough that Ysabel had thought me capable of assault. But somehow...the idea of Dorian thinking badly of me? Well, it struck me harder. I shouldn\u0027t have cared what he thought-God knew I was mad at him more often than not. Yet, I realized that deep inside I wanted his good opinion. I felt sick to my stomach that I might have lost it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he emerged, his face was still serious. \"I believe I have convinced her that your intentions weren\u0027t murderous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sagged in relief-more, I think, because he appeared to believe me. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The question now is: do you want her to stay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will she?\" I asked, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She obeys me,\" he said simply. \"She\u0027ll stay and continue to teach if I tell her to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want anyone here against their will...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve assured her of her safety. She won\u0027t live in-much-fear of you. So, that\u0027s no longer the issue. The issue instead is if you want to continue with her teachings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t-not after...\" I stopped, realizing I was unsure of the words leaving my lips. I didn\u0027t want to be like Storm King. I didn\u0027t want a natural affinity for learning ways to kill people. And yet...I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about the way I\u0027d felt wielding that kind of power. Controlling water had given me a rush; air had doubled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian\u0027s gold-green eyes were watching me very carefully. \"I see,\" he said. \"Then I\u0027ll tell her she\u0027ll be staying a little longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to protest but couldn\u0027t. He returned to her, stayed a few more minutes, and then joined me in my parlor where I had resumed pacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" he said briskly, \"that is that.\" The grim set to his face was gone, and I found myself grateful to see the return of his usual mien. \"I noticed you were about to leave. Off to free humans from your subjects?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Off to free my subjects from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI explained my task, and his features lit up with interest. \"How convenient that I\u0027ll be traveling in the same direction. Unless you\u0027d like me to wait here until you return?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, the last thing I wanted was to encourage Dorian to make himself at home in my castle. So, I grudgingly conceded that he could go with me, partly because I still felt guilty and grateful over his intervention in the Ysabel incident. One bright side to him being with me was that Rurik decided I didn\u0027t need an entire retinue for the trip. He alone accompanied us, and I wondered idly how Dorian managed to go wherever he wanted without an entourage. I didn\u0027t like to think he was a more authoritative ruler than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t give me a hard time about this air thing,\" I warned. \"I don\u0027t want any spiels about how I\u0027m embracing my heritage and approaching my destiny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian smiled, eyes on the road ahead of us. \"I don\u0027t need to tell you things you already know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course...I suppose if I did get a better grip on my magic, I might be able to get rid of those fucking fire demons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see? I told you I don\u0027t need to say anything. You\u0027re finding ways to rationalize your use of magic all on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, this is a serious threat. You can\u0027t tell me you\u0027d be all casual if you had demons running loose in your kingdom.\" I frowned. \"Or would you? I got the impression a lot of rulers don\u0027t bother themselves with that kind of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian\u0027s eyes took on that serious glint again, despite the small smile on his face. \"Aeson didn\u0027t bother. Don\u0027t generalize to all of us. You know better. If I had demons in my land, I\u0027d lead a group out myself to obliterate them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if Dorian could. My potential power might be greater than his, but at the moment, his control and skill made him a more dangerous force than me. A ruler in the Otherworld had to be powerful, or else the land wouldn\u0027t accept them. It was a wonder I\u0027d been found worthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to help you?\" he asked when I remained silent. \"I\u0027ll go with you the next time you strike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would that cost me?\" I asked with an eye roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you assume everything I do has an ulterior motive? Isn\u0027t it enough I\u0027d want to help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said, not liking how his words made me feel bad. Was I attributing more insidious motives to him than he deserved? \"I don\u0027t trust anyone around here.\" Westoria was looming in the distance. \"I don\u0027t even trust Leith\u0027s engineering generosity. He\u0027s not doing this for the sake of trade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian\u0027s eyes lifted to the approaching village. \"That,\" he said, \"we can both agree on. No matter how much you beat yourself up over those demons, you have more than enough strength to bind the land to you.\" I hated his uncanny ability to guess my thoughts. \"When Katrice dies, the Rowan Land will either pass in entirety to someone with the power to control it, or it will divide itself and be subsumed into other kingdoms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shaya said the same thing-and that Leith thinks being hooked up with me would help keep it in the family.\" I shook my head. \"One land\u0027s bad enough. I don\u0027t have the power to control two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be surprised,\" he said ominously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur arrival was greeted with the same wonder and awe I\u0027d had before the demon incident. Apparently, yesterday\u0027s food shipments and Leith\u0027s presence today had reestablished my awesome reputation. Dorian seemed to have an effect as well. As we dismounted and walked through the village, the residents\u0027 eyes followed both of us, filled with admiration and wonder. Glancing at Dorian, I could understand their feelings. He strode through the dusty town just as he had my castle, confident and majestic, even after a hot and wearying ride. He looked like, well, a king, and even I couldn\u0027t help but admire his good looks. Beside him, I felt frumpy and insignificant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, I tried to pull back out of my glum thoughts and imagine what we must look like to these people, both of us tall and red-haired. We looked good together, I knew. I was in jeans, but I\u0027d cleaned up this morning, and my hair was down. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see where the sun lit it up, giving the red a golden hue that complemented Dorian\u0027s truer red. My tank top was blue, a good color for me, and I had on my usual gemstone jewelry. Perhaps most importantly, we carried our titles as king and queen, and to these people, I realized we were probably the equivalent of a Hollywood couple on the red carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your majesty! I\u0027m so glad you could-\" Leith had come running up to us and came to a total standstill when he saw Dorian. After a few stunned moments, he made a polite bow to the Oak King. \"Your majesty. Also a pleasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell Dorian was delighted to have ruined Leith\u0027s plans for a romantic interlude. \"Well, I hated to part from Eugenie this morning, so I thought I\u0027d come along and see what\u0027s new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to restrain myself from elbowing him. His wording implied that we\u0027d woken up together. Our former relationship was no secret, and Dorian had pitched his words loudly, so that some of the gathered villagers would hear. No doubt this would be all over the Otherworld by tonight. Leith looked even more dismayed than before, and I tried to smooth things over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you show us the project?\" I asked him. \"I don\u0027t think I can thank you enough for what you\u0027ve done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeith brightened and eagerly led us forward. As we walked, Dorian murmured in my ear, \"Believe me, he\u0027s more than sure you could thank him enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come you can allegedly do things for me without ulterior motives but no one else can?\" I hissed back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian only grinned as Leith headed toward the village\u0027s edge and showed us his handiwork. There was little to see of his irrigation system at this point. Mostly people were digging and laying out the foundation. Leith did his best to explain what it would develop into and even showed us blueprints-quaintly written on parchment. I followed them a little but could tell they were gibberish to Dorian, despite his polite and confident smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZealous or not, a prince of the Rowan Land was not about to do manual labor, and once the tour was done, he sat down with Dorian and me at the mayor\u0027s house. Davros seemed only too happy to keep offering his home as my hangout and eagerly served us wine before leaving his esteemed guests to discuss whatever it was royalty talked about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is only the beginning of what we can do,\" Leith said, positioning himself so that Dorian wasn\u0027t in his line of sight. \"I\u0027d love to come visit and discuss more ways to work through this. I\u0027ve got some ideas on how to construct buildings that will reflect light better. Have you ever considered redesigning your castle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yikes,\" I said. \"No. That\u0027d be a big feat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as big as you think. Not with the right help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head with a smile. \"Let\u0027s just focus on the people first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeith smiled back. \"Sure. But I will come by some day to show you some palace ideas-just in case you change your mind. Or, better yet, you should come visit us. Mother would love to show you the hospitality of the Rowan Land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or, better yet, you should throw the Thorn Queen a party,\" said Dorian, deadpan. \"I\u0027m sure she would love it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, I did elbow Dorian. Leith didn\u0027t notice. Dorian knew perfectly well I dreaded Otherworldly social events-particularly when the focus was on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really,\" I began. \"That\u0027s not-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course!\" said Leith. \"We haven\u0027t had a grand ball in quite a while. We could invite hundreds of people....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided then that elbowing wasn\u0027t severe enough. It was with great restraint that I didn\u0027t actually kick Dorian. He placed his own elbow on the table, resting his chin in his hand, appearing quite entertained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d have to outdo Maiwenn\u0027s party, to truly show Eugenie honor,\" said Dorian. \"That\u0027s going to be hard to do. Of course, Maiwenn has an unfair advantage with her maternal glow, eh? Eugenie was just telling me on the way here how all this baby talk is kindling longings of her own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choked on my wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love children too,\" Leith told me. \"I can\u0027t wait to have some-once I find the right woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was spared more of this when one of Leith\u0027s workers came in, anxious over some mishap. Leith looked devastated at the thought of abandoning me-and also embarrassed over me witnessing a flaw in his grand plans. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I hate to leave you. I\u0027m sure this will only take a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually,\" I said, rising. \"We should probably get going as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must you?\" he asked, face falling further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll see you soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" agreed Dorian. \"You should get moving on that ball. Or maybe I should just throw one for her....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeith totally fell for the baiting. \"No, no. I would be more than honored to.\" He swept me a bow, and I let him kiss my hand. \"I\u0027ll have news for you soon, I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and expressed my thanks and allowed him to kiss my hand again when he insisted. As soon as he was gone, I turned on Dorian. \"Are you trying to push me into his arms or away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ironically, doing one causes the other.\" He stretched and stifled a yawn. \"Were you telling the truth? Are you ready to leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I think so-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your majesty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavros stuck his head into the room, wearing his usual apologetic look. His eyes flicked nervously from Dorian to me. \"I\u0027m so sorry to bother you...I know you must be busy and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been found, your majesty. The missing girl? Her parents tracked her down last night but were afraid to tell you...she seemed so distraught. I only just found out myself. I told them you\u0027d want to know-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, I do.\" I was already moving toward the door, Dorian fast on my heels. \"Where are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill bobbing his head in obeisance, Davros hastily led us to a small home on the opposite side from Leith\u0027s construction. He beat impatiently on the door. \"Open up! The queen is here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost a minute passed before the door opened. The woman who had accosted me on my first visit peered out, eyes wide. \"Your majesty,\" she said humbly, inclining her head. She didn\u0027t seem to recognize Dorian. \"We-we didn\u0027t know you were here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to see her,\" I said impatiently. \"Let me talk to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman hesitated, fearful of me but also fearful of something else, apparently. Davros was undeterred. \"This is the Thorn Queen! Let her in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a gulp, the woman stepped aside. I found myself in a small but clean cottage, dimly lit thanks to all the curtains being drawn, though all the windows were open to allow a breeze. The woman\u0027s husband met us as we walked through the kitchen, his face pale and afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your majesty...forgive us. We were afraid to tell you. We were afraid she\u0027d run away again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to hurt her. I just want to talk to her.\" It was a bit depressing, between Ysabel and this family, knowing everyone was terrified of me. Ironically, before I\u0027d known about my gentry heritage, I\u0027d been proud of the fear I inflicted on Otherworldly inhabitants. \"Please take me to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Dorian\u0027s hand on my shoulder and his breath warm against my ear as he whispered, \"You do not need to say please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a quick exchange of looks, the couple led us to the back of the cottage, into a tiny bedroom. It too was darkened, and I could make out a slim girl lying on a bed. There was a washcloth on her forehead that fell off when she sat upright at our approach. She cringed against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it? I told you I didn\u0027t want to see anyone....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right, Moria,\" said her mother. \"This is the queen. She\u0027s come to talk to you. She\u0027s not going to hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl wilted even more, blond hair covering half of her face. \"No, no...She\u0027s come with the others, come with her human blood to bind us and kill us and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moria,\" I said gently, holding my hands out as one would under a white flag. \"She\u0027s right. I\u0027m not going to hurt you. I just want to talk to you. It won\u0027t take long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They all say that,\" Moria said, eyes wide with tears. \"They all say they won\u0027t hurt you...all the humans...you\u0027re no different...they all say they aren\u0027t....\" She lapsed into muttering too low for me to hear, her hands clinging to the covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" Dorian murmured to me, \"that her experience has left her...ah, a little touched. I doubt you\u0027ll get anything useful from her. There\u0027s a healer at Maiwenn\u0027s court who\u0027s particularly good with sickness of the mind. You should send for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a feeling he was right but had to make one more attempt. \"I just want to know where you\u0027ve been. Who took you. I want to make sure it doesn\u0027t happen again. Tell me who it is, and I\u0027ll stop them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she breathed. \"You\u0027re the same...the same as him...the Red Snake Man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Red Snake...\" I still had demons on the brain, and an image of their red and black mottled skin came to mind. Were they snake-like? \"Moria, were you taken by demons? Or some kind of...\" Hell, in the Otherworld, any monster you could imagine pretty much existed, as Smokey had shown us. \"...um, snake monster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head frantically. \"Our own kind don\u0027t hurt us. It\u0027s only yours...you\u0027re all the same...the human blood...all marked the same....\" Her eyes left my face and lowered. For a disorienting moment, I thought she was staring at my chest until I realized her gaze was on my arm. I absentmindedly touched the spot. It was where my snake tattoo coiled around my arm. Moria squeezed her eyes shut. \"All the same...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened. \"Did he...are you saying the person who took you had a tattoo like this on his arm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Red Snake Man,\" she whispered, still refusing to open her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he banish you? Did he force you to this world? Or did you come back on your own?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iron...iron everywhere...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared off at nothing for several seconds. \"I\u0027m done,\" I said, turning to her parents. \"She can rest now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left the house as swiftly as I\u0027d come in, Dorian matching my pace. \"What\u0027s going on? That meant something to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, heading toward where Rurik stood with our horses. \"I think I know who took her-and maybe the others. Not bandits or a monster. It was a human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of the tattoo.\" The Red Snake Man. I\u0027d seen a red snake tattoo just the other day-on Art. He\u0027d had that on one arm and a raven on the other. \"It\u0027s another shaman, one who lives very close to where the crossroads around here opens up in my world.\" He was also the shaman who had told me to my face he knew nothing about gentry girls. I came to a halt by the horses and absentmindedly stroked the side of mine. She looked back and sniffed me. \"But why? Why would he take a gentry girl? Or more than one? His job is to get them out of our world. I could see him banishing them out of the human world....That might traumatize her, but that doesn\u0027t sound like what happened. She disappeared from this world. She made it sound like she didn\u0027t want to be in the human world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian snorted. \"Eugenie, where in your jaded existence did you pick up this na\u0026amp;iuml;vete? If a human took one of our girls, it\u0027d be for the same reason we\u0027d take one of theirs. For the same reason any man would abduct a girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blanched at his implications. \"But more than one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wouldn\u0027t be the first man to prefer-ah, how shall we say it? Variety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t see it of Art, not the Art who happily tended his garden and offered us beer and pop. He\u0027d known Roland for years. They\u0027d worked together. Was Art truly a kidnapper and rapist? Or was the girl just traumatized from being banished? It could be a pretty horrific experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced, feeling a sharp twisting in my stomach. I\u0027d come too close to rape already in my life to treat even a hypothetical situation lightly. Was Moria a victim? Were there others like her out there? Maybe it wasn\u0027t truly Art...and yet, her words had dark implications. The human blood. A mark like mine. The Red Snake Man. The crossroads to Yellow River. He had to be involved; I just didn\u0027t know how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave the horse one last pat and then mounted. \"I have to get home,\" I said, turning back to Dorian and Rurik. There was some mistake here, some mix-up. Art wasn\u0027t involved in this. He couldn\u0027t be, at least not in the way Dorian had suggested. \"I have to talk to someone. Immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for the requisite Dorian joke, but none came as he mounted his own horse. \"Then we go different ways. Be careful, Eugenie.\" For some reason, frankness and concern from Dorian was more disconcerting than his usual banter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027m right about this, then it\u0027s a human matter. Should be a cakewalk compared to what I deal with around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian shook his head. \"I\u0027d have to disagree. Give me demons and restless spirits any day over human deceit. But if you need help, I\u0027m here. Just ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, there should have been a joke here. I glanced away, troubled by the way he looked at me. \"Thanks. Hopefully it\u0027ll be a simple matter.\" How exactly? That I didn\u0027t know. I wasn\u0027t sure that roughing Art up would really accomplish anything-if he truly was at fault here. \"See you later, Dorian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded by way of a farewell. Then: \"And of course, my dear, you may kill as many humans as you like, but please try not to harm any more of my subjects. If you can help it.\" There it was, at last. The joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noted,\" I said. I attempted a glare, but there was a smile on my lips as I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set a hard pace back to my castle and the gateway that would bring me back to my own world. Crossing over at the Yellow River one would have been faster, but I needed to go to my home in Tucson and prepare myself before facing Art. Rurik matched my pace easily and mercifully stayed silent. He\u0027d watched me and Dorian together the way a child watches his or her divorced parents, in the hopes that Mommy and Daddy might make amends someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy whirling thoughts made the trip go fast-as did the land\u0027s quick route today-and we were greeted with a commotion when we reached the castle\u0027s outer borders. A group of guards came tearing toward us, and my heart seized. What now? A siege? Demons? Kiyo? Yet as they got closer, I could see that the guards almost looked...enthusiastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your majesty! My lord! We found her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRurik and I drew our horses to a halt and climbed down. I felt my legs scream and knew I\u0027d be sore later. I wasn\u0027t so practiced a rider that I could ride like that without consequences. I ignored the pain and turned to the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have her. The girl. The runaway girl from Westoria,\" said the guard, clearly pleased at his success. Rurik and I exchanged puzzled glances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible. We already saw her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard shrugged. \"We found her out near the steppes, by the Rowan Land border. She matches the description and was clearly afraid of us. She tried to run away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take me to her,\" I said helplessly. Had my guards found another of these kidnapped girls? It would certainly provide more information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led us inside toward one of the little-used rooms, explaining that they hadn\u0027t wanted to put her in the dungeon-although her fear and desire to escape had required a guard. His expression turned uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We, um, also had to bind her in iron. She kept attempting magic. They\u0027re still not able to fully stop her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guard like this could never handle iron shackles without causing himself intense pain. Sometimes, though, prisoners would be bound in bronze cuffs with a tiny bit of iron affixed to them. It required delicate handling by the captors but was usually enough to stunt the prisoner\u0027s magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the room, and the men on duty stepped aside for us to enter. There, across the room, a slim young woman had her back to us. Long blond hair cascaded down her back, and I had a weird, disorienting sense for a moment as my brain grappled with the possibility that Moria had somehow made it here before us. Then, as the girl slowly turned around, the torchlight began bringing out glints of red in the golden hair that little Moria hadn\u0027t had. I realized what was happening even before I fully saw my prisoner\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have got to be kidding me,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Jasmine. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thorn-queen-dark-swan-2/page-13.html","bookId":2039,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:53 PM"}
