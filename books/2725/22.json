But you’re my little sister. You come first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis whole marriage idea—I’m sorry, but I think it’s stupid. If you guys love each other that much, you can wait a couple of years to be together. And if you can’t, you for sure shouldn’t be getting married.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt both touched and annoyed. Steven never said things like “You come first.” But then he called me stupid, which was more like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t expect you to understand,” I said. I folded then refolded another t-shirt. “Jeremiah wants you and Conrad to be his best men.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven’s face broke into a smile. “He does?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven looked really happy, but then he caught me looking at him, and he wiped his smile away. “I don’t think Mom will let me be in the wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Steven, you’re twenty-one years old. You can decide that for yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. I could tell I’d injured his pride. He said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I still don’t think it’s your smartest move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noted,” I said. “I’m still doing it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, man, Mom’s gonna kill me. I was supposed to talk you out of getting married, not get roped into the wedding,” Steven said, getting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hid my smile. That is, until Steven added, “Con and I had better start planning the bachelor party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly, I said, “Jere doesn’t want any of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven puffed up his chest. “You don’t get a say in it, Belly. You’re a girl. This is man stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Man stuff?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, he shut my door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite what I’d said to Steven, I still found myself waiting for my mother. Waiting for her to come around, waiting for her to give in. I didn’t want to start planning the wedding until she said yes. But when days passed and she refused to discuss it, I knew I couldn’t wait any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God for Taylor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brought over a big white binder with clippings from wedding magazines and checklists and all kinds of stuff. “I was saving this for my wedding, but we can use it for yours, too,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I had was one of my mother’s yellow legal pads. I had written wedding at the top and made a list of things I needed to do. The list looked pretty skimpy, next to Taylor’s binder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were sitting on my bed, papers and bride magazines all around us. Taylor was all business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, “First things first. We have to find you a dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust is really, really soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t feel that soon,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it is. Two months to plan a wedding is nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn weddingspeak that’s, like, tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I guess since the wedding is going to be simple, the dress should be too,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor frowned. “How simple?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really simple. As simple as it gets. Nothing poofy or frou frou.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded to herself. “I can picture it. It’s very Cindy Crawford wedding-on- the-beach, very Carolyn Bessette.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, sounds good,” I said. I had no idea what either of their wedding dresses looked like. I didn’t even know who Carolyn Bessette was. After I had the dress, it would feel more real, I would be able to visualize it happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now it still felt too abstract.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about shoes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her a look. “Like I’m gonna wear heels on the beach. I can barely walk in heels on level ground.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor ignored me. “What about my bridesmaid dress?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed some magazines onto the carpet so I could lie down. I stretched my legs as high as I could and put my feet up on the wall. “I was thinking mustard yellow. Maybe in a satiny kind of material.” Taylor hated mustard yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mustard yellow satin,” Taylor repeated, nodding and trying hard to keep the disgust off her face. I could tell she was torn between her vanity and her credo, which was, the Bride is always right. “That could maybe work with Anika’s skin tone. I’m more of a spring, but if I started tanning now, it could work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “I’m kidding. You can wear whatever you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dork!” she said, looking relieved. She slapped my thigh. “You’re so immature! I can’t believe you’re getting married!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me neither.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I guess it makes sense, in a Twilight Zone kind of way. You’ve known each other for, like, a grillion years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s meant to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long is a grillion years?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s forever.” In the air she spelled out my initials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“B.C. + J.F. forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forever,” I echoed happily. Forever I could do. Me and Jere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my way out to meet Taylor at the mall the next day, I stopped by my mother’s office. “I’m going to look for a dress,” I said, standing in her doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped typing and looked over at me. “Good luck,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.” I supposed there were worse things she could have said than “good luck,” but the thought didn’t make me feel any better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe formal-wear store at the mall was packed with girls looking for prom dresses with their mothers. I didn’t expect to feel the pang in my chest when I saw them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGirls were supposed to go wedding dress shopping with their mothers. They were supposed to step out of the dressing room in just the right dress, and the mother would tear up and say, “That’s the one.” I was pretty sure that was the way it was supposed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t it a little late in the year for prom?” I asked Taylor. “Wasn’t ours in, like, May?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My sister told me they had to push back prom this year because of some scandal with the assistant principal,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe explained. “All the prom money went missing or something. So now it’s a grom. Graduation-prom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “Grom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Also, the private schools always have their prom later, remember? Collegiate, St. Joe’s.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-22.html","bookId":2725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM"}
