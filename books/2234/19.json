HE WAS SHORT, WITH a crooked spine, bushy hair and eyebrows, and spoke in a brittle voice of maturity. His crinkly features, gaunt cheeks, coarsened hair, and veined hands all belonged to age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henrik Thorvaldsen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew the name. One of the wealthiest men in Europe. A Dane. But what was he doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktor instantly reacted to the visitor, pointing his weapon. She reached over and restrained him, her eyes saying, Let\u0027s see what he wants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I of you. Risen from Soviet bureaucrat to a forger of nations. Quite an achievement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t in the mood for compliments. \"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older man shuffled close to the wooden box. \"Did you really think Alexander the Great was in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis man knew her business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, adventurer, for my immortal voice, though far off, fills your ears, hear my words. Sail onto the capital founded by Alexander\u0027s father, where sages stand guard. Touch the innermost being of the golden illusion. Divide the phoenix. Life provides the measure of the grave. Be wary, for there is but one chance of success.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought to conceal her shock at Thorvaldsen\u0027s recitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis man truly did know her business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think you\u0027re the only one who knows?\" he asked. \"How pompous are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed Viktor\u0027s gun and leveled the barrel at Thorvaldsen. \"Enough to shoot you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE WAS CONCERNED. HE AND CASSIOPEIA WERE FIFTY FEET up and three quarters of a football field away from where Thorvaldsen was challenging Irina Zovastina while Viktor watched. Michener had brought them into the basilica via the west atrium and led them to a steep stairway. At its top, the walls, arches, and domes reflected the architecture below, but instead of a stunning marble facade and glinting mosaics, the basilica\u0027s upper-story museum and gift shop were encased only by brick walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is he doing here?\" Malone muttered. \"He just called you outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were huddled behind a stone balustrade, beyond which was a panoramic view of the towering vaulted domes, each resting on massive marble pillars. Golden ceiling mosaics shimmered from incandescent lamps-the marble floor and unlit side chapels cast in varying shades of black and gray. The presbytery, at the far end, where Thorvaldsen stood, loomed like a bright stage in a dark theater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to answer me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia stayed silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two are about to piss me off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henrik may have bit off more than he can chew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not going to shoot him. At least not until she knows why he\u0027s here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why is he here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey needed to shift position. \"How about we move over there.\" He pointed left to the north transept and another gallery that overlooked the presbytery. \"This museum winds around that way. We\u0027ll be closer and can hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe motioned right. \"I\u0027ll go that way. There\u0027s surely an opening to the upper south transept from here. That way we\u0027ll be on either side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVIKTOR\u0027S HEART RACED. FIRST THE WOMAN, NOW THE SUPPOSED museum owner. Surely the second man was also alive. And probably nearby. Yet he noticed Thorvaldsen paid him no mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a hint of recognition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZOVASTINA STARED DOWN THE GUN\u0027S SIGHTS AT THORVALDSEN.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize you\u0027re a pagan,\" the Dane calmly said. \"But would you shoot me, here, on the altar of a Christian church?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know Ptolemy\u0027s riddle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ely told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered the weapon and appraised her intruder. \"How did you know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He and my son were close. Ever since they were children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is it important to find the tomb of Alexander the Great?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there any reason I would discuss that with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see if I can provide you with some. At present you possess nearly thirty zoonoses that you\u0027ve harvested from a variety of exotic animals, many of which you stole from zoos and other private collections. You have at least two biological weapons laboratories at your disposal, one operated by your government, the other by Philogen Pharmaceutique, a corporation controlled by a man named Enrico Vincenti. Both of you are also members of the Venetian League. Am I making any progress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re still breathing, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen smiled in seeming satisfaction. \"For which I\u0027m grateful. You also have a formidable military. Nearly a million troops. One hundred and thirty fighter jets. Various transports and support aircraft, adequate bases, an excellent communications network-everything an ambitious despot would need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t like that Viktor was listening, but she desperately needed to hear more, so she turned to him and said, \"Find out what the other two guards are doing, and make sure we\u0027re alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE OTHER TWO?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone heard the words as he assumed a position behind another stone railing, this one high above the presbytery, less than a hundred fifty feet above Thorvaldsen and Zovastina. Cassiopeia was fifty yards across the nave, in the south transept, with an equally high perch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t see her, but he hoped she\u0027d heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZOVASTINA WAITED UNTIL VIKTOR LEFT, THEN GLARED AT THORVALDSEN. \"Is there a problem with wanting to defend my nation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beware the toils of war. Soon they\u0027ll raze your sturdy citadel to the roots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What Sarpedon said to Hector in the Iliad. You have studied me. Let me offer a quotation. Nor do I think you\u0027ll find us short on courage, long as our strength will last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not planning on defending anything. You\u0027re preparing an attack. Those zoonoses are offensive. Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India. Only one man ever conquered them. Alexander the Great. And he could only hold the land for just a handful of years. Ever since, conquerors have tried and failed. Even the Americans attempted with Iraq. But you, Supreme Minister, you intend to best them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe possessed a leak-a massive one. She needed to return home and resolve that problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to do what Alexander did, only in reverse. Not the West conquering the East. This time the East will dominate. You intend to acquire all of your neighbors. And you actually believe the West will allow you the luxury, thinking you\u0027ll be their friend. But you don\u0027t plan to stop there, do you? The Middle East and Arabia, you want those, too. You have oil. The old Kazakhstan is rich with it. But you sell most of that to Russia and Europe cheap. So you want a new source, one that would give you even greater world power. Your zoonoses might just make all that possible. You could devastate a nation in a matter of days. Bring it to its knees. None of your potential victim-states are particularly adept at war in the first place, and when your germs finish, they\u0027ll be defenseless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still held the gun. \"The West should welcome that change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We prefer the devils we know. And contrary to all those Arab states\u0027 varied beliefs, the West isn\u0027t their enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed straight at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE LISTENED CAREFULLY. THORVALDSEN WAS NO FOOL, SO HE was challenging Zovastina for a reason. The Dane even being here was highly unusual. The last trip the man took was to Austria last fall. Yet here he was, inside an Italian basilica in the middle of the night, poking sticks into the spokes of an armed despot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d watched as Viktor left the presbytery and turned into the south transept, below Cassiopeia\u0027s position. Malone\u0027s immediate concern was an open stairway twenty feet away that led down to the nave. If there was a portal on this side, in the north transept, surely another opened in the south since medieval builders, if nothing else, loved symmetry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was surrounded by more undressed masonry walls along with art, tapestries, lace, and paintings, most displayed in glass cases or on tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow appeared in the lighted stairway and danced across the marble walls, growing in size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Zovastina\u0027s guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing to the second floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStraight for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTEPHANIE FOLLOWED MONSIGNOR MICHENER DOWN THE HALLS of the diocese offices, into a nondescript cubicle, where Edwin Davis sat beneath a framed portrait of the pope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still want to kick my ass?\" Davis asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was too tired to fight. \"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying to stop a war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to hear it. \"You realize there could be trouble inside that church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is why you\u0027re not in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealization dawned. \"Malone and Cassiopeia can be denied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that. We have no idea what Zovastina may do, but I didn\u0027t want the head of the Magellan Billet involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d stay here if I were you,\" Davis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Screw off, Edwin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichener blocked her way in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you part of this insanity?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I said outside, we came across something and passed it on to a place we thought might be interested. Irina Zovastina is a threat to the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s planning a war,\" Davis said. \"Millions will die, and she\u0027s just about ready to start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back. \"So she took the time to risk a trip to Venice and look at a two-thousand-year-old body? What is she doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably getting angry,\" Michener said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw a twinkle in his eye. \"You set her up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest shook his head. \"She did that all by herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody\u0027s going to get shot in there. Cassiopeia is way beyond the end of her rope. You don\u0027t think gunfire is going to attract the attention of all those police out in the square?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The basilica\u0027s walls are several feet thick,\" Michener said. \"Totally soundproof. No one will disturb them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stephanie,\" Davis said, \"we\u0027re not sure why Zovastina took the chance coming here. But it\u0027s obviously important. We thought since she was so intent on coming, we\u0027d accommodate her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get the point. Out of her sandbox and into ours. But you have no right to place Malone and Cassiopeia in jeopardy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come now. I didn\u0027t do that. Cassiopeia was already involved, with Henrik Thorvaldsen-who, by the way, involved you. And Malone? He\u0027s a big boy and can do what he wants. He\u0027s here because he wants to be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re fishing for information. Hoping to learn something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And using the only bait we have. She\u0027s the one who wanted a look inside that tomb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie was puzzled. \"You seem to know her overall plan. What are you waiting for? Move on her. Bomb her installations. Shut her down. Bring political pressures on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that simple. Our information is sketchy. And we have no concrete proof. Certainly not anything she can\u0027t simply deny. You can\u0027t bomb biologicals. And, unfortunately, we don\u0027t know it all. That\u0027s what we need Malone and the others to zero in on for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edwin, you don\u0027t know Cotton. He doesn\u0027t like to be played.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know Naomi Johns is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d held that one for the right moment, and the words pounded her gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was stuffed into a coffin with another man, a small-time hood from Florence. Her neck was broken and he had a bullet to the head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vincenti?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavis nodded. \"Who\u0027s also on the move. He left earlier for the Central Asian Federation. An unscheduled visit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see he knew even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just kidnapped a woman that Irina Zovastina has been caring for since last year, a woman that she was once romantically involved with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zovastina\u0027s a lesbian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t that be a shocker to her People\u0027s Assembly? She and this woman were involved for a long time. But her former lover is dying of AIDS, and Vincenti apparently has a use for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s a reason you\u0027re allowing Vincenti to do whatever it is he\u0027s doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s up to something, too. And it\u0027s more than just supplying Zovastina with germs and antiagents. It\u0027s more than providing the Venetian League with a safe haven for all their business activities. We want to know what that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother priest appeared in the office doorway and said, \"We just heard a shot, from inside the basilica.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE DOVE BEHIND ONE OF THE DISPLAY CASES AS THE GUARDSMAN fired. He\u0027d tried to hide before the man topped the stairs, but apparently a fleeting glance of his retreat was enough to generate an attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bullet thudded into one of the tables that displayed medieval textiles. The laminated wood deflected the round and allowed Malone the instant he needed to scurry farther into the shadows. The gunshot echoed through the basilica and had surely attracted everyone\u0027s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrambled across slick hardwood, taking refuge behind a long exhibit of panel paintings and illuminated manuscript pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gun was ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed to draw the man farther in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich didn\u0027t seem a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps were coming his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZOVASTINA HEARD THE SHOT FROM THE UPPER NORTH TRANSEPT. She spotted movement to her right, beyond the stone railing, and saw the head of one of her guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t come alone,\" Thorvaldsen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her gun aimed at the Dane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"San Marco is littered with police. Going to be tough for you to leave. You\u0027re a head of state, in a foreign country.

He was a great tactician. And clever. The Gordian knot, for example.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called out, \"What\u0027s happening up there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer guardsman did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the village of Gordium,\" Thorvaldsen was saying, \"that complicated knot attached to a wagon. Nobody could untie the thing. A challenge Alexander solved by simply cutting the rope with his sword, then untying it.

One says Alexander withdrew a pole connected to the wagon yoke, found the rope ends, and untied it. So who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was tiring of this man\u0027s rambles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHead of state or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFIFTY-FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSAMARKAND\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincenti remembered the first indication of a problem.

Let me out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d tied the idiot down knowing their options were limited. \"We can\u0027t leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Screw policy. Screw you. Cut these damn ropes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEaston stiffened, his breath grew labored, then he succumbed to the fever and relaxed into unconsciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincenti turned from the cot and grabbed a notebook that he\u0027d started three weeks back, the first page labeled with his partner\u0027s name. Inside, he\u0027d noted a progressive shift in skin color. Normal, to jaundiced, to such ashiness that the man now appeared dead. There\u0027d been an incredible weight loss, forty pounds all told, ten over one two-day period alone, the intestinal intake dwindling to an occasional gulp of warm water and a few sips of liquor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the fever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA raging torrent of a constant one hundred and three, sometimes peaking higher, moisture escaping faster than it was being replaced, the body literally evaporating before his eyes. For years they\u0027d used animals in their research, Baghdad providing an endless supply of gibbons, baboons, green monkeys, rodents, and reptiles. But here, for the first time, the effects on a human being could be accurately gauged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared down at his partner. Easton\u0027s chest heaved with more labored breaths, mucus rattling deep in the throat, sweat beading off the skin like rain. He noted every observation in the journal, then pocketed the pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood from the cot and tried to work some feeling into his rubbery legs. He lumbered outside into a crisp night. He wondered how much more Easton \u0027s ravaged tissues could take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich raised the problem of what to do with the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo protocol existed for handling this type of emergency, so he\u0027d have to improvise. Luckily, the station\u0027s builders had thoughtfully provided an incinerator for disposing of the animal carcasses used in experimentation. But making the oven work on something as large as a human body was going to take ingenuity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see angels. They\u0027re here. All around,\" Easton cried from the cot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincenti walked back inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEaston was now blind. He wasn\u0027t sure if the fever or a secondary infection had destroyed the retina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God\u0027s here. I see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Charlie. I\u0027m sure you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a pulse. Blood snapped through the carotid artery. He listened to the heart, which pounded like a drum. He checked blood pressure. On the verge of bottoming. The body temperature was a steady one hundred and three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I tell God?\" Easton asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared down at his partner. \"Say hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled a chair close and watched death take hold. The end came twenty minutes later and seemed neither violent nor painful. Just a final breath. Deep. Long. No exhale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noted the date and time in the journal, then extracted a blood and tissue sample. He then rolled the thin mattress and filthy sheets around the body and carried the stinking bundle out of the building into an adjacent shed. A scalpel was already there, sharpened to the degree of broken glass, along with a surgeon\u0027s saw. He slipped on a pair of thick rubber gloves and sawed the legs from the torso. The emaciated flesh cut soft and loose, the bone brittle, the intervening muscle offering the resistance of a boiled chicken. He amputated both arms and stuffed all four limbs into the incinerator, watching with no emotion as the flames consumed them. Without extremities, the torso and head fit easily through the iron door. He then cut the bloodied mattress into quarters and quickly stuffed it, the sheets, and gloves into the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed the portal shut and staggered outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver. Finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fell to the rocky ground and stared up at the night. Against the indigo backdrop of a mountain sky, silhouetted as an even darker shadow, the incinerator\u0027s brick flue reached skyward. Smoke escaped, carrying with it the stench of human flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lay back and welcomed sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincenti recalled that sleep from over twenty-five years ago. And Iraq. What hell. Hot and miserable. A lonely, desolate spot. What had the UN Commission concluded after the first Gulf War? Given their mission, the facilities were wholly archaic, but within the frantic atmosphere of the time they were thought state of the art. Right. Those inspectors weren\u0027t there. He was. Young and skinny with a head full of hair and brains. A hotshot virologist. He and Easton had eventually been detailed to a remote lab in Tajikistan, working in conjunction with the Soviets who controlled the region, at a station hidden away in the Pamir foothills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many viruses and bacteria had they searched for? Natural organisms that could be used as biological weapons. Something that eliminated an enemy yet preserved a culture\u0027s infrastructure. No need to bomb the population, waste bullets, risk nuclear contamination, or put troops in jeopardy. A microscopic organism could do all of the heavy lifting-simple biology the catalyst for certain defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe working criteria for whatever they found had been simple. Fast-acting. Biologically identifiable. Containable. And, most important, curable. Hundreds of strains were discarded simply because no practical way could be found to stop them. What good would infecting an enemy be if you couldn\u0027t protect your own population? All four criteria had to be satisfied before a specimen was cataloged. Nearly twenty had made the grade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d never accepted what the press reported after the Biological Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972-that the United States quit the germ-warfare business and destroyed all of its arsenals. The military wouldn\u0027t discard decades of research simply because a few politicians unilaterally decided it was the thing to do. At least a few of those organisms, he believed, were hidden in cold storage at some nondescript military institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe personally found six pathogens that met all of the criteria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sample 65-G failed on every count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe first discovered it in 1979, within the bloodstream of the green monkeys that had been shipped for experimentation. Conventional science then would never have noticed, but thanks to his unique virology training, and special equipment the Iraqis provided, he found it. A strange-looking thing-spherical-filled with RNA and enzymes. Expose it to air and it evaporated. In water, the cell wall collapsed. Instead, it craved warm plasma and seemed prevalent throughout all of the green monkeys that came his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet none of the animals seemed affected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie Easton, though, had been another matter. Damn fool. He\u0027d been bitten two years prior by one of the monkeys, but told no one until three weeks before he died, when the first symptoms appeared. A blood sample confirmed 65-G roamed through him. He\u0027d eventually used Easton \u0027s infection to study the viral effects on humans, concluding the organism was not an efficient biological weapon. Too unpredictable, sporadic, and far too slow to be an effective offensive agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazing how ignorant he\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA miracle he\u0027d survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was back in his hotel room at the Intercontinental, dawn coming slowly to Samarkand. He needed to rest, but was still energized from his encounter with Karyn Walde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought again about the old healer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it 1980? Or \u002781?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Pamirs, about two weeks before Easton died. He\u0027d visited the village several times before, trying to learn what he could. The old man was surely dead by now. Even then he was well up in age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man scampered barefoot up the liver-colored slope with the agility of a cat, on feet with soles like leather. Vincenti followed and, even through heavy boots, his ankles and toes ached. Nothing was flat. Rocks arched everywhere like speed breakers, sharp, unforgiving. The village lay a mile back, nearly a thousand feet above sea level, their current journey taking them even higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was a traditional healer, a combination family practitioner, priest, fortune teller, and sorcerer. He knew little English but could speak passable Chinese and Turkish. He was a near-dwarf with European features and a forked Mongol beard. He wore a gold-threaded quilt and a bright skullcap. Back in the village, Vincenti had watched while the man treated the villagers with a concoction of roots and plants, meticulously administered with an intelligence born from decades of trial and error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" he finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To answer your question and find what will stop the fever in your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround him, a stadium of white peaks formed a gallery of untouched heights. Thunder clouds steamed from the highest summits. Streaks of silvers and autumnal reds and dense groves of walnut trees added color to the otherwise mummified scene. A rush of water could be heard somewhere far off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came to a ledge and he followed the old man through a purple vein in the rock. He knew from his studies that the mountains around him were still alive, slowly pushing upward about two and a half inches a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey exited into an oval-shaped arena, walled in by more stone. Not much light inside, so he found the flashlight the old man had encouraged him to bring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo pools dotted the rock floor, each about ten feet in diameter, one bubbling with the froth of thermal energy. He brought the light close and noticed their contrasting color. The active one was a russet brown, its calm companion a sea foam green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fever you describe is not new,\" the old man said. \"Many generations have known that animals deliver it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo learn more about the yaks, the sheep, and the huge bears that populated the region was one of the reasons he\u0027d been sent. \"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We watch. But only sometimes do they pass the fever. If your friend has the fever, this will help.\" He pointed to the green pool, its still surface marred only by an array of floating plants. They looked like water lilies, only bushier, the center flower straining through the shade for precious drops of sunlight. \"The leaves will save him. He must chew them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dabbed the water and brought two moist fingers to his mouth. No taste. He half expected the hint of carbonate found in other springs of the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man knelt and gulped a cupped handful. \"It is good,\" he said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drank, too. Warm, like a cup of tea, and fresh. So he slurped more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The leaves will cure him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed to know. \"Is this plant common?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man nodded. \"Only ones from this pool work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not know. Perhaps divine will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doubted that. \"Is this known to other villages? Other healers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the only one who uses it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached down and pulled one of the floating pods closer, assessing its biology. It was a tracheophyta, the leaves peltate with the stalk and filled with an elaborate vascular system. Eight thick, pulpous stipules surrounded the base and formed a floating platform. The epidermal tissue was a dark green, the leaf walls full of glucose. A short stem projected from the center and probably acted as a photosynthetic surface because of the limited leaf space. The flower\u0027s soft white petals were arranged in a whorl and emitted no fragrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced underneath. A raccoon tail of stringy, brown roots extended out in the water, searching for nutrients. From all appearances, it seemed a well-adapted species.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you learn that it worked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father taught me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the plant from the water and cradled the pod. Warm water seeped through his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The leaves must be chewed completely, the juice swallowed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke off a clump and brought it to his mouth. He looked at the old man-rapier eyes staring back quiet and confident. He stuffed the leaf in his mouth and chewed. The taste was bitter, sharp, like alum-and terrible, like tobacco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe extracted the juice and swallowed, almost gagging. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-venetian-betrayal-cotton-malone-3/page-19.html","bookId":2234,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM"}
