Lin Ming sneered. He took out Gongyang Bonesmash and Soul Thousandmile’s spatial rings from his Extreme Violet Ring. Then, he took one back and said, “I can acknowledge that you played some part in everything. Since that’s the case, fine, of the two spatial rings I will take one and the other I will give to you.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming spoke, the disciples around White Mirrorjade became enraged. “You simply don’t know what’s good for you. Senior-apprentice Brother White isn’t haggling with you and yet you are trying to climb all over him! You want to take one? Even if the heavily wounded Soul Thousandmile and Gongyang Bonesmash were killed by you, you still relied on the team to kill them. What rights do you have to take one?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Senior-apprentice Brother White, this dastardly fellow simply doesn’t know what death or danger is. You should just deal with him according to the sect rules. With Senior-apprentice Brother White’s strength, doing so would be beyond easy! If one dares to defy orders in a mystic realm, that was originally a capital crime to begin with! The Council of Elders will not say anything about it.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany disciples complained. As for White Mirrorjade, he gloomily looked at Lin Ming. He could indeed deal with Lin Ming by using the excuse that Lin Ming was disobeying a command, but now was not the time for infighting. For one, they hadn’t completely escaped danger, and he also didn’t know just what hidden strength Lin Ming had.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Whatever. I’ll let you jump around for some hours and then after I leave the Red Desolate Mystic Realm I’ll have the support of a Highest Elder. I wonder just how you’ll jump then.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhite Mirrorjade thought like this as he reached out to take the spatial ring in Lin Ming’s hand. But, just as he was about to touch the spatial ring, a brilliant purple light suddenly flashed in Lin Ming’s eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that moment, Lin Ming became a human bomb. His aura suddenly erupted!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEight Inner Hidden Gates, first six gates open!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBlood of the Ancient Phoenix, burn!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHeretical God Force, open!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith an explosive sound, the several disciples around White Mirrorjade were sent soaring backwards by the terrifying shockwaves!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn just a split instant, Lin Ming had already thrust out the Phoenix Blood Spear he had prepared. The spear howled forth with 999 small blood spears flying outwards. An incomparably strong fire-attribute true essence flooded the Phoenix Blood Spear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBlue Lotus Flame Dance!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was a killing move right from the start, and this was also a surprise attack!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor someone like White Mirrorjade, Lin Ming’s first idea had been to kill him from the start. However, there were too many disciples around White Mirrorjade, and if he directly attacked then Ye Rosewater might not support him and might even try to stop him. Thus, he chose to kill him in a close range surprise attack. This was the quickest method to kill White Mirrorjade without giving him the smallest chance to run. This sort of person had inherited the legacy of an unknown powerhouse and likely had many life-saving methods, so this was the best method.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You!” White Mirrorjade’s eyes widened. He never imagined Lin Ming would suddenly have the gall to do this. He wanted to kill him in front of everyone else? Was he insane!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn such an important matter, even Ye Rosewater wouldn’t dare to conceal the truth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn just a split-second, White Mirrorjade wasn’t able to think too much. He drew backwards, taking out his top-grade saint artifact sword from his spatial ring and meeting Lin Ming’s attack.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, White Mirrorjade wasn’t stronger than Lin Ming to begin with and he had even consumed a great deal of his energy and was wounded all over. Moreover, he was unprepared for this. Facing Lin Ming’s surprise Blue Lotus Flame Dance, the results could be imagined!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe sword light shattered and Lin Ming’s spear light continued onwards, unstoppable. White Mirrorjade stuffily coughed as his protective true essence shattered. He spat out a mouthful of blood and flew backwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhite Mirrorjade’s clothes had been torn apart, revealing a top grade saint artifact vestment. However, this vestment had only been able to block 60-70% of the Phoenix Blood Spear’s strength. The remaining 30-40% roared into White Mirrorjade’s meridians and a blazing fire-attribute true essence mercilessly raced through him. White Mirrorjade’s entire body was in excruciating pain and his pupils contracted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, you are courting death!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The one to die will be you!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming coldly said. He opened the Gate of Wonder and activated the Mystic Lightning Shade. Immediately, his body turned into an afterimage as he shot straight towards White Mirrorjade, intending on dealing the killing blow!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYe Rosewater, Xiao Raingem, and the others were all stunned. They never thought that Lin Ming would suddenly attack like this!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for the disciples around White Mirrorjade, they were all left dumbfounded. Everything had happened so fast that they weren’t able to clearly figure out just what happened.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the previous moment, White Mirrorjade had been an invincible existence. But now, that invincible existence had been struck to the point of vomiting blood by Lin Ming, a mere eighth stage Life Destruction martial artist.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough it was a surprise attack, to a top master with an extremely quick response time, a surprise attack didn’t give too much of an advantage. This was because in order for Lin Ming to ensure his surprise attack was a success, he inevitably couldn’t gather up his potential and use the strongest strike he could.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Senior-apprentice Brother White!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Protect Senior-apprentice Brother White!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJust as those disciples started to react, Lin Ming had already rushed towards White Mirrorjade for the second time. At this time, a tyrannical fire-attribute true essence was rampaging through White Mirrorjade’s body. Lin Ming had managed to fuse three different level Concepts of Fire, and now the tenacity of his fire-attribute was extremely strengthened. Wasn’t getting rid of it easier said than done?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming!” White Mirrorjade’s eyes flashed with a dire light. “Do you want to perish with me!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Don’t be an idiot. Just you alone are unworthy!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s spear came smashing down. His entire body emitted loud popping sounds; this was the strength of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates’ first six gates!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAgainst this spear, White Mirrorjade forcefully withstood the fire-attribute true essence tearing through his body. He sent out several sword energies to ward off Lin Ming, but Lin Ming thought little of it. Lin Ming brought his spear down again and again, his speed reaching an inconceivable level, each spear stronger than the last!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhite Mirrorjade’s sword wasn’t slow. It was just that every time he blocked Lin Ming’s spear, it caused the blood to tumble in his body. There was just no time to fully suppress the fire-attribute true essence in his body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Damnit!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhite Mirrorjade was breathless with anger. Lin Ming seemed to have already calculated everything. He had caught the advantage with the first blow and had made it so that he couldn’t recover! He had discovered that Lin Ming’s spear strikes became increasingly strong, whereas he was finding it more and more difficult to resist!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Fuck!

Their condition wasn’t much better and each one of them didn’t even have 50% of their true essence remaining, and several of them were also wounded.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming sneered. With a thought, a red lotus began to slowly bloom behind him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHeavenly Demon force field – grandmist space!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs all of the surrounding martial artists were covered in the grandmist space, they immediately felt their strength constantly being drained from their bodies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the same time, Lin Ming’s gold battle spirit also howled forth, forming a world of will projection. His battle spirit formed substantialized spikes of willpower that shot towards White Mirrorjade’s minions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePuff!

Although Lin Ming didn’t want to take their lives, he didn’t show mercy in his attacks either. Every willpower thorn shattered their protective true essence and stabbed into their chest or stomach. Some people were even pierced through! However, to a martial artist, as long as their heart, throat, and brain weren’t wounded then it wouldn’t be fatal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ahhh!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese disciples emitted heart-rending cries of pain.

As he released the grandmist space and world of will protection, he also viciously charged after White Mirrorjade. Not only did his onslaught of attacks not stop, but they even became stronger.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was the advantage of a deep true essence base brought by the dragon marrow blood. It allowed him to continue releasing the extremely energy-consuming grandmist space as well as to display his full striking power. In other words, the true essence inherent within Lin Ming was like a vast and limitless void. At his boundary, it was difficult to ever use it up!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut as for White Mirrorjade, his situation became increasingly bad.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng peng peng peng peng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, Lin Ming had already struck out his spear 99 times; this was his 100th attack!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Celestial Tyrant Manual’s Hundred Layered Waves!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s 99 spear strikes hadn’t been arbitrary; he had been gathering strength with each attack. The goal was this last spear. Following the attack technique recorded within the ‘Celestial Tyrant Manual’, this strike completed the Hundred Layered Waves, increasing his striking power by several times!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming thrust out his spear, the compressed true essence within the Heretical God Sprout completely erupted. A terrifying true essence gushed out, overwhelming the world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of White Mirrorjade’s minions were stopped by the battle spirit projection and the grandmist space. As for Ye Rosewater and those with her, they were all still watching in a daze. In this situation, they really had no idea what to do.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming!

In this life or death moment, he suddenly bit down on his tongue and spat out blood essence onto his sword. At the same time, he combusted the blood essence that the ancient supreme elder had left behind on this top grade saint artifact sword.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a situation where he was in horrible shape, White Mirrorjade had paid the tremendous price of burning dual blood essences to instantly restore his strength to the peak state, and even some above that!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFacing this strike, Lin Ming didn’t care at all. He directly rushed at White Mirrorjade’s sword light, thrusting out with the Phoenix Blood Spear at the same time. This was a completely suicidal attack!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, be careful!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYe Rosewater blurted out.

These words were all subconsciously spoken.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for White Mirrorjade’s minions, all of them were panic-stricken. In the face of such a terrifying strike, all of them ignored their severe wounds and ran away. Because they had attacked Lin Ming just now, they were too close to the battlefield. At such a distance, they wouldn’t be able to withstand the shockwaves.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That’s Lin Ming? Does he really have an eighth stage Life Destruction cultivation? How could he possibly send out such an attack?!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Too terrifying! He is a demon!

However, before they could think further, the horrifying explosion swallowed them all, lighting up the endless horizons. The blood red land was sundered in half and the endless red sand surged outwards like giant tsunami waves.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany of White Mirrorjade’s minions felt as if they had been struck by a massive iron ball. They were sent flying backwards, blood spurting out all over their bodies before being enveloped in the waves of red sand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYe Rosewater and the others were standing very far away. Even so, they were forced back again and again by the shockwaves and had no choice but to use their own attacks to block the terrifyingly powerful red sands.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter stabilizing herself with great difficulty and repelling the sand around her, Ye Rosewater looked forwards to see that on top of the battlefield, White Mirrorjade’s chest had been smashed in by Lin Ming’s spear. Nearly all of his ribs had been shattered and one of his arms was dangling uselessly, nearly crushed to a pulp.
