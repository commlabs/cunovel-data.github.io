Alarmed by the taut vibrations in the air, the unseen presence circling them, Amelia huddled against Cam\u0027s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I do,\" Leo said. \"I should have died when she did. I never wanted to be left behind. You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like. The thought of finally ending this is a bloody relief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s not what she wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHostility flared in the light eyes. \"How the hell would you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If your situations were reversed, would you choose this for her?\" Cam gestured to the gun in his hand. \"I wouldn\u0027t ask that sacrifice of someone I love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no bloody idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" Cam said. \"I understand. And I\u0027m telling you to stop being selfish. You grieve too much, my phral. You\u0027ve forced her to come back to comfort you. You have to let her go. Not for your sake, but hers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\" But emotion had begun to spread across Leo\u0027s face like cracks in an eggshell. Blue light danced through the room, while a frigid wind lifted a few locks of Leo\"s hair like invisible fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her be at peace,\" Cam said, more quietly now. \"If you take your own life, you\u0027ll end up condemning her, as well as yourself, to an eternity of wandering. It\u0027s not fair to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo gave a wordless shake of his bent head, cradling his folded knees in a posture that reminded Amelia of the boy he\u0027d once been. And she understood his grief with a thoroughness that had been impossible for her before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if Cam were taken from her without warning? She could never again know the feel of his hair in her hands or the caress of his lips against hers. No consummation of all she had begun to feel, the promises, smiles, tears, hopes, all ripped from her grasp. Forever. How much she would miss. How much could never be replaced by anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAching with compassion, she watched as Cam moved to her brother. Leo hid his face and jerked a hand up, fingers spread, palm lacing out in a broken, helpless gesture. \u0027i can\u0027t let her go,\" he choked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lamp blew out, and a pane of glass shattered, while a freezing blast of air struck them. Energy crackled through the room, tiny snaps of light appearing around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do it for her,\" Cam said, putting his arms around her brother in the way he might have comforted a lost child. \u0027\u0027You can.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo began to cry harder, each breath a burst of angry despair. \"Oh, God,\" he groaned. \"Laura, don\u0027t leave me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as he wept, the atmosphere seemed to settle, glacier-cold and calm, and the blue light, like the afterglow of a distant dying star, began to fade. There was a quiet drone of wingsâ€”a few bees venturing from the hive, then flying back to settle for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam was murmuring something now, holding Leo in a firm protective grasp. He spoke in Romany, the words drifting into the thinning air. A promise, a compact, offered to a fading, formless spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil all that was left were three people sitting among shattered glass in the darkness, a discarded weapon on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s gone,\" Cam said softly. \"She\u0027s free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo nodded, his face hidden. He was damaged but still alive. Broken, but not beyond the hope of repair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd reconciled to life, at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they had taken Leo back to Stony Cross Manor and put him to bed, Amelia stood outside his room with Cam. Her emotions were brimming so high and strong, it took all her strength to contain them. \"I\u0027m going to tell Poppy that he\u0027s all right,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam nodded, silent and somewhat distracted. Their fingers tangled briefly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey parted company, and Amelia went to find her sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy was in bed, lying on her side, her eyes fully open. \"You found Leo,\" she murmured as Amelia came to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s fine. I think? Amelia sat on the edge of the mattress and smiled down at her. \"I think he\u0027ll be better from now on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like the old Leo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy yawned. \"Amelia ... will you be grumpy if I ask something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m too tired to be grumpy. Ask away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to marry Mr. Rohan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question filled Amelia with dizzying delight. \"Should I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. You\u0027ve been compromised, you know. Besides, he\u0027s a good influence on you. You\u0027re not nearly so much of a porcupine when he\u0027s around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delightful child,\" Amelia observed to the room in general, and grinned at her sister. \"I\u0027ll tell you in the morning, dear. Go to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked through the somber stillness of the hallway, feeling as nervous as a bride as she went to find Cam. It was time to be open, honest, trusting, as she had never been before, not even in their most intimate moments. Her heartbeat resounded everywhere, even in the tips of her ringers and toes. She went to Cam\u0027s room, where lamplight seeped through the fissure of the partially opened door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam was sitting on the bed, still clothed. His head was lowered, hands braced on his knees in the posture of a man who was deep in thought. He glanced up as she came into the room and closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...\" Amelia approached him hesitantly. \"I\u0027m afraid you won\u0027t let me have what I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis slow smile robbed her of breath. \"I have yet to refuse you anything. I\u0027m not likely to start now.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-94.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
