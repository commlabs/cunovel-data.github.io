In the two years I have resided here, I have not, until now, been so graciously and magnanimously entertained by anyone, Dutch or foreign, so your kindness to me and my wife is welcomed for its novelty as well as its benignancy. I am sincerely obliged to you for your courtesy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis being the case, I am deeply sorry that I cannot recommend anyone known to me as a potential suitor for the hand of your ward, lovely young woman though she is, and worthy as she must be of finding a suitable spouse, a man of rank and character who will maintain her consequence-and yours-in the polite world. Even so charming a girl as your ward is at a disadvantage in these difficult times, and I am all sympathy to you in your plight; her future happiness is in your hands, and the fate of your House. So many matters to consider, and you with your own work to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the wars and the many upheavals that have convulsed the Continent, it must be doubly difficult to launch a young woman of noble birth into a union that is acceptable not only to you, but to the family of the apposite men. My employers make it a policy only to employ married men, and therefore all my colleagues are constituted as I am. But I will keep your request in mind, and if any appropriate fellow should make himself known to me, I will at the first opportunity inform you of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving two daughters of my own, I understand how you are concerned with establishing your niece well in the world. With the loss of so many men in the Great Army in Napoleon\u0027s dreadful Russian Campaign, it is astonishing that there are not more unmarried women in the world. As it is, there are far too many widows. I have been considering sending my daughters to their aunt in London for their coming-out, for just the same reasons as you have discussed with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look forward to the publication of your book, and wish you every success with it. I cannot, myself, imagine what work it must be to undertake such an enterprise; I am in awe of your attainment, sir, and I cannot tell you what a privilege it is to know a man who has done as much as you have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish you a safe journey back to Austria. I am pleased to hear that the roads are supposed to be clear most of the way: I trust they will remain so. Let me reiterate again my thanks for your kind invitation to call at Ravensberg if ever I reach Austria. Rest assured that I will do so when I have the good fortune to visit that land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith cordial personal regards,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdgar St. Andrews\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell \u0026amp; Ochie, Importers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmsterdam\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/borne-in-blood-saint-germain-20/page-10.html","bookId":2503,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:05 PM"}
