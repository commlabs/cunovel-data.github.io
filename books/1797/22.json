Don\u0027t run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words echoed in her mind, part command and part plea. She thought she should be able to recognize that voice. It was rough, male, and full of power. And it only made her want to flee faster through the corridor. She had to get out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, without any warning, the curving walls and the sense of being pursued disintegrated. Verity was abruptly, violently aware of Jonas, who stood perfectly still beside her. He was no longer holding one of the pistols. He had returned it to the case. But he was looking at her with his strange golden eyes. There was a raw, unleashed hunger in that gaze. It was both undeniably sexual and much more, indefinable and dangerous and compelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room around Verity looked exactly as it had a moment ago. Nothing had changed, although she was dazed. Something felt terribly, horribly different. In a way she couldn\u0027t explain, she sensed that her world would never be quite the same again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The gun is genuine,\" Jonas said in a voice that sounded unnaturally calm. \"As Verity told you, my field is the Renaissance, but I know enough about old weapons to tell you that you\u0027ve got a very valuable set of pistols there. Take care of them, Emerson. They\u0027re worth a great deal of money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess my daughter was right,\" Emerson said cheerfully. \"Luck follows the virtuous. Now all I have to do is figure out how to turn these pistols into cash. Well, it\u0027s been a long day. What do you say we all hit the sack? I could use a night\u0027s sleep, and Verity here looks a little washed out. What\u0027s the matter, Red?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven\u0027t you been getting enough sleep lately?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She works too hard and she doesn\u0027t eat properly,\" Jonas said. His eyes never left her face. \"Come on, Verity, I\u0027ll walk you back to your cabin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to refuse. The panic attack, or whatever it was, seemed to have vanished with as little warning as that with which it had materialized, but a lingering uneasiness remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome part of her was almost certain that Jonas Quarrel was the source of her uneasiness. Yet, when he took her hand and led her outside into the night, Verity followed without protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ARE you all right?\" Jonas asked quietly. His fingers closed around Verity\u0027s hand as he guided her through the trees along the barely visible path that led to her cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Verity mumbled, taking deep breaths of the crisp night air. Jonas\u0027s grip felt strong and reassuring. He seemed to be communicating some of his quiet strength to her. Verity tried to drink it into herself without being too obvious about it. \"Why shouldn\u0027t I be all right?\" She concentrated on the familiar sights and sounds of the night around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was utterly normal here at Sequence Springs. The wind rustled in the trees. Scattered lights gleamed along the shoreline. The glow from her cabin window was warm and welcoming. Now and then the distant sound of an automobile engine rumbled briefly, then faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was normal. She was normal. She was just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father was right,\" Jonas said slowly. \"You looked a little washed out back there in the cabin. Sure you\u0027re okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, I\u0027m fine. Just a little tired, that\u0027s all. Having Dad show up out of the blue is always a bit disconcerting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt defensive. Damned if she was going to admit to this man that she had suffered a momentary hallucination tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy,\" Jonas said soothingly. He released her hand and put his arm around her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity found herself nestled closely against his side. The warm, heavy, oddly comforting weight of his arm around her sparked mixed emotions. On one hand, she was still aware of an inexplicable uneasiness. A part of her insisted on irrationally associating Jonas with the fear she had known a few minutes ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut another, equally primitive and very feminine part of her was convinced that the masculine power in Jonas offered safety from those same terrors. In desperation, she tried to make normal conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It figures my father\u0027s only here because he\u0027s in trouble. If it isn\u0027t one thing, it\u0027s another. Now he\u0027s got a loan shark after him. Are you sure about those dueling pistols?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure about them being genuine? Yes, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced up at him, curious and perplexed. \"How can you be certain without doing some sort of tests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas shrugged, the action somehow pulling her more tightly against him. \"I\u0027ve seen a lot of old guns. I know what old steel looks like. I know what old craftsmanship looks like. And I know what a dueling pistol feels like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What it feels like? What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring straight ahead at the light in her cabin. \"It\u0027s hard to explain. A good dueler feels right in the hand. The aim is true. Point it and it\u0027s aimed. You can sense it. In a real duel there\u0027s no time to line up the target in the gun\u0027s sights. All you can do is point the weapon in the general direction of the target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDueling pistols are usually fairly heavy, too. They\u0027re designed so that in the grip of a very nervous man the aim is less likely to be affected by a jerky trigger finger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity shivered. \"Makes sense. I can imagine how nervous I would be if I were standing on a so-called field of honor at dawn waiting for someone to give the signal to fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoonlight glinted briefly off Jonas\u0027s bleak smile. \"The feeling goes beyond nervous, believe me. It\u0027s similar to the sensation you get when you hold a rapier with an unblunted tip and face a man who\u0027s holding another one just like it. Talk about life on the edge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really were an expert on old weapons at one time, weren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Feel better now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, I feel just fine. Perfect. Peachy keen,\" she retorted, irritated by the concern in his voice, even as she longed to indulge herself in his unexpected solicitude. \"Why do you keep harping on how I feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped in the middle of the path and tugged her around to face him. His hands slid under the lapels of her coat. The moonlight and the night washed away the gold in his eyes, leaving colorless, gleaming gems that seemed to see past all her defenses into the depths of her soul. A faint echo of the panic she had experienced earlier shot through Verity. She caught her breath, half-preparing to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas\u0027s hands tightened on the lapels and he held her still. \"Relax,\" he ordered quietly. \"It\u0027s over for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s over?\" she whispered, searching his moonlit gaze for answers to questions she did not know how to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. Never mind.\" He groaned and pulled her closer. \"Verity, you\u0027re safe with me. I swear you\u0027re safe. Please don\u0027t run from me. I\u0027ll take care of you. I swear it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-22.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
