They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time, apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!\" whispered Tom, in short catches between breaths. \"I can\u0027t stand it much longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHuckleberry\u0027s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it. They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Huckleberry, what do you reckon\u0027ll come of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging\u0027ll come of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you though?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, I know it, Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom thought a while, then he said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027ll tell? We?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about? S\u0027pose something happened and Injun Joe didn\u0027t hang? Why, he\u0027d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure as we\u0027re a laying here.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he\u0027s fool enough. He\u0027s generally drunk enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom said nothing -- went on thinking. Presently he whispered:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Huck, Muff Potter don\u0027t know it. How can he tell?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the reason he don\u0027t know it?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he\u0027d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D\u0027you reckon he could see anything? D\u0027you reckon he knowed anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"By hokey, that\u0027s so, Tom!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And besides, look-a-here -- maybe that whack done for him!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No, \u0027taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and besides, he always has. Well, when pap\u0027s full, you might take and belt him over the head with a church and you couldn\u0027t phase him. He says so, his own self. So it\u0027s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAfter another reflective silence, Tom said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom, we got to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn\u0027t make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak \u0027bout this and they didn\u0027t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another -- that\u0027s what we got to do -- swear to keep mum.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m agreed. It\u0027s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear that we --\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no, that wouldn\u0027t do for this. That\u0027s good enough for little rubbishy common things -- specially with gals, cuz they go back on you anyway, and blab if they get in a huff -- but there orter be writing \u0027bout a big thing like this. And blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom\u0027s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful; the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it. He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moonlight, took a little fragment of \"red keel\" out of his pocket, got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop 　 down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHuckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom\u0027s facility in writing, and the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on! Don\u0027t do that. A pin\u0027s brass. It might have verdigrease on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s verdigrease?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s p\u0027ison. That\u0027s what it is. You just swaller some of it once -- you\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building, now, but they did not notice it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom,\" whispered Huckleberry, \"does this keep us from ever telling -- always?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it does. It don\u0027t make any difference what happens, we got to keep mum. We\u0027d drop down dead -- don\u0027t you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I reckon that\u0027s so.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside -- within ten feet of them. The boys clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Which of us does he mean?\" gasped Huckleberry.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I dono -- peep through the crack. Quick!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you, Tom!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t -- I can\u0027t do it, Huck!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Tom. There \u0027tis again!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, lordy, I\u0027m thankful!\" whispered Tom. \"I know his voice. It\u0027s Bull Harbison.\"*\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of him as \"Harbison\u0027s Bull,\" but a son or a dog of that name was \"Bull Harbison.\"]\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s good -- I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I\u0027d a bet anything it was a stray dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe dog howled again. The boys\u0027 hearts sank once more.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my! that ain\u0027t no Bull Harbison!\" whispered Huckleberry. \"do, Tom!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His whisper was hardly audible when he said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Huck, it\u0027s a stray dog!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Huck, he must mean us both -- we\u0027re right together.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Tom, I reckon we\u0027re goners. I reckon there ain\u0027t no mistake \u0027bout where I\u0027ll go to. I been so wicked.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller\u0027s told not to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I\u0027d a tried -- but no, I wouldn\u0027t, of course. But if ever I get off this time, I lay I\u0027ll just waller in Sunday-schools!\" And Tom began to snuffle a little.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You bad!\" and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. \"Consound it, Tom Sawyer, you\u0027re just old pie, \u0027longside o\u0027 what I am. Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom choked off and whispered:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Hucky, look! He\u0027s got his back to us!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHucky looked, with joy in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you know. Now who can he mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sh! What\u0027s that?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like -- like hogs grunting. No -- it\u0027s somebody snoring, Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That is it! Where \u0027bouts is it, Huck?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I bleeve it\u0027s down at \u0027tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep there, sometimes, \u0027long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts things when he snores. Besides, I reckon he ain\u0027t ever coming back to this town any more.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe spirit of adventure rose in the boys\u0027 souls once more.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hucky, do you das\u0027t to go if I lead?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like to, much. Tom, s\u0027pose it\u0027s Injun Joe!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down, the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter. The boys\u0027 hearts had stood still, and their hopes too, when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tiptoed out, through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet of where Potter was lying, and FACING Potter, with his nose pointing heavenward.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, geeminy, it\u0027s him!\" exclaimed both boys, in a breath.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Say, Tom -- they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller\u0027s house, \u0027bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there ain\u0027t anybody dead there yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I know that. And suppose there ain\u0027t. Didn\u0027t Gracie Miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but she ain\u0027t dead. And what\u0027s more, she\u0027s getting better, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, you wait and see. She\u0027s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff Potter\u0027s a goner. That\u0027s what the niggers say, and they know all about these kind of things, Huck.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for an hour.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not been called -- persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs, feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit\u0027s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAfter breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so; and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more. This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom\u0027s heart was sorer now than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sid; and so the latter\u0027s prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging, along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go. His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!\u003c/p\u003e     \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/51/3262.html","bookId":586,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:39:50 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:39:50 AM"}
