So when you set out, bring extra sleeping skins for us. Winter comes on quickly. I do not wish to sleep cold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your plans make no sense to me. I am weary of journeying, and you have no supplies. Let us go to my lodge now, and have a good rest and a hot meal. Then, when you are recovered a bit, you can quick-walk us to the Trading Place.” She ran her hand over her head and then glanced up at the overcast sky, obviously bothered by the light and impatient to be on her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered. I think he was tempted by the idea of a hot meal and a restful night in a warm place. But then he shook his head. It was a Gernian gesture, I suddenly realized. He was incorporating more of me into himself. I wondered fearfully if that meant I was losing myself to him. He spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I will not show myself to our kin-clan again until I can do so with pride. I am determined that when next Jodoli sees me, I will have put on flesh and appear as a prosperous man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And how will you do this?” Olikea demanded. “What will the others think of me, returning without you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not entirely sure. But it is not for you to worry about. If anyone asks about me, tell them that I sent you on ahead. For now, think only that you will be getting what you want, time at the trading fair. Go on, go now. Likari and I will find you there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There will be many questions for me when I arrive at my home village without either of you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just smile and promise them a surprise. Tell them the boy is safe with me. And then start off for the Trading Place. Four days hence, we will find you there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Four days?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said you might need to sleep. You will arrive before we do. Brag of the Great Man you have found. Trade with abandon, as if you have no need to strike the best bargain, as if you know you have untold wealth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brow had furrowed and her eyes shifted with uncertainty. She wanted to go to her home, she wanted to rest and then to journey to the Trading Place for the last days of trading. But curiosity was biting her like an insatiable flea. “What are you planning?” she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am planning to arrive at the Trading Place four days hence and impress everyone. Including you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But if I go and I brag of you and trade my goods recklessly, and you do not come, I shall look a fool!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But if you do, and I do arrive, then you shall be celebrated and honored as a woman of great foresight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was silent, staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know it’s a gamble, Olikea. Only you can decide if you will wager or not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment longer she stood, debating, and then she turned on her heel and walked away toward her village. We watched her go. Soldier’s Boy then glanced down, to find Likari looking up at him uncertainly. Olikea had departed without even a farewell to the boy, let alone a list of cautions for taking care of him. I thought of how wary Amzil had been about letting me take care of her youngsters for even a few minutes. Yet plainly Olikea regarded Likari as an independent entity, one capable of making his own decisions or objections to the decisions of others. I was not sure that I approved, but the system seemed to work for this boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Soldier’s Boy heard the echoes of my thoughts? He met Likari’s gaze. “Do you wish to go with me? Or to return to the village with your mother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew himself up. “I am your feeder. You have said I will go with you. So I shall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well.” Soldier’s Boy sent a final glance after Olikea. The sun shone on her skin. She was as unconcerned as a lioness as she strode down the trail toward the villages. As he watched, she entered the shelter of the trees and was lost to sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I intend to hunt. You will help me. And I intend to eat. A lot. Then when I have grown as fat as I can in four days, we shall quick-walk to the Trading Place. And there I shall trade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head at me. “What will you trade?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not entirely sure yet. What is considered valuable?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe furrowed his brow. His eyes were very serious as he pondered my question. “Tobacco. Tobacco is always good. And furs. Pretty things. Things that are good to eat. Knives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I should have asked your mother before she left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably. Why do you call Olikea my mother so much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well. It is what she is, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose. But it sounds odd to me.” He glanced about and said anxiously, “We should go beneath the trees. I start to burn.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/renegade-s-magic-the-soldier-son-trilogy-3/page-71.html","bookId":2015,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:26 PM"}
