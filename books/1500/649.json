The woman’s entire body trembled, instinctively gathering energy to resist Su’s perception, but she released a sigh, forcing her body to completely relax, exposing all of her mental and physical secrets before Su.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf one only looked at her from her exterior, she was completely a beautiful human female, her exposed body full of sex appeal and energy, her long and powerful legs making others lose themselves in their wild and fanciful thoughts. She preserved all human female characteristics, but the inside of her body, its composition and organization, was already entirely different. Not only was there the greatest extent of optimization on her human female characteristics, her internal organs were even completely different. From this composition, there were many similarities between her and Su.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was also the reason why Su had never loosened his right hand that gripped her neck. In Su’s eyes, this woman was an extremely dangerous combat creature, a ranked life form that possessed similar characteristics as himself, as well as a great enemy that he had to deal with using his full attention, the degree of danger even exceeding Pandora, only a bit lower than the apostle in Su’s order of priority.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s left hand stroked her chest.

Under Su’s perception, several hundred gene fragments appeared. After a brief analysis, Su already knew that these gene fragments were precisely the crucial pieces that completed the swamp beasts, military engineers, and dragonborn’s fragmented genome. What was even more important was that the woman’s body similarly lacked over a hundred crucial fragments, and they also existed in the depths of the nucleus! Moreover, as more and more genetic fragments surged, the species of biological weapons that appeared before Su increased more and more, many of which Su had never seen before. There were quite a few biological weapons who were stronger than the dragonborn.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was the ‘Key’ this woman was speaking about.

Su understood the woman’s intentions, this matter wasn’t as simple as it looked on the surface. These several hundred pieces of extremely precious gene fragments were like the treasure in in a treasure chest, currently only revealing a corner through a crack. All of the gene jigsaw puzzles were missing the most crucial part; that was the nucleus.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOnly when the nucleus was completely broken down would one be able to obtain the true ‘Key’.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLet him go, and she’d stay behind.

It didn’t always have the greatest combat strength, but it could adapt to almost any environment, as well as possess endless growth potential, on the premise that there was ample energy.

Cirvanas was close to a General, the nucleus in his body his life core, and also possessed low level intelligence. In certain situations, for example, when it threatened Su, the nucleus would seize control as the body’s highest level of authority.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMeanwhile, this woman before Su seemed to be a complete General, the degree of similarity reaching 99%. The nucleus was her everything, and the nucleus in her body possessed the highest level of intelligence on its own.
