Working under the notorious Fiona Stone is a nightmare, but there’s one distinct perk: ogling the ridiculously hot male models who parade through the office—particularly rising star Ben Shaw. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBen is everything Emmy’s not: exquisitely gorgeous, highly paid, and well-traveled. He’s also got more issues than Vogue. Emmy looks after Ben on photo shoots, but she refuses to become another one of his lusting groupies. Ben finds Emmy’s refreshingly real attitude to be surprisingly attractive. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAgainst a backdrop of the most fashionable cities in the world, casual flirting turns into an illicit affair, but when Ben’s twisted past is revealed, and the bitter Fiona catches wind of their relationship, their careers and hearts are threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/working-it-love-by-design-1.jpg","author":"Kendall Ryan","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/working-it-love-by-design-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:22 PM"}
